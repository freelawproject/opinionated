After a bench trial, the trial court agreed that three of Living Essentials' advertising campaigns violated the CPA. The trial court assessed a civil penalty against Living Essentials and awarded the State its attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Living Essentials argues on appeal that the trial court (1) erred by adopting the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) prior-substantiation doctrine, (2) that the prior-substantiation doctrine violates article I, section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, (3) that Living Essentials' claims were mere puffery which did not require substantiation, (4) the trial court applied the wrong standard for necessary substantiation, and (5) the trial court erred in concluding that Living Essentials' Ask Your Doctor claim was deceptive. Living Essentials also challenges the trial court's penalty and award of attorney fees. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Living Essentials produces and markets the energy drink 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. During its advertising campaign, Living Essentials made numerous claims about the efficacy of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. Three of those claims are relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 First, Living Essentials claimed that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae was \"Superior to Coffee\" (Superior to Coffee claim). Specifically, Living Essentials claimed that \"the key vitamins and nutrients [in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae] work synergistically with caffeine to make the biochemical or physiological effects last longer than caffeine alone.\" Second, Living Essentials claimed that the decaf variety of 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae provided energy, alertness, and focus \"for hours.\" (Decaf claim). Living Essentials provided the basic message, if you do not like caffeine then \"Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae... can provide the alertness you want without the 'caffeine feeling' you don't.\" Third, Living Essentials implied that 73 percent of doctors would recommend 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae (Ask Your Doctor claim). In an ad that ran on national television, a spokesperson said\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   We asked over 3,000 doctors to review 5-hour Energy\u00ae, and what they said is amazing. Over 73% who reviewed 5-hour Energy\u00ae said they would recommend a low calorie energy supplement to their healthy patients who use energy supplements.\n   <em>\n    73%\n   </em>\n   . 5-hour Energy has 4 calories and is used over nine million times a week. Is 5-hour Energy right for you? Ask your doctor. We already asked 3,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 After an 11-day bench trial involving testimony and transcripts of testimony from 20 lay and expert witnesses and the admission of approximately 500 exhibits, the trial court issued a 57-page decision including detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Following FTC guidance, the trial court concluded that Living Essentials Superior to Coffee, Decaf, and Ask Your Doctor claims were deceptive and violated the CPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 With respect to the Superior to Coffee claim the trial court found that the real takeaway was \"that the combination of caffeine, B vitamins and amino acids would\n   provide energy that would last longer than consumers would experience from a cup of premium coffee (and in some of the ads, longer than 3 or 4 cups of coffee).\" The court further found that \"[t]he studies [Living Essentials presented] do not\n   clearly establish that 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae's vitamins and nutrients work synergistically with caffeine to make these benefits last longer than they would last with caffeine alone.\" Living Essentials' claim that \"5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae works better than caffeine alone ... is certainly plausible, given the science presented to the Court, but it remains a hypothesis, not an established scientific fact.\" The court concluded that \"Living Essentials violated the [CPA] when it aired or published ads that represented that the energy, alertness and from 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae lasts longer than a cup of coffee because of the synergistic effects of caffeine, B vitamins and nutrients in the product.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The trial court also found that \"Living Essentials lacks competent and reliable scientific evidence to claim that decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae will generate energy and alertness that 'lasts for hours.' \" The trial court concluded that \"Living Essentials violated the [CPA] when it claimed in a press release and on its web site that Decaf 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae will provide energy, alertness and focus that lasts for hours.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The State filed a motion to strike or disregard portions of appellants' opening and reply briefs. Because the State prevailed in this appeal, it is unnecessary for us to consider the merits of this motion. The State's motion is denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    \u00b6 8 Finally, the trial court determined that the \"Ask-Your-Doctors\" claim was deceptive. The court found that the \"net impression\" from the ad was that \"a substantial majority of doctors believe 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae is a safe and effective nutritional supplement that doctors would recommend to their patients.\" The court noted that \"while the statistics displayed ... were\n    <em>\n     literally\n    </em>\n    true, the impression left by the ads was not.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 9 Based on the number of times the ads aired or the number of bottles of product sold, the trial court imposed a $ 2,183,747 civil penalty and awarded the State its attorney fees and costs.

In\n    <em>\n     Pacific Health\n    </em>\n    , the unlicensed defendants were actually skilled at performing the tests and diagnosis for which they had advertised. Therefore, to hold that they violated the CPA would have created a new per se unfair trade practice because the doctor's advertisements were not, in fact, deceptive.

But this is not what the trial court did. While the trial court explained the FTC's prior substantiation doctrine as part of its conclusions of law, the court specifically declined to rely only on prior substantiation:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    The State argues that any scientific evidence developed or relied upon after Living Essentials aired or published its ads is legally irrelevant because the FTC guidelines required pre-claim substantiation. While this Court acknowledges that both the FTC guidelines and federal case law indicate that pre-claim substantiation is required, the Court also concludes that subsequent scientific studies may shed light on pre-claim studies and are thus relevant and material to the Court's CPA analysis.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b6 28 More importantly, a review of the trial court's extensive findings of fact demonstrates that the court carefully\n    considered Living Essentials' preclaim substantiation as well as an extensive list of postclaim studies and expert trial testimony in making its findings. The trial court found-with respect to Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee claim-that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support Living Essentials' express claims that people who drink 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae will experience hours of energy, alertness, and focus because the vitamins and nutrients extend the effects of caffeine. As a result of the lack of scientific evidence, the trial court found the ads materially misleading and in violation of the CPA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 29 Similarly, after reviewing both pre and postclaim studies and expert trial testimony, the trial court found:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    While there is competent and reliable scientific evidence to support a claim that the Decaf 5-hour ENERGY\u00ae shot may provide a short-term benefit in terms of energy, the science is insufficient to substantiate the claim that this benefit will endure over a five hour period. For this reason, the Court finds the Decaf Claims to be materially misleading and a violation of the CPA.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \u00b6 30 Thus, while the trial court was appropriately guided by the FTC's prior substantiation doctrine, it did not adopt the doctrine as a per se violation of the CPA.

These are factual representations that are capable of being tested. \"Living Essentials\n    intentionally promoted the product's ingredients as changing the way the body functioned [and] [i]t promoted the product as a healthy way to achieve these physiological results.\" We agree with the trial court that Living Essentials' claims were factual representations and not mere puffery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b6 45 Living Essentials also contends that the FTC does not require substantiation where the product involved is \"frequently purchased, easily evaluated by consumers, and inexpensive.\" But this point disregards the underlying policy purposes of the FTC's position: \"[t]here is little incentive for sellers to misrepresent ... in these circumstances since they normally would seek to encourage repeat purchases.

The FTC requires that \"the substantiation must be relevant to the claimed benefits[,]\" and Living Essentials never advertised that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae lasted for\n    <em>\n     five\n    </em>\n    hours, but rather than it lasted for\n    <em>\n     hours\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \u00b6 52 However, because this court reviews CPA violations de novo, the trial court's reliance on an erroneous standard does not mandate a reversal; substantial evidence exists to support the trial court's conclusion that Living Essentials' ads violated the CPA.

Further, Living Essentials points to no evidence that directly supports its Superior to Coffee claim. \"Dr. Kennedy's summary of the scientific literature does show some different physiological results from caffeine plus vitamins or caffeine plus amino acids, but the results are not the benefits touted by Living Essentials.\" Specifically, the Giles Study shows that taurine counteracts caffeine, rather than enhancing its effects. Further, neither the Glade nor NERAC studies examined whether combining the specific ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae with caffeine will cause the energy, alertness, and focus effects of caffeine to last longer than caffeine alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    \u00b6 55 Living Essentials pointed to the 2013 Nagrecha study, the 2015 Molnar study, and the 2015 Paulus study as support for its Superior to Coffee claim. But, as the trial court found, none of those studies are sufficiently relevant to substantiate Living Essentials' claim. \"The Nagrecha study has limited relevance because its test subjects underwent only one round of testing 40 minutes after ingesting\" 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. The Paulus study had \"methodological problems... [that were] significant enough to render [its] results unreliable.\" The Molnar study was insufficient to substantiate Living Essentials' claims because there was\n    significant disagreement between the testifying experts as to the relevance of the Molnar Study and, as the trial court found, the Bloomer Study \"undercut the reasonability of relying on Molnar as substantiation for Living Essentials' claims.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    \u00b6 56 Finally, the Medicus study does not support 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae's Superior to Coffee claim. The trial court found Dr. Tom McLellan's testimony to be credible that there is no basis for concluding that the Medicus study's results \"were attributable to any ingredient other than caffeine.\" As the testifying experts pointed out, the Medicus study was designed in a flawed manner that overemphasized its results with respect to 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. The study was not designed \"to determine whether the non-caffeine ingredients in 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae led to improved performance[,]\" and the results \"do not show that consuming 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae improved any of the test subjects' cognitive functioning ... above baseline.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    \u00b6 57 We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that Living Essentials' Superior to Coffee claim is unsubstantiated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \u00b6 58 There is also no substantiation in the record to show that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae lasts \"for hours.\" In support of the Decaf claim, Dr. Sanford Bigelow testified that Living Essentials acted reasonably in relying on the 2010 Glad Report and the 2007 NERAC Report as substantiation. But the trial court found that Dr. Bigelow's testimony was not credible. The Glade report relied on studies that tested doses of 3000mg or more of taurine but Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae contains only 483mg of taurine; a differentiation that fatally undermines Dr. Michael Glade's conclusions because the FTC specifically cautions advertisers from relying on studies the conclusions of which are based on very different dosages.

But \"the chart\n    on which Dr. Kennedy relie[d] actually show[ed] that the... test results at the 3 hour mark were not statistically significant.\" Further, the 2013 Kurtz study also contradicts Living Essentials' claim because it found that \"consumers drinking Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae experienced no energy benefits from the ingredients in the drink.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \u00b6 60 While the trial court may have been incorrect in saying that Living Essentials had to show that Decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae lasted for 5-hours, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that Living Essentials' Decaf Claim was deceptive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    E.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    \u00b6 61 Living Essentials finally argues that the trial court erred in determining that its Ask Your Doctor claim was deceptive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    \u00b6 62 The trial court found that despite the words in the Ask Your Doctor ad being literally true, the net impression-that 73 percent of doctors had specifically recommended 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae as a healthy and safe dietary supplement-was deceptive. The court first reasoned that Living Essentials' specific goal in creating this ad, as its advertising manager admitted at trial, was to indicate that doctors would recommend 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae. Second, the surveys that Living Essentials used were specifically designed to elicit a yes response because saying no \"suggested that the responding doctor would instead recommend a high fat, high calorie, or high sodium energy supplement.\" And that \"Living Essentials presented the statistics in a way that would lead a reasonable viewer to believe that 73 [percent] of 3,000 doctors surveyed would recommend this product to their patients\" when it was actually 73 percent of 503 doctors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    \u00b6 63 Living Essentials contends that its expert testimony alone is sufficient to establish what message the reasonable consumer would take away from the ad and that there is\n    insufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination.

First, the court concluded that \"the most appropriate method of determining the total number of violations for the deceptive advertisements is to determine the number of times the deceptive advertisements were aired in Washington\" within the statute of limitations period. The Superior to Coffee claim was included in two different ads that ran in Washington 975 and\n    1,040 times, respectively. The Ask-Your-Doctor ad ran 19,716 times in Washington.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    \u00b6 70 As for the Decaf claim, the court concluded that Living Essentials had made deceptive claims in its press release, press kit, and on the bottle packaging, but had not expressly advertised those claims in Washington. The court determined that the press release, dated 2008, was outside of the limitation period. Similarly, the court found there was no credible evidence introduced to show that the press kit was ever distributed in Washington. However, the court did conclude that deceptively packaged bottles of decaf 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae were sold in Washington 2,482 times.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    \u00b6 71 Then, the court determined that a civil penalty of $ 100 per violation for the deceptive advertisements and $ 4.29 per decaf bottle sold was an appropriate penalty. In determining the proper amount of penalty to assess per violation, the trial court found the following factors significant: (1) Living Essentials generated a substantial amount of revenue in Washington; (2) 5-Hour ENERGY\u00ae posed a high risk to the public because it is consumed, so there is no way to reverse the impact such a product may have on an individual; and (3) Living Essentials spent more time trying to substantiate its claims after marketing its products in Washington than before. Accordingly, the court assessed a $ 1,971,600 penalty for the Ask-Your-Doctor claim, a $ 201,500 penalty for the Superior to Coffee claim, and a $ 10,647 penalty for the decaf packaging, equating to a total civil penalty of $ 2,183,747.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    \u00b6 72 RCW 19.86.140 provides that \"[e]very person [ (including corporations) ] who violated [the CPA] shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty of not more than two thousand dollars for each violation.\" Washington courts recognize two\n    basic tenets of trade law in effectuating the purpose of chapter 19.86 RCW. \"First, no one should be permitted to profit from unfair and deceptive conduct. ...

Living Essentials' argument fails for two reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    \u00b6 76 First, this court has already expressly rejected Living Essentials' argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mandatory Poster\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452500\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/199/506/#p512\">\n     199 Wash.

Second, the cases that Living Essentials cites actually stand for the opposite proposition. In\n    <em>\n     Ralph Williams II\n    </em>\n    , the court awarded civil penalties between $ 250 and $ 2000 per violation.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1113797\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/87/298/\">\n     87 Wash.2d at 316, n.11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20P.2d%20423\">\n     553 P.2d 423\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Here, the court assessed a penalty, on average, of just $ 90 per violation. The only reason that the total penalty here is significantly higher than in the cited cases is because Living Essentials violated the CPA more than 24,000 times. In essence, Living Essentials is suggesting that the penalty is unconstitutionally excessive because they violated the statute too many times. We decline to adopt this interpretation of the due process clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    \u00b6 77 We conclude that the trial court's assessment of $ 2,183,747 in civil penalties for Living Essentials' 24,213 individual violations of the CPA was not an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    IV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \u00b6 78 Living Essentials finally argues that the trial court abused its discretion in its award of attorney fees.

RCW 19.86.080(1) provides that \"the prevailing party [in a CPA action] may, in\n    the discretion of the court, recover the costs of said action including a reasonable attorney's fee.\" In interpreting the term \"prevailing party,\" the Washington Supreme Court has taken guidance from federal courts. \"[A] plaintiff becomes 'a prevailing party ...

The State brought suit because it believed that Living Essentials had violated the CPA, which the trial court ultimately agreed it had. That the State originally alleged more violations of the CPA than were ultimately found at trial does not change the fact that the State was successful in proving that Living Essentials had violated the CPA. As such, the State succeeded on a significant issue in this case: whether Living Essentials had violated the CPA. Therefore, the State was the prevailing party below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    \u00b6 83 Further, awarding the State its attorney fees and costs is consistent with the underlying purpose of the CPA. This award will help to encourage the Attorney General's active role in CPA enforcement actions, which in turn will help to protect the public from untrue and deceptive advertisements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    \u00b6 84 Lastly, the trial court did not err in calculating the amount of fees awardable in this case. The trial court awarded the State $ 1,886,866.71 in attorney fees and $ 209,125.92 in costs. The trial court found that the State had reasonably incurred such a substantial amount of attorney fees and costs based on the \"lengthy and complex nature of the litigation.\" Further, the court reduced the original amount of fees and costs that the State had requested in order to \"reflect time spent on unsuccessful motions or other duplicative time.\" Accordingly, the court found that there was \"no basis to reduce the request\" any further.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    \u00b6 85 While Living Essentials argues that the court should have further reduced the award because the State only prevailed on some of its claims, the trial court expressly stated that it had already taken that into account. In fact, the court reduced the fee award by more than\n    $ 40,000 \"to reflect time spent on unsuccessful motions or other duplicative time.\" The trial court's finding that there is no basis to reduce the award any further was not an abuse of its discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <em>\n     Fees on Appeal\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    \u00b6 86 Both parties have requested their fees on appeal, and RCW 19.86.080(1) allows this court to award fees to the prevailing party. Because the State is the prevailing party on appeal it is entitled to its reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal subject to compliance with RAP 18.1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    \u00b6 87 We affirm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    WE CONCUR:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Chun, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Verellen, J.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-125\">\n     Living Essentials does not assign error to numerous findings of fact.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Unchallenged findings 1-9, 1, 13-14(d)(6), 15-16(a)-(c)(1), 16(d(10-(4), and portions of 10, 16(c)(2), 16(d)(5)-(6), 17, 19, 20, 22.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-126\">\n     Living Essentials assigns error to several findings but fails to provide argument in support of the assignment.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Findings 14(d)(7), 16(c)(2), 19(i), 20(d), 22(a), 22(a)(2)-(3).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-127\">\n     Living Essentials assigns error to several of the trial court's credibility determinations and weighing of evidence.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Findings 16, 16(c)(2), 16(d)(5)-(6), 17(c), 19, 20, 22.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-128\">\n     Here, because the State was proceeding only under the reasonable basis theory, the trial court did not analyze Living Essentials' claims under the falsity theory.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-129\">\n     Living Essentials also argues that the trial court violated the First Amendment by shifting the burden of proof and not requiring the government to prove Living Essentials' ads were misleading.
