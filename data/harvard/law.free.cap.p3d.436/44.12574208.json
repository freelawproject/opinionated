Defendant was arrested following an altercation with a family member. During an inventory search of defendant's purse, officers found methamphetamine and a methamphetamine\n   pipe. Defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, defendant testified that, at the time of the search, she did not know that the substance in her purse was methamphetamine. She testified that she believed the substance was \"crackle or shatter or some type of THC product\" left in her purse by friends. Deputy Iverson, one of the arresting officers, testified that he formed the belief at the scene that defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time. He based that belief on defendant's behavior-she was agitated and hostile, had rapid arm movements, was sweating, and her speech was animated-which, according to his training and experience as a drug recognition expert, was consistent with methamphetamine intoxication. Deputy Zaugg, another arresting officer, testified that after the substance tested positive for methamphetamine at the scene, defendant did not appear to be surprised when Zaugg informed her that she was being charged with possession of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that she lacked the requisite mental state under ORS 475.894(1) (making it \"unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess methamphetamine\") because she did not know that the substance in her purse was methamphetamine. After her MJOA was denied, defendant objected to the state's proposed jury instructions on the same substantive ground. The trial court overruled her objection and issued the following jury instruction:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Defendant was also convicted of resisting arrest, ORS 162.315. Defendant does not assign error to that part of the judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    ORS 475.894 was amended in 2017,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Or. Laws 2017, ch. 706, \u00a7 15. Because the amendment does not affect our analysis, we refer to the current version in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    \"In this case the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of both the presence and the narcotic or illicit nature of the substance. The State does not need to prove that the defendant knew the specific identity of the substance.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    The jury found defendant guilty of possession of methamphetamine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    On appeal, defendant reprises the argument she made below. As we understand it, defendant neither disputes that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that she knowingly possessed a controlled substance nor does she dispute that that substance was, in fact, methamphetamine. Her narrow argument is that, to convict a person of the specific offense of possession of \"methamphetamine\" under ORS 475.894, the state must prove that the person knew that the substance in his or her possession was methamphetamine specifically, as opposed to a controlled substance generally. That is, defendant argues that the identity of the substance\n    as \"methamphetamine\" is a material element of the offense to which the required mental state of \"knowingly or intentionally\" applies. The state disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Defendant's argument relies on ORS 161.095(2), which provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Except as provided in ORS 161.105\n    </em>\n    , a person is not guilty of an offense unless the person acts with a culpable mental state with respect to\n    <em>\n     each\n    </em>\n    material element of the offense that necessarily requires a culpable mental state.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    (Emphases added.)

LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr.,\n    <em>\n     Criminal Law\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 27, 193 (1972)). That is, it is unclear at first blush whether, to be convicted, a defendant need only knowingly or intentionally possess a substance that turns out to be methamphetamine or whether the defendant must also know (or intend) that the substance is methamphetamine.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    We resolved that ambiguity in\n    <em>\n     Schodrow.\n    </em>\n    In that case, ORS 166.250(1) provided that it was unlawful for a person to \"knowingly carr[y] any firearm concealed upon the person.\"\n    <em>\n     Schodrow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102837\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/187/224/#p229\">\n     187 Or.

The question on appeal was whether the \"defendant need only knowingly carry an object that turns out to be a firearm or whether the defendant must also know that the object\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    a firearm.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102837\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/187/224/#p229\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102837\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/187/224/#p229\">\n     at 228\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102837\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/187/224/#p229\">\n     66 P.3d 547\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original). We relied on the statutory definition of \"knowingly\" to resolve the ambiguity. ORS 161.085(8) provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \" 'Knowingly' or 'with knowledge,' when used with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person acts\n    <em>\n     with an awareness that the conduct of the person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists\n    </em>\n    .\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    (Emphasis added). We concluded that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    \"By force of that definition, to knowingly 'carry a firearm' requires more than the person's awareness that he or she is engaged in the conduct of carrying an object of some or any kind. Instead, either because carrying 'a firearm' is an aspect of\n    the nature of the conduct or a circumstance described by the statute, a person must also be aware that the object he or she is carrying is a firearm. That awareness requires, in turn, knowledge that the weapon has the characteristics of a firearm-namely, as relevant to defendant's challenge, that it is readily capable of use as a weapon.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ORS 166.210(2).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    \"To conclude otherwise would render the prescribed culpable mental state a nullity and would effectively convert the crime into a strict liability offense. Under ORS 161.095(1), the 'minimal requirement for criminal liability' is performance by a person of conduct that includes a 'voluntary act' or failure to act. A 'voluntary act' means 'a bodily movement performed consciously and includes the conscious possession or control of property.' ORS 161.085(2). Thus, even if the legislature were to have dispensed with a culpable mental state for the crime of unlawful possession of a firearm-which it expressly did not-the state would be required to prove that the defendant was carrying property consciously, even if he or she was unaware of the nature of that property being carried (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that it was a firearm). Necessarily, then, for the prescribed mental state of \"knowingly\" to add anything to the crime's definition, it must modify more than the conduct of carrying an object or property and must extend as well to the nature of the object or property carried.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     Schodrow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9102837\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/187/224/#p229\">\n     187 Or.
