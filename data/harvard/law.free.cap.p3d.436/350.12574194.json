He argues that his constitutional right to the effective assistance of\n   counsel was violated because his trial counsel failed to request an instruction regarding a lesser included offense of assault. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 One evening, Ricks and his girlfriend (Girlfriend) began arguing in the bathroom of the home they shared with Ricks's mother. The couple disagreed about whether Girlfriend had been using drugs, and Ricks was looking around the bathroom for drugs and a needle he suspected Girlfriend was using. To prove to Ricks that she was not hiding anything, Girlfriend disrobed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 As Girlfriend sat naked on the bathtub ledge, Ricks took a pair of metal tweezers and \"tried to rip [her] nipple off.\" Ricks \"picked forcefully\" at Girlfriend's nipple, lacerating it and causing Girlfriend pain. Both Ricks and Girlfriend later told an officer that Girlfriend had bit him on the nipple a few months earlier, causing it to bleed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Ricks left the room after the tweezing incident, while Girlfriend dressed. Once dressed, Girlfriend joined Ricks in another room and the two started arguing with each other again. During the argument, Ricks hit her in the head and face five or six times and in the thigh once. Ricks's mother heard Girlfriend screaming, and when she entered the room she saw Ricks hitting Girlfriend in the face. Girlfriend told Ricks's mother to call the police, so Ricks's mother grabbed her keys and cell phone and ran out of the home. After his mother left, Ricks threw a large plastic mug at Girlfriend's face, splitting her cheek open. Ricks then ran after his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Ricks caught up with his mother in the front yard, grabbed her arm, and tried to take away her phone. A neighbor saw Ricks and his mother fall to the ground and ran over to help. By the time the neighbor got there, Ricks had already picked his mother up from the ground. The neighbor tried in vain to \"pry [Ricks's] arms from [his mother].\" Ricks finally got the cell phone away from his mother and let go of her. Realizing that another neighbor had already called the police, Ricks said, \"Thanks, Mom,\" and threw his mother's cell phone onto the ground, breaking it into two pieces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The State charged Ricks with one count of forcible sexual abuse, two counts of assault, one count of criminal mischief, and one count of damage or interruption of a communication device. The forcible sexual abuse count and the first assault count related to Ricks's interactions with Girlfriend, and the remaining counts related to the incident with his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 During trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ricks contested only the forcible sexual abuse charge. During his opening statement, Ricks's trial counsel stated, \"Did he assault her? Yes, he did.\" \"But,\" counsel argued, \"this is not ... forcible sexual abuse.\" And during closing argument, trial counsel stated, \"Is that an assault? Good grief, yes, and there is a charge of assault, domestic violence in here.\" Trial counsel requested and received a jury instruction on sexual battery as a lesser included offense of forcible sexual abuse. However, trial counsel did not request an instruction on assault as a lesser included offense of forcible sexual abuse. The jury convicted Ricks as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Ricks asked trial counsel about filing an appeal, and trial counsel stated that he would visit Ricks to discuss the issue. Trial counsel never visited Ricks, however, and the time to appeal passed. Ricks later moved to reinstate the time to file an appeal, and the trial court ultimately granted his motion. Ricks timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Ricks contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a lesser-included-offense instruction for assault on the forcible sexual abuse count. \"An ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised for the first time on appeal presents a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But on cross-examination, she stated that she elbowed Ricks because he had \"just tried to rip [her] nipple off with [the] tweezers\" and that she was \"pretty upset by that.\" Girlfriend also recalled telling police that Ricks had \"picked forcefully\" at her nipple. A picture shown at trial demonstrated that Ricks squeezed Girlfriend's nipple with the metal tweezers hard enough to lacerate it. These actions indicate that Ricks intended to cause Girlfriend substantial bodily pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Looking at the surrounding circumstances, the evidence also demonstrates that within minutes of picking forcefully at and lacerating Girlfriend's nipple, Ricks hit her in the face, head, and thigh. He also threw a large plastic mug at Girlfriend hard enough to split her cheek. A neighbor testified that \"it was all bloody\" under Girlfriend's eye. The jury viewed pictures of Girlfriend's face, but one of the responding officers testified that the pictures did not fully show the extent of the swelling. The officer testified: \"[H]er face was puffy and swollen and it was very bruised on her forehead, on her nose and the left side of her face was bloody.\" We agree with the State that \"Ricks's overall aggression toward [Girlfriend] ... strongly suggest[s] that he intended to cause substantial bodily pain when he pinched and lacerated [Girlfriend's] nipple with metal tweezers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 But even if the jury had concluded that Ricks did not intend to cause Girlfriend substantial bodily pain and acquitted him of forcible sexual abuse, there is still no reasonable probability that the jury would have convicted him of assault. Ricks requested and received a lesser-included-offense instruction on sexual battery, a class A misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-9-702.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (LexisNexis 2012). Thus, even if the jury had been given a lesser included offense instruction on class B misdemeanor assault, to convict Ricks of assault the jury would have been required to first acquit Ricks of both forcible sexual abuse and sexual battery. Pursuant to Utah Code section 76-9-702.1, \"[a] person is guilty of sexual battery if the person ... intentionally touches, whether or not through clothing, ... the breast of a female person, and the actor's conduct is under circumstances the actor knows or should know will likely cause affront or alarm to the person touched.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-9-702.1(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 Here, the evidence demonstrates that Ricks intentionally touched Girlfriend's breast when he squeezed and lacerated her nipple with a pair of metal tweezers.
