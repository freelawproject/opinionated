But it says \"and in addition to.\" So my position on that is that unless the Court imposes a sentence of between one and five days under 291E-61(a)(1),\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   then the mandatory should not come into play because ... the Legislature uses the term \"and\" or conjunctive. So in other words, there would have to be in - a position [sic] of sentence under (a) - or 291E-61(a) as a first-time offender for jail, and Ms. Otani has never gotten into any trouble in her past. I mean ... she is a first-time ... offender. ... It was an aberration. So we would ask the Court to not impose the mandatory jail because she's not the type of person that would have had an imposition of jail under -- as a first offender under ... 291E-61(a)(1)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... [W]e would ask that no jail be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [THE STATE]: So, Your Honor, ... I do not interpret the enhanced sentencing to be read that way. I believe that the Court has discretion to impose either the 72 hours of community service, the jail, or a fine, as notated by the \"or\" in 291E-61(b)(1) through (3). But with regard to (b)(4), it reads \"in addition to a sentence imposed under paragraphs (1) through (3).[\"] So Your Honor has the discretion to impose a sentence under subsections (1) through (3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   And in addition to whatever sentence the Court imposes, the defendant who's convicted of having a person ... 15 years and under shall be sentenced to an additional mandatory fine of $500 and an additional mandatory term of imprisonment of 48 hours, just provided that the total term of imprisonment does not exceed a maximum term provided in paragraphs (1), (2), or (3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ... [A]nd I don't think that the Court has discretion with regard to subsection 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. [Defense counsel], I beg to disagree with your interpretation. I mean, if I were to follow your interpretation, given the circumstances, I would consider - under subsections paragraphs (1) through (3), give your client ... one or more of the following: either the fine of $1,000, 72 hours' community service, 48 hours' jail up to five days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   That is part of the regular statute; is that correct, [Defense counsel]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: So, you know, I could give her 48 hours under that provision and then impose the additional [48] hours for the enhanced sentencing for a child under the ... age of 15. So that would still make it under the ... five-day limit. But I'm not sure you want to argue that if you're saying I have to give her jail time in order to also impose a 48-hour mandatory jail time.... [I]f I'm not mistaken, that's what you're arguing. I have to give her jail time, otherwise I cannot impose the mandatory 48 hours' jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, that's why I was letting the Court know that this individual would ... not be someone that really is appropriate for jail, given her history, ... her background, given that this is a huge aberration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: ... [U]nfortunately, the Court having found her guilty as charged, I have no discretion, as I read the statute. It's the Legislature ... that has deemed it mandatory sentence....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Footnote added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The District Court entered the Judgment and Otani's sentence included forty-eight\n   hours of imprisonment, a fine, assessment of various fees, and referral to substance abuse assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Contrary to Otani's argument, we do not interpret the \"[i]n addition to\" wording as indicating a legislative intent to limit the imposition of the prison sentence under subsection (b)(4) to situations in which the trial court has also sentenced the defendant to imprisonment under subsections (1), (2), or (3).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, when we consider the legislative history for HRS \u00a7 291E-61(b)(4), it is apparent that the Legislature intended the forty-eight hours of imprisonment in this subsection to be mandatory and in addition to any sentence imposed in subsections (1), (2), or (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The subject provision was first adopted in 1999, when the Legislature enacted Act 78, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , amended HRS \u00a7 291-4 (the predecessor statute to HRS \u00a7 291E-61 ). 1999 Haw.

Many of these collisions have involved a driver who consumed intoxicating liquor and then operated a motor vehicle.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The June 13, 2017 \"Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment\" entered by the District Court of the First Circuit, 'Ewa Division, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Honorable Randal I. Shintani presided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2017) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    \u00a7 291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person's normal mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against casualty[.]\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    It appears defense counsel's reference to HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1) was incorrect, as that provision does not address sentencing. Further, the applicable provision, HRS \u00a7 291E-61(b)(1)(C)(ii), does not provide for imprisonment of between one and five days, but rather allows sentencing to include \"[n]ot less than forty-eight hours and not more than five days of imprisonment[.]\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    HRS \u00a7 291E-61(b)(1) applies because Otani is a first-time offender. The provision in subsection (b)(1) providing for imprisonment is subsection (b)(1)(C)(ii).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    There were amendments to the enhanced sentencing provision that are not material to this opinion and thus are not discussed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The \"[i]n addition to\" language was originally adopted by the Legislature in the 2008 Hawai'i Session Laws, to go into effect on July 1, 2010. 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 171, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 20, at 618-20, 628. However, after further revisions by the Legislature in 2009, the \"[i]n addition to\" language was made effective as of January 1, 2011. 2009 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 88, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 17, at 216-18, 222.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
