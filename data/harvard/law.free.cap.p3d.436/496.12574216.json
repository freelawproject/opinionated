After the superior court affirmed his convictions, Lay petitioned for special action relief, arguing the State had not offered evidence to prove the justice court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the charges. We accept jurisdiction of his petition but deny relief. We agree with Lay that Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 22-301 (2019) establishes the subject-matter jurisdiction of an Arizona justice court but conclude the evidence at his trial was sufficient to satisfy that statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Lay was charged with harassment under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2921(A)(1) (2019) and threatening or intimidating under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1202(A)(1) (2019). The harassment charge was based on text messages Lay sent a woman with whom he had been in a relationship; the threatening or intimidating charge was based on evidence that Lay threatened to kill the woman's current significant other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 At the close of the State's case, Lay moved for judgment of acquittal under Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 20, arguing the State had failed to offer evidence that he committed the crimes within the precinct as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 22-301. The justice court denied the motion. It then convicted Lay and sentenced him to 60 days in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Lay appealed to the superior court, which affirmed his convictions. After the superior court denied Lay's motion to reconsider, he filed this petition for special action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 We exercise our discretion to accept jurisdiction of this special action under Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-120.21(A)(4) (2019) and Arizona Rule of Procedure for Special Actions 1(a).

The Attorney General argues that subpart (C) of the statute, defining when \"an offense is committed within the precinct of a justice court,\" does not concern subject-matter jurisdiction but instead establishes the \"territorial jurisdiction\" of a justice court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b614 The Attorney General argues \u00a7 22-301 does two distinct things: (1) It establishes what offenses fall within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the justice court, and (2) separately, it establishes in which precincts those offenses may be tried. But the statute is not written that way. Subpart (A), which the Attorney General concedes defines the court's subject-matter jurisdiction, states that \"justice courts shall have jurisdiction of the following offenses\n   <em>\n    committed within their respective precincts\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). Subpart (C), which states what it means to be \"committed within the precinct,\" therefore is not distinct from subpart (A)'s grant of subject-matter jurisdiction but instead is a critical component of that grant. Read together, as relevant here, the statute provides that a justice court has jurisdiction over misdemeanors and felony preliminary proceedings only when the \"offense[ ] [is] committed within [its] respective precinct[ ],\" meaning when \"conduct constituting any element of the offense or a result of such conduct occurs ... [w]ithin the precinct.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 22-301(A), (C)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b615 The Attorney General relies on\n   <em>\n    Womack v.

We do not draw that conclusion from the court's scant discussion of waiver in that case. The Attorney General's argument fails to acknowledge that a felony prosecution need not begin in justice court but may be undertaken by the filing of a complaint directly in superior court, where a defendant may enforce his right to a preliminary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 2.2(b) (complaint may be filed in superior court); 2.4, 3.1(a)(3). There is no suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Womack\n   </em>\n   that the superior court in which the information was filed (and which accepted the defendant's guilty plea) lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b617 Finally, the Attorney General argues that \u00a7 22-301 does not limit the subject-matter jurisdiction of the justice court because A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 22-302 (2019) and -303 (2019) allow transfer of criminal offenses from one justice court precinct to another for trial. It is true that, under certain circumstances, \u00a7 22-302 allows a case to be commenced in another precinct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If the justice of the peace of the precinct in which the crime is alleged to have been committed is absent therefrom, or for any reason is unable to act, the prosecution may be commenced in any precinct within the county designated by the justice of the peace or in the absence of the justice of the peace in any precinct designated by the presiding judge of the superior court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 22-302.

The State offered evidence Lay not only knew where the female victim was living, but that the purpose of his texts was, at least in part, to coerce her to move out of the home she shared with her partner and return to Lay.

The crime of threatening or intimidating does not require proof of the mental state of the intended victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ryan A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946384\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/19/#p23\">\n    202 Ariz. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"946384\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/202/19/#p23\">\n    39 P.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (App. 2002). Nevertheless, a threat made in violation of \u00a7 13-1202 naturally may cause the victim fear or apprehension of physical harm or damage to property to be inflicted at some future time. The male victim heard Lay's threat, took it seriously, and immediately drove home at the direction of law enforcement. The justice court reasonably could have inferred his apprehension did not disappear before he reached home, where he met with police to describe the alarming incident in greater detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b630 Lay and\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice argue the court's subject-matter jurisdiction over the two offenses should not extend to any precinct into which a victim might travel while he or she feels annoyed or alarmed by a harassing text or a threatening call. Notwithstanding their contention that a victim cannot create jurisdiction by moving from one precinct to another, here, the two victims' retreat to their home was an entirely logical and expected result of Lay's crimes. Given that the victims naturally returned to their home in Precinct One after receiving the texts and hearing the threat, we need not determine the outer boundaries of a justice court's jurisdiction under \u00a7 22-301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b631 Accordingly, we conclude Lay's criminal offenses caused intended results and \"substantial effects\" within the justice court's precinct. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Yegan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   , where the defendants committed crimes intending to cause effects in Arizona, Lay's criminal acts were designed to cause fear, anxiety and other emotional upset in the victims.
