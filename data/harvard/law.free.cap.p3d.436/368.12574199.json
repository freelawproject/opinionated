She contends that its rules and policies, including its practice of retaining records of \"founded\" filings of child neglect by individuals have a disparate impact on the ability of Native Americans like herself to obtain work. We hold that under the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, an employee or applicant for employment can state a cause of action against a third party who interferes with the individual's right to obtain and hold employment without discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 A difficulty with the parties' remaining arguments below and on appeal is that the record is not well developed\n   with evidence of the policies of DSHS that are challenged, nor has DSHS presented evidence of high-level policy considerations that might afford it discretionary immunity. The fact that some of the rule- and policy-making authority of DSHS on which Ms. Howell appears to rely was delegated to the Department of Children, Youth, and Families in agency reorganizations effective after her complaint was filed exacerbates the lack of clarity. Ms. Howell may need to amend her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b63 On the present record, DSHS's arguments for dismissal fail. We reverse the trial court's order that dismissed Ms. Howell's complaint with prejudice and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 After Brooke Howell sued DSHS for alleged discrimination in violation of the WLAD, it filed a CR 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court granted. Our review requires us to assume\n   the truth of facts alleged in Ms. Howell's complaint as well as hypothetical facts. We summarize the allegations of her complaint and her argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    DSHS's complained-of conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Ms. Howell bases DSHS's asserted liability on the manner in which it has exercised its discretion to impose background check requirements, and retain and make available findings from adjudicative hearings that can disqualify persons like her from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 She makes the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 Under RCW 43.43.832 et seq., many Washington employers are required to obtain a background check when hiring or retaining an individual in a position potentially involving unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 Pursuant to authority delegated in chapter 26.44 RCW, it is DSHS that investigates and makes administrative\n   findings against persons alleged to have committed child abuse or neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 DSHS is required by statute to \"keep records concerning founded reports of child abuse or neglect as the department determines by rule.\" RCW 26.44.031(3). If a finding becomes final either after an administrative hearing or by default (because an accused person fails to appeal a notice of the finding), the accused's name is placed in a database of persons with administrative findings of abuse, neglect or other employment-disqualifying conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 By rule, DSHS keeps \"founded\" findings of abuse or neglect as required by DSHS records retention policies. WAC 388-15-077.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under DSHS's records retention policies, a final finding of abuse or neglect is nearly permanent and may not be expunged or removed from the Child Protective Services' database for at least 35 years from the date of the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b611 A founded finding of child abuse or neglect is an automatic disqualification for certain types of health care employment, including types of health care employment that one might obtain with a nursing assistant degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b612 The administrative hearing process granted under RCW 26.44.125 to a person who asks for review of a finding of child neglect by DSHS does not consider how the person's actions are related to her suitability for affected employment. The appeal does not consider how long the disqualification is appropriate, mitigating factors justifying removing the finding, or whether the severity of the accusation or alleged conduct warrants a permanent sanction on the many foreclosed employment opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b613 For persons with criminal convictions, some, but not others, may demonstrate their character, competence, and suitability to work with minors or vulnerable adults. Persons with founded findings of abuse and neglect are never allowed to demonstrate their character, competence and suitability, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b614 Ms. Howell alleges that DSHS has options to expunge records without jeopardizing its policy goal of protecting vulnerable people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Application to Ms. Howell\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 Ms. Howell identifies her race as Native American and is an enrolled member of the Yakama Indian Nation. In 2015, she entered a Nursing Assistant Certified (NAC) training program, desiring to become certified and work in the health care field. In the middle of her school year and before beginning clinical rotations, she learned that DSHS had made a \"founded\" finding of child neglect against her several years earlier. Clearing a background check with DSHS is a mandatory part of completing the NAC program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Howell was not allowed to complete the NAC program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 The finding against Ms. Howell followed her arrest in November 2012 for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Ms. Howell's three children were in the car with her. She was charged with DUI and reckless endangerment and addressed the charges by entering a diversion program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Unknown to Ms. Howell at the time, DSHS made an administrative finding of child neglect against her for the incident leading to her arrest for DUI. It sent notice by certified mail to Ms. Howell but the notice went unclaimed and was returned to DSHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Upon learning of the finding and that it would prevent her from completing NAC training and becoming licensed, Ms. Howell appealed the founded finding in June 2015. An administrative law judge reversed the finding, but DSHS's Board of Appeals reinstated the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 In January 2017, Ms. Howell asked DSHS to expunge her founded finding because of the effect of the finding on her ability to work. She asserts that she has complied with all of the conditions of her diversion, no longer drinks alcohol, and has no record of a criminal conviction as a result of the 2012 incident. DSHS did not respond to her request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Disparate impact claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 Ms. Howell's complaint alleges on information and belief that Native Americans are approximately four times more likely than white persons to have founded findings of child abuse or neglect discovered through background checks of DSHS records. She alleges that DSHS's policy of retaining the founded findings for so long, without review or an opportunity for expungement, disparately impacts the ability of Native Americans to obtain work, education, training, and licensure in a field of their choosing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b621 Ms. Howell alleges that DSHS has no legitimate reason for indefinitely maintaining and reporting the findings. She alleges that even if DSHS has a legitimate reason for indefinitely maintaining its findings, a less discriminatory alternative to its current practice exists: DSHS \"could ... permit accused persons to expunge their findings after demonstrating their rehabilitation; reduce the period of retention of the record on a background check when there is no evidence of future harm to children; or periodically review all records to determine ongoing need to retain any given record in its background check database.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The motion to dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 After answering and amending its answer to the complaint, DSHS moved under CR 12(c) for an order dismissing the complaint. It argued, first, that its conduct is not subject to the WLAD for two reasons: because it is not the employer, and the WLAD imposes liability for employment\n   discrimination only on a plaintiff-employee's employer; and because the prohibition on Ms. Howell's being employed as an NAC is the direct result of an initiative of the people that bars the employment as long-term care workers of individuals with \"founded\" findings. Alternatively, it argued that its actions are entitled to discretionary immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b623 Ms. Howell did not allege in her complaint that DSHS was an employer. She responded to DSHS's motion to dismiss by arguing that her complaint's allegations that DSHS's practices \"exert[ ] direct control over the list of prospective candidates available to ... employers\" and \"foreclosed [her] chosen career path,\" \"raise a factual issue significant enough that it should not be dismissed at this early stage.\" CP at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 In responding to the motion, Ms. Howell conceded that the November 2011 Initiative Measure No. 1163, codified at RCW 74.39A.056, raises a statutory bar to employment as a \"long-term care worker\" for individuals found to have committed child neglect. But she argued that she is not challenging that law; she is challenging DSHS's dissemination of its findings without a method to avoid racial disparity. Alternatively, she argues that other types of employment would remain available to NACs but for DSHS's practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 The trial court granted DSHS's motion and dismissed the complaint. Ms. Howell appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I. MS. HOWELL'S COMPLAINT PLEADS A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF DISPARATE IMPACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b626 Ms. Howell first argues that her complaint pleads a prima facie case of disparate impact; hence, the trial court erred in dismissing it. \"[T]he WLAD creates a cause of action for disparate impact.\"\n   <em>\n    Kumar v.

But the commission's rule provides that an independent contractor is protected by the general right declared by RCW 49.60.030, a protection that does not use the words \"employer\" or \"employee,\" and that the commission states is \"enforceable by private lawsuit in court under RCW 49.60.030(2) but not by actions of the [commission].\" Former WAC 162.16.230(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635 In\n   <em>\n    Marquis\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court agreed that the plain language of RCW 49.60.030(1) supports the commission's conclusion that it creates a general civil right that can be privately enforced, describing it as \"broadly stated, ... to be liberally construed, and ... meant to prevent and eliminate discrimination in the State of Washington.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72830\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/130/97/#p112\">\n    130 Wash.2d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20P.2d%2043\">\n    922 P.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The statutory definition imposes employee-numerosity and commerce-connection requirements and exempts certain employers from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b638 Federal courts have required that to state a cause of action, a plaintiff must be\n   <em>\n    someone's\n   </em>\n   employee or applicant.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salamon v.

For the\n   most part, they have not required that the defendant be the plaintiff's direct employer. Many federal courts have recognized claims where a covered employer interferes with the employment opportunities\n   of someone else's employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EEOC's compliance manual also continues to support an interference theory. It characterizes itself as following Supreme Court decisions requiring a common law agency analysis in determining employment status, stating that a Title VII plaintiff must establish both that she or he is someone's common law employee, and that the defendant is a covered common law employer of other employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EEOC COMPLIANCE MANUAL \u00a7 2-III(B)(3)(a)(i)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and EEOC Enforcement Guidance No. 915 (eff.

DSHS HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT PROVISIONS OF INITIATIVE 1163, CODIFIED AT RCW 74.39A.056, ARE FATAL TO MS. HOWELL'S CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 In November 2011, Washington voters approved Initiative 1163, the \"Restoring Quality Home Care Initiative.\" LAWS OF 2012, ch. 1, \u00a7 308. The intent of the initiative was to reinstate a requirement that long-term care workers obtain criminal background checks, which the state legislature had proposed to eliminate. LAWS OF 2012, ch. 1, \u00a7 1. DSHS argues, and Ms. Howell concedes, that Washington law established by the initiative is just as binding as the WLAD, is more recent, and must be harmonized with the WLAD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b641 DSHS argues that the approval and enactment of the initiative is the true impediment to Ms. Howell's employment prospects. It points to the following provision of the initiative, codified at RCW 74.39A.056(2) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   No provider, or its staff, or long-term care worker, or prospective provider or long-term care worker, with a stipulated finding of fact, conclusion of law, an agreed order, or finding of fact, conclusion of law, or final order issued by a disciplining authority or a court of law or entered into a state registry with a final substantiated finding of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment of a minor or a vulnerable adult as defined in chapter 74.34 RCW shall be employed in the care of and have unsupervised access to vulnerable adults.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b642 Ms. Howell makes two arguments in response: first, that DSHS has been given rulemaking discretion as to how the employment prohibition is applied and second, that it is other DSHS action, not the initiative, which completely precludes Ms. Howell from becoming certified and employed as an NAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A. DSHS's rulemaking discretion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b643 Subsections of RCW 74.39A.056 delegate authority to DSHS to adopt rules to implement the provision and to establish the state registry against which the background checks will be conducted. RCW 74.39A.056(4) provides that \"[t]he department shall adopt rules to implement this section.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   RCW 74.39A.056(3) authorizes DSHS to establish the state registry by rule, adding that the rule \"must include disclosure, disposition of findings, notification, findings of fact, appeal rights, and fair hearing requirements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b644 Administrative rules and regulations adopted by an agency pursuant to statutory authority are valid if they are reasonably consistent with the statute being implemented, and the intent and purpose of the legislation.\n   <em>\n    Multicare Med. Ctr. v. Dep't of Soc. &amp; Health Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1169893\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/114/572/#p588\">\n    114 Wash.2d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=790%20P.2d%20124\">\n    790 P.2d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Washington's Administrative Procedure Act provides that an agency may use a statute's statement of intent or purpose in interpreting its other provisions. RCW 34.05.322. Section 1 of Initiative 1163 stated that it was the intent of the people through the initiative \"to protect vulnerable elderly and people with disabilities by reinstating the requirement that all long-term care workers obtain criminal background checks and adequate training.\" LAWS OF 2012, ch. 1, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b645 DSHS has so far not demonstrated that its rulemaking authority is too limited for it to develop a registry and fashion background check requirements that would have the features Ms. Howell alleges are possible: \"permit[ting] accused persons to expunge their findings after demonstrating their rehabilitation; reduce the period of retention of the record on a background check when there is no evidence of future harm to children; or periodically\n   review all records to determine ongoing need to retain any given record in its background check database.\" CP at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B. RCW 74.39A.056 does not present a complete bar to Ms. Howell's employment as an NAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b646 Alternatively, Ms. Howell argues that even if construed as argued by DSHS, RCW 74.39A.056(2) does not foreclose her from all employment as an NAC. A \"nursing assistant\" is \"an individual, regardless of title, who, under the direction and supervision of a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse, assists in the delivery of nursing and nursing-related activities to patients in a health care facility.\" RCW 18.88A.020(8). A \"nursing assistant-certified\" is a nursing assistant certified under chapter 18.88A RCW. To receive a nursing assistant certificate, an applicant must successfully complete an approved training program or satisfy alternative training criteria adopted by the Washington Nursing Care Quality Assurance Commission and successfully complete a competency evaluation. RCW 18.88A.085.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b647 As construed by DSHS, RCW 74.39A.056 would preclude Ms. Howell from being employed as a \"long-term care worker\" or serving as a provider or provider staff caring for, and with unsupervised access to, vulnerable adults. As defined by RCW 74.39A.009(20), \"long-term care worker\" includes some, but not all, NAC employment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (a) \"Long-term care workers\" include all persons who provide paid, hands-on personal care services for the elderly or persons with disabilities, including but not limited to individual providers of home care services, direct care workers employed by\n   home care agencies or a consumer directed employer, providers of home care services to persons with developmental disabilities under Title 71A RCW, all direct care workers in state-licensed assisted living facilities, enhanced services facilities, and adult family homes, respite care providers, direct care workers employed by community residential service businesses, and any other direct care worker providing home or community-based services to the elderly or persons with functional disabilities or developmental disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (b) \"Long-term care workers\" do not include: (i) Persons employed by the following\n   facilities or agencies: Nursing homes licensed under chapter 18.51 RCW, hospitals or other acute care settings, residential habilitation centers under chapter 71A.20 RCW, facilities certified under 42 C.F.R., Part 483, hospice agencies subject to chapter 70.127 RCW, adult day care centers, and adult day health care centers; or (ii) persons who are not paid by the state or by a private agency or facility licensed or certified by the state to provide personal care services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Not all NAC employment would require Ms. Howell to provide care, with unsupervised access, to vulnerable adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b648 DSHS has so far not demonstrated that the provisions approved by Initiative 1163 present a complete bar to Ms. Howell's employment as an NAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   III. DSHS HAS NOT YET MADE A SHOWING OF BUSINESS NECESSITY NOR HAS IT DEMONSTRATED THAT DISCRETIONARY IMMUNITY IS FATAL TO MS. HOWELL'S CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b649 In moving for a dismissal under CR 12(c), DSHS did not undertake to produce evidence of business necessity, a response to Ms. Howell's claim that remains available to it. It did argue, and argues on appeal, that discretionary immunity bars Ms. Howell's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b650 After the Washington legislature abolished the principle of sovereign immunity by passing RCW 4.96.010, the Washington Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Evangelical United Brethren Church of Adna v.

It appears that at least some of the rules and policies probably were adopted by high-level agency executives. But DSHS did not present the required evidence of the risks and advantages that were consciously balanced (or when, or by whom) before high-level agency executives adopted the rules or policies. Just as an agency rule can be declared invalid if, e.g., it was adopted without compliance with statutory rule-making procedures or is arbitrary and capricious,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RCW 34.05.570(2)(c), agency decisions will not enjoy discretionary immunity if the required conscious balancing of risks and advantages did not take place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   IV.

The consequences of this novel determination are quite significant. Seeing no evidence that WLAD employment protections were intended to apply to nonemployers or that it was designed as some type of super oversight statute, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b661 Initially, it is prudent to begin with a history lesson. Seventy years ago, Washington outlawed discrimination in employment, declaring:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The opportunity to obtain employment without discrimination because of race, creed, color or national origin is hereby recognized as and declared to be a civil right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   LAWS OF 1949, ch. 183, \u00a7 2.

LAWS OF 1949, ch. 183, \u00a7 7. The employer section of this provision was codified at RCW 49.60.180, while labor organizations were placed in \u00a7 190 and employment agencies in \u00a7 200. As new civil rights were added, RCW 49.60.030 was recast into a list of civil rights recognized by the chapter. LAWS OF 1957, ch. 37, \u00a7 3.

This is not a practice by some employer that discriminates against a job applicant.

Ms. Howell provides no evidence of discriminatory purpose behind the known abuser statute. The alleged disparate impact of that statute is simply not actionable under WLAD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b668 Another reason this action fails is because WLAD is not some sort of super-statute designed to trump competing statutes. Typically, we construe statutes to avoid conflict in order to give effect to both, but a later adopted statute will govern when the two conflict.\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3975541\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/147/251/#p262\">\n    147 Wash. App. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20P.3d%201285\">\n    191 P.3d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Here, there is a statute prohibiting discrimination in employment and a later adopted statute prohibiting known abusers from working with vulnerable populations. We can give effect to both statutes by limiting them to their core concerns-discrimination in employment and protection of the vulnerable. Known abusers are not a protected class under WLAD and the statute need not be construed to extend to them. But, even if it were unclear, the specific policy of the latter adopted statute, RCW 74.39A.056(2), should govern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b669 The consequences of applying WLAD in this manner are significant. All sorts of otherwise neutral statutes could be subject to oversight. Our prison population is overwhelming male and includes a large number of minorities; do those facts render the criminal law invalid under WLAD? Are school admissions policies that have disparate impact on some groups invalid? And, even if invalid under\n   WLAD, why should the policy of that statute govern over the policy of another statute? The legislature has not granted higher status to some statutes over others. We should not do so either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b670 Accordingly, I dissent for the following reasons: (1) this was not an employment action and DSHS was not acting as an employer, making RCW 49.60.030(1)(a) inapplicable; (2) there is no obligation on DSHS to ameliorate the known abuser statute; (3) disparate\n   impact analysis has no role in this litigation; (4) appellant has not shown that the known abuser statute was adopted for a discriminatory purpose; and (5) WLAD has no super status authorizing it to trump the policies of later adopted statutes. If there is a policy problem with the known abuser statute, it should be tested and resolved under constitutional principles rather than under an inapplicable statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b671 The summary judgment ruling should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Every case brought under .030(1) has involved suit brought against an employer.\n    <em>\n     Kilian v.
