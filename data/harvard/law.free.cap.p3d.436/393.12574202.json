The trial court granted the Leeches' motion for summary judgment, ruling as a matter of law that the Boyles did not establish actionable nuisance. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 John Leech lived at his current residence as a child in the 1950s. He moved back to the property in 1995 and currently lives there with his wife. A coastal redwood tree has grown on the property since Leech first lived there, and he believes that someone planted the tree in the 1930s. Leech estimates the trunk of the tree sits approximately 70 feet from the boundary line with the Boyles' neighboring property. He also estimates the branches stop approximately 50 feet before the boundary line. Leech stated he has received no prior complaints about the tree from the neighbors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The Boyles moved into their home in July 2013. Wind blows debris from the Leeches' tree onto the Boyles' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometimes, this debris causes staining. The staining does not remove easily, and requires power washing or strong cleaning products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The Boyles hired Brian Allen, a certified arborist, to inspect the tree on the Leeches' property. Allen determined the sap and cones from the tree contains tannic acid, which stains the Boyles' property. In his report, Allen stated the tree \"is dying slowly,\" causing excessive sap and cone production. Despite this diagnosis, Allen noted the \"[t]ree is not currently considered high risk.\" On a 1 to 10 health scale (1 being the highest risk, with the potential for critical failure at any moment), Allen ranked the health of the tree as close to a 7. As a recommendation, the report provides, \"Due to client's motivations, and the potential for continued and worsening damage to surrounding property, removal is recommended.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Because of the staining, the Boyles filed a nuisance action against the Leeches on September 28, 2016. The Boyles requested $5,000 in damages and asked the court to order the Leeches to abate the nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On June 26, 2017, the Leeches moved for summary judgment, arguing the Boyles failed to establish a prima facie case of nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 The trial court granted the Leeches' motion for summary judgment on August 25, 2017. The Boyles filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The Boyles appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. Nuisance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 The Boyles assert the trial court erred by ruling that debris from a tree wholly on a neighboring party's property cannot constitute a nuisance as a matter of law. The Leeches argue the Boyles did not establish a nuisance caused by any unlawful act or omission. Additionally, the\n   Leeches contend the tree cannot constitute a nuisance because it\n   exists entirely on their property. We conclude the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the Leeches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Appellate courts review de novo a trial court order granting summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    MJD Props.

We decide that this-debris from a tree wholly on another's property-does not constitute a nuisance. Cases from other courts accord with this conclusion. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Leeches.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.
