We accept special-action jurisdiction and grant relief, holding that the statute does not limit venue to the county which contains an LLC's known place of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 This case arises from a conflict over various business and financial matters among\n   a group of siblings and their families involving jointly owned and managed companies and properties. Pishit Patel (\"Petitioner\") filed suit against members of his family, including Nilay Patel and Mayank Patel (\"Respondents\"), and various other entities in the Maricopa County Superior Court. In his second amended complaint, Petitioner alleged, in relevant part, that Respondents misused operating funds from Sammy's Island, LLC-a business he formed to operate a mobile home and RV park. Petitioner's complaint asked the court to determine the ownership interests of Sammy's Island and to appoint a receiver, and included claims for an accounting, breach of contract, fraudulent nondisclosure, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, conversion, civil racketeering, and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Respondents denied all of Petitioner's claims and filed counterclaims. They alleged that, together, they owned 50 percent of the membership interests in Sammy's Island, while Petitioner effectively owned the other 50 percent. Respondents' counterclaims included breach of contract, conversion, defamation, false light, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The same day Respondents filed their answer and counterclaims in Maricopa County, they also filed a complaint against Petitioner in the Mohave County Superior Court. Their complaint included claims for breach of contract, accounting, conversion and aiding and abetting, injunctive and declaratory relief, and for the judicial dissolution of Sammy's Island under A.R.S. \u00a7 29-785, again alleging that Respondents together had a 50 percent ownership interest in Sammy's Island and that Petitioner's actions had made it impossible to continue operating the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Petitioner filed a motion for abatement in Mohave County, arguing that substantially identical claims were already pending in Maricopa County. In their response, Respondents argued that pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 29-785, Mohave County was the \"exclusive\" forum with \"subject matter jurisdiction\" to resolve the judicial dissolution and related claims. The Mohave County Superior Court denied Petitioner's motion for abatement, ruling that the statute does not allow for \"concurrent jurisdiction [between counties] in the dissolution claim.\" Petitioner then filed a petition for special action with this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After the petition for special action, response, and reply were filed, Respondents filed a notice to supplement the record to inform this court they were voluntarily dismissing their counterclaims relating to Sammy's Island in the Maricopa County action. They argued this voluntary dismissal of certain claims meant there were \"no longer any claims related to Sammy's Island ... remaining in the Maricopa County [a]ction,\" rendering moot the issue before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Petitioner argues the Mohave County Superior Court erred by ruling that A.R.S. \u00a7 29-785(A) does not allow for \"concurrent jurisdiction in the judicial dissolution claim.\" The Mohave County Superior Court ruled that regardless of whether the Mohave claims were sufficiently identical to the Maricopa claims to warrant abatement, the statute does not permit the judicial dissolution claim to be raised anywhere else but Mohave County. We agree with Petitioner that the superior court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Because the question raised by this special action-whether the statute mandates the exclusive forum in which an action for the involuntary judicial dissolution of an LLC may be raised-is a purely legal question and a matter of first impression, we accept special action jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn H. v.

City of Tucson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1208144\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/10/54/#p55\">\n    10 Ariz.

The dismissal of Respondents' counterclaims concerning Sammy's Island in Maricopa County did nothing to alter the LLC's status as a party and as the subject of many of Petitioner's claims in the Maricopa County action. Therefore, whether Petitioner's Maricopa County claims and Respondents' Mohave County judicial-dissolution claims are substantially identical remains squarely at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Next, we turn to the interpretation of A.R.S. \u00a7 29-785(A), which states: \"On application by or for a member, the superior court in the county in which the known place of business of the limited liability company is located may decree dissolution of a limited liability company\" if the court makes certain findings. The Mohave County Superior Court erred in ruling that this statute does not allow for \"concurrent jurisdiction in the judicial dissolution claim.\" Instead, the statute merely provides a preferred venue for such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Pursuant to Article 6, Section 13 of the Arizona Constitution, \"the superior courts constitute a single court composed of all the judges in every county.\"\n   <em>\n    Sil-Flo Corp. v.

Rather, the statute prescribes the proper venue for the judicial dissolution of the LLC but does not foreclose raising such a claim elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohave County v.

The Mohave County Superior Court therefore erred in ruling that it alone had the power to decide Respondents' action for the judicial dissolution of Sammy's Island, and in ruling that this was a reason to deny Petitioner's motion for abatement. Abatement is appropriate when \"the pendency of a prior action between the same parties for the same cause in a state court of competent\n   jurisdiction gives grounds for the abatement of a subsequent action either in the same court or in another court of the state having like jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.
