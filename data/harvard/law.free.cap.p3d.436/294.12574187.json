Gary\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered\n   early retirement in 2015, claiming that physical pain prevented him from working in a position similar to his employment during the marriage. As a result, Gary's income decreased after he retired, and he petitioned the district court to modify the divorce decree by terminating Pixie's award of alimony (the Petition to Modify). The district court denied the Petition to Modify, concluding that Gary's retirement was foreseeable at the time of divorce and that his early retirement was voluntary and therefore did not constitute a material and substantial change of circumstances. Gary appeals, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 Gary and Pixie's 2005 divorce decree identified three events that would terminate Gary's alimony obligation: (1) Pixie's remarriage, (2) \"her creation of a cohabitation relationship with a person of either sex,\" or (3) \"her death.\" It also provided that Pixie would receive a \"50% distributive share of [Gary's] federal civilian employment civil service retirement account as of and not beyond the entry date of the decree of divorce.\" Gary had worked as an aircraft mechanic at Hill Air Force Base for thirty-five years before retiring at the age of sixty-one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b63 Near the end of 2014, Gary filed the Petition to Modify, asking the court to modify the divorce decree and terminate his alimony obligation, based on his planned retirement the next year. According to the Petition to Modify, he wanted to retire early because he was \"simply unable to continue [working].\" Because of his retirement, Gary asserted that, \"[f]or some reason, [Pixie] believes she is entitled to her alimony, and her appropriate share of [Gary's] retirement accounts, which would obviously be inappropriate and inequitable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b64 During the bench trial, Gary testified that he suffered an injury in a car accident in 1998 that broke all of the metatarsal bones in his foot. Then, in 2011 and 2012, Gary underwent shoulder surgeries to repair torn rotator cuffs in each shoulder. As a result of these injuries, Gary claimed it was too painful to continue working and therefore sought early retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b65 After the bench trial, the court entered an order with supporting findings of facts and conclusions of law. The court concluded that it \"[did] not have jurisdiction to terminate alimony\" because Gary's retirement was foreseeable at the time of divorce and nothing in the divorce decree provided that retirement would terminate his alimony obligations. It found that the divorce decree allocated half of Gary's retirement account accrued during the time of the marriage to Pixie, but the decree did not provide that receipt of the retirement funds would \"modify, terminate, or amend the award of alimony to [Pixie].\" In its oral ruling, the court also found that there was no evidence, other than Gary's anecdotal statements, that his injuries rendered him disabled and unable to continue working. It further found that Gary \"admitted under cross-examination that he didn't even seek alternative employment or reassignment,\" and he did not provide any information that his employer had \"talked to him about the quality of his work\" or his ability to continue working. Without additional evidence to support his inability to continue working, the court concluded that his early retirement was voluntary. For these reasons, the court denied the Petition to Modify. Gary appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b66 Gary contends the district court erred in determining that his retirement was foreseeable at the time the divorce decree was entered. \"In a divorce action, the district court is permitted considerable discretion in adjusting the financial and property interests of the parties, and its actions are entitled to a presumption of validity.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Entitlement to retirement benefits is not a function of need, and that entitlement does not end with remarriage or cohabitation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 11 (providing that \"an employee spouse's retirement benefits are subject to equitable distribution in a divorce proceeding, provided that the benefits accrued in whole or in part during the marriage\" (quotation simplified) ). But there is an indirect connection between the two. Alimony is a function of need and ability to pay.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-5\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (8)(a)(i)-(iii). To the extent that a spouse otherwise entitled to alimony becomes eligible for retirement benefits, her actual need may well be reduced. And by the same token, if the spouse obligated to pay alimony receives less in retirement than he earned while working, his ability to pay may likewise be reduced. Seen from this perspective, Judge Harris makes an excellent point: where a payor spouse experiences a drop in income at retirement, or where a payee spouse receives significant benefits associated with either spouse's retirement, such changes may well make alimony unnecessary or at least suggest that the amount of alimony be reduced. Thus, anticipating such changes and adjusting alimony accordingly, either prospectively or at the time they occur, makes a great deal of sense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b610-12. But the majority does not see any need for amendment of the applicable statute. Family law practitioners need only recognize that in all but a handful of divorce cases, retirement is inevitable, and thus a foreseeable, event. As such, it should routinely be dealt with explicitly in the divorce decree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-16\">\n   HARRIS, Judge (concurring):\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 I concur in full with the majority opinion, because in my view the result in this case is compelled by the plain language of Utah Code section 30-3-5(8)(i)(i), which allows district courts to modify alimony orders only where there exists a change in circumstances that is both (a) substantial and material, and (b) \"not foreseeable at the time of the divorce.\" (LexisNexis Supp. 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macdonald v.

The language of the current statute, by contrast, could give rise to situations in which payor spouses are saddled with alimony obligations that were computed based on pre-retirement income but that, subsequent to their retirement, they may not realistically be able to meet.
