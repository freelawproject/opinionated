Through her collective bargaining agreement, Braitsch was paid her full salary in lieu of temporary total disability (TTD) payments. She was later awarded permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits which were reduced by the amount her full salary payments were in excess of TTD benefits pursuant to 85A O.S. \u00a7 89.

She asserts the deduction to her PPD award for amounts paid above the TTD maximum, as required by 85A O.S. \u00a7 89, was an unconstitutional taking of property and violated her right to due process.

The first prong of the test is satisfied. The ALJ's Order granting PPD was entered on August 15, 2017. This Order provided a PPD award that was reduced by $5,228.61, the amount paid to Braitsch above the TTD maximum. This PPD award was calculated by the statutes in place at the time of Braitsch's injury which included the above mentioned deduction pursuant to 85A O.S. \u00a7 89. This is not a case where PPD was awarded and then later reduced or taken away without a hearing. The core elements of procedural due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Baby F. v. Okla. County Dist.

The Order reflects a hearing before the Administrative Law Judge was held on July 19, 2017, and Braitsch was represented by her attorney Michael R. Green. An administrative deprivation of a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest must be accomplished by an impartial and disinterested tribunal in an adjudicative process where the procedures employed are appropriate for the constitutional interest at stake.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Braitsch has not argued she received an unfair hearing or that the ALJ was partial. The record is clear that several hearings took place and Braitsch was represented by counsel. We hold Braitsch was afforded an appropriate level of process and find no evidence to support Braitsch's claim she incurred an unconstitutional taking of property without procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2. Substantive Due Process:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 7 Braitsch also appears to make a substantive due process argument in challenging the constitutionality of 85A O.S. \u00a7 89. Braitsch claims she was denied due\n   process because this section of law shifts the economic burden upon an injured worker without a legitimate state interest. The substantive component of the due process clause bars certain governmental action despite the adequacy of procedural protections provided.\n   <em>\n    Baby F. v. Okla. County Dist.

We explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   There is little doubt that a state legislature may alter private contractual rights of employers and employees when it properly exercises its police power in creating a particular workers' compensation law, or that workers' compensation laws, by themselves, have been considered by courts as a legitimate State interest since the compensation laws were first created. In our case today, we do not repeat\n   <em>\n    Lochner's\n   </em>\n   error of\n   <em>\n    improperly rejecting\n   </em>\n   an articulated economic interest of the State.

The deduction from PPD of excess TTD benefits ensures fairness and predictability in the award of PPD benefits. By receiving her full wages during her temporary total disability period, Braitsch received more than what other employees would receive who are only awarded TTD benefits. The deduction brings parity to workers' compensation awards by providing, in the end, relatively the same amount of benefits to all injured workers. Respondent notes previous versions of the workers' compensation code provided a specific prohibition on deducting overpayments or receiving credits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, under the AWCA no such prohibition exists. As mentioned, the AWCA was effective upon the date of Braitsch's injury and therefore it is the applicable law for determining her workers' compensation benefits. We hold the state interest articulated in support of 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 is legitimate: ensuring fairness, efficiency, objectivity, predictability, and uniformity in the awarding of PPD benefits. Braitsch has not established her right to substantive due process was violated by the provisions of 85A O.S. \u00a7 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Title\n   </strong>\n   85A O.S. \u00a7 89\n   <strong>\n    Is Not A Special Law In Violation Of The Oklahoma Constitution.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 9 Braitsch next claims 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 is an unconstitutional special law in\n   violation of Okla.

Braitsch does not identify any of these subjects in her brief. She merely claims 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 is a special law pursuant to Okla. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 46. Without such identification it is impossible for this Court to determine whether a prohibited special law was passed in violation of this section. However, determining what enumerated subject was violated is immaterial because Braitsch cannot establish 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 is a special law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 10 In order to have a special law you need to first establish a class of similarly situated subjects and then prove less than all the subjects are being affected differently by the law. Statutes facing a special law challenge are considered pursuant to a three-part test. First, is the law special or general? Second, if the law is special in nature, does a general apply?

In\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   , 85 O.S. \u00a7 41.1 (repealed by 2011 Okla. Sess. Laws c. 318, \u00a7 87) was challenged as being an impermissible special law. Subsection A of \u00a7 41.1 provided that if salary or any other remuneration was paid in lieu of temporary total compensation during the period of temporary total disability no respondent or insurance carrier could deduct from the amount of a permanent or partial permanent disability award any amounts paid for temporary total disability nor could any credit be given for such additional payments against any benefits provided under the workers' compensation laws. This Court determined that the classes involved under this subsection were: 1) employers who chose to pay salary or other remuneration in lieu of temporary total disability compensation, and 2) the employees who were paid such amounts.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243915\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/5/594/\">\n    2000 OK 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243915\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/5/594/\">\n    5 P.3d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, this Court held \"[s]ubsection A of \u00a7 41.1 sets out a general law that prohibits credit against subsequent awards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Subsection B of \u00a7 41.1, however, provided a limited exception to the general law found in subsection A. It carved out a subclass of qualified individual self-insured employers who could receive credits for amounts paid in excess of temporary total disability benefits against any permanent partial disability owed. We held the provisions of subsection B created an impermissible special law that violated Okla. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 13 Title 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 provides \"[a]ny wages paid by the employer, over the statutory temporary disability maximum, shall be deducted from the permanent partial disability award.\" Similar to the classes identified in\n   <em>\n    Grant,\n   </em>\n   the classes affected under \u00a7 89 are: 1) employers who choose to pay wages over the statutory temporary disability maximum, and 2) the employees who receive such wages. Both of these classes are affected by the provisions of \u00a7 89. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Grant,\n   </em>\n   however, there is no similar provision to \u00a7 41.1 (B). No subclass has been carved out for special treatment. Section 89 allows all similarly situated employers to deduct the amounts paid in excess of the temporary disability maximum from any permanent partial disability award. Employees who received amounts in excess of the TTD maximum will also be treated alike and receive a reduction in their permanent partial disability awards. The law in\n   <em>\n    Grant,\n   </em>\n   85 O.S. \u00a7 41.1 (A), prohibited deductions and the law in the present case, 85A O.S. \u00a7 89, allows deductions. The difference is immaterial to our analysis and only reflects a legislative policy change. What matters for our determination in this matter, is how the classes are treated under the individual statutes.

In my view, she is entitled to both. Therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 2 On October 15, 2015, Braitsch, a Tulsa Police Officer, suffered an injury to her right arm (elbow) while in the line of duty working for her employer, the City of Tulsa. The City of Tulsa is a self-insured, own risk employer. She promptly notified her employer and timely filed a CC-Form-3 with the Workers' Compensation Commission. Braitsch was diagnosed with damage to her ulnar nerve. She received treatment to her back, neck and the elbow of her right arm. She was off work from October 16, 2015, to November 1, 2015, and then again from March 1 through April 7, 2016, as a result of surgery. She was paid injury leave in the amount of her full wages during those periods. A hearing was held on July 19, 2017, to determine the amount of PPD to her right arm, and the parties stipulated to the temporary total disability rate of $571.55 and the PPD rate $323.00. The parties also stipulated that the accrual date for PPD was June 16, 2016. Respondent City of Tulsa requested a credit for overpayment of TTD pursuant to 85A O.S.Supp. 2014 \u00a7 89, which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   If the employer has made advance payments for compensation, the employer shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of any unpaid installment or installments of compensation due. If the injured employee receives full wages during disability, he or she shall not be entitled to compensation during the period. Any wages paid by the employer, over the statutory temporary disability maximum, shall be deducted from the permanent partial disability award. Such deduction shall be made after any such applicable attorney fee and any such assessment made pursuant to Sections 45 and 46 of this act have been paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 3 In the order filed on August 16, 2017, the ALJ awarded Braitsch 20% PPD benefits to her right arm in the amount of $17,765.00 and found that it had all accrued and was payable immediately. The ALJ overruled Braitsch's constitutional challenges to \u00a7 89 and granted employer's request for a credit of $5,228.62, thereby reducing her PPD award due to the payment of annual leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Braitsch appealed the order, and the Workers' Compensation Commission sitting\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   affirmed the decision of the ALJ on October 20, 2017. An order memorializing the Commissions' affirmation was filed on October 31, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 4 Braitsch never received any TTD benefits. Instead, Braitsch received annual leave benefits in the amount of $9,915.32 pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the City of Tulsa and Lodge #93 of the Fraternal Order of Police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CBA was admitted as an exhibit at the PPD hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of her injury, Braitsch had been an officer with the Tulsa Police Department for 11 years and her employment was protected by the CBA. This is the exclusive agreement wherein the parties negotiated for wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This agreement was in effect at the time of her injury. Article 16-Injury Leave includes only the following three provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Section 16.1\n   </em>\n   The Lodge and the City of Tulsa recognize the necessity of maintaining a policy and procedure for administering Injury Leave with the City of Tulsa. The guidelines provided in the Tulsa Police Department Policy and Procedure Manual shall be used for administering injury leave under this agreement. It is the policy of the Employer to provide compensation and leave time for Employees who incur disabilities in accordance with State Statute Title 11 Section 50-116 et. seq. and/or Workers' Compensation Title 85.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Section 16.2\n   </em>\n   While on Injury Leave, an Employee shall be entitled to all vacation, sick, and other leave benefit accruals. The employee's credit for computing time in grade for pay increases and promotional seniority considerations shall not be affected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Section 16.3\n   </em>\n   The parties agree that for purposes of administering Injury Leave as it applies to members of this bargaining unit, Employees awaiting a final claim decision of the Claims Administrator may elect to use Injury leave as stated in this Article 16. Upon notification from the Claims Administrator that the claim is denied, the City is authorized to deduct any Injury Leave used from the Employee's accruals of sick leave, vacation leave, or compensatory time, in that order, to reimburse the Injury Leave used. If the Employee lacks sufficient accruals of leave to reimburse the Injury Leave then the reimbursements shall come from accruals of sick leave, vacation leave, and compensatory time as they are earned by the Employee. Should the claim be denied and Injury Leave reimbursed, this will not prejudice any later action by the Employee in a Workers Compensation claim or other proceeding to contest said denial and to recover the personal leave that reimbursed said Injury Leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There is nothing in the agreement that provides for an elective or mandatory reduction in payment of any benefits provided under the CBA related to Title 85 (now 85A). Employer argues that the CBA does not prohibit the requested salary deduction, but any modification of the CBA can only be changed by the specific terms of the CBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employer was required to make injury leave payments pursuant to this contract. If the Employer is permitted to reduce the amount of money which Braitsch received while off work, then the Employer has unilaterally changed the terms of the CBA. Further, Title 85A O.S. Supp. 2013 \u00a7 8(A) provides: \"No agreement\n   by an employee to waive his or her right to compensation shall be valid. No contract, regulation, or device shall operate to relieve the employer or carrier, in whole or in part, from any liability created by this act, except as specifically provided in this act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 5 Article 16 providing for salary continuation is a bargained for condition of employment. Braitsch's only remedy for permanent loss of function due to her on the job injury is found in the AWCA, a right specifically reserved in the CBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   From a plain reading, it is clear that the intent of Article 16 of the CBA is to provide police officers with the benefits of both the CBA and statutory workers' compensation benefits. Indeed, Section 16.3 allows a Tulsa police officer to receive injury leave pay whether or not the claim is denied by the Tulsa Claims Administrator. The CBA also specifically enumerates the situations in which the employee may be required to reimburse the City of Tulsa, while reserving the right of the employee to pursue remedies in Workers' compensation. To take away the employee's workers' compensation benefits in order to reduce the cost to the employer for benefits guaranteed in the CBA destroys the purpose of collective bargaining and punishes a police officer for being part of a bargaining unit, which is prohibited by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    11 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 51-101.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Braitsch had vested rights to the lawful benefits provided in the CBA and pursuant to Article 2 \u00a7 15 of the Oklahoma Constitution, it would be unconstitutional to construe Section 89 as modifying the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither Title 11, the AWCA nor the CBA permit a reduction in Braitsch's PPD benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 6 I also agree with Braitsch that \u00a7 89 offends Art. 5 \u00a7 59 of the Oklahoma Constitution because it is a special law.

Just like Braitsch, Grant was injured while working for her self-insured employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just like Braitsch, Grant received no TTD but was paid her regular higher wages. Her self-insured employer was given a credit for the overpayment of temporary total disability pursuant to 85 O.S. Supp. 1999 \u00a7 41.1(B). This Court determined that subsection (B) of \u00a7 41.1 was an impermissible special law that violated Art. 5, \u00a7 59 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243915\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/5/594/\">\n    5 P.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, we said: \"For a special law to be permissible, there must be\n   <em>\n    some distinctive characteristic warranting different treatment and that furnishes a practical and reasonable basis for discrimination\n   </em>\n   .

The dissent asserts the application of 85A O.S. \u00a7 89, which provides a credit against permanent partial disability (PPD) awards, unconstitutionally impaired the Petitioner's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in violation of Art. 2, \u00a7 15 of the Oklahoma Constitution. This is not so. The effective date of the CBA is for the period of July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. O.R. at 22. Title 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 is part of the Administrative Workers' Compensation Act (AWCA) which repealed and replaced the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Code effective February 1, 2014 and prior to this CBA. 2013 Okla. Sess. Laws c. 208; SB 1062. Title 85A O.S. \u00a7 89 was the law in place at the time of the Petitioner's injury, October 15, 2015. Nowhere in the CBA does it mention any specific amount for PPD benefits or injury leave benefits. Section 16.1 of the CBA, which concerns \"Injury Leave,\" does, however, cite repealed law. It provides in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    It is the policy of the Employer to provide compensation and leave time for Employees who incur disabilities in accordance with State Statute 11 Section 50-116 et. seq. and/or Workers' Compensation Title 85.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Title 11 O.S. \u00a7 50-116 was repealed in 1988 by House Bill 1588. 1988 Okla. Sess. Laws c. 267, \u00a7 38. This same bill also created 11 O.S. \u00a7 50-116.1 which concerns benefits paid by a municipality when a member of a police department is injured on the job (injury leave). 1988 Okla. Sess. Laws c. 267, \u00a7 13. It requires the municipality to pay the salary of the member for up to 6 months with the possibility of an additional 6 month period. This section was enacted in Article 50 of Title 11 which concerns the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System. It is not a workers' compensation law. The municipality paid the Petitioner's salary following her accident pursuant to 11 O.S. \u00a7 51-116.1 and arguably in compliance with Section 16.1 of the CBA. There are no provisions in the CBA concerning PPD benefits that would conflict with \u00a7 89.
