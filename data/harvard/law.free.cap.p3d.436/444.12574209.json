The Unemployment Insurance Commission (Commission) denied her application and the district court affirmed the Commission's decision. Ms. Mahoney argues on appeal, first, that the Commission lacked substantial evidence to conclude she committed misconduct connected with her work, and, second, that the City violated her First Amendment rights when it dismissed her for constitutionally protected speech. Finding neither argument persuasive, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b62] We rephrase Ms. Mahoney's issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Was there substantial evidence to support the Commission's determination that Ms. Mahoney engaged in misconduct connected with her work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Did the City violate Ms. Mahoney's First Amendment rights when it terminated her employment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] Ms. Mahoney worked at-will as a communications technician (dispatcher) for the City's police department (Department) for over seven years. On two different occasions during the course of her employment, Ms. Mahoney contacted the City's human resources department and the City's administrator about concerns she had with her supervisors and work environment. The response she received on both occasions was\n   to \"give it some time.\" Dissatisfied by these responses, Ms. Mahoney contacted a member of the city council and the two discussed Ms. Mahoney's concerns, which included a hostile work environment, harassment, poor training programs, and unorganized and unprofessional supervision-all of which Ms. Mahoney attributed to a lack of leadership. Their first two meetings occurred in October and November 2016. The council member told Ms. Mahoney he would try to help her, but he needed documents regarding her concerns. They met a second time in November, together with other dispatchers, and Ms. Mahoney gave the council member some documents. Ms. Mahoney also gave the council member a letter indicating why she and other employees were coming to discuss concerns with him. She signed the letter \"on behalf of the Police Dispatch Employees\" and included her job title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] In early December, Ms. Mahoney emailed herself (at her work account) correspondence and attached documents to give to the council member at their next meeting. Among the email's attachments, Ms. Mahoney sent confidential tables the Department maintained to show registered alarms in the City. Ms. Mahoney believed it was the Department's policy not to respond to calls from unregistered alarm systems. She thought that her supervisor was not correctly updating the tables and the failure to do so posed a safety risk to the City and its residents if the police ever failed to respond to a call from an alarm that was registered, but appeared not to be according to the tables. The tables listed residential and commercial alarms along with personal identifying information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and birth dates. Ms. Mahoney did not redact this information before emailing it to herself or before she gave the council member copies of the emailed documents on December 14, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] In late December, the chief of police discovered the email Ms. Mahoney had sent to herself. The chief launched an investigation into the email and met with Ms. Mahoney in early February. Ms. Mahoney admitted she had given the tables to the council member. At the conclusion of his investigation, the chief determined Ms. Mahoney had violated numerous City and Department policies-policies of which Ms. Mahoney acknowledged she was aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] The City dismissed Ms. Mahoney on February 8, 2017. She applied for unemployment insurance and her application proceeded through four tiers of review. The Unemployment Insurance Division of the Department of Workforce Services initially denied Ms. Mahoney's application, but an Appeals Division hearing officer reversed that denial after a contested case hearing. The City then appealed to the Commission, which reversed the hearing officer's decision. The Commission found Ms. Mahoney knew of, but intentionally disregarded City and Department policies and procedures. The Commission concluded that Ms. Mahoney was terminated for misconduct connected with her work and denied her benefits. Ms. Mahoney appealed and the district court affirmed the Commission's order after considering whether substantial evidence supported the Commission's decision and whether that decision violated Ms. Mahoney's free speech rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Mahoney timely appealed the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] In unemployment insurance cases, we review the Commission's decision \"without considering the decisions of the deputy, the hearing officer or the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

First, the City established that it had \"a policy prohibiting employees from providing, without express authorization, confidential information to anyone not authorized to receive it.\" Section 3.6 of the City's policy handbook specifically required, \"Except for information deemed to be public under federal and state law, information about City of Gillette employees, customers, suppliers and vendors is to be kept confidential and divulged to individuals within the City with both a need to receive and authorization to receive the information.\" That policy further mandated, \"Confidential information may not be removed from the City property without express authorization.\" Department policies also prohibited employees from removing any official Department records, \"except as authorized by the chief of police or under due process of law.\" The Department prohibited employees from divulging \"to any person not connected with the department information acquired by their employment if the information might discredit or imperil the efficiency of the department, unless under due process of law, departmental order, or an order of a commanding officer.\" The Department further required employees to report alleged policy violations, and to do so by submitting a written memorandum through their chain of command (either to their immediate supervisor or the police chief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b614] Second, the City established that Ms. Mahoney violated City and Department policies on distributing confidential information. The Department's alarm registration tables contained confidential personal identifying information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and birth dates. Ms. Mahoney gave unredacted copies of the tables to the council member, who was not authorized to receive them. The police chief testified-and Ms. Mahoney admitted-that neither he nor a court order directed Ms. Mahoney to provide the confidential information to the council member. She also admitted that she had not received permission from her supervisors or the director of\n   human resources to disclose the information. The council member, in turn, testified that he was not a city employee, and the City demonstrated through policies and testimony that the council member was not otherwise authorized to review the confidential tables. The record also contains testimony that Ms. Mahoney did not formally report her concerns about the confidential tables in accordance with the Department's reporting policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b615] To satisfy her burden, Ms. Mahoney argues that any violation of the City's and Department's policies was unintentional and justifiable. She testified that she did not provide the alarm registration tables to the council member for the purpose of disclosing confidential information. In fact, she stated that she had not noticed that the tables contained confidential information when she disclosed them to the council member. She also believed that the council member was authorized to see those records. She claimed she provided the tables to the council member out of concern that the allegedly out-of-date tables posed a risk to the City and its residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The council member testified that he believed Ms. Mahoney was just trying to correct a problem she saw, and she was not acting against the City's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b616] After evaluating the record, the Commission determined that Ms. Mahoney \"intentionally disregarded\" applicable policies and that her actions amounted to misconduct.

The evidence clearly establishes that Ms. Mahoney was aware of City and Department policies and chose to violate them anyway. In early 2016, Ms. Mahoney signed an \"acknowledgment of receipt\" attesting that she had received the Department's updated policy manual. She later acknowledged receipt of the City's employee handbook. Ms. Mahoney admitted at the hearing that she provided the confidential tables to the council member without obtaining prior authorization. She also did not report her safety concerns to her supervisors, the police chief, or the city administrator before she raised them with the council member.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record shows Ms. Mahoney's policy violations did not amount to an isolated, excusable incident, as the employee disciplinary report the City provided Ms. Mahoney on discharge shows that she was reminded on three previous occasions to report her workplace concerns through her chain of command.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aspen Ridge Law Offices\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8462425\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/143/911/\">\n    143 P.3d at 917-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an employee's conduct was \"an isolated instance of ordinary negligence which did not constitute misconduct\" and noting that the employer failed to point to evidence that the employee's conduct \"was more than an isolated incident\").

The record demonstrates that Ms. Mahoney disclosed the tables containing confidential information, at least in part, out of a concern for the public's safety. However, the fact that she did not notice that the tables contained confidential information belies any assertion that Ms. Mahoney believed it was necessary to disclose that information in order to explain her concerns to the council member. Instead, she risked harm to the City, the Department, and the individuals whose personal information was contained in the tables when she disclosed confidential information merely to show that her supervisor was not updating alarm registrations. The record further demonstrates that Ms. Mahoney's concern that the Department did not respond to calls from unregistered alarms was unsupported. The police chief testified that the Department responded to calls regardless of whether the Department's records indicated an alarm was registered. Moreover, Ms. Mahoney had an available, and\n   <strong>\n    mandatory\n   </strong>\n   , internal reporting process through which Department leadership could have addressed her misunderstanding about Department practices and ensured the tables were properly updated.
