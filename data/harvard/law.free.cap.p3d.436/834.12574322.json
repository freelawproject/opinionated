Finally, he argues that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find that he had premeditated intent to kill two of the victims.

When Deputy Brandon Myers arrived at the park, Justin Helwick came out of the trailer at space 47, and told him that someone inside had been shot. Inside the trailer, Myers found a man lying on his stomach, covered in blood. The man, Mathew Dean, told Myers that he had been shot three times. Myers radioed for a medical crew to help Dean, but the aid crew that had been dispatched was busy at another location at the park. Myers and Detective Cory Manchester, carried Dean to Myers's patrol car. They drove Dean to the entrance of the park, where they met medics who moved Dean into an ambulance. Dean survived but required multiple surgeries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.%202\">\n    3 At 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :28 a.m., Patrol Sergeant Mike Davis also arrived at the scene. Helwick directed Davis and fellow officers to the trailer at space 21, where the shooting occurred. The officers surrounded the trailer. Davis heard screams from inside, and then Jalisa Lum, carrying her two year old son,\n   Kaden, exited the home. Kaden\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had a bullet wound above his eye. Officer Jeff Schaefer attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Kaden. Medical aid arrived, and Schaefer took Kaden to the ambulance. Kaden died. According to the autopsy, the cause of Kaden's death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Davis, along with three other officers, went inside the trailer. Toward the back of the home, the officers found a woman who had been shot and appeared to be dead. That woman, Heather Kelso, had been shot once in each thigh and twice in the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Lum was Kelso's roommate. Lum moved into Kelso's trailer at space 21 near the beginning of 2015. On March 27, 2015, Dean went to Kelso's home. That night, their romantic relationship progressed further than it had in the past. Around 1:00 a.m., Kelso went to the back porch to smoke a cigarette. Dean heard gunshots and ran to the porch. Kelso was holding her legs and yelling that she had been shot. Dean pulled her into the house and laid her down. He then went into Lum's room, and felt that he had been shot. He jumped through the window, breaking it, and ran to Helwick's trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Lum was lying in her bed when she heard Kelso say, without \"rais[ing] her voice hardly,\" that she had been shot. Lum heard more gunshots and heard Dean ask her for help. Lum then got out of her bed and, with her body, covered her son on the ground. While she was on the floor, she heard \"a lot of gunshots.\" Then, she heard someone she thought was Dean come through her room and ask her for help or to call 911. After she heard the window shatter, Lum testified that \"somebody opened up the door again, [and] shot towards me and Kaden.\" She felt the bullet go by her face, and pretended to be dead. After she did not hear anything for about three minutes, she reached for her cellphone, which she had placed on the floor before she went to sleep. She then called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 After the shooting, police quickly identified Geraldo DeJesus as a person of interest. In the past, DeJesus and Kelso had a relationship, had lived together, and had a child together. Their relationship was rocky and remained conflicted during Kelso's pregnancy. They ended their relationship after the child was born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 On February 24, 2015, Kelso filed a report about DeJesus with Child Protective Services (CPS). The same day, she got a temporary domestic violence protection order against DeJesus. Kelso got a permanent protection order against DeJesus on March 5, 2015. In March 2015, DeJesus expressed frustration with not being able to see his\n   daughter. On March 24, CPS mailed a letter to DeJesus, notifying him that it had closed the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 On March 27, 2015, Kelso had a confrontation with DeJesus at a McDonald's restaurant. She called Elizabeth Forrester, Kelso's surrogate mother and friend, and told her about the confrontation. Later that day, DeJesus visited his and Kelso's child, who was sick and staying with Forrester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Around 5:50 a.m. after the shooting, police found DeJesus's car in a parking lot next to an apartment building in Port Orchard. Ivy Rose DeJesus, DeJesus's ex-wife, lived in the building. A heavy police presence set up outside the building, and, using a loudspeaker-like device, called for DeJesus to exit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 After DeJesus exited, police handcuffed him, read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, and interviewed him in the front passenger seat of a detective's car. The officers told DeJesus that they were investigating the murder of Kelso and an infant. Detective Michael Grant testified that DeJesus's reaction was \"indifferent.\" Grant noticed that DeJesus had a scrape on his left shin. DeJesus told the police that he had injured his leg, and his hip, at work. The detectives asked\n   DeJesus what he had been wearing the night before, and he told them that he had changed clothes. He gave the police permission to collect the items that he said he had been wearing. The police collected a brown hooded sweatshirt with a zipper, a gray T-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and another T-shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Police searched Ivy's\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   residence. They found a Smith and Wesson gun case. Inside the case, police found a loaded magazine, a cleaning brush, and some literature about the gun. A spent shell casing was inside an envelope tucked inside the inner lining of the gun case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The magazine had 15 Federal brand 9mm hollow-point rounds in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 A former Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory analyst examined evidence in this case. She compared the cartridge case from the Smith and Wesson envelope and the cartridge casings from the scene. She concluded that the cartridge casings from the scene had consistent markings with the casing found in the Smith and Wesson envelope, indicating that they were fired from the same gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 The State charged DeJesus with first degree premeditated murder of Kelso, with aggravating circumstances (count 1); first degree felony murder of Kelso, with special allegations (count 2); first degree burglary, with special allegations (count 3); first degree premeditated murder of Kaden, with special allegations (count 4); first degree felony murder of Kaden, with special allegations (count 5); first degree murder by extreme indifference of Kaden, with special allegations (count 6); attempted first degree premeditated murder of Dean, with a special allegation (count 7); and attempted first degree premeditated murder of Lum, with a special allegation (count 8). The jury found DeJesus guilty as charged. By agreement, the trial court vacated the felony murder convictions to avoid double\n   jeopardy. The court sentenced DeJesus to life imprisonment. DeJesus appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 DeJesus makes six arguments. First, he argues that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   hearing and admitting expert testimony on ballistic identification. Second, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding other suspect evidence. Third, he argues that the trial court violated his right to counsel by restricting counsel's closing argument. Fourth, DeJesus argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence that he told police that he had been kidnapped and robbed a few weeks after the shooting. Fifth, he argues that cumulative error deprived him of his right to a fair trial. And sixth, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support findings that he premeditated the murder of Kaden and attempted murder of Lum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Many of DeJesus's arguments focus on the various evidentiary rulings the trial judge made during the trial. A trial court's evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

DeJesus argues that Trammell had the motive to commit the crime, because Trammell had animosity towards Lum and a history of domestic violence towards her. In his motion to admit other suspect evidence, DeJesus offered Lum's petition for a protection order against Trammell. Unlike the petition Kelso had filed against DeJesus, Lum filed her petition against Trammell\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the shooting. In the petition, Lum describes Trammell's past acts of domestic violence, but also describes the shooting and the death of their child as a turning point. She writes,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   March 28, 2015 my baby was shot in [a] Bremerton shooting. Sence [sic] that day my baby's dad, James, has become very unpredictable and aggressive towards me. ... We have had a very difficult relationship all along and [I] have never felt fearful of him, like I do now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 When DeJesus moved to admit other suspect evidence, he argued that, like himself, Trammell was an \"estranged boyfriend[ ],\" shared a small child with a woman living in the mobile home, had incidents of\n   domestic violence with his estranged girlfriend, and owned a Smith and Wesson gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 The trial court denied DeJesus's pretrial motion to present other suspect evidence, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   I'm not able to, based on what's been presented this morning -- I don't believe that the strength of the defendant's showing of the -- some tangible connection between the other person, Mr. Trammell, and the crime charged is sufficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   There is an insufficient train of facts or circumstances as presented in the offers of proof. And so I'm going to deny the motion with regards to other suspect evidence in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   However ... you have leave to renew this motion pending additional information certainly and perhaps most importantly what I'm hearing crime lab information with regards to the firearm that Mr. Trammell turned over. So I guess it remains to be seen what that says, but if you believe it's relevant, you certainly have leave to refile your motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 40 At the time of the shooting, the parenting arrangement between DeJesus and Kelso was significantly different from the arrangement between Trammell and Lum. In the month of the shooting, DeJesus expressed resentment because he felt Kelso was keeping their daughter from him. By contrast, Trammell and Lum were alternating days and splitting time with their child equally. And, on the day before the shooting, Trammell agreed to let Kaden spend the night with Lum, even though it was Trammel's turn to host him. This demonstrates that, at the time of the shooting, Trammell and Lum's relationship was amicable, at least in regards to parenting their child. And, Trammell knew that on the night of the shooting Lum had their child, with whom he had an invested relationship. There is also no evidence in the record of Trammel having animosity toward Kelso or Dean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 41 DeJesus also argues that Trammell had the means to commit the crime, because he owned firearms. In his pretrial motion, DeJesus specifically argued that Trammell also owned a Smith and Wesson gun, and \"was familiar with firearms and knew how to use them.\" DeJesus did not argue that Trammell had possession of DeJesus's gun or of any other third parties' gun. The fact that Trammell owned a firearm does not sufficiently link him to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 42 Finally, DeJesus argues that Trammell had the opportunity to commit the crime, because he showed up at the crime scene \"shortly after the shooting, demonstrating his proximity.\" Trammell lived approximately 50 to 60 minutes from the mobile home park. He testified that, the night of the shooting, his mother woke him up and told him that Kaden had been shot. Together, Trammell and his\n   mother drove to the hospital, looking for Kaden, and then went to the park where the shooting occurred. His arrival at the scene after learning that his son had been shot is not a circumstance pointing to a nonspeculative link connecting him to the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 43 When the trial court denied his motion, DeJesus had not shown that Trammell had the motive, means, or opportunity to commit the crime. The decision to exclude the evidence was not error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 44 And, evidence admitted subsequently rendered any possible error in the decision to exclude harmless. A forensic scientist with the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory tested Trammell's Smith and Wesson gun and compared it with casings from the scene. He testified that the \"fired cartridge case that was collected from the scene was eliminated as having been fired from the Smith [and] Wesson MMP firearm\" that he examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 45 DeJesus's allegations about Trammell do not amount to a chain of circumstances that creates reasonable doubt as to DeJesus's guilt, as in\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 46 During the trial, DeJesus renewed his motion to admit other suspect evidence, this time focusing on Houston. DeJesus alleged that Houston sold Kelso drugs. DeJesus argued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [T]here was an individual named James Houston that was Heather's pill dealer....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Mr. DeJesus told the detectives that she owed money to this particular person, that he was her pill dealer, that she used pills. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ... [W]e have evidence that she had a substantial bit of cash on her person when she was found. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   ... [I]t's a nexus test on the other suspect. We're renewing the motion to be able to explore the other suspect evidence. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ... There's a sufficient nexus to argue another suspect, being James Houston or some other unknown person associated with Mr. Houston.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 47 On appeal, DeJesus argues that Houston had motive, because he \"threatened Kelso\" on March 26, and was a \"drug dealer [who] wanted her to pay up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He asserts that Houston had means, because \"firearms are widely available.\" He argues that Houston had opportunity, stating that \"Kelso expected him to be coming over to her residence.\" And, he argues that there was a hostile interaction shortly before her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 48 The court found that DeJesus did not meet the bar to present other suspect evidence as to Houston, stating, \"I'm also not finding at this point that, through this witness at this time, there's a sufficient nexus between Heather's drug use and what we're referring to as other suspect evidence and that test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 49 DeJesus alleges that Houston's motive for the shooting was to recover money, but there was money found in Kelso's wallet at the scene. Next, DeJesus claims that Houston had the means and the opportunity to commit the crime. But, arguing that guns are widely available does not establish that someone has a gun. It is merely conjecture. And, nothing places him at or near the scene of the crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mere fact that the person sent the victim a \"hostile\" text message the day before is insufficient support for other suspect evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

During closing, defense counsel argued that, while it was reasonable for the police to have investigated DeJesus, they failed to explore other theories and suspects. He stated, \"Five months, they did everything they could to tie Mr. DeJesus to the shooting.... [A]s of March 28 at 4:30, but certainly by March 31, there's one suspect, and everything else is excluded. Everyone else is excluded.\" After some time, he mentioned Houston, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   And in particular, they did not do a thorough investigation of James Houston. Now, James Houston was a name that was provided to them as early as March 28. They knew James Houston is [sic] a possible suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   By the way, I want to be clear on one thing.

Law enforcement did not investigate James Houston, despite the fact that he was a suspect -- he was a known suspect as early as March 28. Why did not they not\n   investigate him?

I don't think bullet point two is a proper inference because of the time delay. I'll let you use bullet point one with regards to that slide if you take off bullet points two and three. Those are excluded. The second slide is likewise not admissible for purposes of argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 64 Defense counsel asked if he was allowed \"to talk about pawning.\" The court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Well, you're allowed to talk about the text message, the direct quote from the text message, because that was substantive evidence. But the $ 600 to $ 800, there's such a difference -- there's such a significance in time between when that money was found that I don't think you can make a reasonable inference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 65 After some discussion, the court clarified,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   I think you can certainly -- there was a motion in limine with regards to Heather Kelso's alleged drug use. That was excluded. I think argument with regards to her secret life or another life, I think that encroaches on the motion in limine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   So I think you can use text messages that were admitted for the purpose of why they were admitted, and that was to the nature and extent of the investigation but not as substantive evidence. I guess I want to make sure that your argument makes that clear to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   And I think you did -- at the outset of talking to [about] Mr. Houston, you did make it clear to the jury that you're not saying he's the shooter, and I appreciate that. That's consistent with what we talked about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 66 Pursuant to the court's ruling, counsel changed his slides. The slide captioned \"Question\" kept only the bullet points, \"Can you pawn your gun?\" and \"Where is the gun on March 28? ?\" Counsel removed the slide captioned, \"Kelso's Secret Other Life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 67 DeJesus contends that counsel \"wanted to argue the inference that Kelso may have pawned the gun, given her expressed interest in doing so and the fact that she had $ 600-$ 800 in her wallet when she died.\" He asserts that the court improperly prohibited counsel from making this inference to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 68 A text message in which Kelso asked DeJesus, \"Can you pawn your gun?\" had been admitted into evidence. And, the fact that Kelso had between $ 600 and $ 800 in her wallet when she died had been admitted. Also in admitted evidence was a text message sent March 31 from DeJesus to Brandon Whittaker stating, \"Don't know if she sold or pawned it, man. I'm tripping out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 69 But, there is no evidence that Kelso had possession of DeJesus's gun before she died. After the shooting, DeJesus sent a text message to Whittaker saying, \"I left it at Heather's house, and the police said it wasn't there.\" DeJesus told police that he left the gun at Kelso's house, and counsel argued this to the jury. But, there is no evidence that DeJesus left the gun there, other than his statement that he did. There is also no evidence that Kelso pawned the gun. The fact that she had $ 600 to $ 800 in cash when she died does not prove that she ever had the gun or pawned the gun. It is speculation, not a reasonable inference. Further casting doubt on the reasonableness of the inference is the fact that the Smith and Wesson gun that DeJesus owned was positively identified as the firearm likely used in the shooting. The notion that Kelso pawned the gun for $ 600 to $ 800, and that it was then purchased by someone else and used in a shooting in which she died is implausible, and highlights the unlikelihood of the inference DeJesus argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 70 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defense counsel's closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of a Fabricated Kidnapping and Robbery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 71 DeJesus argues fourth that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence that, a few weeks after the shooting, he told police he had been kidnapped and robbed. He argues that the relevance of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect under ER 403 and ER 404(b). The State argues that the false report to police was a lie to implicate another person for the murder.

DeJesus argued that the court had to find by a preponderance of the evidence that he had lied about the robbery, filed a false report, and committed bank fraud, and that the State could not meet that burden. The State did not argue that it had to meet a different burden. The court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   I'm satisfied that, as an offer of proof -- the reported robbery as an offer of proof, the prosecution will be able to at least examine in their case in chief whether or not Mr. DeJesus attempted to create another suspect for the murder he was being investigated for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   I'm relying on\n   <em>\n    Freeburg\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Messinger\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   that's been cited in the prosecution's brief that does allow for this type of evidence under this theory.

The trial court did not explicitly state that it found by a preponderance of the evidence that DeJesus committed the misconduct. But, because no other standard\n   was asserted, it implied as much by referring to the State's offer of proof and the case law cited by the State, which used the preponderance standard.

He asserts that because he reported the kidnapping/robbery incident to police 18 days after the shooting, the time gap weakens the consciousness of guilt inference. DeJesus also argues that the trial court did not, on the record, carefully weigh the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect, and that \"any marginal probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to DeJesus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 80 In making a case for the probative value of the evidence, the State said,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   [I]t clearly shows the defendant is trying to create another suspect in this case.

Importantly, unlike\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   , the State also relied on the content of DeJesus's statements themselves, which established a direct link to the murders. The timing of the statements relative to the murder did not undercut the probative value on the question of consciousness of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 83 DeJesus argued to the trial court that the probative value was \"negligible\" and that it was unfairly prejudicial.

The State presented\n   evidence of motive and planning. After shooting Kelso, DeJesus entered the home with a loaded gun, shot Kelso again, and pursued and shot Dean as he ran through the home. These circumstances show a\n   premeditated intent to kill not only Kelso, but the other occupants of the home, as well. DeJesus then deliberately shot at Lum while she was holding Kaden on the ground. The jury could have concluded that, when DeJesus ran into the dark bedroom pursuing Dean, he thought that the person huddled on the floor was Dean. The intent is transferred. It is immaterial if he thought it was Dean, when really it was Lum, or the fact that he fired only once at two victims. The statutory definition of first degree murder does not require specific intent for a specific victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 100 Under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable jury could have found the essential elements of first degree premeditated murder as to Kaden and attempted first degree premeditated murder as to Lum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 101 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Chun, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    <em>\n     Frye v.
