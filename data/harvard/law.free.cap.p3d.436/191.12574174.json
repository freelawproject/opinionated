Regarding her obstruction of justice conviction, Horvath argues that the trial court erred by refusing her request for a lesser-included-offense instruction and that she received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because her counsel failed to object to an allegedly erroneous instruction. As to her reckless driving conviction, she argues that the court incorrectly entered the conviction as a class A misdemeanor rather than a class B misdemeanor. We affirm Horvath's obstruction of justice conviction, but we vacate\n   her reckless driving sentence and remand the case to the trial court to correct the penalty classification and to amend her sentence accordingly on that count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Car Chase\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Horvath's convictions arise from a car chase involving Horvath, another driver (Other Driver), and a detective (Detective). In July 2014, West Valley City police officers were surveilling a house near 4000 West and 3500 South. The police had received information that a witness to a homicide frequented this particular house. The officers were in plain-clothes, and their vehicles were unmarked. One of the officers (Officer) was parked in a lot facing the house, while Detective was parked in a grocery store parking lot on 4000 West, facing the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Officer observed two people exit the house around the same time, and he alerted Detective. The first person to exit, Other Driver, entered a Pontiac. The second person, Horvath, entered a Subaru. Both cars drove away from the house \"[w]ithin seconds\" of each other, with Other Driver leading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Meanwhile, Officer and Detective confirmed Other Driver's identity through a records check and discovered that he was on parole, that the car he was driving was registered to him but uninsured, and that his license was invalid. Officer and Detective determined Detective would initiate a traffic stop with Other Driver and Officer would assist him once the stop was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 From his parked location, Detective watched Other Driver drive past him. Other Driver looked at Detective \"quite heavily,\" making sustained eye contact with Detective while he drove by. Detective observed Horvath pass by him \"immediately\" afterward, at which point Detective \"pulled out on to the street\" behind the two cars. Once Detective did so, both cars \"began to accelerate very, very rapidly\" toward the intersection of 4000 West and 3500 South. Detective then saw both cars make right turns onto 3500 South \"against the red light with ... no signal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Detective continued to follow Other Driver and Horvath, observing them drive aggressively and apparently in tandem with one another. They merged into the center passing lane on 3500 South, using it \"as a travel lane\" to speed past the traffic waiting for the light at the Bangerter Highway intersection. Detective estimated that the cars were traveling at approximately sixty miles per hour. Both cars then ran the red light at Bangerter Highway, continuing east on 3500 South toward the I-215 interchange. Detective followed them, working his way closer through the traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 The center turn lane that both cars had been using as a travel lane became a bus lane after Bangerter Highway, and 3500 South eastbound opened up to three travel lanes. Detective observed both cars merge right, out of the center lane, and into slower traffic. At that point, both Other Driver and Horvath continued to drive \"very aggressively,\" cutting off other vehicles, making abrupt lane changes without signaling, and accelerating around other vehicles. To keep up with the cars, Detective had to employ similarly aggressive driving tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 After several blocks, at approximately 3300 West, Detective caught up to Other Driver, ending up \"directly behind\" him within one car length. In doing so, Detective lost sight of Horvath. Detective activated his lights and siren, signaling Other Driver to pull over. Although Detective's vehicle was unmarked, Detective testified at trial that it was equipped with a combination of white, red, and blue flashing lights around all sides of the vehicle at various heights and locations, and that the lights were \"very, very visible\" from every direction. When activated, lights flashed in the headlights, the brake lights, the grill, the fog lights, and on bars around the front, sides, and back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Other Driver did not stop. Instead, he \"continued to accelerate\" and drive aggressively, \"cutting off cars, driving around cars quickly, [and] not using [his] signal.\" From Detective's perspective, Other Driver appeared to be \"run[ning] from [him].\" Detective tried to keep up with Other Driver by driving in the same aggressive manner over\n   several blocks. During this time, Detective did not observe Horvath's location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 As Other Driver and Detective approached 2900 West, Other Driver merged into the innermost lane to pass a slowing vehicle in the center lane, and Detective followed. After passing the slowing vehicle, Other Driver merged back into the center lane. Detective tried to follow Other Driver into that lane, but as he began to merge, Detective saw \"out of [his] peripheral vision\" Horvath accelerating toward his vehicle into the center lane at the same time, \"almost causing a collision.\" Indeed, Detective testified that he \"had to jerk [his] wheel back into the [innermost] lane to avoid a collision.\" While she merged into the center lane, Horvath kept her car parallel with Detective's vehicle, and Detective testified that Horvath \"maintained direct eye contact\" with him for three to five seconds, that he did not observe \"any panic\" or \"shock on her face\" as if she had merged accidentally, and that she was looking at him with an aggressive expression on her face, as though she was \"mad at [him].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Thereafter, Horvath did not move out of Detective's way, but continued to stay in the center lane, blocking him from pursuing Other Driver. Although Detective was eventually able to work his way around other vehicles to continue the pursuit, Other Driver had gained too much ground. When Detective saw Other Driver merge onto I-215, he broke off pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The State charged Horvath with reckless driving and with obstruction of justice with respect to Other Driver's criminal conduct of failing to respond to Detective's signal to stop. The case proceeded to a one-day jury trial. Detective was the State's primary witness, and he was the only witness who testified regarding the details of the pursuit and Horvath's obstruction. Neither Horvath nor Other Driver testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 The State asserted at trial that Horvath had obstructed Detective's ability to apprehend Other Driver for failure to respond to Detective's signal. The seriousness of the offense being obstructed-failure to respond-made a conviction under this theory a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 During trial, defense counsel asked the court to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of misdemeanor obstruction of justice predicated on reckless driving. Defense counsel argued that a jury could find that \"the only thing in [Horvath's] realm of knowledge\" at the time she nearly merged into Detective's vehicle was that Other Driver had been driving recklessly, not that he had failed to respond. Defense counsel asserted that the evidence supported a finding that Horvath intended only to impede Other Driver's apprehension for reckless driving, which would lower the severity of the obstruction crime from a felony to a misdemeanor. The court denied defense counsel's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 The jury convicted Horvath of both charges. Horvath timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Horvath raises three issues on appeal. First, she argues that the trial court erred when it declined to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of misdemeanor obstruction of justice. In particular, she argues that misdemeanor obstruction of justice predicated on reckless driving is a lesser included offense of felony obstruction of justice predicated on failure to respond. She also contends that there is a rational basis in the evidence from which the jury could have acquitted her of the greater charge and convicted her of the lesser charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Second, she argues that she received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when her defense counsel failed to object to the instruction for failure to respond. She claims that her counsel performed deficiently because the instruction obviously omitted the required mens rea for certain terms in the\n   failure-to-respond instruction and that she was harmed thereby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 Third, she argues that the court erred in entering and sentencing her reckless driving conviction as a class A, rather than a class B, misdemeanor. We address each issue below, ultimately affirming her conviction for obstruction of justice predicated on failure to respond. However, we vacate her reckless driving sentence and remand the case for the limited purpose of correcting the classification of and sentence on her reckless driving conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I. Lesser-Included-Offense Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Horvath was charged with obstruction of justice predicated on Other Driver's failure to respond to Detective's signal to stop,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6a-210(1) (LexisNexis 2014),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which constitutes a third degree felony under the obstruction of justice statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-8-306(3)(b)(i) (2017). Horvath argues that she should be granted a new trial because the trial court incorrectly refused her request to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of obstruction of justice predicated on the underlying offense of Other Driver's reckless driving,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41-6a-528 (2014),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which would have constituted a class A misdemeanor under the obstruction of justice statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-8-306(3)(c) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Horvath frames this error as a statutory construction question; she asks us to construe the obstruction of justice statute as requiring a defendant to know that the criminal conduct on which the obstruction charge is predicated occurred. The obstruction of justice statute provides in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) An actor commits obstruction of justice if the actor, with intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the investigation, apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of any person regarding conduct that constitutes a criminal offense:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) prevents by force, intimidation, or deception, any person from performing any act that might aid in the discovery, apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of any person[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-8-306(1)(b). Horvath argues that obstruction of justice is a specific intent crime requiring a defendant to \"act with knowledge of the predicate\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   \" charged-in this case, failure to respond to a police officer's signal. And if a defendant is charged with felony obstruction, as she was here, Horvath argues that \"that conduct must be of a nature that[,] if prosecuted, it would constitute a felony crime.\" As applied to her case, Horvath claims that she had to know that Other Driver committed the felonious criminal conduct underlying her obstruction charge-failure to respond to Detective's signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 Employing similar reasoning, Horvath further argues that she was entitled to the lesser-included-offense instruction for obstruction based on reckless driving, asserting that there was a rational basis in the evidence from which the jury could have determined that she did not know that Other Driver had failed to respond to Detective at the time she obstructed Detective's attempts to apprehend Other Driver, but that she did know that Other Driver had committed reckless driving.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although there was a lack of direct evidence about what Horvath might have observed during the time Detective lost sight of her, the circumstances surrounding Horvath's obstructive act overwhelmingly suggest that, at the time she obstructed Detective in his pursuit, she did so knowing that Other Driver had failed to respond to Detective's signal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    2015 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 40-43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    349 P.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a trial court's failure to give a requested lesser-included-offense instruction was harmless where the evidence overwhelmingly established the defendant's guilt for the charged, instructed offense);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, Detective testified that Other Driver \"stare[d]\" at him, maintaining eye contact \"the entire time [Other Driver] passed by\" him, and that almost immediately upon Detective pulling out from his vantage point to follow them, both vehicles accelerated \"very, very rapidly\" away from him-Horvath following Other Driver. Detective testified that he observed both vehicles drive \"very closely\" and in tandem with each other, speeding, running red lights, passing vehicles by using the turning lane, and weaving aggressively around and cutting off vehicles without signaling when they could no longer use the turn lane for travel. While Detective testified that he thereafter lost sight of Horvath for several blocks, there was no suggestion in the evidence that Horvath did not stay nearby throughout Other Driver's flight. Indeed, the timing of Horvath's obstructive act strongly suggests the opposite-that, even if Detective could not see her, she continued to follow Other Driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 In this regard, the more specific context in which Horvath's obstructive lane change occurred powerfully suggests that she knew Other Driver failed to respond to Detective's signal to stop when she blocked Detective from merging. For example, Detective testified that his vehicle, though unmarked, was equipped with a siren as well as a plethora of flashing lights-white, red, and blue-surrounding every side of the vehicle in various heights and locations. At the time Horvath merged to block Detective, his flashing lights and siren had been activated for approximately half a mile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Detective also testified that he activated his lights and siren only when he maneuvered his vehicle directly behind Other Driver, one car length away; that, rather than slowing or stopping, Other Driver immediately responded by accelerating away from him and weaving aggressively around other vehicles in an apparent attempt to flee; and that, to keep up with Other Driver, Detective had to drive with similar aggression. Although Detective may not have been able to see Horvath during the time that he activated his signal and proceeded through the several blocks of vigorous pursuit, Horvath demonstrated a present ability to block Other Driver's apprehension. Indeed, the timing of Horvath's obstructive lane change was precise and almost prescient; she accelerated from behind and merged into the center lane at the exact moment Detective attempted to follow a fleeing Other Driver into the center lane, boxing him in behind slowing vehicles in the innermost lane. She also maintained her vehicle parallel to his after merging, blocking Detective from maneuvering into the center lane in pursuit of Other Driver. Through these actions, Horvath showed a keen awareness of Detective's pursuit of Other Driver, one sufficient to anticipate Detective's merge and then deftly block it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 In these circumstances, the presence of mind and action that Horvath displayed cannot be reasonably explained away by mistake or ignorance. Rather, the contextual evidence strongly suggests that, before her act of obstruction, Horvath kept up with Detective and Other Driver through the several blocks of aggressive driving and thereby knew Other Driver was attempting to flee from Detective, fully mindful of Detective's signal to stop. Indeed, it strains credulity to suggest that, despite being available to block Detective at the exact moment he attempted to merge and after a significant stretch of aggressive driving, Horvath was nevertheless unaware of Detective's signal and Other Driver's flight from it. In this regard, Detective's testimony about Horvath's demeanor upon obstructing his lane change fairly supports an inference that she intended to block any further pursuit of Other Driver. Detective testified that she \"maintained direct eye contact\" with him \"for a good few seconds\" and that, rather than having an expression of shock indicative of a mistake, she \"look[ed] at [him] like she was very, very aggressive or mad or was mad at [him].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 In sum, the context and circumstances surrounding Horvath's obstructive act overwhelmingly suggest that her ability to merge\n   in the moment she did arose from purposeful maneuvering on her part based on her awareness of Detective's signal to stop and Other Driver's failure to respond to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we are not persuaded that it is reasonably likely that, had the jury been instructed on obstruction of justice predicated on reckless driving, the jury would have acquitted her of obstruction of justice predicated on failure to respond by necessarily finding that Horvath did not know Other Driver failed to respond to Detective's signal.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Horvath has therefore not shown that it was reasonably likely she would have enjoyed a more favorable trial outcome had the court instructed the jury on obstruction of justice predicated on reckless driving.

In\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   , the Utah Supreme Court held that the trial court should have instructed the jury that, to find the defendant guilty of failure to respond, it must have found that the vehicle operator \"\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   received a visual or audible signal from a police officer\" and\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   attempted \"to flee or elude a peace officer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6881797\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1141/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18 -24, 26 (emphasis added) (quotation simplified). Horvath further claims that the mens rea omissions were prejudicial because they prevented the jury from deciding whether Horvath \"acted with the intent to prevent [Other Driver's] apprehension for Failure to Respond.\" Horvath asserts that the omission made it possible for the jury to convict her even if it found she believed that Other Driver was \"unaware of [Detective's] signal to stop\" and/or \"the purpose of [Other Driver's] actions was not to flee or elude.\" In this regard, she contends that there was a rational basis in the evidence from which the jury could conclude that Horvath believed Other Driver was not intending to flee or elude Detective and that she believed Other Driver was unaware of Detective's signal to stop. On this basis, she claims that, had the jury been adequately instructed on the mens rea required for a failure to respond charge, it is reasonably likely she would have enjoyed a more favorable result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b632 But even assuming Horvath is correct that the jury instructions were erroneous and that her counsel should have objected to them, Horvath has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her counsel's performance. To begin with, no evidence was presented at trial suggesting that Other Driver did not \"knowingly\" receive Detective's signal or \"intentionally\" attempt to flee or elude Detective. Rather, the evidence of the circumstances surrounding Detective's activation of his lights and signal and Other Driver's immediate response only affirm that Other Driver knew he had received a signal to stop and, by accelerating and maneuvering away, intentionally attempted to elude it. Detective turned on his lights and siren when\n   he was directly behind Other Driver-a position from which it would have been nearly impossible for Other Driver to miss the signal-and the only testimony about Other Driver's actions afterward was that he accelerated away from Detective, aggressively weaving around cars for several blocks in an apparent attempt to flee as Detective tried to keep up with him. And although Detective's signal and siren remained on throughout the remainder of the pursuit, Other Driver never stopped in response to Detective's signal. Instead, he continued toward I-215 and was ultimately successful in his flight from Detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b633 Further, as already discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-29, the circumstances surrounding Horvath's obstruction overwhelmingly suggest that she knew Other Driver intended to flee from Detective's signal to stop. Had she not, there would have been little purpose for her obstructive act-one which ultimately permitted Other Driver to escape Detective. As a result, even had the jury been correctly instructed under\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   , there is no reasonable likelihood that the result would have been more favorable to Horvath. Thus, her ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.
