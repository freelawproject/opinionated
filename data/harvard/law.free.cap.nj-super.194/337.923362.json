The issues in that aspect of the case await trial in the special civil part after a determination of this appeal. The remaining issues, before us because the trial judge certified his order as final, relate to whether an automobile policy insuring Rumble and issued by Colonial Penn Insurance Co. (Colonial Penn) was effectively cancelled before the accident. If it was, the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board and not Colonial Penn must defend and pay plaintiff\u2019s ultimate recovery. The policy was purportedly cancelled at the request of Regal Premium Finance, Inc. (Regal), an insurance premium finance company that had paid the policy premium. Rumble never paid anything on account of the premium. The trial judge held that the notice of cancellation was defective and therefore the policy was not cancelled before the accident. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The facts are not in dispute. By their written agreement, Rumble authorized Regal to pay Colonial Penn the premium for the policy in question and agreed to repay Regal with interest in monthly installments commencing September 10, 1978. The agreement further provided that Rumble\u2019s default in making an installment payment when due \u201cshall render the whole unpaid balance of principal hereof immediately due and payable, without notice, and if default continues for ten (10) days thereafter, shall constitute an election by the undersigned insured to cancel the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On September 14 Regal mailed Rumble a notice stating that because his September 10 installment was not paid his \u201cinsurance is subject to cancellation if payment is not received within 10 days of this notice.\u201d The notice also contained the printed words \u201ccancellation date\u201d followed by the typewritten date \u201cSeptember 27, 1978.\u201d One may infer from the record that Colonial Penn received a copy of this notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Rumble persuaded Regal to postpone the cancellation on the promise that the installment would be paid by October 2. Regal waited for payment until October 4. It then mailed Colonial Penn and Rumble a form entitled \u201ccancellation notice.\u201d It contained the following request to Colonial Penn that it cancel the policy: \u201cThis notice effective immediately, request cancellation of policy ... for ... Non-payment of Premium.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Meanwhile, unaware that Regal had given Rumble more time, Colonial Penn purported to cancel the policy on September 27 and so notified Rumble by a \u201cnotice of cancellation\u201d mailed October 14. The accident occurred on October 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Cancellation on September 27 was in keeping with Regal\u2019s September 14 notice and the contract provision that deemed Rumble to have elected cancellation by not curing the default within 10 days. Regal\u2019s contract rights, however, are overriden by the statutory provisions on which the trial judge based his ruling. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16D-13 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>(a) When a premium finance agreement contains a power of attorney enabling the premium finance company to cancel any insurance contract or contracts listed in the agreement, the insurance contract or contracts shall not be cancelled by the premium finance company unless such cancellation is effectuated in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">(b) Not less than 10 days\u2019 written notice shall be mailed to the insured of the intent of the premium finance company to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured within such 10-day period. A copy of said notice shall also be sent to the insurance agent or insurance broker indicated on the premium finance agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">(c) After expiration of such 10-day period, the premium finance company may thereafter request in the name of the insured, cancellation of such insurance contract or contracts by mailing to the insurer a notice of cancellation, and the insurance contract shall be canceled as if such notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured himself, but without requiring the return of the insurance contract or contracts. The premium finance company shall also mail a notice of cancellation to the insured at his last known address and to the insurance agent or insurance broker indicated on the premium finance agreement. The effective date of such cancellation shall not be earlier than 3 days after the date of mailing of such notice to the insured and to the insurance agent or insurance broker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">For a cancellation to be effective under the statute the premium finance company must give the insured two notices. Each performs a different function.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The \u201cnotice of intent to cancel\u201d is given after default and advises the insured that unless he cures the default within 10 days the finance company will cause the policy to be can-celled. The function of that notice is to give the insured warning that if payment is not made by a certain date, it will be too late for him thereafter to prevent cancellation of the policy. The notice must be clear and unequivocal so that the insured will fully understand his peril and know what he has to do to prevent cancellation. If the notice of intent to cancel is inadequate, it will not be given legal effect. <em>See Brown v. </em>Shaw, 174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 40-41 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> The \u201cnotice of cancellation\u201d is given after the insured has failed to cure the default. He already knows from the \u201cnotice of intent to cancel\u201d that the finance company may now cancel at any time. The notice of cancellation advises the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>insured that the finance company cancelled the policy. Its function is simply to alert the insured that he is no longer insured by the policy. Whenever he receives it, the insured can no longer prevent cancellation if the notice of intent to cancel was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In order to prevent termination of coverage before the insured has a chance to be aware of cancellation, the statute provides that \u201ccancellation shall not be earlier than 3 days after the date of mailing of [the notice of cancellation].\u201d This allows time for mail delivery of the notice. Thus no matter when the finance company requests the insurer to cancel, the statute establishes the effective date of cancellation as three days after the finance company mails notice of cancellation to the insured unless the insurer cancels at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Regal\u2019s October 4 notice of cancellation clearly advised Rumble that Regal requested Colonial Penn to cancel his policy. The policy was therefore effectively cancelled October 7, three days after Regal mailed Rumble the notice. Although the request to cancel \u201ceffective immediately\u201d could mean to cancel within the three-day mailing period, an attempt by Colonial Penn to cancel before the period expired would not be effective under the statute until October 7. There is no reason to invalidate Regal\u2019s request to cancel in these circumstances. Rumble does not claim to have been misled by the notice of cancellation. He was certainly not prejudiced. Even if he believed that the effective date of cancellation fell within the mailing period, he would only be misled into believing he was uninsured for a day or two. Had an accident occurred during that time, he would have been covered. The accident here occurred almost two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The judge invalidated the cancellation on the basis of Colonial Penn\u2019s \u201cnotice of cancellation\u201d mailed October 14 which advised Rumble that his policy was cancelled \u201ceffective 12:01 A.M. 9/27/78.\u201d Colonial Penn\u2019s notice in this case though inaccurate was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
