The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, for further consideration in light of <em>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>-[104 <em>S.Ct. </em>615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443] (1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">464 U.S.-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The procedural history and factual background of this case is set forth in full in a prior opinion of this Court reported at 181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516 (App.Div.1981) and in the opinion of the trial court reported at 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391 (Law Div.1977). The facts are restated here in brief in order to place our \u201cfurther consideration\u201d in proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">This action was instituted as a class action by Gerrit Van Dissel on behalf of \u201call riparian property owners who claimed to have an interest in property located on Forked River, Oyster Creek, Barnegat Bay and various lagoons, canals and inlets which are tributaries of these waterways.\u201d The suit named as defendant the Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., a public utility of the State of New Jersey which constructed and operates a nuclear power reactor plant near plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The complaint sought money damages and a restraint against further operations of the plant in such a manner as to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>damage to plaintiff and the other members of the class. The complaint set forth eight different causes of action: negligence, nuisance, trespass, strict liability, violation of the New Jersey Water Pollution Control Statute <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>23:5-28; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.1 <em>et seq.), </em>violation of the Refuse Act of 1899 (33 <em>U.S. C. </em>407), violation of the Federal Water Pollution Prevention and Control Act (33 <em>U.S.C. </em>1251), and inverse condemnation. <em>Van Dissel, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Defendant\u2019s plant commenced operation in 1969. Plaintiffs allege that the design, construction and continued operation of the plant had resulted in a significantly altered marine environment in the water adjacent to plaintiffs\u2019 properties resulting in higher salinity levels, increased water flow and increased water temperatures. These changes, it is alleged, have permitted the proliferation of shipworms which have attacked and destroyed wooden docks, bulkheads and appurtenances belonging to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The increase in salinity, temperature and water flow it is conceded results from the design and operation of the cooling system and the Radwaste Discharge System. The design and method of operation of these two systems is described in detail in three reported opinions: <em>State v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>102, 106-108 (1976); <em>Van Dissel v. New Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 521-522 and 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 397-398. We need not repeat that description here.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint contending the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because federal law had preempted the field. The trial court, at 152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391 (Law Div.1977), granted the motion as to the first seven counts of the complaint and denied the motion as to the demand for damages based on the claim of unlawful taking of property without just compensation. That inverse condemnation claim was tried before a judge without a jury and resulted in a determination by the trial judge that as to one subclass of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>plaintiffs they had established that defendant had caused a \u201cshipworm invasion in the area of the subclass, but that plaintiffs had not carried the burden of proving the claimed damages had been caused by shipworm infestation.\u201d As to other subclasses of plaintiffs the judge ruled that they \u201chad failed to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s nuclear generating station had proximately caused the complaint of damage. The complaint was dismissed.\u201d <em>Van Dissel, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">On appeal to this Court we affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>Van Dissel, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to the New Jersey Supreme Court was denied, 89 <em>N.J. </em>409 (1982), and plaintiffs\u2019 appeals to that Court were dismissed. (Order dismissing appeal No. 19,201 dated February 8, 1982, filed February 17, 1982, September Term 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Plaintiff then filed in the United States Supreme Court a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the N.J. Supreme Court stating the single \u201cquestion presented\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">Are common law tort claims brought in state court by local property owners against the owner and operator of a nuclear power plant for damage to their property due to the plant\u2019s thermal pollution of local coastal waters federally preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 et seq?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">As we indicated above, the writ was granted, the judgment vacated and the case remanded to us for further consideration in light of <em>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp. </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>615, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>443 (1984). Plaintiff\u2019s motion for direct certification by the New Jersey Supreme Court was denied. Order No. 22,207 entered March 13, 1984, filed March 15, 1984, M-655 September Term 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">FEDERAL PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Our reconsideration of the federal preemption claim commences with an examination of the case of <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec, v. Energy Res. Comm\u2019n., </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>190, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1713, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>752 (1983). The precise issue presented by that ease was \u201cwhether the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, 68 Stat. 921, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>amended 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2011 <em>et seq., </em>preempted California\u2019s authority to condition the construction of a nuclear facility in California on the State\u2019s finding that adequate means of disposal were available for the plant\u2019s nuclear waste.\u201d <em>Silkwood, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 78 L.Ed.2d at 459 (noted in the dissenting opinion of Justice Blackmun). The Court concluded that \u201c... federal preemption of nuclear safety regulations was full and complete____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 460. It held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">Congress, in passing the 1954 Act and in subsequently amending it, intended that the federal government should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant, but that the States retain their traditional responsibility in the field of regulating electrical utilities for determining questions of need, reliability, cost and other related state concerns. <em>[Pacific Gas, </em>461 <em>U.S. 190, </em>\u2014, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1713, 1723, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>752, 765 (1983)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">In emphasizing the nature and extent of this preemption, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">... State safety regulation is not preempted only when it conflicts with federal law. Rather, the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states. When the federal government completely occupies a given field or an identifiable portion of it, as it has done here, the test of preemption is whether \u201cthe matter on which the state asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the federal government.\u201d <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>supra [331 <em>US </em>218], at 236, 91 <em>L.Ed </em>1447, 67 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146 [at 1155]. A state moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field. Moreover, a state judgment that nuclear power is not safe enough to be further developed would conflict directly with the countervailing judgment of the NRC, see infra, at- US-, 75 <em>LEd2d </em>774-776 [103 <em>SCt </em>1729-1730], that nuclear construction may proceed notwithstanding extant uncertainties as to waste disposal. A state prohibition on nuclear construction for safety reasons would also be in the teeth of the Atomic Energy Act\u2019s objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use \u2014 and would be preempted for that reason. <em>[Pacific Gas, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>190, ---, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1713, 1722, 1726-1727, 75 <em>L.Ed.2A 152, </em>765, 770-771 (1983) (footnote omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Despite this statement of a broad federal preemption for nuclear safety concerns and the court\u2019s recognition that the California statute had an effect on safety of nuclear plant operations, the Court upheld the statute because its purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>was economic. In describing the holding of the <em>Pacific Gas </em>case, Justice Blackmun, dissenting in <em>Silkwood, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">... The Court concluded that the State had adopted the regulation to prevent investments in power plants that were likely to become white elephants due to inadequate nuclear waste storage facilities. <em>Ibid. </em>Because Congress had not meant the Atomic Energy Act to deprive States of the right to make economic decisions concerning nuclear power, the Court concluded that the regulation was not preempted. Thus, the fundamental teaching of Pacific Gas is that state regulation of nuclear power is pre-empted to the extent that its purpose is to regulate safety. [Silkwood, 464 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 460, 104 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 627 (1984)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The significance of that holding with relation to our present inquiry is that all parties agree that the design, construction and operation of the cooling system and the Radwaste Discharge System constitutes a safety feature of the Jersey City Power &amp; Light Nuclear Power Generating Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The court opened its opinion in <em>Silkwood, </em>decided the next term of court, with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">Last term, this Court examined the relationship between federal and state authority in the nuclear energy field and concluded that states are precluded from regulating the safety aspects of nuclear energy. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Development Comm\u2019n, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>190, -, 75 <em>LEd2d </em>752, 103 <em>SCt </em>1713 [1726] (1983). This case requires us to determine whether a state-authorized award of punitive damages arising out of the escape of plutonium from a federally-licensed nuclear facility is preempted either because it falls within that forbidden field or because it conflicts with some other aspect of the atomic energy Act. [464 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 78 L.Ed.2d at 447, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 617],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Karen Silkwood was employed by Kerr-McGee Corp. in a plant where plutonium fuel pins for use as reactor fuel in nuclear power plants were manufactured. She was contaminated by the escape of plutonium and its contact with her skin. Her contamination spread to her personal belongings. A few days later she was killed in an unrelated automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">Karen\u2019s father, as administrator of her estate, instituted an action against Kerr-McGee under Oklahoma common law principles to recover damages for injuries to Karen\u2019s person and property. It was stipulated that the plutonium which caused the contamination came from the Kerr-McGee plant. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>returned verdicts for compensatory damages for injuries to Karen of $500,000, for property damage of $5,000 and a punitive damage award of $10,000,000. The case was appealed to the 10th Circuit which held that because of federal preemption, punitive damages could not be awarded. That court reasoned that \u201cA judicial award of exemplary damages under state law as punishment for bad practices or to deter future practices involving exposure to radiation is no less intrusive than direct legislative acts of the state.\u201d That court held the award for punitive damages was preempted by federal law and reversed it. 667 F.2d 908, 923 (10th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Silkwood appealed seeking review of that ruling with respect to the punitive damage award. Kerr-McGee argued in the Supreme Court that \u201cbecause the state-authorized award of punitive damages in this case punishes and deters conduct related to radiation hazards, it falls within the prohibited field.\u201d <em>Id., </em>464 <em>US. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 622, 78 L.Ed.2d at 453. The Court disagreed and held there was ample evidence that Congress had no intention of forbidding states from providing such remedies as punitive damages under state law for those suffering from injuries from radiation in a nuclear plant. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">Indeed, there is no indication that Congress even seriously considered precluding the use of such remedies either when it enacted the Atomic Energy Act in 1954 and or when it amended it in 1959. This silence takes on added significance in light of Congress\u2019 failure to provide any federal remedy for persons injured by such conduct. It is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">More importantly, the only congressional discussion concerning the relationship between the Atomic Energy Act and state tort remedies indicates that Congress assumed that such remedies would be available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Although the Price-Anderson Act does not apply to the present situation, the discussion preceding its enactment and subsequent amendment indicates that Congress assumed that persons injured by nuclear accidents were free to utilize existing state tort law remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">Congress clearly began working on the Price-Anderson legislation with the assumption that in the absence of some subsequent legislative action, state tort law would apply____ [464 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 454-455, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 622-623].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The Court concluded this portion of its opinion saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">In sum, it is clear that in enacting and amending the Price-Anderson Act, Congress assumed that state-law remedies, in whatever form they might take, were available to those injured by nuclear incidents. This was so even though it was well aware of the NRC\u2019s exclusive authority to regulate safety matters. No doubt there is tension between the conclusion that safety regulation is the exclusive concern of the federal law and the conclusion that a state may nevertheless award damages based on its own law or liability. But as we understand what was done over the years in the legislation concerning nuclear energy, Congress intended to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there was between them. We can do no less. It may be that the award of damages based on the state law of negligence or strict liability is regulatory in the sense that a nuclear plant will be threatened with damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regulatory consequence was something that Congress was quite willing to accept. [464 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 78 L.Ed.2d at 457, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 625]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Kerr-McGee focused on the differences between compensatory damage awards and punitive damage awards and asserted that, at most, Congress intended to allow the former and reject the latter. This argument was rejected by the Court saying: \u201cPunitive damages have long been a part of traditional state tort law. As we noted above, Congress assumed that traditional principles of state tort law would apply with full force unless they were expressly supplanted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 78 L.Ed.2d at 457, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">Defendant herein contends <em>Silkwood </em>carves out a very narrow exception to the flat prohibition against any state regulation by either legislation or tort law of safety matters relating to nuclear power plants, and that this narrow exception requires an allegation of \u201cdamages for radiation injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>This argument is bottomed on the court\u2019s repeated references to the nature of Karen Silkwood\u2019s injuries as being the result of \u201cthe escape of plutonium\u201d or \u201ccontamination by plutonium\u201d and \u201cEscape of plutonium caused by grossly negligent, reckless and willful conduct.\u201d Defendant also relies on the court\u2019s repeated references to \u201cnuclear incident\u201d, \u201cnuclear accidents\u201d, \u201cextraordinary nuclear occurrences\u201d and the statutory and regulatory definition of these terms. 464 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014 n. 14, \u2014 n. 15, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 624 n. 14, 625 n. 15, 78 L.Ed.2d at 455 n. 14, 456 n. 15. Defendant concludes that since plaintiffs do not allege radiation damages the claims are in the nature of preempted safety regulations and plaintiffs\u2019 claim is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Defendant also argues that in <em>Silkwood </em>there was proven violations of the safety regulations by Kerr-McGee in the past. <em>Id. </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 619, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 449, as well as the fact that Karen\u2019s injuries were the result of the escape of plutonium. On the other hand, the record in this case is lacking in any proof that defendant JCP &amp; L operated its nuclear power plant in a manner otherwise than as \u201cauthorized, approved and licensed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We do not view the holding in <em>Silkwood </em>as so narrowly constructed. This conclusion finds support in the vigorous dissent of Justice Blackmun. He focused on the difference between compensatory damages and punitive damages and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">... Compensatory damages therefore have an indirect impact on daily operations of a nuclear facility. But so did the state statute upheld in <em>Pacific Gas. </em>The crucial distinction between compensatory and punitive damages is that the purpose of punitive damages is to regulate safety, whereas the purpose of compensatory damages is to compensate victims. Because the Federal Government does not regulate the compensations of victims, and because it is inconceivable that Congress intended to leave victims with no remedy at all,7 the pre-emption analysis established in <em>Pacific Gas </em>comfortably accommodates \u2014 indeed it compels \u2014 the conclusion that compensatory damages are not pre-empted whereas punitive damages are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">Differences in the means of calculating compensatory and punitive damages further distinguish the two, and highlight the fundamental incompatibility of punitive damages and federal standards. When a victim is determined to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>eligible for a compensatory award, that award is calculated by reference to the victim\u2019s injury. Whatever compensation standard a State imposes, whether it be negligence or strict liability, a licensee remains free to continue operating under federal standards and to pay for the injury that results. This presumably is what Congress had in mind when it pre-empted state authority to set administrative regulatory standards but left state compensatory schemes intact. Congress intended to rely solely on federal expertise in setting safety standards, and to rely on States and juries to remedy whatever injury takes place under the exclusive federal regulatory scheme. Compensatory damages therefore complement the federal regulatory standards, and are an implicit part of the federal regulatory scheme. [464 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 629, 78 L.Ed.2d at 462].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Footnote 7 of Blackmun\u2019s dissent states \u201cthe absence of federal regulations governing the compensation of victims of nuclear accidents, is strong evidence that Congress intended the matter to be left to the States.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Justice Blackmun argues for the proposition that Congress always assumed that victims harmed by the generation of nuclear power would be compensated under State law. The majority does not disagree with that premise. The only point of disagreement relates to permissible awards of punitive damages. It would indeed be incongruous to hold that punitive damages could be recovered under <em>Silkwood </em>but not compensatory damages. We decline to read <em>Silkwood </em>as standing for that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Nor do we believe that it was the intent of Congress or the Supreme Court to hold that victims injured by the approved and authorized design, construction and operation of safety features could only be compensated if the injuries were caused by a nuclear accident, nuclear hazard or extraordinary nuclear occurrence. No intent to cast adrift without compensation, victims otherwise injured by the generation of nuclear power can be discerned from the statute, regulations or authorities that have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">We hold that plaintiffs claim for compensatory damages is not barred by federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">That does not end our inquiry, however, because of defendant\u2019s claim that plaintiffs are barred from trying the issue embodied in the first seven counts of the complaint by the principle of collateral estoppel, even if we should find them not precluded by federal preemption. Defendant contends the trial judge found the plaintiffs had failed to prove proximate causation between the alleged taking (based on claimed shipworm damage) and the design, construction and operation of defendant\u2019s nuclear power plant; that we affirmed that finding; that our Supreme Court denied plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification of the case and the issue was not before the United States Supreme Court. Therefore, defendant claims the issue of proximate cause has been conclusively determined adversely to plaintiffs\u2019 position and since plaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the proximate cause issue, they are \u201ccollaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of cause in fact as to any other claim they might now have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On the other hand, plaintiffs claim that the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel would deprive them of a right to trial by jury under the New Jersey Constitution of 1947, Art. I, Sec. 9, relying on <em>Suchit v. Baxt, </em>176 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 415 (Law Div.1980) and <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 216-217 (1981). Plaintiffs claim that to rely upon the trial court\u2019s finding of proximate cause in the non-jury trial of the inverse condemnation claim so as to defeat their common-law tort claims would deny them their fundamental rights under the New Jersey Constitution to present those claims to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u201cAn essential element of plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for negligence, or for that matter for any other tort, is that there be some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which plaintiff suffered. This connection usually is dealt with by the courts in terms of what is called \u2018proximate cause\u2019 or \u2018legal cause\u2019.\u201d Prosser, <em>Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 41 (4th Ed.1971). This element of proximate cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>applies in the context of both statutory and common law causes of action. In <em>State v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>102 (1976), the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection brought an action against JCP &amp; L for alleged state statutory violations arising out of the operation of the very plant with which we are here concerned. It was alleged the improper operation of the plant resulted in a large \u201cfish kill\u201d. The Supreme Court held plaintiff\u2019s claim to be deficient in two respects: 1) lack of proof of causation linking the fish kill to the operation of the plant, and 2) federal preexemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">It is clear that the element of proximate cause is essential to a cause of action for damages grounded in either a statutory or common law breach of duty. The issue is whether litigation of this issue in the inverse condemnation case bars its relitigation with respect to plaintiff\u2019s asserted common law and statutory claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In <em>Plainfield v. PSE &amp; G, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>245, 257 (1980), the court addressed this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">The general rule regarding \"issue preclusion\u201d arising out of prior judgments was expressed by this Court in <em>Washington Tp. v. Gould, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>527, 533 (1963), as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">It is well-settled that where a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction directly determines a right, question or fact distinctly put in issue, such judgment estops the parties or their privies from thereafter relitigating the same issue in a subsequent proceeding between them, regardless of its nature or form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">In <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>181, 186 (1977), it was stated that \u201c[cjollateral estoppel is that branch of the broader law of <em>res judicata </em>which bars relitigation of any issue which was actually determined in a prior action, generally between the same parties, involving a different claim or cause of action.\u201d See <em>United Rental Equip. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>92, 101 (1977); <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 531 (App.Div.1979); <em>Gareeb v. Weinstein, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 15 (App.Div.1978). The general rule was formulated in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 68 at 1 (Tent.Draft No. 4, 1977) as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">When an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>See generally Currie, <em>\u201cRes judicata: </em>The Neglected Defense.\u201d 45 <em>U.Chi.L. Rev. </em>317 (1978); Note, <em>\u201cRes judicata: </em>Cause v. Common Law,\u201d 22 <em>Loyola L.Rev. </em>221 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In New Jersey the doctrine of issue preclusion whether it be <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel precludes only questions \u201cdistinctly put in issue\u201d and \u201cdirectly determined adversely to the party against which the estoppel is asserted.\u201d <em>Eatough v. Bd. of Medical Examiners, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 175 (App.Div. 1983); see also <em>New Jersey-Philadelphia, etc. v. N.J. State Board, </em>654 F.2d 868, 876 (3rd Cir.1981), citing <em>City of Plainfield v. Public Service Gas &amp; Electric, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>245, 257-258 (1980); <em>N.J. Manufacturers Insurance Co. v. Brower, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 297 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The issue of proximate cause previously determined in the trial court and affirmed by this court clearly falls within that definition. Plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the inverse condemnation proceeding and is barred from relitigating that same issue. <em>Accord Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, </em>402 <em>US. </em>313, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1434, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>788 (1971); see also <em>Parklane Hosiery Company, Inc. v. Shore, </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>322, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>645, 58 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>552 (1979), <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d \u00a7 27 at 250 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The precise issue of proximate cause previously determined would be a necessary ingredient in plaintiffs\u2019 proofs should the previously dismissed seven counts of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint proceed to trial because the common-law tort claims and statutory claims (assuming a private cause of action for a breach thereof) asserted by plaintiff in the first seven counts all require the proof of the same element of causation in fact that was required in the inverse condemnation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The remand of the United States Supreme Court for reconsideration of this case in light of <em>Silkwood </em>does not render null and void the past procedural history of this case. Indeed it is clear that federal courts are required to give preclusive effect to state court judgments whenever the courts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>state from which the judgment emerged would do so. <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>461, 481-482, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883, 1897-1898, 72 L.Ed.2d 262, reh\u2019g. den. 458 <em>U.S. </em>1133, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>20, 73 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that application of collateral estoppel would violate their right to a jury trial guaranteed them under the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution and under the New Jersey Constitution of 1947, Art. I, sec. 9. This is based on the fact that plaintiff initially made a demand for jury trial of all claims and the inverse condemnation was tried without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The holding and the reasoning of <em>Parklane Hosiery Company, Inc. v. Shore, supra, </em>is dispositive of this contention under both constitutions. The Court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">This case presents the question whether a party who has had issues of fact adjudicated adversely to it in an equitable action may be collaterally estopped from relitigating the same issues before a jury in a subsequent legal action brought against it by a new party. <em>[Id. </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>at 324, 58 L.Ed.2d at 557-558, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 648.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In that case the Supreme Court approved the holding of the 7th Circuit that <em>\u201cA </em>party who has had issues of fact determined against him after a full and fair opportunity to litigate in a nonjury trial is collaterally estopped from obtaining a subsequent jury trial of these same issues of facts... The Seventh Amendment preserves the right to trial by jury only with respect to issues of fact [and] once those issues have been fully and fairly adjudicated in a prior proceeding nothing remains for trial either with or without a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The Supreme Court held that the application of collateral estoppel in this context does not violate the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. \u201cIf collateral estoppel is otherwise warranted, the jury trial question should not stand in the way.\u201d <em>Id., </em>439 <em>U.S. </em>at 334, n. 21, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 653 n. 21, 58 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 563 n. 21. If this is so where the parties are not identical as in the <em>Parklane </em>case, the conclusion is even more applicable here where the parties are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We see no reason to apply a different standard on this issue to our New Jersey Constitutional guarantee of a jury trial. See <em>Van Dissel, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>State v. Ingenito, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, is misplaced. That case involved the use by the prosecutor in a second criminal trial of a defendant of that defendant\u2019s prior conviction to establish one element of the crime for which he was charged in the second trial. The Court was there confronted with a criminal matter and was properly concerned that the jury\u2019s fact-finding process be all inclusive and encompass the evaluation of the credibility of all witnesses. <em>Id., </em>at 211. The conclusion of the Court indicates quite clearly the fact that its holding was limited to criminal cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">These considerations lead us to conclude that the right to a jury in a criminal trial ordinarily includes the right to have the <em>same </em>trier of the fact decide <em>all </em>of the elements of the charged offense. Unless the same jury is permitted to deliberate meaningfully upon all of the issues that are crucial to a verdict of guilt or innocence of the particular crime charged, a defendant will not have secured the jury right contemplated by the Constitution. Collateral estoppel against a defendant in the context of the criminal trial is inconsistent with this proposition. [87 <em>N.J. </em>at 217 (emphasis in original) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The policy concerns which compelled the <em>Ing\u00e9nito </em>result are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In summary we hold on \u201cfurther consideration\u201d that:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">1. Federal preemption does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 claim for compensatory property damages, but</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">2. Plaintiff has already had one full and fair trial of the issue of proximate cause which is an essential ingredient of plaintiff\u2019s other claims and the principles of issue preclusion, <em>i.e., res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel, effectively bar relitigation of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The judgment entered in the trial court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\">For a helpful article on the ambiguous message conveyed by summary reconsideration orders of the United States Supreme Court see \"Granted, vacated, and remanded\" \u2014 Judicature, Vol. 67, No. 8, page 390 (March 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The compensatory damage award of <em>$500,000 was reversed </em>by that court because \"recovery for Silkwood\u2019s personal injuries was controlled exclusively by Oklahoma\u2019s Workmens Compensation Law.\u201d 464 U.S. at-, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 620, 78 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 450.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
