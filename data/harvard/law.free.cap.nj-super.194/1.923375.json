Ciancia, </em>Assistant Attorney General, of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b34-9\">KING, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">This appeal is taken from an order of the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles suspending appellant\u2019s New Jersey driving privileges for 60 days and requiring him to attend and complete a program of education and rehabilitation. Appellant had been arrested in December 1981 in New York for driving while under the influence. <em>N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law </em>\u00a7 1192. He thereafter pled guilty to the charge of driving while impaired. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1192(1). His driving privileges were suspended in New York from May 27 to August 25, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">On September 14, 1982, pursuant to the Interstate Driver License Compact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5D-1 <em>et seq., </em>of which both states are signatories, the Director issued a notice of proposed suspension, advising appellant of his decision to suspend Lawrence\u2019s driving privileges for six months, effective September 29, 1982. Appellant requested a hearing which was conducted and resulted in a recommendation of a six-month suspension. The Director modified the recommendation and suspended for 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">We reject appellant\u2019s contention that New Jersey has no equivalent offense to New York\u2019s lesser-included charge of driving while impaired. We conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>and <em>N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law </em>\u00a7 1192(1) are of a \u201csubstantially similar nature\u201d as required by the compact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5D-4. <em>See also Farrell v. Strelecki, </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221 (App.Div.1965). Both deal with alcohol-related offenses and are aimed to deter and punish drunk drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The offense of driving while \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d prohibits a \u201cgeneral condition, short of intoxication, as a result of which every motor vehicle operator has to be said to be so affected in judgment as to make it improper for him to drive on the highways.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 165 (1964). Our courts have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">The expression \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d covers not only all the well-known and easily recognized conditions and degrees of intoxication, but any abnormal mental or physical condition which is the result of indulging in any degree in intoxicating liquors and which tend to deprive him of that clearness of intellect and control of himself which he would otherwise possess. <em>[State v. Rodgers, </em>91 <em>N.J.L. </em>212, 215 (E. &amp; A.1917) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\"><em>See also State v. Tamburro, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>414, 421 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The related offense of driving while \u201cimpaired\u201d has been similarly defined by the courts of New York. In <em>People v. Miller, </em>83 Misc.2d 118, 373 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>312, 314 (Cty.Ct.1975), the court said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">The word \u201cimpaired\u201d as defined by said dictionary is \u201cto make worse or lessen.\u201d It would therefore appear that the Legislature intended that the <em>driving of an automobile after the consumption of sufficient alcohol to lessen or impair pkysical and mental control to any significant degree, constituted a violation of this section.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">And further in <em>People v. Cruz, </em>48 <em>N.Y.</em>2d 419, 426-427, 423 N.Y.S.2d 625, 628, 399 <em>N.E.2d </em>513, 516 (Ct.App.1979), the Court of Appeals said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-12\">In sum the prohibition against driving while the ability to do so is impaired by alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 1192, subd. 1) is not a vague and indefinite concept as the defendant contends. It is evident from the statutory language and scheme that the question in each case is whether, by voluntarily consuming alcohol, this particular defendant has actually impaired, to any extent, the physical and mental abilities which he is expected to possess in order to operate a vehicle as a reasonable and prudent driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">These judicial interpretations from both jurisdictions clearly support the substantial similarity of these two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Appellant\u2019s reliance on statutory presumptions is misplaced. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.1(2). Even if appellant\u2019s blood level was less than .10%, he could still be found guilty under the New Jersey statute. A level of .05% to .10% simply establishes no presumption but is nevertheless competent evidence of guilt. <em>Ibid. </em>We note that appellant\u2019s actual blood alcohol level is riot in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We also reject appellant\u2019s contention of prejudicial delay. <em>See In re Garber, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>87, certif. den., 71 <em>N.J. </em>494 (1976). <em>See also In re Kallen, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>14, 26-27 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
