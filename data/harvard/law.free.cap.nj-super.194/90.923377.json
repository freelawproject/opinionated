Following plea negotiations, Franco, Scaffidi and Rizzo each pleaded guilty to a violation of the Solid Waste Utility Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:13A-10(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">No person shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize, trade or commerce in any relevant market, located in whole or in part in this State, for the solid waste collection business or the solid waste disposal business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The plea was entered under this statute rather than under the Antitrust Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to avoid burdening the defendants with the \u201cinterdict\u201d sanctions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-ll(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Each defendant was sentenced to three- years probation on condition that he serve 180 days at the Somerset County Jail. Franco was fined $50,000; Scaffidi and Rizzo were fined $40,-000 each. The judgments directed that the fines be paid to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Chief Probation Officer of Somerset County \u201cand distributed by him in accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeu\">Thereafter the County of Somerset was permitted to intervene \u201cregarding the issue of the proper disposition of fines,\u201d and the court amended the judgments to delete the reference to the distribution of fines under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19. Following a hearing to reconsider the \u201cdecision to modify the sentences,\u201d the court ordered that the fines \u201cbe distributed by the Chief Probation Officer of the County of Somerset in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4(b)(l) to the Treasurer of the County of Somerset.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The State contends that the Antitrust Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19, allocates the fines to the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">There is hereby appropriated out of the General State Fund to the Department of Law and Public Safety for the purpose of this act the sum of $100,000.00 for the period ending June 30, 1971, which sum shall be returned to the General State Fund from the sums derived from litigation instituted by the Attorney General under this act or the antitrust laws of the United States, as determined by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. In addition to the sum hereinabove appropriated, there are hereby appropriated as a revolving fund the sums derived as aforesaid for the purpose of paying any additional expenses incurred by the Attorney General in the administration of this act or litigation instituted under the antitrust laws of the United States, provided, however, that the expenditure of such additional sums shall first be approved by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting and the Legislative Budget and Finance Director in the same manner as transfers of appropriations are approved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The County, on the other hand, claims entitlement to the fines by reason of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4(b)(l):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">(b) Except as provided in subsection c. with respect to fines imposed on appeals following convictions in municipal courts, all fines imposed by the Superior Court, county district court, or otherwise imposed at the county level, shall be paid over by the officer entitled to collect same to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">(1) The county treasurer with respect to fines imposed on defendants who are sentenced to and serve a custodial term, including a term as a condition of probation, in the county jail, workhouse or penitentiary except where such county sentence is served concurrently with a sentence to a State institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">In his oral opinion below, the judge found no conflict between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19. He concluded that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4(b)(l) fixes \u201cthe appropriate allocation of funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>collected\u201d while <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19 \u201cdeals with the appropriation of State funds.\u201d The judge sought to \u201cgiv[e] effect to both provisions in question\u201d by construing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19 to permit the \u201crevolving fund\u201d therein established to receive \u201conly those funds which result from antitrust litigation and which are turned over to the State under the criteria of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4.\u201d We find this reading of the statutory sections unpersuasive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The Antitrust Act, enacted in 1970 as part of an anti-organized crime package (A. 1970, <em>c. </em>73, \u00a7 3), declares \u201c[ejvery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce, in this State\u201d to be unlawful. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-3. Enforcement of the act is entrusted to the Attorney General, who is directed to \u201cinvestigate suspected violations of, and institute such proceedings as are hereinafter provided for violation\u201d of the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-6. Broad authority is granted to the Attorney General for those purposes. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-8; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-9; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-10. Violations of the Act are sanctioned both by substantial criminal fines and sentences and treble damage civil liability. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-11; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-12. The Legislature clearly contemplated that the expense to the State of enforcing the Act would be substantial and, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19, structured a means to pay the cost of enforcement by using the proceeds of enforcement. \u201c[T]he sums derived from litigation instituted by the Attorney General under [the Antitrust Act] or the antitrust laws of the United States\u201d were to be used to repay the initial $100,000 appropriation and thereafter \u201cthe sums derived as aforesaid\u201d were to comprise the \u201crevolving fund\u201d for the purpose of paying expenses incurred by the Attorney General in the administration of the Act. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We discern from these provisions of the Act a legislative mandate that all \u201csums derived\u201d from antitrust litigation, civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and criminal, instituted by the Attorney General are to be appropriated to the \u201crevolving fund.\u201d The contention that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19 merely allocates monies among various State accounts fails, in our view, to give proper and sympathetic recognition to the legislative directive that antitrust recoveries shall fund future antitrust investigation and litigation. The subsequent enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4 cannot fairly be regarded as evidencing a new and different legislative intent concerning antitrust enforcement. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:46-4 is part of the Criminal Code; the generality of its purpose and language should not prevail over the particularized mandate of the Antitrust Act. <em>Cf. In re Salaries Probation Officers Hudson Cty., </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363 (App.Div.), certif. den. 78 <em>N.J. </em>339 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Since the fines levied here were \u201cderived from litigation instituted by the Attorney General under [the Antitrust Act],\u201d they are to be transferred to the State for the \u201crevolving fund.\u201d The fact that defendants pleaded guilty to an offense under the Solid Waste Utility Control Act is of no significance. The litigation was not only instituted under the Antitrust Act, but was litigated as such up to the entry of the pleas; the defendants pleaded under the Solid Waste Utility Control Act to offenses of the same nature as those charged under the Antitrust Act; it was only the presence of the \u201cinterdict\u201d provision of the Antitrust Act that caused the parties to avail themselves of the parallel provisions of the Solid Waste Utility Control Act. We see no reason to elevate form over substance. The reality is that the fines were derived from a litigation instituted and conducted by the Attorney General under the Antitrust Act. For the reasons set forth, those fines should be turned over to the State for the \u201crevolving fund\u201d established under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The order of September 13, 1983 is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of an appropriate order in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The penalties provided by the Solid Waste Utility Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:13A-12(a), and the Antitrust Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-11(a), are comparable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-11(b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">b.
