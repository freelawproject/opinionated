Wyman, </em>Attorney General, <em>Warren E. Waters, </em>Deputy Attorney General, and <em>Dort S.

H. 287, 291. \u201cUnless the facts recited in the petition are limited to those within the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge, they cannot be properly evaluated either by the solicitor in exercising his discretion or by the Court in determining the reasonableness with which that discretion has been exercised.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We deem it advisable, because uncertainty may exist in future cases of this character, to consider other points raised in the motion to dismiss. In the instant case the petition was signed by an Assistant Attorney General and joined in by the solicitor. Such execution was a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The Warden of the State Prison is required to \u201csafely keep\u201d all convicts committed to his custody \u201cuntil discharged according to law.\u201d RSA 622:7. We are of the view that it was within his implied authority and a reasonable course of conduct to ascertain if this prisoner, prior to release, was safe to be at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">It was not improper to receive evidence of the defendant\u2019s sexual deviations which occurred prior to the passage of the act. See RSA 173:5 III. \u201cThe discretionary inquiry under which the defendant was committed (section 3 II) is not retrospective merely because it considers the past history of the person involved.\u201d <em>In re Moulton, </em>96 N. H. 370, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The petition is dismissed without prejudice to new proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
