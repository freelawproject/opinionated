H. 243, 244; <em>Ricker\u2019s Petition, </em>66 N. H. 207, 211. In the exercise of this power this court has the obligation to make appropriate disciplinary orders \u201cfor the protection of the public, as well as for the maintenance of public confidence in the bar as a whole.\u201d <em>Welanko\u2019s Case, </em>99 N. H. 413, 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Although the respondent is presumed innocent until he has been proved guilty of the criminal charges pending against him, his right to continue the practice of law in the interim is not in the public interest. <em>Delano\u2019s Case, </em>58 N. H. 5, 6; <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>98 N. H. 324, 327; anno. 76 A. L. R. 674. While the respondent indicates that he will not practice law during that time, the public is entitled to an order that he shall not. Accordingly, the respondent is immediately and indefinitely suspended from the practice of law pending further order of this court and the prayer of the petition for disbarment (RSA 311:8) will be held in abeyance pending final adjudication of the criminal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
