The board here states that in reaching its decision it gave \u201cdue consideration ... to the diminution of value of surrounding properties, the benefit to the public interest, the unnecessary hardship involved, the justice to be done,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>and that \u201cits decision was not contrary to the spirit of the ordinance.\u201d The plaintiffs do not deny that such consideration was given although they dispute the conclusions reached. The board also took a view of the area before issuing a permit to the defendants but no view was requested of or taken by the Court. This view by the board may have \u201cfurnished a vital part of the evidence\u201d upon which its decision was based. <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>97 N. H. 248, 251, and authority cited. The record discloses that numerous variances including a garage, filling station, ice cream stand and a monument company are already established in the same zoning district. The board before issuing the permit considered all the requirements necessary to warrant the granting of a variance <em>(Gelinas </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, supra, </em>250) and found that they all existed. We believe on the entire record that the board granted a variance rather than a special exception (see <em>Jadda </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>100 N. H. 150, 152) and its action was not shown to be \u201cunreasonable or unlawful.\u201d RSA 31:78.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The question actually before the Superior Court was the effect of s. 43 (f) of the ordinance of the defendant city dealing with the requirement of the consent of the adjoining land owners and the testimony introduced at that hearing bore on that issue. In these circumstances and in the absence of a view by the Court, we do not believe there was sufficient evidence before it to warrant overturning the board\u2019s finding that cause for a variance existed in the face of RSA 31:78. See <em>Jadda </em>v. <em>Manchester, supra. </em>It follows the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-7\">Wheeler, J., took no part in the decision; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
