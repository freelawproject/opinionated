H. 138, 142. See <em>Canaan </em>v. <em>District, </em>74 N. H. 517; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>76 N. H. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The problem of the Legislature in selecting the proper subjects for taxation is a difficult one <em>(Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N. H. 561, 570, 575) since such selection produces an unequal distribution of the tax burden. But this inequality does not defeat that power since it is the result of every classification. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn the selective process of classifying certain property for taxation and exempting other property the Legislature has a wide discretion which will be sustained \u2018provided just reasons exist for the selection made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N. H. 548, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Just reason for excluding the personal property described by the bill from the classification of taxable stock-in-trade may be thought to exist because the excluded property includes goods in interstate commerce and goods temporarily warehoused within the state for not more than nine months which are types of property frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>classified in other states as nontaxable. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N. H. 548, 551; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>97 N. H. 533, 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In our opinion House Bill No. 402 does not conflict with our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Frank R. Kenison,</p>\n<p id=\"AQS\">Laurence I.
