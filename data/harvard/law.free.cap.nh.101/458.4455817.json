In determining jurisdiction some confusion exists between situations where the charge may be abandonment of the wife or children on the one hand and the offense of nonsupporfc on the other. It is the general rule that jurisdiction is in the courts of the place in which the offense was committed; but it is also generally held that nonsupport is a continuing offense which can occur at the place where the wife or children live, at the father\u2019s residence or at both. On the other hand abandonment or desertion, as distinguished from nonsupport, is a single occurrence which generally occurs at one definite place. See anno. 44 A. L. R. (2d) 887, 892; 22 C. J. S., Criminal Law, s. 136(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u201cThe offender is here, within our jurisdiction. While residing here he ought to make provision for the support of his wife and minor children, whether they are here or elsewhere. If he fails to do this, his neglect of duty occurs here, without reference to a place where the proper performance of his duty would confer benefits.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acker, </em>197 Mass. 91, 93; see <em>In re Alexander, </em>42 Del. 461, 469. The Keene municipal court has jurisdiction. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Tetreault, </em>97 N. H. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
