In support of these exceptions, he points out that there was no evidence that at the time of Mrs. Lyman\u2019s conveyance of the defendant\u2019s land there were any cabins on the tract on the east side of the highway which she then retained; and that the only evidence with respect to such cabins was the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ant\u2019s testimony, introduced by the plaintiff, that these cabins were erected in 1940 or 1941, which was after Mrs. Lyman had sold all of her holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">While the record tends to support this contention by the defendant the order of the Trial Court is not to be set aside for that reason. Under the circumstances surrounding the transaction including the restriction with respect to a filling station and the provision for a \u201cfirst refusal\u201d in case of resale, the Court properly concluded that the restrictions were imposed for the benefit of the property which Mrs. Lyman retained. Mt. Prospect Lodge is situated close by the highway. Mrs. Lyman saw fit to retain ownership of the land immediately across from the lodge, and to impose restrictions upon what she conveyed, designed to prevent the erection of any filling station within three hundred feet south of the \u201cnortherly point\u201d of the land conveyed, and of any \u201covernight cabins\u201d short of two hundred feet from the highway over the entire frontage of several hundred feet to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Whether the restrictions were imposed because the grantor thought that preservation of the prominence of her hotel would serve to attract a larger clientele than might otherwise be the case, or whether she contemplated at some time erecting cabins or other | structures across the street from it, which might be less attractive i or profitable because of cabins or a filling station to the south,! her reasons for imposing the restrictions are not determinative of the rights of the parties. The essential finding that the restrictions were imposed for the benefit of the grantor\u2019s remaining land was properly made by the Trial Court. II American Law of Property 417. Restatement, Property, s. 544, <em>comment </em>(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The restrictions were necessarily binding upon the immediate grantees. The primary issue is whether the restriction respecting the erection of cabins may be enforced by the plaintiff as a subsequent owner of land intended to be benefited. In granting the relief sought by the plaintiff, the Court ruled that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Since the deed to the defendant included the restriction in question, his rights are plainly subject to it. While not in the form of a covenant on his part, the restriction is enforceable in equity by a party entitled to its benefit. <em>Pratte </em>v. <em>Balatsos, </em>99 N. H. 430, 433. The plaintiff is admittedly a successor in interest to Mrs. Lyman. Since there is no evidence that the restriction was for the benefit of any one part of the land retained, more than any other, the plaintiff is entitled to enforce it with respect to the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>which he now owns. Restatement, Property, s. 551. 3 Tiffany, Real Property (3rd <em>ed.) s. </em>865. It must be taken to have \u201ctouched and concerned\u201d every part of the land retained by Mrs. Lyman. The benefit will run with the land, if not at law, at least in equity. <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>48 N. H. 475, 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In urging that the plaintiff is not entitled to enforce the restriction the defendant relies upon the absence of requirements laid down in <em>Nashua Hospital </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>85 N. H. 335, 339, for the creation of reciprocal rights among grantees of lots constituting a part of a general scheme of development. Such rights are not sought to be established in the pending action. On the contrary wo are here concerned merely with the enforcement of the benefit of a restriction to which the defendant\u2019s rights are admittedly subject, by a successor in title to land intended to be benefited. Enforcement of such a right in equity is clearly permissible. <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>supra; <em>Bauby </em>v. <em>Krasow, </em>107 Conn. 109. See 14 Am. Jur., Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions, <em>s. </em>314; 26 C. J. S., Deeds, <em>pp. </em>1140-1142. The Court therefore did not err in ruling that it may be enforced by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In concluding that the restriction may be enforced by the plaintiff, the Trial Court reached the only conclusion of which the evidence fairly admits. <em>Bauby </em>v. <em>Krasow, supra, </em>115. If it was error to find that the restriction was designed to protect cabins on the northerly lot because no such cabins existed or were shown to have been planned, the error was harmless. Regardless of the exact purpose behind it, the restriction was patently intended to benefit the land retained. The right to the benefit as to the northerly tract now belongs to the plaintiff and may be enforced by him if the restriction has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The defendant contends that it has not. On any construction of the term \u201covernight cabins,\u201d he maintains, his motel is not within the restriction. In this connection the Trial Court ruled that it is \u201cthe real character of the building that should be considered rather than its name.\u201d He found that the defendant\u2019s building is used in competition with overnight cabins, that it provides the same accommodations, attracts the same trade, and that the \u201cfact that the units are joined together under one roof does not change their essential character.\u201d These findings and rulings are sustainable upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The words \u201covernight cabins\u201d were not words of art, and the question is what the parties intended by them. It seems plain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Mrs. Lyman intended to prevent the erection of structures designed for use by motorists for overnight sleeping quarters which could properly be regarded as \u201ccabins,\u201d or \u201csmall houses.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2nd <em>ed.) p. </em>370. The quarters provided by the defendant\u2019s motel could reasonably be found to answer that description. <em>Cf. Gillis </em>v. <em>Bailey, 17 </em>N. H. 18, 21. The fact that the roof extended to more than one \u201csmall house\u201d or that there were common walls between such \u201chouses\u201d did not make them any less \u201ccabins,\u201d or the structure any more an apartment house, or \u201cmodern development of an inn or hotel without the service of meals\u201d as the defendant describes it. A \u201cmotel\u201d may reasonably be considered to be a building which \u201cmerely furnishes the transient guest with sleeping quarters and bath and toilet facilities, with linen service and a place to park his car.\u201d <em>Van Der Heide </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>123 N. Y. S.(2d) 726, 730. These are likewise the essential characteristics of \u201covernight cabins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The defendant moved to dismiss upon the ground that there was no evidence that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction or an order for removal of the structure, and upon the ground that the evidence conclusively established that he was not. The order of the Trial Court appears to rest upon the findings that the defendant\u2019s motel obstructs the view of the plaintiff\u2019s cabins which is available to northbound tourists. While the bill alleged serious depreciation in the value of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and irreparable damages, the record contains no evidence bearing upon the former allegation, and the latter appears to find its chief support, apart from the view and the photographs in evidence, in the testimony drawn from the defendant that in the cabin business it is desirable that the property be \u201cseen as far away as possible on the travelled way\u201d and that the view of the plaintiff\u2019s cabins is \u201cpartially\u201d obstructed by the motel. The defendant\u2019s exceptions raise the issue of whether the relief sought should have been denied as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">It has long been settled that injunctive relief is one of \u201cthe peculiar and extraordinary powers\u201d of equity <em>(Bassett </em>v. <em>Company, </em>47 N. H. 426, 437) exercised only when warranted by \u201cimminent danger of great and irreparable damage.\u201d <em>Wason </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>45 N. H. 169, 171. \u201cHardship [upon the defendant] may be a sufficient ground for withholding specific relief\u201d <em>(Manchester Dairy System </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>82 N. H. 193, 206) and \u201ctheoretical injury . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>does not furnish ground for interposition by injunction.\u201d <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Craddock, </em>66 N. H. 593, 595. See <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>64 N H. 572; Restatement, Property, <em>ss. </em>561-564; Torts, s. 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">No express finding was made upon the issue of whether the injunctive relief granted \u201cwould be equitable in view of all the circumstances of the particular case\u201d <em>(Manchester Dairy System </em>v. <em>Hayward, supra, </em>207; <em>Dunfey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Enwright, </em>101 N. H. 195, 198) although the record warranted a finding that it would be. A finding to that effect would ordinarily be implied, in the absence of indication that it was not in fact made. <em>Cf. Hatch </em>v. <em>Hillsgrove, </em>83 N. H. 91, 98. However in view of the evident hardship which the mandatory injunction will impose upon the defendant, the absence of an express finding by the Court and of any substantial consideration at the trial of the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s damage raises doubt as to whether the necessary supporting finding was intended to be implied. We consider that justice requires opportunity to be afforded for clarification of the issue, and leave will accordingly be granted the parties to apply for a finding with respect to it. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Hillsgrove, supra. </em>If the order for removal is found inequitable under all the circumstances, the petition should be dismissed. If found to \u201csubserve the ends of justice\u201d <em>(Eaton </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>64 N. H. 493, 498), the injunction will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled nisi.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
