H. 480; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Company, 78 </em>N. H. 433, 436. Without detailing the evidence, it appears there was testimony that the road would be of value in fire fighting, that it would be used by the selectmen in getting to the property for the purpose of assessing it, that the power company would use it in reaching their lines, and that persons wishing to get out timber on property remote from the road would also find it both convenient and necessary. There was substantial evidence that the proposed road was the only practical route to this section of the area. In addition to this, the selectmen and the county commissioners took a view which may have furnished a vital part of the evidence. <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>Portsmouth, </em>97 N. H. 248, 251, and cases cited. True, there was sharply conflicting testimony, but the contradictions and the weight of the evidence were for the \u201csole determination\u201d of the commissioners in the absence of fraud or gross mistake. <em>Waisman </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>96 N. H. 50, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">To overturn the commissioners\u2019 findings, it is not enough that this court might have reached a different result. See <em>Sinkevich </em>v. <em>Nashua, </em>97 N. H. 262, 265. Considering the record as a whole, we cannot say that the commissioners made a gross mistake in reaching the conclusion that a public need or occasion for the way existed. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mason, 78 </em>N. H. 148, 149. It follows the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the finding that there was occasion for laying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>out the road is overruled. <em>Waisman </em>v. <em>Manchester, supra; Opinion of the Justices, </em>98 N. H. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In regard to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the issue of damages we are confronted with the familiar question of whether the finding was such as no reasonable person could make. In the light of the record as a whole, including the fact that the selectmen and county commissioners each took a view of the disputed premises, we cannot say that the finding was clearly unreasonable or that there was error in the Trial Court\u2019s acceptance of the report. It follows the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
