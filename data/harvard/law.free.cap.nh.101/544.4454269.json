The question assumes that in those towns where the Municipal Budget Law (RSA ch. 32) is in force the total amount appropriated at the meeting would not exceed the limitations therein provided. RSA 32:8, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The answer to this inquiry is in the negative, that is, a town could be authorized to so vote without violating the Constitution or the constitutional rights of any taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Towns have only such powers as are granted to them by the State. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>North Hampton, </em>98 N. H. 193, 197. They are bound by the limits imposed upon them by the Legislature from whom they derive their powers. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Beals, </em>98 N. H. 461, 466; <em>State v. Goffstown, 100 </em>N. H. 131, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">RSA 31:4 provides that \u201cTowns may at any legal meeting grant and vote such sums of money as they judge necessary for the following purposes.\u201d We are assuming in our answer that the object of the proposed appropriation is one that is duly authorized and that other applicable statutory provisions have been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">RSA 39:2 provides that \u201cThe subject matter of all business to be acted upon at the town meeting shall be distinctly stated in the warrant, and nothing done at any meeting . . . shall be valid unless the subject thereof is so stated.\u201d It has long been the law of this state that the purpose of this requirement \u201cis to inform the inhabitants of the business upon which they are called to act in the meeting, \u2014 \u2018to bring before the town substantially and intelligently the subject with which it has to deal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>62 N. H. 135, 158; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>7 N. H. 113, 125, 126. If the proposed bill were enacted the amendment itself would inform interested persons that the meeting might lawfully appropriate a sum larger than that specified by the warrant. It is our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>opinion that it may be provided by statute that the specific sum of money called for by the warrant can be increased-by the vote of the town without violating the Constitution or the constitutional rights of taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Frank R.
