The record discloses that the defendant\u2019s attorney testified that an agreement had been reached, which opposing counsel and his client unequivocally denied. The defendant\u2019s attorney stresses the fact that he wrote plaintiff\u2019s counsel a letter \u201cin confirmation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>of the alleged agreement, setting forth its terms, to which he received no written reply. While this evidence was entitled to consideration, it was by no means conclusive in the face of the record as a whole, especially in view of plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cwithin two or three days\u201d of the receipt of this letter he telephoned defendant\u2019s attorney and told him no agreement had been made. The sharp conflict in testimony was plainly for the Court to resolve. <em>Clover &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith Co., </em>96 N. H. 491, 493.
