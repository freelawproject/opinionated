H. 577, 579. Accordingly, it was held in the cited case that an action to recover for the death of a three-year-old child trespasser, based on common-law negligence, could not be maintained. The Court said \u201cthe fact that the person who suffered, injury and death was an infant, child does not change the question, nor create a liability . .where none would have existed ... to an adult person under similar circumstances.\u201d Shortly thereafter the Court declined to follow the \u201cattractive nuisance\u201d doctrine and denied recovery on behalf of a seven-year-old child injured upon a railroad turn-table. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>64 N. H. 220. See also, <em>Devost </em>v. <em>Company, </em>79 N. H. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In <em>Burrill </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>75 N. H. 554, 555, the general rule regarding the liability of landowners to trespassers was stated to be that landowners \u201care not liable unless the injury is caused intentionally\u201d and \u201cwhen the defendant is not present and acting at the time, he is under no liability to the trespasser on account of the mere condition of his premises.\u201d At the same time, however, it was recognized that liability to a known trespasser might also arise from active intervention on the part of the landowner. <em>Buch </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Company, </em>69 N. H. 257; <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Company, </em>75 N. H. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Relying upon these and other decisions, the defendant in the case before us maintains that no claim is here made of active intervention and that these actions may not be maintained. Neither the plaintiffs\u2019 writs nor the opening statement contain any allegation that the hole through which the minor child fell was created or uncovered by the defendant after it had notice that children had been trespassing upon its premises. Such evidence if presented might be thought to support a claim of active intervention for which an action could be maintained. See <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>Company, </em>80 N. H. 45, 49; James, Tort Liability, 63 Yale L. J. 144, 176. The question is squarely presented whether the defendant may properly be found liable for failure to take reasonable precaution to prevent injury to small children in case of recurrence of the trespasses of which it was alleged to have had notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The governing principles were stated in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Company, </em>85 N. H. 449: \u201cIn general, when the danger is great and the wrongful conduct of the injured person is not serious, it is reasonable for the law to find a relationship and to impose a duty of protection. A defendant in his own interest causing . . . dangerous conditions to exist should reasonably protect those likely to be exposed to them and not reasonably in fault for the exposure.\u201d <em>Id., </em>453. The rule applicable here was stated thus: \u201cThe duty not to carelessly intervene against known trespassers is not doubtful, and known trespassers include those whose presence should in reason be anticipated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>452. See also, <em>Lawrence </em>v. Company, 90 N. H. 27, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Our decisions since <em>Hobbs </em>v. <em>Company, supra, </em>dealing with liability for active intervention have broadened the rule to the point where the landowner \u201cmay not carelessly cause force to be exerted against [a known trespasser] either by active or passive conduct\u201d <em>(Castonguay </em>v. <em>Company, </em>83 N. H. 1, 6); and failure to halt an active force already in motion, may constitute active intervention as well as the act of setting such a force in motion. <em>Id.; Dillon </em>v. Company, <em>supra; Smith </em>v. Railroad, 87 N. H. 246, 252; <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>Company, supra. </em>See <em>Public Service Co. </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>123 F. (2d) 2, 5; 2 Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts, <em>s. </em>27.6, <em>pp. </em>1463, 1464. But this is the extent to which our cases go, and the case before us does not fall within them. No active force within the control of the defendant is claimed to have caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. It resulted from the natural force of gravity, and there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>no indication that the plaintiff was misled by any deceptive condition maintained by the defendant for which it may be held accountable. <em>Cf. Chase </em>v. <em>Luce, </em>239 Minn. 364; <em>Puchta </em>v. <em>Rothman, </em>99 Cal. App. (2d) 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">After the decision of most of our cases dealing with injury to infant trespassers, the law regarding the owners\u2019 liability in such cases was formulated in the Restatement of the Law of Torts, <em>s. </em>339, which has received growing support. Prosser, Torts (2nd <em>ed.) </em>440; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Rehbein, </em>123 Conn. 110; <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Company, </em>248 Wis. 132. Even if the rule of the Restatement were to be applied, it would not permit recovery by the plaintiff in this case. \u201cThere are some dangers . . . which any child of sufficient age to be allowed at large may be expected to understand and appreciate \u2014 such as the usual risks ... of falling from a height <em>. ... \u201d </em>Prosser, <em>supra, </em>441, 442. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>195 Ark. 535. The requirement of s. 339 that \"the utility .... of maintaining the condition [must be] slight as compared to the risk to young children involved therein,\u201d contemplates that \u201cthere must have been a reasonably feasible way to remove the danger\u201d (2 Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts, 1458), and reflects the view that precautions are not to be required which would unreasonably interfere with the landowner\u2019s rights of user of his property. This principle may be thought to underlie the numerous decisions almost universally denying recovery to infant trespassers injured in buildings under construction. See anno. 44 A. L. R. (2d) 1253. No reason is apparent why it should not likewise apply to the use, presumably in demolition of the building in question, which the defendant was making both of the building itself and of the hole through which the plaintiff fell. \u201cSurely, it would be an intolerable burden to require a landowner \u2018to guard eveiy stairway, cellarway, retaining wall, shed, tree and open window on his premises, so that a child cannot climb to a precipitous place and fall off.\u2019 \u201d James, Tort Liability, <em>supra, </em>63 Yale L. J. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s case fails for want of evidence of active intervention on the part of the defendant which would subject it to liability to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Decision of the issue raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 exception turns primarily upon the extent of the defendant\u2019s duty and not upon classification of the minor plaintiff as a trespasser or licensee. Whether he was upon the defendant\u2019s premises wrongfully, or whether he was there without fault on his part, as the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>assert, no claim is made that he was there by permission. His status is material only as one of the circumstances bearing upon whether the defendant should have anticipated his presence. See <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>Company, </em>80 N. H. 45, <em>supra, </em>50; James, Tort Liability, <em>supra, </em>63 Yale L. J. 181-2. The facts stated in the opening statement would not warrant a finding of a breach of any duty owed by the defendant, and the nonsuits were properly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In view of the conclusion reached, if it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the pleadings, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
