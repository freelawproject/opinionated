II, <em>Art. </em>9th. gee 28 N. H. Manual for the General Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>(1943) 429, 430. Pursuant to other changes then made in Article 9th, the Constitution now further provides that every ten years after 1951 the Legislature shall make an apportionment of representatives so that the \u201cnumber of inhabitants necessary to entitle any town or ward to representatives additional to the first shall be for each additional representative twice the number of inhabitants required for the first representative <em>. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Article 11th was also amended in 1942 so that if now provides that the Legislature shall authorize \u201cany town or ward [having] less than the number of inhabitants necessary to entitle [it] to one representative\u201d to send a representative \u201csuch proportionate part of the time as the number of its inhabitants shall bear to the requisite number established for one representative and without such authority no town or ward shall send a representative; <em>provided, however, </em>that each town and ward shall be entitled to representation in at least one session in every ten years.\u201d Const., Pt. II, <em>Art. </em>11th. See Laws 1951, c. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It is clear that the provisions of Articles 9th and 11th in their present form preclude legislative provision for representation of every town and ward at \u00e9very session of the Legislature, which is the apparent purpose of Senate Bill No. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Following the Constitutional Convention of 1948, a proposed amendment of Article 9th which would have provided for representation of each town and ward at each session failed of adoption by vote of the people. 31 N. H. Manual (1949) 621. Plainly, the Legislature may not by enactment of Senate Bill No. 98 effect a formula for representation which the people refused in 1948 to sanction by constitutional amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The bill would not, as has been suggested by memorandum, establish a \u201cbench mark\u201d of fifteen hundred inhabitants for one representative. On the contrary, it would require no fixed number of inhabitants, because it would provide for representation of any town the inhabitants of which numbered fifteen hundred \u201cor less.\u201d <em>S. </em>1. <em>Cf. </em>Laws 1951, c. 247, <em>supra, s. </em>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">While directing that each town and ward shall be represented \u201cin at least one session in every ten years,\u201d Article 11th leaves no ambiguity with respect to the question of whether each town and ward shall be entitled to representation at each session. It definitely provides that they shall not. If the number of inhabitants is less than the number necessary to entitle a town or ward to one representative, it is entitled to representation a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>proportionate part of the time only, but never less than one session in every ten years. Dishman, \u201cA New Constitution for New Hampshire?\u201d (Governmental Series No. 6, Univ. of N. H., April 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Although the first question is answered in the affirmative\u2019, your next inquiry would seem to be whether there is \u201cany method by which the general court may so apportion the representatives so that each town and ward shall have at least one representative in each session.\u201d The answer to this question is \u201cno.\u201d The authority of the Legislature is limited to that conferred by Article 11th, which specifically provides that without authority from the Legislature \u201cno town or ward shall send a representative.\u201d The latter mandate is qualified by the proviso that each town and ward shall be entitled to \u201crepresentation in at least one session in every ten years,\u201d but this confers no authority to provide for representation of each town and ward at each session.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Your third inquiry would seem to arise if the first question is answered in the negative, rather than in the affirmative as the third question literally provides. Section 3 of the bill provides that it shall take effect as law \u201cfor the election of representatives for the 1963 session of the general court.\u201d Your third question is whether the general court can \u201capportion the representatives at the present session or at the 1959 session.\u201d The question must be assumed to relate to a reapportionment such as is contemplated by Senate Bill No. 98. Const., Pt. II, <em>Art. </em>74th; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>98 N. H. 537. Since such a reapportionment may not constitutionally be made, it follows that the third question is answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In summary, it is our opinion that Senate Bill No. 98 would be unconstitutional if enacted, and that the Legislature may not constitutionally provide that each town and ward shall have at least one representative in each session, whether it undertakes to do so at this or any ensuing session.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Frank.
