It lost sight entirely of that part of the procedure which related to proof, and sacrificed everything for a scientific system of allegations.\u2019 24 Harv. L. Rev. 290, 294. In the light of modern conditions any complaint or indictment should be considered adequate if it informs the defendant \u2018of the nature and cause of the accusation with sufficient definiteness\u2019 so that he can prepare for trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rousten, </em>84 N. H. 140, 142, 143; <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>97 N. H. 141, 146. The defendant contends that the words \u201cfeloniously incite, move, procure and counsel\u201d are general accusations and insufficient to properly prepare him to meet such proof as may be offered by the State. It is almost universally held that an indictment of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>accessory to a crime does not require that the means and specific facts by which the alleged accessory procured, aided and abetted in the commission thereof be set forth. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U. S. 432; 27 Am. Jur., Indictments and Informations, s. 97, <em>p. </em>657. A defendant is not entitled in an indictment to information as to how the State is to prove its case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>95 N. H. 217, 220; <em>State </em>v. <em>Twarog, </em>97 N. H. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The defendant further contends the indictment is defective because it contains no averment of time. The indictments charge the principal with committing the offenses on December 29, 1956, at Portsmouth and after reciting the charge against the principal conclude with these words \u201cand the Grand Jurors . . . further present that Kenneth W. Ball of Portsmouth, in said County, at Portsmouth, did feloniously incite, move, procure and counsel him, the said [principal], the said felony to do and commit <em>. \u201d </em>The \u201csaid felony\u201d was averred to have been committed on a day certain prior to returning the indictment. The plain import of the indictment is that the offense of the accessory was committed prior to commission of the principal crime and prior to the finding of the indictment. It is therefore sufficient. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>14 N. H. 456, 458; <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>70 N. H. 330. Under the better practice however, the indictment should allege a date or dates when the offense is charged to have been committed and that it occurred prior to commission of the principal crime.
