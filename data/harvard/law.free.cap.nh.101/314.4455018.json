The plaintiff contends that the sheriff\u2019s return of service, which was regular on its face, is conclusive and its truthfulness cannot be controverted by the defendant. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Bradstreet, </em>99 N. H. 55. The defendant contends that the sheriff\u2019s return is not an absolute verity and that the sheriff\u2019s return is not so far conclusive that he is precluded from showing his nonresidence in fact. Superior Court Rule 45, 99 N. H. 614; <em>Galusha </em>v. <em>Cobleigh, </em>13 N. H. 79; <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Mugridge, </em>19 N. H. 109; anno. 107 A. L. R. 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The ancient common-law rule that a sheriff\u2019s return is conclusive has been retained in New Hampshire <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Bradstreet, supra) </em>and a dwindling minority of jurisdictions (49 Col. L. Rev. 136, 137) but this rule is not a Draconian net engulfing all cases. The \u201crule is not an inflexible one.\u201d <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>85 N. H. 548, 549. The fundamental inquiry relates to the service of the writ in fact and not the sheriff\u2019s return of service. This was demonstrated in <em>Bissonnette </em>v. <em>Alpine, Inc., </em>96 N. H. 419, 420: \u201cIt is not the return, however, but the service of the writ, that gives jurisdiction. The return is merely evidence by which the court is informed that the defendant has been served.\u201d In that case a defective sheriff\u2019s return was held to have conferred jurisdiction when supplemented by other evidence showing that service \u201cwas in fact made on\u201d the defendant. See also, <em>Mathes </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>62 N. H. 491; <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>63 N. H. 111, 112. The New Hampshire cases relied upon by the defendant allowing a party to show non-residence are supported by Restatement of the Law, Second (tentative draft no. 3, 1956), Conflict of Laws, s. 77, <em>comment </em>d: <em>\u201cEffect of sheriff\u2019s return. </em>A state does not have judiciaf jurisdiction over an individual because a sheriff or other official of the state makes a return stating that he has served him with process in the state. Personal service in the state, and not the sheriff\u2019s return, is the basis of jurisdiction. The truth of the return may therefore be questioned in a court of any state.\u201d To the same effect see Restatement, Conflict of Laws, <em>s. </em>77, <em>comment </em>a.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">If this were a case of first impression, consideration would be given to the classic criticism of the common-law rule in Sunderland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The Sheriff\u2019s Return, 16 Col. L. Rev. 281, and the many cases which consider the rule archaic and unsound. <em>Vaughn </em>v. <em>Love, </em>324 Pa. 276. However this is unnecessary since our cases allow the defendant to show nonresidence. In <em>Galusha </em>v. <em>Cobleigh, </em>13 N. H. 79, 83, it was said that the \u201cplaintiff is not estopped by the officer\u2019s return from showing his true residence at the time of service.\u201d Likewise in <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Mugridge, </em>19 N. H. 109, 113, the defendant was allowed to prove his nonresidence in New Hampshire with the court saying that \u201cWe think such evidence cannot be regarded as contradicting the officer\u2019s return.\u201d We do not pause to consider the clarity of this observation since the result of the case is to allow the controversy to be decided on fact rather than fiction. These cases and Superior Court Rule 45, 99 N. H. 614, are adequate authority for holding that the defendant was entitled to introduce evidence that he was a resident of Connecticut and a nonresident of New Hampshire at the time of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Although the defendant\u2019s evidence of nonresidence was admissible, it does not follow that the Court was thereby required to grant his motion to dismiss. The record only discloses the motion to dismiss and the affidavit in support thereof. It fails to indicate that the Trial Court has committed error or has abused its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss. <em>LaMarre </em>v. <em>LaMarre, </em>84 N. H. 553; <em>Vidal </em>v. <em>Errol, </em>86 N. H. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
