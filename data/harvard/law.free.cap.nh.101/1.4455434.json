Counsel however proceeded to inquire of the witness concerning \u201ca picture taken of [plaintiff\u2019s] left arm.\u201d The witness testified that he was with the plaintiff when a photograph was taken, and his answer to the question \u201cIs that it?\u201d was then excluded, on objection, after plaintiff\u2019s counsel had stated that the photograph was \u201can enlarged picture.\u201d The photograph was thereupon marked for identification and was later received in evidence in the course of direct examination of the plaintiff. No prejudicial error can be found in what thus transpired. The question concerning the lay witness\u2019 personal knowledge \u201cof the condition of some part of [the plaintiff\u2019s] body,\u201d in the form in which asked, appeared to call for expert testimony by a witness not shown to be qualified. The photograph which the same witness was not permitted to identify was later identified by the plaintiff himself, and received in evidence. The plaintiff's exceptions to these rulings of the Trial Court are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The plaintiff later objected to questions put to the same witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>on cross-examination as to whether the witness could have controlled the horse which the plaintiff had been driving \u201cbetter if [he] were leading him by the halter\u201d than if he had tried to stop him by pulling on the reins. Subject to exception, the witness was permitted to answer, and replied that he would have just as much control of \u201cthat horse,\u201d if he pulled on the reins. The testimony was admissible in the Court\u2019s discretion, and since it was favorable to the plaintiff rather than the defendant, it could not be considered ground for a new trial in any event. Other exceptions relating to the evidence are not of sufficient merit to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">The general exception to denial of the plaintiff\u2019s requests \u201cexcept in so far as they were covered by the charge\u201d presents no clear issue for determination here. Such an exception would be invalid in many jurisdictions (see <em>Peppin </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>86 N. H. 395, 401) and has not been regarded with favor here. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>95 N. H. 485, 490. It does not serve to call any specific error to the attention of the Trial Court in season for correction, and leaves the excepting party free after the trial to search for defects in the charge not previously thought significant. Accordingly, we hold such an exception to be insufficient to present any question for determination by this court. Counsel should have no difficulty in specifying at the trial, by number or other specific reference, any requests for instructions which they consider to have been denied. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>State, </em>94 N. H. 321, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The order in this case will be no different from the order which would have been entered had we held that the general exception was entitled to consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-6\">Wheeler, J., took no part in the decision; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
