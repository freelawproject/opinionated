Ct. 1203, and <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>77 S. Ct. 1173, both decided June 17, 1957, and has issued orders in No. 306 <em>Raley </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>77 S. Ct. 1391, and No. 206 Miscellaneous, <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>77 S. Ct. 1403, both dated June 24, 1957. Since the disposition of this case may be affected by these decisions and orders it is necessary in fairness to the parties that the case should be set for reargument. Accordingly, the case will be assigned for reargument by separate order of this court at a time therein indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
