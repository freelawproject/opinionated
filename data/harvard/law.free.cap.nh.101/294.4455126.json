It is admitted on the theory that the declarant is the agent of the other and the admissions of one are admissible against the other. <em>Delli Paoli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>352 U. S. 232, 237; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>94 N. H. 62, 63; McCormick on Evidence 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>However when, as is the case here, the common enterprise has come to an end, whether by accomplishment or abandonment, no subsequent declaration of a former conspirator will be attributed to another. A statement made under such circumstances constitutes a hearsay declaration which does not come within the orbit of any exception to the hearsay rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clapp, supra, </em>64; <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>49 N. H. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">The defendant having denied the veracity of the declarations made by his former co-conspirator when confronted with them, they could not constitute adoptive admissions (IV Wig. Ev. (3rd <em>ed.) s. </em>1071) and the question of their admissibility as such is not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The testimony of the State\u2019s only witness being inadmissible, the agreement is that the defendant shall be discharged and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\n<em>Complaint dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
