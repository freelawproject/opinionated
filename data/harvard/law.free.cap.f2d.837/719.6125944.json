WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1245-21\">Appellant, Shearn Moody, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order requiring Moody National Bank of Galveston to give Bankruptcy Trustee Smith at least 72 hours advance notice prior to any contemplated or actual distribution by the bank as trustee of funds from a spendthrift trust established by Mr. Moody\u2019s grandfather to appellant or his designated agent. We affirm the district court\u2019s notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-23\">On November 14, 1983, Shearn Moody, Jr. filed a voluntary Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The case was converted to a Chapter 11 proceeding on March 21, 1984, and a Chapter 11 trustee was appointed. Moody\u2019s bankruptcy case was then transferred to the Southern District of Texas, and appellee, W. Steve Smith, was appointed successor trustee. On June 28, 1985, Trustee Smith filed a complaint against Shearn Moody, Jr. and Moody National Bank of Galveston, trustee, seeking a determination of the rights of the parties under a spendthrift trust, including a turnover of funds received and to be received from this trust, an accounting, a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The trust at issue was created by Shearn Moody, Jr.\u2019s grandfather, the late W.L. Moody, Jr., on December 26, 1934. This trust has been held to be a spendthrift trust by both state and federal district courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No party disputes the spendthrift status of the trust. The provisions of this spendthrift trust require the trustee to pay over to the beneficiaries monthly the net amount of income and cash dividends received from the trust corpus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shearn Moody, Jr. is one of the trust\u2019s beneficiaries. He has a life estate in a pro rata share of all the net income and cash dividends derived from the trust corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">In his second amended complaint against Shearn Moody, Jr. and Moody National. Bank, Trustee Smith sought to recover from Mr. Moody the trust distributions made to him within the 180 day period subsequent to the filing of his bankruptcy petition on November 14, 1983. Smith claimed these distributions, which totaled $77,151.99,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(5)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the event Moody no longer had possession of these distributions, the trustee requested an equivalent amount plus interest from the trust distributions that had been escrowed pursuant to a previous court order<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or from the trust funds currently on deposit in the court\u2019s registry pursuant to another prior court order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-12\">Trustee Smith also sought a declaration that all trust distributions made to or for the benefit of Shearn Moody, Jr. after the filing of his bankruptcy petition were subject to various post-petition claims. The claims include Trustee Smith\u2019s claims for recovery of pre- and post-petition transfers and damages, claims of Moody\u2019s post-petition creditors, claims which were not discharged, and Trustee Smith\u2019s damages related to several of his suits against Moody, including the damages arising from his prosecution of Trustee\u2019s Motion for Enforcement and Trustee\u2019s Emergency Motion to Compel Turnover of Books and Records. Smith requested that a charge be placed on all existing, escrowed, and future trust distributions attributable to Moody\u2019s interest in the trust for the satisfaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>these claims and that the Bank be required to give Smith ten working days advance notice of the exact date, place, time and manner of each and every future trust distribution to Moody.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the event that the court declined to place a charge on Moody\u2019s existing, escrowed, and future trust distributions, Trustee Smith requested that Moody National Bank be directed to continue to deposit all of Moody\u2019s future distributions into the account established pursuant to the January 16, 1986, court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">On January 20,1987, appellee Smith filed a motion for summary judgment. The court granted this motion on March 2, 1987. In its order the district court held that the trust distributions made within the 180 day window following the filing of Shearn Moody, Jr.\u2019s bankruptcy petition were property of his bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(5)(A) despite the spendthrift provisions of the trust and the related statutory provision, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2). The court held that Moody had already converted these distributions, resulting in a diminution in the value of his bankruptcy estate, and further held that Trustee Smith could recover the December 15, 1983, and April 3, 1984, trust distributions from Moody, or their value, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550(a). The court also awarded Trustee Smith interest and costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, however, declined to place a charging order against the various past and future trust distributions to Moody. But the court did extend the January 16, 1986, order for a period of 60 days from the entry of the Order Granting Summary Judgment \u201cin order to give the [trustee] an opportunity to attempt to execute against distributions from [the trust] to the Defendant Debtor on deposit, and to be deposited, in the Defendant Debtor\u2019s account at the Defendant Bank for recovery of the [trustee\u2019s] <em>post-petition </em>claims against the Defendant Debtor, <em>including the summary judgment granted hereby.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">On April 16, 1987, Trustee Smith filed an Application for Writ of Garnishment against Moody National Bank, garnishee, to recover the $77,151.99 plus interest from Moody\u2019s escrowed trust distribution funds deposited in the bank pursuant to the January 16, 1986, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">The district court denied Trustee Smith\u2019s garnishment application, apparently finding that the trust funds on deposit at Moody National Bank were still protected from garnishment by the spendthrift provisions of the trust since the deposit of the funds by the bank into this account did not constitute receipt of the funds by Moody or his agent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court also dissolved the January 16, 1986, order prohibiting the distribution of trust funds to Shearn Moody, Jr. by Moody National Bank. The court, however, ordered that Moody National Bank give Trustee Smith and his attorney at least 72 hours prior written and oral notice of any contemplated or actual distribution by the bank of the spendthrift trust funds, including those presently escrowed and on deposit. The notification is \u201cto include the date and hour of such distribution, the method of transfer, the complete name and address of such addressee, desig-nee or transferee as well as the source of such instructions if other than those contained in the trust instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">The only issue before us is Shearn Moody, Jr.\u2019s appeal of this 72 hour notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">A beneficiary\u2019s interest in a spendthrift trust is excluded from his bankruptcy estate by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2), if state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>law and the trust so provide.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d 574, 580 (5th Cir.1983). Texas law and the trust in the case at bar do so provide.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In general, a spendthrift trust is one in which the right of the beneficiary to future payments of income or capital cannot be voluntarily transferred by the beneficiary or reached by his or her creditors. <em>In re Brooks, </em>60 B.R. 155, 159 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1986); <em>Hines v. Sands, </em>312 S.W.2d 275, 278 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Fort Worth 1958, no writ). Spendthrift trusts have long been held valid by Texas courts. <em>Hines v. Sands, </em>312 S.W.2d at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Unless the settlor creates the trust and makes himself beneficiary, the corpus and future income of a spendthrift trust in the hands of the trustee is not subject to execution or garnishment by the creditors of a beneficiary. Furthermore, income from a spendthrift trust which has already accrued in the hands of the trustee, but which has not yet been paid to the beneficiary, is also exempt from the claims of a beneficiary\u2019s creditors. <em>First Bank &amp; Trust v. Goss, </em>533 S.W.2d 93, 95 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1976, no writ); <em>Hines v. Sands, </em>312 S.W.2d at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">The exclusion of spendthrift trust income payments from a debtor's bankruptcy estate is tempered slightly by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(5)(A). Under that statutory provision, the income payments from a spendthrift trust which the beneficiary is entitled to receive or does receive within the 180 day period after the filing of the bankruptcy petition \u00e1re brought into the bankruptcy estate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(c)(2) does not prevent this \u201creaching forward.\u201d <em>In re Kragness, </em>58 B.R. 939, 944 (Bankr.D.Or.1986); <em>Matter of Hecht, </em>54 B.R. 379, 384 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1985), <em>affirmed sub nom, Togut v. Hecht, </em>69 B.R. 290 (S.D.N.Y.1987). This result is consistent with the theory of the spendthrift trust because once trust income is paid to the beneficiary the income so paid is no longer subject to the protection of the spendthrift provisions contained in the trust. <em>In re Kragness, </em>58 B.R. at 944; <em>Togut v. Hecht, </em>69 B.R. at 291. The Texas law on spendthrift trusts leads to the same result. Neither the Texas Trust Code nor the applicable common law undertake to protect trust property from the reach of a beneficiary\u2019s creditors once such property has been distributed to the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-15\">The corollary that necessarily must follow from this holding is that income distributions from a spendthrift trust that occur after the 180 day window of \u00a7 541(a)(5)(A) are not to be included in the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate and instead are part of the debtor\u2019s \u201cfresh start.\u201d As a result, such income distributions are free from the pre-petition claims of the debt- or/beneficiary\u2019s creditors or any other claims that may be discharged by the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-16\">Critical to this case, however, is the fact these later trust income distributions are subject to post-petition creditor claims and judgments, and claims not discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, a district court has jurisdiction to enforce judgments against property other than property of a bankruptcy estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>or property protected by the spendthrift provisions of a trust.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>In re Crabtree, </em>39 B.R. 702, 711 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1984). <em>See also Southmark Properties v. Charles House Corp., </em>742 F.2d 862, 868 (5th Cir.1984). The district court was exercising this power when it took the jurisdiction over Moody National Bank to require the bank to give the 72 hour advance notice. The bank was a defendant in this suit and was a party in interest in the main bankruptcy case of Shearn Moody, Jr. The jurisdiction of a district court sitting as a bankruptcy court is not limited to the property in the debtor\u2019s estate. The court has original jurisdiction of \u201call civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). This jurisdiction properly extends to an order in aid of collecting valid claims and judgments of the bankruptcy trustee against the beneficiary of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">.

No beneficiary shall be permitted to appoint any Agent or Attorney in Fact, except as specifically permitted by the Trustee, to collect or receive any part of the Trust Estate if the Agent or Attorney in Fact has directly or indirectly made any advances of money or other consideration to such beneficiary with the agreement or expectation of having the same recognized as a claim so as to collect or receive any part of the Trust Estate from the Trustee.
