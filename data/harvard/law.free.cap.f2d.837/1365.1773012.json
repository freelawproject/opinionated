He concedes that he deliberately falsified his prior employment term with defendant\u2019s predecessor, Rockwell, by two years and that he did not leave his former job with Rockwell for personal reasons, as he stated in his application, but was fired for unauthorized absences. Nor does he dispute that the application expressly provides that \u201cany misrepresentation by me on this form is sufficient excuse for rejection of my application....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">Instead his contention is that because the applications of several successful white applications for the machinist jobs likewise contained incorrect information, race must have been the reason why his was rejected. The district court concluded that these were \u201cmere errors, as distinguished from [the] material falsehoods found in the plaintiffs application,\u201d and we agree. Two of the applicants, for example, recited that they had applied for work with the defendant on earlier occasions, when in fact the application was to Rockwell, its predecessor; and another dates the applicant\u2019s military service as \u201cFrom July 1982 to August 1981,\u201d an obvious typographical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">As the district court recognized, such trifling errors raise no questions about the moral character of the applicants who made them and are of an entirely different order from McGee\u2019s admittedly deliberate and self-serving falsehoods, which most certainly do. Thus, there being a good and sufficient reason for the rejection of plaintiff's application and none for rejecting those of the other applicants, no evidence exists to support an inference of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">For this and the other reasons stated in the memorandum opinion of the district court, its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
