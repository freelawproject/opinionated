Plaintiffs filed and amended their complaint during the pendency of the appeal to this court in <em>Smith v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs of Mobile County, </em>827 F.2d 684 (11th Cir.1987). The district court (Judge W. Bre-vard Hand) found that \u201cthe issues sought to be litigated in this action are founded upon legal theories which, at the time this action was filed, were pending and due to be litigated in <em>Jaffree v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, </em>Civil Action No. 82-554-H, <em>sub nom. Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, </em>Civil Action No. 82-554-H, an action originally filed by these plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Jaffree v. Wallace, </em>No. 86-0515-BH (S.D. Ala. May 7, 1987). Thus, the court held that plaintiffs were \u201cestopped to file [or amend] a second action raising the same issues which they had the opportunity to litigate but chose to abandon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s order, asserting that (1) Judge Hand should have recused himself from considering this case, and (2) the doctrine of res judicata does not bar the present action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we perceive no error in the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions, we affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-15\">In 1982, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983, Ishmael Jaffree, one of the appellants in this action, sued on behalf of three of his minor children. He sought a declaratory judgment and injunction against the Mobile County School Board, various school officials, teachers, the Governor of Alabama, and the Alabama State Board of Education. Jaffree challenged classroom prayer activities and three Alabama statutes that allegedly violated the establishment and free exercise clauses of the first amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Douglas T. Smith, one of the appellees in this action, and others intervened in Jaffree\u2019s action, alleging that an injunction against religious activity in the public schools would violate their right to free exercise of religion. We need not recite in detail the full history of that case, which the parties label <em>\u201cJaffree I.\u201d See Jaffree v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>554 F.Supp. 1104, 1128 (S.D.Ala.1983), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part sub nom. Jaffree v. Wallace, </em>705 F.2d 1526 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Board of School Comm\u2019rs v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number><em>Jaffree, </em>466 U.S. 926, 104 S.Ct. 1707, 80 L.Ed.2d 181 (1984); <em>Jaffree v. James, </em>554 F.Supp. 1130, 1132 (S.D.Ala.1983), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part sub nom. Jaffree v. Wallace, </em>705 F.2d 1526 (11th Cir.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>472 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985), 466 U.S. 924, 104 S.Ct. 1704, 80 L.Ed.2d 178 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-4\">Upon remand for an assessment of costs and the enforcement of appropriate injunc-tive relief, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>realigned the parties by making Smith party-plaintiff, consolidated the cases, and invited the parties to submit briefs and to reopen the record for the presentation of additional evidence. The district court stated that Jaffree could withdraw if he felt that his position had been \u201cfully justified\u201d \u2014in which case the court would consider the question of attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 or he could remain in the litigation, in which event his motion for attorney\u2019s fees would be denied as premature. Jaffree did withdraw, and Smith filed a position statement which asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the curriculum in the Mobile County School System unconstitutionally advanced the religion of Humanism and unconstitutionally inhibited Christianity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-5\">Twelve parents of children enrolled in the Mobile County School System intervened as defendants to oppose Smith\u2019s request for injunctive and declaratory relief. Judge Hand then held a bench trial in October 1986. He found that the use of forty-four textbooks, which appeared on the Alabama State Approved Textbook List, violated the establishment clause of the first amendment; he permanently enjoined the use of these textbooks in Alabama public schools. On August 26, 1987, we reversed and remanded with directions. <em>Smith v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>827 F.2d 684 (11th Cir.), <em>rev\u2019g, </em>655 F.Supp. 939 (S.D.Ala.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-8\">The present action arose directly from circumstances surrounding <em>Jaffree I </em>and <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith. </em>Prior to the October 1986 bench trial in <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith, </em>defendants Governor Wallace and the Mobile County Board of School Commissioners separately agreed to entry of consent decrees in favor of Smith. They stipulated that the textbooks in question \u201cdemonstrated censorship of the existence, history, contributions, and roles of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Judasim ... in violation of the First Amendment\u201d, and they consented \u201cto the establishment of court-approved standards, criteria, or guidelines designed to protect the constitutional rights stipulated herein.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-9\">In May 1986 plaintiffs-appellants Ishmael Jaffree and his wife, a local school teacher, brought this action on behalf of their five minor children. They sought \u201cto enjoin the appellees from entering or executing agreements which would: (a) deny appellants\u2019 free speech rights ..., and equal protection rights ... and (b) establish religion in the public school classroom.\u201d They also sought a declaration that \u201csecular humanism is not a religion for establishment purposes and that it was not being promoted in the state\u2019s public schools.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1540-10\">Although plaintiffs originally filed their action with the Middle District of Alabama, Judge Myron Thompson transferred the case to Judge Hand in the Southern District of Alabama, noting that \u201c[t]he issues [plaintiff Jaffree] raises as a basis for seeking ... relief in this court are substantially similar to the issues now pending before that court.\u201d Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a motion to recuse, asserting that Judge Hand (1) exhibited undue partiality concerning the issues and (2) exhibited personal bias against Jaffree. The district court (Judge Hand) denied the motion to disqualify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>After filing their motion to recuse, plaintiffs attempted to amend their complaint by naming additional plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They also asserted that the State Board of Education had passed a resolution \u201con or about June 5. 1986, which promotes the religions of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Judaism, denies to the plaintiffs and some members of the classes they seek to represent, the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court held a hearing on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-5\">In May 1987 the district court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 case. This order came after the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith </em>(March 1987), yet before our decision to reverse on appeal (August 1987). <em>Smith v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>655 F.Supp. 939 (S.D.Ala.), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>827 F.2d 684 (11th Cir.1987). Upon dismissing the complaint,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the district court held that plaintiffs were \u201cestopped to file a second action raising the same issues which they [previously] had the opportunity to litigate but chose to abandon.\u201d <em>Jaffree v. Wallace, </em>No. 86-0515-BH, at 2 (S.D.Ala. May 7, 1987). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-6\">\n<em>Recusal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-7\">Appellants claim that Judge Hand improperly refused to recuse himself from this case. Previously we declined to grant appellants\u2019 request for a writ of mandamus. Today, we conclude that 28 U.S.C. sec. 455(a) did not indicate a disqualification of Judge Hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-8\">We review a judge\u2019s refusal to recuse himself under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Greenougk, </em>782 F.2d 1556, 1558 (11th Cir.1986). The standard \u201cis an objective one, whether a reasonable person knowing all the facts would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is well established that an allegation of bias sufficient to require disqualification under ... section 455 must demonstrate that the alleged bias is personal as opposed to judicial in nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Meester, </em>762 F.2d 867, 884-85 (11th Cir.1985). Thus, appellants must show more than a disagreement with the judge\u2019s judicial philosophy: they must point out personal, extrajudicial bias. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1541-12\">Appellants have failed to demonstrate how Judge Hand abused his discretion in this case. It is simply not enough to voice disagreement with previous rulings by Judge Hand in this and other cases. Nor is it enough to complain that Judge Hand did not expressly consider some of appellants\u2019 motions, including several motions that sought to attack collaterally the pending <em>Smith </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-13\">\n<em>Estoppel of Amended Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-14\">Before discussing the doctrine of res ju-dicata in detail below, we must address a preliminary question \u2014 namely, whether the district court improperly \u201cestopped\u201d plaintiffs-appellants from amending their complaint. The Jaffrees attempted to amend their complaint to add new parties-plaintiffs <em>before </em>defendants had filed a responsive pleading. They claim that they could do this once \u201cas a matter of course\u201d pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 15(a). <em>See McLellan v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co., </em>526 F.2d 870 (5th Cir.1976) (stating when a plaintiff may amend a complaint to add or drop a party \u201cas a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>course\u201d), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>545 F.2d 919, 922 n. 3 (1977) <em>(en banc </em>).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1542-4\">We believe that <em>McLellan </em>does not control this case. First, <em>McLellan </em>involved the amendment of a complaint to add parties defendants rather than plaintiffs. <em>See Summit Office Park, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., </em>639 F.2d 1278, 1283 n. 11 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981) (stressing this fact). Second, unlike the plaintiff in <em>McLellan, </em>the Jaffrees sought to amend their complaint to surmount an otherwise fatal res judicata bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-5\">In an analogous case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that, because the original parties-plaintiffs lacked standing, they could not amend their complaint to add new parties-plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 1282-85. The court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-6\">[Wjhere a plaintiff never had standing to assert a claim against the defendants, it does not have standing to amend the complaint and control the litigation by substituting new plaintiffs, a new class, and a new cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-7\">The principal issue involved is not whether the complaint can be amended as a matter of course, as urged by appellants, but ... whether [plaintiff-] Summit could offer an amendment to the complaint at all. Since there was no plaintiff before the court with a valid cause of action, there was no proper party available to amend the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1542-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1282. Similarly, assuming that res judicata barred the Jaffrees\u2019 original complaint, plaintiffs were estopped from amending their complaint: \u201cNo amendment could give [plaintiffs] a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1542-9\">\n<em>Res Judicata</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-10\">The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-12\">refers to the preclusive effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of matters that were litigated or could have been litigated in an earlier suit.... In order for the doctrine of res judicata to bar a subsequent suit, four elements must be present: (1) there must be a final judgment on the merits, (2) the decision must be rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, must be identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action must be involved in both cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1542-13\"><em>I.A. Durbin, Inc. v. Jefferson Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>793 F.2d 1541, 1549 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-14\">Appellants argue that at least three elements <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> did not exist in this case. Regarding the first element \u2014 a final judgment, appellants quote a treatise for the following proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-15\">When a judgment has been subjected to appellate review, the appellate court\u2019s disposition of the judgment generally provides the key to its continued force as res judicata and collateral estoppel. A judgment that has been vacated, reversed, or set aside on appeal is thereby deprived of all conclusive effect, both as res judicata and as collateral estoppel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzTl\">IB <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>Para. 0.416[2], at 517 (1984). Appellants cite several cases that differ significantly from the case <em>sub judice. See, e.g., Quarles v. Sager, </em>687 F.2d 344 (11th Cir.1982) (when the district court\u2019s judgment is <em>vacated, </em>it has no preclusive effect); <em>Hicks v. Quaker Oats Co., </em>662 F.2d 1158 (5th Cir.1981) (discussing the use of offensive collateral es-toppel and the \u201calternative ground\u201d rule when a losing party fails to appeal a decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-16\">We conclude that finality, for purposes of claim preclusion, existed in this case. Appellants filed and attempted to amend their complaint during the pendency of the <em>Smith </em>appeal. Prior to our reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>of the district court s judgment in that case, the district court dismissed appellants\u2019 action on preclusion/estoppel grounds. \u201cThe established rule in the federal courts is that a final judgment retains all of its res judicata consequences pending decision of the appeal.\u201d 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>sec. 4433, at 308 (1981 &amp; Supp. 1987) [Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>] (see cases listed therein). Moreover, \u201c[a] judgment merely voidable because based upon an erroneous view of the law is not open to collateral attack, but can be corrected only by a direct review and not by bringing another action upon the same cause [of action].\u201d <em>Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, </em>274 U.S. 316, 47 S.Ct. 600, 604, 71 L.Ed. 1069 (1927). <em>See also Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>462 U.S. 394, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 2428-31, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981) (citing <em>Phillips).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1543-4\">Regarding the third element \u2014 parties in privity, appellants assert that their complaint listed additional parties-plaintiffs, including Ishmael Jaffree\u2019s children and his wife,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who were not parties to the <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>litigation. In dismissing appellants\u2019 action, the district court stated simply that \u201cit cannot be disputed that ... privity with party plaintiffs exists.\u201d <em>Jaffree, </em>No. 86-0515-BH, at 2 n. 2.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Given the context and posture of this case, it appears that appellants Jaffree were in privity with plaintiffs Ishmael Jaffree and his children in the <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-7\">We begin with a discussion of the doctrine of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d, which supports a finding of privity \u201cwhen the respective interests are closely aligned and the party to the prior litigation adequately represented those interests.\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. McCoy Restaurants, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 582, 587 (11th Cir.1983). Several factors are relevant, including \u201cparticipation in the first litigation, apparent consent to be bound, apparent tactical maneuvering, [and] close relationships between the parties and nonparties.\u201d 18 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, </em>sec. 4457, at 494-99. <em>See also Robinson v. National Cash Register Co., </em>808 F.2d 1119, 1124 (5th Cir.1987) (discussing the doctrine and noting that \u201c[t]he question whether a party\u2019s interests are virtually representative of the interests of a nonparty is one of fact for the [district] court.\u201d). Although a familial relationship need not, in and of itself, confer privity status, it does constitute an important factor when assessing the preclusive effects of a prior adjudication. <em>See Mesa Petroleum Co. v. Coniglio, </em>787 F.2d 1484, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1986) (plaintiff-wife was precluded from litigating claims her husband previously had litigated), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 876, 93 L.Ed.2d 830 (1987); <em>Cotton v. Federal Land Bank of Columbia, </em>676 F.2d 1368, 1369-71 (11th Cir.) (plaintiff-husband was precluded from litigating claims his wife previously had litigated), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1041, 103 S.Ct. 458, 74 L.Ed.2d 610 (1982); <em>Seamon v. Bell Tel. Co. of Pa., </em>576 F.Supp. 1458, 1460-61 (W.D.Pa.1983) (plaintiff-husband was precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>from litigating claims his wife previously had litigated), <em>aff'd, </em>740 F.2d 958 (3d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-4\">We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that the Record in this case indicates an identity of interests, and adequacy of representation, sufficient to confer privity status upon all appellants-Jaffree. Ishmael Jaffree chose to withdraw from the <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>litigation<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>after </em>the district court had announced its intention to reopen the Record for the presentation of evidence on the schools\u2019 curriculum. While his motion for attorney\u2019s fees remained pending, twelve parents intervened as defendants to oppose Smith, <em>et </em>al.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rather than attempt to intervene when they learned about settlement negotiations, Jaffree, his wife, and children filed this action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Their subsequent motions and filings reveal a close identity of claims and parties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, appellants have failed to demonstrate how privity was lacking in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1544-12\">Our analysis of the fourth and final element of res judicata \u2014 same cause of action, confirms our conclusion. Appellants contend that their action constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201ccause of action\u201d that is separate and distinguishable from the <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>case. They argue that the issues and relief requested differ in each case. We disagree and conclude that the district court properly estopped their action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-13\">Res judicata, or \u201cclaim preclusion,\u201d \u201cextends not only to the precise legal theory presented in the previous litigation, but to all legal theories and claims arising out of the same \u2018operative nucleus of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olmstead v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>725 F.2d 627, 632 (11th Cir.1984). <em>See also I.A. Durbin, Inc., </em>793 F.2d at 1549 (\u201cThe principal test for determining whether the causes of action are the same is whether the primary right and duty are the same in each case.\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number><em>cf. Jackson v. United States Postal Service, </em>799 F.2d 1018, 1021 (5th Cir.1986) (adopting the \u201cseries of connected transactions\u201d test for comparing causes of action). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n determining whether the causes of action are the same, a court must compare the substance of the actions, not their form.\u201d <em>I.A. Durbin, Inc., </em>793 F.2d at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-4\">A comparison of the present action with <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>reveals that the two cases arose from the same \u201coperative nucleus of facts\u201d and that they involved the same \u201cprimary right and duty.\u201d Appellants\u2019 complaint in this case sought to enjoin state and local officials from \u201cexecuting any agreement between themselves or others which denies plaintiffs their free speech rights ... and/or establishes religion in the public schools.\u201d To achieve this end, they sued persons and entities that were parties to the <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Both </em>cases raised first amendment (free exercise and establishment clause) challenges to the use of textbooks and teachings on various subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">Appellants further contend that the focus of their action \u2014 namely, the consent orders and the board of education\u2019s resolution \u2014 concerns events that occurred after they dropped out of the <em>Jaffree sub nom. Smith </em>case. Yet these events arose directly from the same \u201coperative nucleus of facts\u201d, involving the same \u201cprimary right and duty.\u201d The doctrine of res judicata bars all subsequent suits raising allegedly new theories, unless a substantial change in the underlying facts or law has transpired. <em>See </em>IB <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>para. 0.415, at 504-12 (stating the rule and listing cases); <em>Jackson v. DeSoto Parish School Bd., </em>585 F.2d 726, 729 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cres judicata is no defense where, between the first and second suits, there has been an intervening change in the law or modification of significant facts creating new legal conditions.\u201d); <em>cf. Montana v.

Thus, the term \"res judicata\u201d may encompass</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXT\">two preclusion concepts: \"issue preclusion\" and \u201cclaim preclusion.\u201d Issue preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided.... This effect also is referred to as direct or collateral estoppel. Claim preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of a matter that never has been litigated, because of a determination that it should have been advanced in an earlier suit. Claim preclusion therefore encompasses the law of merger and bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoMV\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1539-18\"><em>. </em>Jaffree tried to convert the suit into a class action.
