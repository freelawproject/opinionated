JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1404-15\">Responding to petitioner\u2019s appeal from an order of the National Transportation Safety Board revoking his commercial pilot\u2019s license, we affirm that \u00a7 609(c) of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429(c), mandates this severe penalty for pilots who have knowingly trafficked in drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-16\">In December 1985, Paul Rawlins piloted a Cessna 210 from Belize, Central America to Houston, Texas. The flight ended in a crash near Houston Hobby Airport. It is undisputed that petitioner knowingly carried a cargo of approximately 750 pounds of marijuana. Rawlins was subsequently convicted in the Southern District of Texas of conspiracy to violate narcotic laws (in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846); possession with intent to distribute marijuana (in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)); and importation of marijuana (in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)). These violations carry penalties of imprisonment in excess of one year. Rawlins was sentenced to a suspended sentence and given five years probation with supervision on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">Subsequently, the Administrator of the FAA advised the petitioner of the revocation of his commercial pilot\u2019s license, and further ordered that no application for a new certificate be made for five years. Rawlins appealed this order to the National Transportation Safety Board, and the order was thereupon filed as the FAA Administrator\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A hearing was convoked before an NTSB administrative judge who received stipulated findings that revocation of petitioner\u2019s pilot certification would have an adverse economic impact, since he derives his livelihood from flying, and that Rawlins cooperated with the FAA in its investigation. Nevertheless, the AU advised Rawlins that \u00a7 609(c) precluded consideration of any sanction other than revocation. The AD then confirmed the order revoking Rawlins commercial pilot certificate pursuant to \u00a7 609(c). Petitioner appealed, again unsuccessfully, to the NTSB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>Rawlins, on appeal to this Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, argues that the NTSB erred in holding that in certification actions governed by \u00a7 609(c), the Administrator is precluded from considering any sanction less severe than revocation. He contends further that such an interpretation deprives certificate holders of constitutional due process. We reject petitioner\u2019s argument for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-4\">The language of \u00a7 609(c)(1) is mandatory in stating that \u201c[t]he Administrator <em>shall </em>issue an order revoking the airman certificate of any person upon conviction ... of a crime punishable by ... imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under State or Federal law relating to a controlled substance.\u201d (Emphasis added). Because the language of the statute is plain, we may not modify it by judicial construction. The legislative history only confirms that \u00a7 609(c) \u201c[rjequires the Administrator to revoke an airman certificate ...\u201d if a pilot is convicted of violating drug trafficking laws. H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1085, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 8, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3916, 3921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">Moreover, the structure of enforcement under \u00a7 609 reinforces our conclusion that \u00a7 609(c) calls for an all-or-nothing sanction. Under \u00a7 609(c)(3), the NTSB may only affirm or reverse the Administrator\u2019s order of revocation. By contrast, broader powers have been assigned to the regulatory authorities under \u00a7 609(a), which permits the NTSB to amend, modify or reverse the Administrator\u2019s order amending, suspending, modifying or revoking an airman certificate if \u201csafety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest requires ...\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429(a). Congress obviously determined that a harsh penalty was the only advisable response to drug trafficking violations by FAA-certified pilots.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">Against the compelling language and structure of the statute, Rawlins suggests his own interpretation based on the language of \u00a7 609(c)(3) that affords an airman the opportunity to \u201cbe heard as to why such a certificate should not be revoked\u201d. This language, however, refers only to the airman\u2019s opportunity to contest the facts underlying the FAA order of revocation, rather than the degree of sanction. Section 609(c)(3), consistently with our interpretation, provides that the NTSB \u201cshall not be bound by [the FAA\u2019s] findings of <em>fact\u201d </em>(emphasis added). More significantly, the very language quoted by Rawlins admits of only one possible sanction, license revocation. The quoted language would in fact make no sense <em>if </em>Congress had permitted a lesser sanction than revocation, for it would then unreasonably limit a petitioner\u2019s opportunity for a hearing only to revocation orders. Construing this language in \u00a7 609(c)(3) does not assist petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">Because Congress has mandated license revocation when certain facts have been established, we find no due process violation as posited by Rawlins. He had the opportunity to contest the facts pertinent to \u00a7 609(c)(1) and FAA regulations promulgated thereunder with his attorney present in a hearing before the administrative law judge. He does not question the adequacy of the hearings or the factfinding process. Consequently, the NTSB had no alternative but to revoke his pilot certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\">As the NTSB correctly determined that it did not have the discretionary power to consider any mitigating factors, we need not address Rawlins\u2019 argument for mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-11\">The decision of the NTSB is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1404-13\">.
