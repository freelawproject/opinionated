George appeals the dismissal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), of his <em>pro se, in forma pauperis </em>suit, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, complaining of a single instance of food poisoning he suffered while confined as a state prisoner at the Dixon Correctional Institute in Jackson, Louisiana. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-23\">Appellant\u2019s suit was filed in April 1983 against the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Corrections and the Warden of the Dixon Correctional Institute, where appellant was then confined. Well prior to the dismissal below, appellant was transferred to another Louisiana prison. Appellant alleged that on the morning of March 18, 1983 he awoke with stomach cramps, diarrhea, and nausea. He collapsed and was found by the security man on duty, who helped him up and told him to go to the infirmary. He went to the infirmary, where he was examined by a doctor who took all his vital signs. He alleged that he was given medication and told that he would be seen by another doctor later in the day. There is no statement as to whether or not he was seen later in the day by another doctor. It is alleged that some three to four hundred other inmates also suffered from the same symptoms on the same day, and \u201c[a]ll of us were given the day off, and told to stay in the bed.\u201d No further consequences, to appellant or any of the other prisoners, are alleged in respect to the food poisoning, except that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>his proposed pretrial order appellant stated, \u201cBecause of the food poisoning, I suffered great mental and physical pain for several days.\u201d No complaint is even intimated concerning the medical response or treatment given for the food poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The complaint sought damages \u201cfor neglect of Dixon Correctional Institute\u2019s Warden to provide safe and clean meals and for allowing unsanitary food and/or unsanitary utensils to be used in the preparation of the foods here,\u201d and also \u201cfor allowing the preceding conditions to prevail ... with no attempts made to correct them until inyates [sic ] were sick.\u201d In his proposed pretrial order, appellant stated that his food poisoning \u201cwas caused through neglect of the Food Service Department, and their policy of serving food which has been left over from other meals for several days.\u201d In his brief on appeal, appellant states that this is \u201cnot a signed institutional policy,\u201d but rather is \u201ca practice which is known to exist by the governing body at Dixion [sic] Correctional Institute.\u201d He further states in his brief that \u201cdefendants who had knowledge of the policy employed by the Food Service Department, at the Dixion Correctional Institute, whereby foods prepared days earlier are stored for future serving, allowed said policy to exist which ultimately became the launching pad for the bad food that caused appellants [sic] food poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The brief further contends that \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowledge of the policies ..., and allowing said policies to exist, acted as an official approval of said policy, even though said policy did not receive formal approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In February 1987, almost four years after this suit was filed and, as appellant characterizes it, \u201c[a]fter numerous motions, pretrial orders, and discovery proceedings,\u201d the magistrate recommended the dismissal of appellant\u2019s suit, pursuant to section 1915(d), on the basis that \u201cit is clear that plaintiff's allegations are frivolous and have \u2018no realistic chance of ultimate success,\u2019 \u201d citing <em>Green v. McKaskle, </em>788 F.2d 1116, 1120 (5th Cir.1986). The magistrate noted that \u201c[although the plaintiff indicates many inmates were affected by one allegedly spoiled meal, the incident is isolated, caused no serious medical complications and does not amount to a violation of federally protected rights.\u201d Appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, reiterating that he could prove that he suffered food poisoning at the Dixon mess hall on March 18, and that three to four hundred other inmates there were likewise treated for food poisoning \u201con that date.\u201d He likewise reiterated that \u201c[t]his incident was caused through neglect of the Food Service Department and their policy of serving food which has been left over from other meals for several days.\u201d At no time, either in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s report or otherwise, did appellant ever intimate that either he or any other inmate ever suffered any food poisoning at any time other than on March 18, 1983, this despite the fact that the suit had been on file for nearly four years, and appellant had remained at the Dixon Correctional Institute for over two years after the suit was filed. In his brief on appeal, appellant challenges the magistrate\u2019s determination that the food poisoning was an isolated incident, saying, \u201c[T]his is an er-roueous finding since appellant in his pretrial order to the lower court, listed serveral [sic] inmates who would testify that they had also experienced food poisoning on the same day as appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Accordingly, granting full liberality to all appellant\u2019s filings as appropriate for a <em>pro se </em>litigant, it is nevertheless plain that this case presents only the question of whether a prisoner\u2019s suit asserting a single incident of food poisoning, not causing any permanent injury or serious medical complications and which is treated with at least minimal adequacy, states a claim for deprivation of constitutional rights, where the illness allegedly arises from the neglect of the prison food service department and its informal policy \u201cwhereby foods prepared days earlier are stored for future serving,\u201d no other such incidents being claimed. More precisely, the question is whether, when it becomes clear that this is all that is claimed, the suit may be dismissed under section 1915(d) without an evidentiary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ing or a motion for summary judgment. We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">As we have noted, \u201c[d]istrict courts are vested with especially broad discretion\u201d in determining whether IFP complaints are subject to dismissal as frivolous under section 1915(d), and dismissal thereunder is appropriate where the complaint has no \u201c \u2018realistic chance of ultimate success.\u2019 \u201d <em>Green, </em>788 F.2d at 1119, 1120. Measuring appellant\u2019s rights as a prisoner under the Eighth Amendment, the relevant standard is certainly no less than the \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs\u201d of <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). <em>See also Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236 (5th Cir.1985). And in this context, it also appears that the \u201cDue Process Clause affords no greater protection than does the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1088, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). Moreover, it is plain that mere negligence does not suffice. <em>Gamble; Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We have said that a state must \u201c \u2018furnish[] its prisoners with reasonably adequate food ... \u2019 to satisfy constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Green, </em>788 F.2d at 1126. Certainly, the Constitution does not tolerate the administrative transformance of a sentence of several years\u2019 imprisonment to one of a gulag-type death by incremental starvation. Obviously, however, we are not here dealing with anything comparable to that. Rather, we confront a single incident of mass food poisoning of the kind occasionally experienced by those in military service or in other institutional settings, as well as individually in the more routine course of daily life. We spoke, albeit in dicta, to this sort of situation in <em>Roberts v. Williams, </em>456 F.2d 819, 827 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 866, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 110 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\">\u201cWe might say careless preparation of a single meal, producing food poisoning in prisoners, was not cruel, but it might be so if the jailors negligently allowed the jail\u2019s only drinking water supply to be-c\u00f3me permanently infected with typhoid bacteria.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Although subsequent decisions, such as <em>Gamble, Daniels, </em>and <em>Whitley, </em>make it plain that mere negligence is not in any event a sufficient basis for constitutional claims in this context, nevertheless we believe that <em>Roberts </em>is sound insofar as it implies that a single incident of unintended food poisoning, whether suffered by one or many prisoners at an institution, does not constitute a violation of the constitutional rights of the affected prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Nor is the situation changed by the fact that this incident is alleged to have resulted from a known custom \u201cwhereby foods prepared days earlier are stored for future serving,\u201d particularly as it appears no prior (or subsequent) food poisoning resulted therefrom. If prisoners regularly and frequently suffer from food poisoning with truly serious medical complications as a result of particular, known unsanitary practices which are customarily followed by the prison food service organization, and the authorities without arguable justification refuse to attempt remedial measures, the requisite deliberate indifference might well be manifested or inferred. But such deliberate indifference is certainly not even suggested by a single incident, and the singularity of the incident, in light of the claimed existence of an allegedly improper custom or policy, in fact points in the other direction. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 304-05 (5th Cir.1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Were it otherwise, the federal courts would of necessity become the forums for determining the propriety and desirability of virtually all details of prison food service management and proceedures, as in such institutional settings occasional food poisoning of this character, which is not productive of truly serious medical complications or permanent injury, is almost inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing appellant\u2019s suit as frivolous under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>1915(d) because the suit had no realistic chance of ultimate success.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Accordingly, the judgment below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\">. So, too, does the adequate and prompt medical response to the single incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AtQ\">. While appellant in his suggested pretrial order also asked for injunctive relief, the same considerations discussed in the text likewise reflect the inappropriateness of such relief. Moreover, as previously noted, subsequent to the filing of the proposed pretrial order, appellant was transferred out of the Dixon Correctional Institute, the only institution to which any of his allegations below made reference. Accordingly, any claim for injunctive relief was mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">The judgment below is a dismissal with prejudice. However, appellant does not urge that this aspect of the dismissal is inappropriate or that he should have been given an opportunity to amend by making the dismissal without prejudice. <em>Compare Lyons v. Sheetz, </em>834 F.2d 493, 495 (5th Cir.1987) (rejecting, on basis of plaintiffs bad faith, complaint on appeal that dismissal with prejudice did not afford an opportunity to amend). Given the long pendency of this suit, and appellant\u2019s full opportunity to state and restate his claims, and their elaboration in his brief on appeal, we see no reason to <em>sua sponte </em>change the dismissal from one with prejudice to one without prejudice. We stated in <em>Good v. Allain, </em>823 F.2d 64, 67 (5th Cir.1987), \u201cWhen a dismissal of a pro se complaint is warranted, it should generally be without prejudice in order to afford the plaintiff the opportunity to file an amended complaint.\u201d However, in that case, the complaint challenged only the lack of a hearing before the appellant\u2019s return from Minnesota to Mississippi, and we noted, \u201cIf he had been denied the opportunity to challenge his removal from Mississippi, he might have a viable \u00a7 1983 claim.\" <em>Id. </em>While we also observed that \"we perceive no viable claim Good could include in an amended complaint,\" it would appear that this latter statement refers to the challenge to the lack of a hearing before Good\u2019s return to Mississippi. <em>Id. </em>As to that, we had predicated our holding on the validity of his Mississippi conviction, as to which Good had made no challenge. In other words, the matrix of facts which Good alleged left possible constitutional violations open, although it did not affirmatively reflect them. In <em>Good, </em>we relied in this connection on <em>Moawad v. Childs, </em>673 F.2d 850, 852 (5th Cir.1982). There we reversed a dismissal with prejudice to allow an amendment. But we observed: \"Unless proper procedures have been followed, a claim of mail censorship could state a constitutional claim.... [H]is complaint of mail censorship, of guard harassment and his change of classification without due process require findings_\u201d We concluded by saying, \"Because Moawad\u2019s complaint, liberally construed, stated claims that were not addressed by the court below, we must send his case back to the district court for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-23\">In this case, we conclude that a <em>sua sponte </em>change in the district court\u2019s order from dismissal with to dismissal without prejudice is neither appropriate nor mandated by <em>Good </em>or <em>Moa-wad. </em>It is entirely clear that appellant is entitled to no relief on account of the food poisoning incident which is the only matter raised in his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
