Wood, III, D.D.S., appeals a judgment rejecting his demands against CNA Insurance Companies (Continental Casualty Company). Finding neither error of fact nor law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-14\">From April 1985 until April 1986, CNA insured Wood, his professional dental corporation, and its pension and profit sharing plans. The insurance satisfied the requirements of ERISA. As administrator and principal beneficiary of the pension and profit sharing plan, Wood invested $150,-000 of plan funds in certificates of deposit with Alliance Federal Savings and Loan Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-15\">In August 1985 the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board placed Alliance Federal in receivership. The plans, as owners of certificates of deposit in the failed institution, sustained a loss of nearly $50,-000. Wood sought recovery of that loss from CNA. The facts were stipulated and the matter was submitted for bench resolution. Wood contended that CNA was liable because Alliance Federal was a \u201cplan official\u201d under ERISA and an \u201cemployee\u201d under the policy. The district court rejected these contentions and entered judgment for CNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-16\">ERISA requires that \u201c[ejvery fiduciary of an employee benefit plan and every person who handles funds or other property of such a plan (hereafter in this section referred to as \u201cplan official\u201d) shall be bonded as provided in this section_\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a). ERISA defines a fiduciary as a person who exercises discretionary authority over management of a pension plan, who renders investment advice for a fee or who has discretionary responsibility in the administration of such a plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A) (1982). <em>See also Intn\u2019l. U. United Auto Workers v. Greyhound Lines, </em>701 F.2d 1181 (6th Cir.1983). A savings and loan association would qualify as a fiduciary only if the association were the asset custodian or trustee; took part in investment decisions; was affiliated with the plan sponsor; or exercised discretionary authority regarding management of the plan or disposition of its assets. Alliance Federal, acting solely as a financial institution which had issued certificates of deposit, had none of these characteristics. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>It was not a fiduciary of the plans; only Wood was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">Wood maintains that if Alliance Federal was not a fiduciary under ERISA, it was a \u201cperson who handles funds or other property of such a plan\u201d or in other words a \u201cplan official\u201d as designated by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a). We do not agree. Alliance Federal had no affiliation with the plans; Wood was the only plan official. Alliance Federal was merely a party from whom Wood had purchased negotiable instruments. That purchase did not by some act of legal legerdemain convert Alliance Federal into a plan official.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">Wood finally contends that CNA insured the plans against the acts of fraud by employees of Alliance Federal. Wood supports this argument with the policy\u2019s definition of employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1480-6\">Any one or more of the natural persons while in the service of any welfare or pension plan (included as insured herein) as fiduciary, trustee, administrator, officer or employee and any other natural person while performing acts normally performed by a fiduciary, trustee, administrator, officer or employee as defined in such act shall be deemed to be an employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-7\">and CNA\u2019s explanation of that clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATn\">ERISA Bond \u2014 This coverage protects funds from dishonesty and fraudulent acts by individuals handling your Employment Retirement Income Fund. The word individual includes employees, CPAs, Financial Planners, Banks, Brokers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1480-8\">Albeit ingenious, this argument lacks persuasion. Alliance Federal acted neither as a fiduciary, trustee, administrator, officer, nor employee of the fund. It did not handle the funds of the plans; only Wood did. He invested those funds in certificates of deposit of Alliance Federal. The loss resulting from the institution\u2019s failure was not covered by the CNA policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A1QT\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
