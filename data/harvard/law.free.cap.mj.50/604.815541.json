Contrary to his pleas, the appellant was also found guilty of a conspiracy to assault LCpl H and of the aggravated assault upon LCpl M<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of Articles 81 and 128, UCMJ. The approved sentence includes confinement for 18 months, forfeiture of $600 pay per month for 18 months, reduction to E-l, and a bad-conduct discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">We have carefully reviewed the record of trial, the appellant\u2019s two assignments of error, and the Government\u2019s response. We conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">The Conspiracy Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">The appellant first contends that the evidence presented at his general court-martial was factually and legally insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he and his co-accused, LCpl Hoover, entered into an agreement to assault LCpl H before the assault actually took place in the appellant\u2019s barracks room.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s brief of 3 Nov 1998 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">The facts surrounding this event are not in significant dispute (largely the result of appellant having videotaped the assault). The appellant was assigned to a unit in Okinawa, and resided in the barracks located on board Camp Hansen. During the weekend of 16-17 August 1997, a typhoon swept across Okinawa and all Marines on Camp Hansen were instructed to remain within their barracks. In anticipation of a lengthy \u201clock down,\u201d many of the individuals residing in the barracks purchased large quantities of alcohol, including the appellant and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">The testimony of various witnesses established that the appellant and his friends began drinking in the appellant\u2019s room at approximately noon on 16 August 1997, and continued drinking into the night. LCpl Hoover, the appellant\u2019s friend (and co-accused), testified that the five Marines who congregated in the appellant\u2019s room were drinking, listening to music, and \u201cbeing loud.\u201d Record at 261. As the party wore on into the evening, LCpl Hoover left to retrieve some compact music discs from his room. In the hallway of the barracks, LCpl Hoover encountered LCpl H, a Marine with whom he had previously had a falling out, but their differences had, ostensibly, been subsequently resolved. He invited LCpl H to join the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>party in the appellant\u2019s room. LCpl H stated he would come up later.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Upon returning to the appellant\u2019s room, LCpl Hoover announced to the group that he had invited LCpl H to the party, and he was \u201cgoing to get him\u201d when he arrived. The appellant, who heard LCpl Hoover\u2019s comment, stated, \u2018Yeah, bring him in here,\u201d or words to that effect. Cpl Brumfield, another Marine present at the party, testified that he interpreted LCpl Hoover\u2019s comment to mean LCpl Hoover intended to \u201cbeat [LCpl H] up\u201d and the appellant\u2019s response to mean he was \u201cjust like agreeing with [LCpl Hoover].\u201d Record at 311. Cpl Brumfield testified that others in the room questioned LCpl Hoover\u2019s statement, saying, \u201cI thought that [your disagreement] was over\u201d and \u201cthat you guys were friends now.\u201d LCpl Hoover responded, \u201cAw, I a\u2019int gonna do nothing to him; I\u2019m just playing. We cool.\u201d or words to-that effect. Record at 316. LCpl Hoover then left again to get LCpl H and bring him to the party. He returned approximately five minutes later and stated to the group, \u201cH is on his way.\u201d LCpl H arrived minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The appellant had a videotape recorder and videotaped the events taking place in his room that evening. Prosecution Exhibit 1. When LCpl H arrived, LCpl Hoover can be seen on the videotape giving the appellant a \u201cthumbs up\u201d signal (held against his chest) and nodding. When LCpl H demonstrated a reluctance to speak into the video-camera, LCpl Hoover confronted him [\u201cgetting all mad\u201d and bringing up their \u201cold stuff\u2019] and asked him, \u201cwhy are you disrespecting my boy\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) room and his camera?\u201d Record at 316. Prosecution Exhibit 1 shows LCpl Hoover pushing LCpl H and commanding him in an angry voice to \u201cget on the fucking camera, dog!\u201d LCpl H then stood up and faced the camera. On the videotape, LCpl Hoover can be seen standing behind LCpl H and gesturing toward the appellant and the others present. LCpl Hoover made -a fist with one hand and rubbed it into his other open hand, then gave a second \u201cthumbs up\u201d signal to the appellant. He testified that his intent in doing so was to let the appellant and the others know \u201cit [the assault] was about to happen, that I was going to get him.\u201d Record at 265. The appellant then passed off the video-camera to another Marine and walked over to LCpl H. Words were exchanged and the appellant bumped chests with LCpl H, stating, \u2018You\u2019re about my size.\u201d Moments later, both LCpl Hoover and the appellant began raining blows and kicks upon LCpl H. After being beaten and kicked, LCpl H escaped out the door when others in the room momentarily restrained his attackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The test for legal sufficiency is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A.1987). When applying this test, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference from the record in favor of the prosecution. <em>United States v. McGinty, </em>38 M.J. 131 (C.M.A.1993)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The test for factual sufficiency is \u201cwhether, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses ... [we are] convinced of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 325. <em>See </em>Article 66(c), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Our review of the record of trial and the graphic videotape depicting the vicious assault in question clearly convinces us that the evidence was both legally and factually sufficient to establish that the appellant and LCpl Hoover had formed an agreement to assault LCpl H before the event took place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">The agreement in a conspiracy need not be in any particular form or manifested in any formal words. It is sufficient if the minds of the parties arrive at a common understanding to accomplish the object of the conspiracy, and this may be shown by the conduct of the parties. The agreement need not state the means by which the conspiracy is to be accomplished or what part each conspirator is to play.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.), Part IV, H 5c(2); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Jackson, </em>20 M.J. 68 (C.M.A.1985). \u201cThe agreement need not be expressed but need only be implied to sustain a finding of guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Matias, </em>25 M.J. 356, 362 (C.M.A.1987). The existence of a conspiracy is generally established by circumstantial evidence and is usually manifested by the conduct of the parties themselves. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In this case, we find more than abundant evidence in the record demonstrating that there was a conspiratorial agreement between the appellant and LCpl Hoover to assault LCpl H, and that the actual assault was executed in furtherance of that agreement. This agreement was express, and was also clearly implied by the conduct of appellant and LCpl Hoover. When LCpl Hoover informed the group that he had invited LCpl H to the party, and that he was \u201cgoing to get him,\u201d the evidence of record clearly indicates that those present, including the appellant, interpreted his comments to mean that he was going to \u201cbeat up\u201d LCpl H. The appellant immediately responded, \u201cYeah, bring him in here,\u201d or words to that effect, indicating his agreement with Hoover\u2019s plan. The videotape itself provides the best evidence that an agreement existed. LCpl Hoover is depicted leaving the room to go get LCpl H. Minutes later he returned and announced to the group, \u201con his way,\u201d or words to that effect, indicating LCpl H was coming. The appellant then can be heard to state, \u201cHe\u2019s coming up ... that\u2019s all good to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">After LCpl H arrived, two separate and clandestine \u201cthumbs up\u201d signals were made by LCpl Hoover toward the appellant. The second is most telling, and more than confirms the existence of their conspiratorial agreement. LCpl Hoover, standing behind LCpl H but facing toward appellant and the camera, rubbed his right fist into his left hand, and then gave appellant the second \u201cthumbs up\u201d signal. Immediately, the appellant passed off the video-camera to another, walked over and bumped chests with LCpl H, and challenged him by stating, \u201cYou\u2019re about my size.\u201d Simultaneously, appellant and LCpl Hoover began striking and kicking LCpl H.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Based upon our careful and thorough review of the record of trial, we are more than satisfied that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiratorial agreement to assault LCpl H was formed. Also, we are ourselves personally convinced of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, this assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The Drunk and Disorderly Offenses</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The appellant\u2019s second assignment of error challenges the sufficiency of the providence inquiry in regard to the appellant\u2019s two drunk and disorderly conduct offenses. Charge Y, specifications 1 and 2. At issue is the military judge\u2019s inquiry into the charged allegation that appellant\u2019s drunk and disorderly conduct on these two occasions was \u201cof a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\u201d At most, the appellant believes the inquiry only established that his conduct on these occasions was \u201cto the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.\u201d As regards the offense of drunk and disorderly conduct in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, the distinction is a significant one.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Drunk and disorderly conduct which is to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces authorizes a maximum permissible punishment of confinement for 3 months and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 3 months. If similar conduct is under circumstances that bring discredit upon the military service, the maximum punishment is confinement for 6 months and forfeiture of two-thirds pay per month for 6 months. M.C.M., Part IV, H73e(3)(b) and (e). Thus, as a sentence escalator in drunk and disorderly offenses, pleading and proving service discrediting conduct doubles the permissible punishment. Accordingly, unlike most offenses under Article 134, UCMJ, \u201cconduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d must be specifically pled and proved in drunk and disorderly specifications to authorize the greater maximum punishment. <em>Id., </em>1173c(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">A military judge may not accept a guilty plea to an offense without inquiring into its factual basis. <em>United States v. Care, </em>18 U.S.C.M.A. 535, 40 C.M.R. 247 (1969); Art. 45(a), UCMJ. Before accepting a guilty plea, the military judge must explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>elements of the offense and ensure that a factual basis for the plea exists. <em>United States v. Faircloth, </em>45 M.J. 172, 174 (1996); <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>9 M.J. 364, 367 (C.M.A.1980). \u201cMere conclusions of law recited by the accused are insufficient to provide a factual basis for a guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Outhier, </em>45 M.J. 326, 331 (1996)(citing <em>United States v. Terry, </em>21 U.S.C.M.A. 442, 45 C.M.R. 216 (1972)). The accused \u201cmust be convinced of, and able to describe all the facts necessary to establish guilt.\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial 910(e), Discussion, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.). Acceptance of a guilty plea requires the accused to substantiate the facts that objectively support his plea. <em>Id.; United States v. Schwabauer, </em>37 M.J. 338, 341 (C.M.A.1993). The standard of review to determine whether a plea is provident is whether the record reveals a substantial basis in law or fact for questioning the plea. <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">We hold that the military judge\u2019s inquiry into the factual basis for the appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to \u201cservice discrediting\u201d conduct was sufficient in regard to both specifications alleging drunk and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Article 134, UCMJ, punishes \u201cdisorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces\u201d (clause 1) and \u201cconduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\u201d (clause 2). MCM, Part IV, H 60c(2) and (3). Clause 2 offenses under Article 134 specifically punish \u201cconduct which has a tendency to bring the service into disrepute or which tends to lower it in public esteem.\u201d <em>Id., </em>U 60c(3). The gravamen of any \u201cclause 2\u201d offense is its service discrediting circumstances. <em>United States v. Lowe, </em>4 U.S.C.M.A. 654, 16 C.M.R. 228, 232 (1954); <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>31 M.J. 776, 777-778 (A.C.M.R.1990). The appellant incorrectly asserts that there is nothing in his record of trial that indicates that his drunk and disorderly conduct in the barracks on board Camp Hansen, Okinawa, brought the armed forces into disrepute or lowered it in public esteem. After being properly informed by the military judge of the definition of service discrediting conduct, the appellant agreed during the providence inquiry that his conduct was indeed \u201cservice discrediting.\u201d While more facts could have been elicited by the military judge to clarify and support this conclusion, we are satisfied that the appellant\u2019s pleas in this regard were provident. Specifically, the appellant admitted that provoking and assaulting LCpl H in the presence of several other Marines, then committing an aggravated assault on LCpl M, and videotaping both incidents on separate occasions while highly intoxicated was conduct that would tend to bring the service into disrepute or lower it in public esteem. Record at 221-244.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The appellant pled guilty in this case and expressly waived all possible factual issues concerning his guilt to the offenses to which he was pleading guilty. R.C.M. 910(j); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>44 M.J. 223, 225 (1996). Moreover, post-trial speculation as to a putative defense is an improper basis to upset voluntary guilty pleas that were preceded by a providence inquiry that is regular on its face. <em>Wilson, </em>44 M.J. at 225. We hold that, on this record, no substantial question is raised in law or fact as to the validity of the appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to both drunk and disorderly offenses, and we cannot discern any error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant. R.C.M. 910(j); Article 59, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">We are completely satisfied that the appellant\u2019s responses during the providence inquiry were sufficient to establish his guilt of both offenses under \u201cClause 2\u201d of Article 134, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">Accordingly, the findings and sentence as approved on review below are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Senior Judge DORMAN and Judge TROIDL concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-12\">. The appellant originally pled guilty to the lesser included offense of assault consummated by a battery upon LCpl M. The Government went forward and proved the greater offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-13\">.
