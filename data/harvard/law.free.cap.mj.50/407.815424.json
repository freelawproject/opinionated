The convening authority approved the sentence of a bad-conduct discharge, 150 days\u2019 confinement, partial forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion on April 24, 1998. 1998 WL 238586. We granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-24\">WHETHER SPECIFICATION 1 OF CHARGE II, WILLFUL DISOBEDIENCE OF A LAWFUL ORDER, FAILS TO STATE AN OFFENSE BECAUSE THE ORDER WAS AN ILLEGAL ONE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-28\">We hold that Major Learn gave a lawful order.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-29\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b569-30\">In September 1995, appellant was diagnosed with narcolepsy; that is, he was prone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>to \u201csleep attacks, excessive sleepiness and spells of sleep paralysis.\u201d Thus, he was instructed by a neurologist not to handle weapons or explosives, participate in range detail or field duty, operate a government vehicle, or stand watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">When Major Learn, appellant\u2019s commander, was apprised of the diagnosis and prescribed limitations on appellant\u2019s activities, he further ordered appellant not to drive his personal vehicle. Major Learn testified that he issued this order to \u201cprotect [appellant] as well as the Marines and the civilian populus here around Jacksonville, North Carolina, in the event he did fall asleep behind the wheel.\u201d However, after receiving Major Learn\u2019s order, appellant was seen driving his private vehicle on base.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">Appellant contends that Major Learn did not limit his order in time or place. In fact, the Major testified that his order included not only Appellant\u2019s POV but any POV. (R. at 26.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">Major Learn\u2019s order was illegal because it forbade Appellant from driving, without a sufficient connection to a valid military purpose. Major Learn\u2019s order was limitless in place and duration. It effectively forbade Appellant from driving any POV anywhere, any time for any reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Final Brief at 6. Furthermore, appellant complains that since the medical board did not restrict his use of any POV, \u201c[t]he obvious conclusion is that [his] physician did not believe it was necessary to restrict [his] access to a POV.\u201d In addition, appellant asserts, \u201cthere is no evidence in the record that [his] driving license had been revoked by the issuing state or any other competent authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Congress, based on its authority in Article I, section 8, clause 14, has provided that disobedience of orders is a punishable offense. <em>See </em>Arts. 90, 91, and 92, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 890, 891, and 892, respectively. As the Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[T]o accomplish its mission the military must foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de corps.\u201d <em>Goldman v. Weinberger, </em>475 U.S. 503, 507, 106 S.Ct. 1310, 89 L.Ed.2d 478 (1986). There must be a first instinct to obey orders if the military is to function since its \u201cprimary business\u201d is \u201cto fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise.\u201d <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 743, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), quoting <em>United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 17, 76 S.Ct. 1, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Orders requiring performance of military duties are presumed to be lawful when issued by superiors. Para. 14c(2)(a)(i), Part IV, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). However, \u201c[t]he order must relate to [a] military duty, which includes all activities reasonably necessary to accomplish a military mission, or safeguard or promote the morale, discipline, and usefulness of members of a command and directly connected with the maintenance of good order in the service.\u201d Para. 14c(2)(a)(iii). Major Learn\u2019s order to appellant clearly interfered with appellant\u2019s private rights, but it was permissible in view of its valid military purpose. Additionally, the order was properly transmitted and heard. It is unnecessary to determine whether the outer limits of the order are overly broad, because driving on base was a matter well within the scope of military authority, which includes protecting civilians from injury at the hands of military personnel. This is not analogous to an order not to drink liquor or not to speak to members of his command. <em>Cf. United States v. Wilson, </em>12 USCMA 165, 166-67, 30 CMR 165, 166-67 (1961); <em>United States v. Wysong, </em>9 USCMA 249, 26 CMR 29 (1958). Thus, we agree with these observations of the Court of Criminal Appeals, 1998 WL 238586:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">We can imagine few situations more likely to result in fatal or serious injury, to both the driver and anyone who happens to be in the path of his automobile, than a driver who is subject to falling asleep at any moment. Just as our superior court upheld the \u201csafe sex\u201d orders issued in the case of an HIV-positive servicemember in <em>[United States v.] Womack[, </em>29 MJ 88 (CMA 1989) ], we have no difficulty finding that, under the circumstances of this case, the order not to drive a POV had a valid military purpose and was neither overly broad nor did it impose an impermissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>burden on his personal rights. <em>Womack, </em>29 MJ at 90-91. The appellant asked the military judge at trial, and this court on appeal, that we speculate that the real reason his commanding officer issued this order was to hassle or punish him. However, the officer\u2019s testimony at trial, supported by the documentary evidence, indicated that the reason was to preserve unit readiness and the life and safety of the appellant and others.

MICHALEC, 1999 WL 187374 (4th Cir.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">Apr. 6, 1999: Before WIDENER and WILKINS, Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">Judges, and PHILLIPS, Senior Circuit Judge.]</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Jon Stephan Michalec pled guilty to possession of videotapes containing child pornography, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) (West Supp.1998), and was sentenced to a term of 30 months imprisonment. He challenges his sentence on appeal, arguing that the district court erred in finding that his computer files were \"items\" within the meaning of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2)(1997), and enhancing his offense level accordingly. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Michalec ordered four videotapes of child pornography from a law enforcement agent who advertised the tapes on the Internet. On the same day, Michalec consented to a search of his personal computer. One of his hard drives had 224 files containing visual depictions of children engaged in sexual acts with adults. The files were down-loaded to his computer on seventeen different days over a period of a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">Michalec objected to the probation officer's recommendation that he receive a two-level enhancement for possession of ten or more videotapes \"or other items\" containing child pornography under USSG \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2). Relying on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>119 F.3d 742 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied,\u2014U.S.\u2014, 118 S.Q. 1571, 140 L.Ed.2d 804 (1998), Michalec argued that he possessed only five items containing child pornography \u2014 the four tapes and his hard drive. In <em>Lacy, </em>however, the issue was whether the evidence was sufficient for a conviction under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) (West Supp.1998), which prohibits possession of three or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, videotapes, or \"other matter\" containing child pornography. <em>Lacy </em>held that \"matter\u201d or \"matters\u201d meant the computer disks and hard drive, rather than the computer files; it did not consider the meaning of \"items\" under \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2). For this reason, the district court followed <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>142 F.3d 988, 998-99 (7th Cir.1998), which held that \"items,\" as used in USSG \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2), meant individual computer files stored on the computer, and on that basis made the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-20\">Since the parties' briefs were filed, the Ninth Circuit has followed <em>Hall, </em>finding that a computer file containing visual depictions of child pornography, rather than the hard drive, is an \"item\" within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2). See <em>United States v. Fellows, </em>157 F.3d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.1998). Moreover, to the extent that <em>Lacy </em>provides any guidance in interpreting \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2), it has been called into question by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vig, </em>167 F.3d 443 (8th Cir. 1999), which rejects <em>Lacy's </em>interpretation of \"matter\" under \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). Consequently, we find that the district court did not err in following <em>Hall </em>to conclude that Michalec's individual computer files were \"items\" within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-21\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-22\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
