The convening authority approved the sentence of a bad-conduct discharge and reduction to Private El.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">In reviewing this case under Article 66, UCMJ, we have examined the record of trial and considered the briefs submitted by the parties, as well as the matters personally raised by the appellant pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982). We heard oral argument on the only assigned error, which is framed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZxE\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION BY ALLOWING MS. MYRA EARLS TO TESTIFY CONCERNING THE HEARSAY STATEMENTS MADE BY [E.B.] UNDER THE RESIDUAL HEARSAY EXCEPTION, MIL.R.EVID. 803(24), WHERE THE STATEMENT DID NOT POSSESS PARTICULARIZED GUARANTEES OF TRUSTWORTHINESS, WHERE THE TESTIMONY WAS NOT MORE PROBATIVE THEN (SIC) ANY OTHER EVIDENCE OFFERED, AND WHERE THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE WAS NOT SERVED BY THE ADMISSION OF THE STATEMENTS INTO EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">We conclude that the military judge abused his discretion by admitting the hearsay statement, but we hold that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">On the day of the incident giving rise to the charge in this case, the appellant\u2019s wife, Siggy, was baby-sitting the then seven-year-old victim, E.B., and her brother. E.B. testified that it was fun at Siggy\u2019s house because she could play things like hide-and-seek with Kristie, the daughter of Siggy and the appellant. When Siggy went to the grocery store that day, the appellant, whom the children knew as \u201cCuddles,\u201d assumed the baby-sitting responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">Under the appellant\u2019s care, the children and the appellant played hide-and-seek inside the appellant\u2019s small three-bedroom apartment because the weather was inclement. When E.B. was \u201cit,\u201d she and \u201cCuddles\u201d walked into the master bedroom so the other children could hide. After E.B. climbed up on the bed, the appellant put a blindfold over her eyes. As the appellant stood in front of her, he put chocolate in E.B.\u2019s mouth. E.B. further testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-14\">Q. What did he do next, [E.B.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-15\">A. He pulled down his pants and put his pee-pee in my mouth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-16\">Q. How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-17\">A. \u2018Cause I peeked under the blindfold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-18\">Q. What is a pee-pee honey? Do girls have pee-pees? Is that a private part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU2\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-19\">Q. How do you know it was his pee-pee honey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-20\">A. \u2018Cause I peeked under it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-21\">Q. And where was (sic) his pants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-22\">A. Down on the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-23\">Q. What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-24\">A. After I peeked under, I threw it off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1O\">Q. You threw what off honey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-25\">A. The blindfold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-26\">Q. Then what\u2019d you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-27\">A. I walked out of the room to tell Kristie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-28\">Q. Did you tell Kristie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-29\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-30\">Q. Was Siggy there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-31\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Q. Where was she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-4\">A. Shopping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">Q. Did she ever come back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">Q. And did you tell her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">Q. Did she \u2014 what did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">[After a hearsay objection was overruled, the testimony continued.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-11\">Q. ... Can you say what she said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-12\">A. She said she didn\u2019t believe me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-13\">Q. She didn\u2019t believe you. Did she say you could get in trouble? Did you ever tell Siggy that you were lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-14\">A. I wasn\u2019t lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-15\">Q. You weren\u2019t lying? Did you tell your Mom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-17\">Q. How come?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-18\">A. \u2018Cause I was afraid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-19\">Q. Afraid of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-20\">A. I might get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-21\">Q. Did you tell anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-23\">Q. Who did you tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-24\">A. The student counselor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-25\">Before the trial on the merits, the military judge had conditionally granted a defense motion in limine to preclude the testimony of the student counselor, Ms. Earls. The military judge had found, as a preliminary matter, that Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony concerning what E.B. told her out-of-court would not be more probative on the pertinent issues than E.B.\u2019s own in-court testimony. Because Military Rule of Evidence 803(24)(B) [hereinafter Mil.R.Evid.] requires the proffered out-of-court statement to be more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other reasonably procurable evidence, the military judge ruled that the testimony would not be admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. The military judge made it clear, however, that his ruling was conditioned upon hearing E.B.\u2019s trial testimony and evaluating whether she testified clearly and completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-26\">During a brief and cautious cross-examination of E.B. at trial, the defense attempted to impeach E.B.\u2019s direct testimony that appellant had sexually abused her by demonstrating that she did not act as a traumatized victim when in the presence of the appellant several weeks after the incident. Specifically, the defense tried to elicit from E.B. testimony that she had returned to the Pablo residence after the alleged sexual abuse and played games with the appellant and his daughter, Jessica. The cross-examination, excluding minor portions which are unnecessary to this discussion, went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-28\">Q. Were you scared of Sergeant Pablo after the hide-n-seek game?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-29\">A. Was I scared of Kristie\u2019s dad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-30\">Q. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-31\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-32\">Q. Okay. And did you go back to Kristie\u2019s parents\u2019 house after the hide-n-seek game?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-33\">A. I was there at the hide-n-seek game.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arx-dedup-0\">Q. Did you \u2014 that was during the Christmas break?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-34\">A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-35\">Q. And after the Christmas break, do you remember going back to the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-36\">A. I don\u2019t [unfinished]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-37\">Q. Do you remember if \u2014 do you know Jessica?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-38\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-39\">Q. Who\u2019s Jessica?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-40\">A. She\u2019s my little friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-41\">Q. Does Kristie have a sister named Jessica also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-42\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-43\">Q. Did you go back to Kristie\u2019s house after the 1st of the year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-44\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-45\">After the completion of direct and cross-examination of E.B., the government reasserted that Ms. Earls should be allowed to testify about what E.B. had told her regarding the sexual abuse. In reversing his earlier ruling, the military judge made findings that E.B.\u2019s trial testimony was vague and unclear \u201cas to the events surrounding the incident in many respects.\u201d Specifically, the military judge stated that E.B.\u2019s \u201cdescription about how the [hide-and-seek] game started, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>how the game was played, how she went into the bedroom, and even at some incidents (sic), as to what occurred in the bedroom, as to how she told \u2014 reported the incident, who she told it to, what she told her \u2014 I\u2019m talking about Siggy \u2014 are vague and unclear.\u201d The military judge made additional findings of fact supporting his conclusion that E.B.\u2019s statements to Ms. Earls possessed circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. Finally, the military judge concluded that, because he found E.B.\u2019s trial testimony vague and unclear, E.B.\u2019s hearsay statements were \u201cmore probative than any other evidence before the court.\u201d Accordingly, the military judge allowed Ms. Earls to testify about E.B.\u2019s out-of-court statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The military judge permitted Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony regarding E.B.\u2019s out-of-court statements under Mil.R.Evid. 803(24), one of the two residual exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Under this rule, the following statements are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">A statement not specifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the court determines that (A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">a. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Military judges enjoy broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. Such discretion must be tempered by the recognition that the residual exception to the hearsay rule \u201cis to be used \u2018rarely and only in exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wiley, </em>36 M.J. 825, 829 (A.C.M.R. 1993) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, a \u201cruling of the military judge admitting residual hearsay is entitled to \u2018considerable discretion\u2019 on appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Pollard, </em>38 M.J. 41, 49 (C.M.A.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Powell, </em>22 M.J. 141, 145 (C.M.A.1986)). Our standard of review, therefore, is whether the military judge abused his considerable discretion. In conducting our review, the military judge\u2019s findings of fact are to be upheld on appeal unless they are \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d whereas his conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Meeks, </em>41 M.J. 150, 161 (C.M.A.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 M.J. 337, 340 (C.M.A.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">b. Admissibility of Hearsay under Residual Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">Evidence admitted under the residual exception to the hearsay rule must be both highly reliable and necessary. <em>U.S. v. Giambra, </em>33 M.J. 331, 334 (C.M.A.1991). Under the explicit language of Mil.R.Evid. 803(24), the reliability of the statement must be established by circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that are equivalent to those underlying the traditional hearsay exceptions. In this case, we are satisfied that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in finding ample circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness in E.B.\u2019s out-of-court statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">The more troubling issue in this case, however, is whether the military judge abused his discretion in finding E.B.\u2019s testimony vague and unclear and concluding, therefore, that the hearsay statements were necessary. Under Mil.R.Evid. 803(24)(B), such hearsay is \u201cnecessary\u201d when it is more probative than any other reasonably procurable evidence. <em>United States v. Giambra, </em>33 M.J. at 334. <em>See also United States v. Ureta, </em>44 M.J. 290, 296 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1059, 117 S.Ct. 692, 136 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997). The military judge made findings of fact that E.B.\u2019s trial testimony was vague and unclear regarding how the hide-and-seek game started and was played, how she went into the bedroom, what occurred in the bedroom, to whom she reported the incident, and what she told Siggy. With regard to these findings, the only portion of E.B.\u2019s direct testimony which could be construed as vague or unclear dealt with how she physically came into the appellant\u2019s bedroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Q. How did you get there [into appellant\u2019s bedroom]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-4\">A. I walked in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">Q. You remember walking in? Do you know if he carried you in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-7\">Q. You don\u2019t remember? That\u2019s okay. What did you do \u2014 what happened when you were in the bedroom? Where did you go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-8\">A. On his bed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Based on this testimony, the military judge found that E.B.\u2019s testimony was vague and unclear as to \u201chow she went into the bedroom.\u201d Although we believe that any vagueness or lack of clarity stems more from the trial counsel\u2019s compound questions than from E.B.\u2019s answers, the military judge\u2019s finding on this particular point cannot be termed \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Aside from this one finding, however, the remainder of the findings that E.B.\u2019s testimony was vague and unclear \u2014 about how the game began; how it was played; what occurred in the bedroom; and what, how, and to whom she reported the sexual abuse \u2014 are simply unsupported by the record. To the contrary, we find that E.B. was particularly definite, clear, and unequivocal in her direct testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we are compelled by the record to conclude that the foundational findings of fact, except with regard to how E.B. entered the bedroom, were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">Having found that all but one of the findings of fact were clearly erroneous, the core issue remains: Whether Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony \u2014 about what E.B. <em>told </em>her had happened \u2014 was necessary because it was more probative of what did or did not happen than E.B.\u2019s own trial testimony. In our view, the imprecision of the evidence regarding how E.B. entered the bedroom does not support the necessity for presenting to the members her entire out-of-court statement about the appellant\u2019s sexual abuse. <em>See United States v. Lyons, </em>36 M.J. 183 (C.M.A.1992) (military judge carefully restricted the scope of the out-of-court statement admitted into evidence). As it turns out, Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony did not even address how E.B. entered the bedroom, nor did it clarify any of the other matters cited by the military judge as vague. What Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony did was essentially repeat E.B.\u2019s in-court testimony. Concluding, as we must, that E.B. testified clearly, unequivocally, and completely on all material issues, the only logical conclusion is that the out-of-court statement was not more probative than E.B.\u2019s in-court testimony. After all, what could be more probative on the point of the sexual abuse than the victim\u2019s own in-court testimony that she was sexually abused?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the hearsay statement fails the probativeness prong of Mil.R.Evid. 803(24), we hold that the military judge abused his considerable discretion in admitting Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony under the residual exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">c. Harmless Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">In view of our holding that the military judge abused his discretion in admitting the evidence, we must decide whether the error requires reversal under Article 59(a), UCMJ. Because the defense had a full and free opportunity to cross-examine E.B., the appellant was not denied his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985). Therefore, since the error was not of constitutional dimension, the standard for assessing the error in this case is whether the error was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>harmless, not whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Pollard, </em>38 M.J. 41, 51-52 (C.M.A.1993); <em>compare United States v. Jacobs, </em>48 M.J. 208 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The <em>Pollard </em>court applied harmless error as explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 760, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). Under the <em>Kotteakos-Pollard </em>analysis, whether the error in this case was harmless depends on whether we can say with \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the improperly admitted evidence did not have a <em>\u201csubstantial </em>influence\u201d on the findings. 38 M.J. at 52 (emphasis added). The standard is not whether we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of guilt aside from the error. We are required to consider all the evidence, without stripping out the error, when we decide whether the error substantially influenced the findings of guilty. If we conclude that the error substantially influenced the guilty findings, we must reverse; if it did not, the error is harmless. The burden is on the government to persuade us that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In deciding whether erroneously admitted hearsay is harmless or reversible, courts analyze how important the hearsay evidence was to the government\u2019s case; whether it was cumulative; the existence or not of corroborating evidence; the relative strength and weakness of the government and defense eases; and, perhaps most important, whether the witness whose out-of-court testimony has been admitted is subjected to in-court cross-examination. These factors apply to both harmless error analysis and when harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is the applicable standard. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>40 M.J. 405 (C.M.A.1994); <em>United States v. Grooters, </em>39 M.J. 269 (C.M.A.1994); <em>U.S. v. Pollard, </em>38 M.J. 41 (C.M.A.1993); <em>United States v. Batten, </em>31 M.J. 205 (C.M.A. 1990); <em>U.S. v. Wiley, </em>36 M.J. 825 (A.C.M.R. 1993). We will apply these factors to decide whether the error was harmless or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The prosecution\u2019s case was quite strong. It rested on E.B.\u2019s clear and unequivocal testimony that the appellant dropped his pants and put his \u201cpee-pee\u201d in her mouth. She related a coherent, step-by-step description of the events before, during, and after the abuse, and her testimony was internally consistent and deta\u00f1ed. E.B.\u2019s trial testimony and her out-of-court statements to Ms. Earls are consistent. Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony was cumulative with E.B.\u2019s in-court testimony and nonessential to the government\u2019s case. Nothing in the record directly contradicts E.B.\u2019s definite testimony that the appellant sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">E.B.\u2019s testimony was substantia\u00fcy corroborated by Kristie and the appellant\u2019s own out-of-court statement. After confirming E.B.\u2019s description about the game, Kristie testified that she saw the appellant, her father, standing in front of E.B., who was on the bed. Kristie then hid in the living room. Kristie testified that after E.B. came out of the bedroom, E.B. made an excited utterance that \u201cCuddles\u201d had put a \u201cweiner\u201d in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">In addition to Kristie\u2019s corroboration of E.B.\u2019s testimony, one of the appe\u00f1ant\u2019s coworkers further corroborated the events. Sergeant (SGT) Carter testified that the appellant admitted to him that he had played hide-and-seek with E.B., had taken her to the bedroom, blindfolded her eyes, put her on the bed, and was going to give her some candy. The appellant told SGT Carter that E.B. had accused him of sticking his finger in her mouth. Nowhere else in the record is there the slightest suggestion that E.B. said appellant had put his finger in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">In comparison, the defense case was weak. Aside from cross-examination of the government witnesses, the defense presented the testimony of Jessica and Kristie, the appellant\u2019s daughters, as its only merits witnesses. Jessica testified that she was in Alabama at the time of the charged offense. She testified that after she returned, E.B. visited her home and reacted normaUy to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Kristie testified for the defense on direct about a normal game of hide-and-seek, and she made no mention that E.B. complained of sexual abuse. On cross-examination, however, she corroborated E.B.\u2019s excited utterance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>as summarized above, that \u201cCuddles\u201d had put his \u201cweiner\u201d in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Viewing all the evidence of record, we are convinced that the great weight of the evidence proved the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On balance, the government\u2019s case was convincingly strong, and the defense case was unpersuasive and weak. Within this context, the erroneously admitted hearsay amounted to cumulative bolstering. The defense had a full opportunity to cross-examine E.B., both as to the substantive allegations and her out-of-court statements. Considering all the evidence, we find with fair assurance that the cumulative hearsay evidence did not substantially influence the findings of guilty of indecent acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Pollard, </em>38 M.J. at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We have considered the matters personally raised by the appellant pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982). They merit no comment or relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Judge MERCK concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-12\">. We acknowledge that, on cross-examination, E.B.\u2019s testimony demonstrates confusion about whether she returned to the Pablo\u2019s home after the time that the sexual abuse occurred; hut, again, the confusion may have been the result of inartful questioning. Also, on cross-examination, E.B. testified that she did not know whether Jessica was Kristie\u2019s sister. This is completely understandable as Jessica and Kristie were half-sisters. Even so, Jessica was not present during the incident, so any confusion regarding her is collateral. In any event, the military judge did not cite either point as his basis for finding E.B.\u2019s testimony vague and unclear; Ms. Earls did not explain or contribute to clarifying those points; and, the alleged confusion centered on matters in defense. The defense, of course, vigorously opposed the testimony of Ms. Earls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-17\">. We paraphrase Judge Cox, now the Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, in <em>United States v.

Even if we were required to apply the more stringent constitutional standard of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we would reach the same conclusion that the findings should not be reversed. The harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard requires us to decide \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963); <em>see also United States v. Morgan, </em>40 M.J. 405 (C.M.A. 1994). In view of the strength of the government's case, as established by the definite, unwavering, and clear testimony of the victim as corroborated by the appellant and his daughter, we are convinced there was no reasonable likelihood that the inadmissible evidence contributed to the appellant's conviction. We are convinced that, if Ms. Earls had not testified, the members would have found the appellant guilty of, at least, indecent acts. Therefore, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b828-8\">KAPLAN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"afv-dedup-1\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">I agree completely with my fellow judges that the testimony of Ms. Earls was inadmissible hearsay, and that the military judge committed legal error when he allowed this testimony to go before the court-martial panel. I respectfully decline to join in their follow-on holding that this error was harmless, or harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, depending on the standard applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">My brothers have concluded that because of the cumulative nature of the erroneously admitted testimony, its admission is, therefore, clearly harmless. Their logic, as I understand it, is as follows: The victim, E.B., testified that the appellant had committed sodomy upon her by placing his penis in her mouth while she was blindfolded. She testified that she knew this happened because she \u201cpeeked.\u201d Her testimony was corroborated, at least peripherally, by the testimony of Kristie, the appellant\u2019s daughter, and by Sergeant Carter, a co-worker of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">The disagreement I have with my brothers\u2019 legal conclusion that Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony was merely cumulative is that I find the testimony, at one and the same time, more corroborative of the crime of indecent acts than the testimony of Kristie and Sergeant Carter, and less corroborative of, or even arguably in conflict with, E.B.\u2019s testimony that she had been sodomized by the appellant. Ms. Earls testified, upon cross-examination, that E.B. had never related seeing the appellant\u2019s penis or describing it. The court-martial panel returned a finding of not guilty of sodomy, but guilty of indecent acts with a child. The logical conclusion is that Ms. Earls\u2019 erroneously admitted testimony raised the reasonable doubt that resulted in the finding of not guilty of the more serious offense and the guilty finding as to the lesser included offense. In this respect, it appears to have substantially bolstered E.B.\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">The problem, as I see it, is that this case presents the classic conundrum of whether the glass is half-full or half-empty. The majority seems to view the improperly admitted testimony as having had a minimal effect on the panel\u2019s findings because of its cumulative nature. However, can we conclude, with \u201cfair assurance,\u201d Ms. Earls\u2019 testimony did not have the effect of overwhelming the appellant\u2019s entitlement to a presumption of innocence? In other words, because the panel members were not convinced beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>sonable doubt, based on E.B.\u2019s testimony, that sodomy had been committed, (i.e., the glass was empty of proof of guilt of sodomy), how can we be sure that the improper testimony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not have the effect of filling the glass half-full so as to support the guilty finding of indecent acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that when legal error has been committed, we may only affirm those findings that we determine with \u201cfair assurance\u201d have not been substantially influenced by such error. <em>See United States v. Pollard, </em>38 M.J. 41, 49 (C.M.A.1993). When the error is of Constitutional dimension, we must eliminate every \u201creasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Batten, </em>31 M.J. 205, 211 (C.M.A. 1990). I am unable to conclude, without resorting to unbridled speculation as to what effect the erroneously admitted testimony had on the minds of the panel members, that either of these standards have been satisfied in this case. Therefore, based on the error noted, I would set aside the findings of guilty and authorize a full rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-13\">.
