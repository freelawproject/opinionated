The convening authority approved the sentence of a dishonorable discharge, 8 years\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-28\">We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>I. WHETHER APPELLANT WAS DENIED A FAIR TRIAL WHEN THE MILITARY JUDGE ABANDONED HIS ROLE AS AN IMPARTIAL AND NEUTRAL ARBITER AND ASSUMED THE ROLE OF A PARTISAN ADVOCATE FOR THE PROSECUTION BY BADGERING APPELLANT WITH A QUESTION HE KNEW APPELLANT COULD NOT ANSWER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">II. WHETHER APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE BECAUSE THE MILITARY JUDGE RULED THAT HE COULD NOT ANSWER THE JUDGE\u2019S QUESTION ABOUT THE REASONING PROCESS THAT LED HIM TO MAKE SEXUAL ADVANCES ON THE ALLEGED VICTIM.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We also specified the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A62\">WHETHER APPELLANT WAS DENIED THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WHEN THE MILITARY JUDGE RULED A MEMBER\u2019S QUESTION CALLED FOR AN IMPERMISSIBLE RESPONSE FROM APPELLANT, INSTRUCTED APPELLANT TO NOT GIVE THE ANSWER, AND THEN PROCEEDED TO ASK SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND ALLOW TRIAL COUNSEL TO ASK SIMILAR QUESTIONS WHICH CALLED FOR THE ANSWER APPELLANT HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO GIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We now reverse for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Lance Corporal Salyer, the ex-girlfriend of appellant\u2019s roommate, Lance Corporal Elder, became extremely intoxicated while celebrating her birthday at the Tri-Mod Enlisted Club. She went with Elder back to his room, where the two engaged in sexual intercourse. Afterwards, Elder went back to the club. A few hours later, Elder told appellant that he did not want to spend the night with Salyer but that appellant could. Appellant went back to the room and began petting Salyer. She became aroused and, according to appellant, moved his hands down to her panties. Eventually, they had sexual intercourse after she removed her panties, during which she grabbed him around the back and made moaning sounds. After appellant had ejaculated, Salyer asked him if he was Elder\u2019s roommate. When appellant replied yes, she pushed him off. That is the first thing that she remembers. She then got dressed, left the room, went downstairs, and began to cry. She reported what happened to the military police.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">The granted and specified issues are tied directly together and stem from an exchange at an Article 39(a) <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> session held to rule on the admissibility of appellant\u2019s sworn answer to a member\u2019s question. Appellant was on the stand as a witness in his own defense. One of the members submitted a set of questions (AE XXIV), and trial counsel called for a 39(a) session on the last one: \u201cAt the time prior to intercourse, did you have reason to believe she would have had intercourse with you if she had known who you were?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">After the members were excused, counsel and the military judge discussed the proposed question. The military judge pointed out that the question basically asked for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer, and trial counsel agreed that she had no objection to the form of the question. What trial counsel wanted to know was, if appellant had such a belief, what was the basis for that belief. The military judge put the question as originally asked to appellant, and he answered, \u201cYes, I do, sir.\u201d The judge then asked him what that reason was. Appellant\u2019s answer: \u201cSir, she\u2019s known around the barracks as being easy. I mean, I know many people that have only been with her for one night or have only known her for a very, very short time and have been with her sexually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">Trial counsel objected to the question on the basis that sexual reputation is inadmissible under Mil.R.Evid. 401 and 412, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Before the members were called back in, the following exchange occurred between the military judge and appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">MJ: PFC, let me caution you now. Nowhere in your response are you going to utter what you believe you have heard her reputation to be around the barracks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">Do we understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">WIT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">MJ: I don\u2019t want those words coming off your lips in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">Bring the members back in, please.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Once the members returned, the military judge asked appellant the permissible questions from AE XXIV. The military judge then began to address a second member\u2019s questions (AE XXV), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">Q[MJ]: Describe in your own words then \u2014 addressing [AE] XXV, and those past two questions have been related to this document \u2014 describe in your own words why you thought you could take advantage of somebody that you hardly knew and that you knew to be drunk and passed out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">A[WIT]: Sir, at that point in time, I didn\u2019t know if she was passed out or not. I made a sexual move towards her to see if there would be any response back towards me as in anything leading to sexual intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">Q: Let me stop you. I understand what you did. My question to you is why? That is, you\u2019re telling me that you made a sexual move towards her. You didn\u2019t know her; you knew her to be drunk or at least intoxicated or having drunk \u2014 having something to drink that evening and had thrown up. You previously testified that although you didn\u2019t know with absolute certainty, you believed her at least to be asleep. What was there in your mind that led you to believe you could, to use your words, make a sexual move on her? What was going through your mind at that time that made you believe that it was appropriate to do that? Or can you answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-13\">A: I can\u2019t answer that. I can\u2019t answer that, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Of course, appellant had an answer, a truthful answer. However, it was not admissible per the judge\u2019s ruling at the close of the Article 39(a) session, and the judge had been very firm in telling appellant what he could not say. Yet the judge persisted in asking the very same question which he previously had told appellant he could not answer. Appellant could only respond the way the judge told him to respond during the Article 39(a) session. Then the military judge did it again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-15\">Q: I believe this is the question that you\u2019ve already said you ean\u2019t answer, but let me make certain of that. As you sit here, can you describe in your own words what the thoughts were that were going through your mind that prompted you to make this move on her sexually to see what kind of response you would get? Were you attracted to her? Was it just a desire for sex with her? I mean, you tell me, or can you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-16\">A: Sir, yes, I am attracted to her; but other than that, I can\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">After these questions by the military judge, trial counsel re-crossed, and then some more questions from members were asked. Appellant was studiously avoiding answering in any way that was close to that about which the judge had admonished him. Finally, trial counsel asked even more questions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-18\">Q: PFC Watt, in answer to one of the member\u2019s questions, had you ever gone up and tried to meet her because if you were so attracted to her, you said, no, you\u2019re not the type of person that would just go up and try to meet someone; right? That\u2019s what you just said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-19\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-20\">Q: But you\u2019d go up and just have sex with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-21\">A: Ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t answer that question right now because I was instructed by the judge not to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-22\">Q: PFC Watt, the question\u2019s very simple. You wouldn\u2019t \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t go up and say, Hi, my name is PFC Ken Watt. You\u2019re not the type of person that would say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"au5-dedup-0\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Q: That\u2019s what you just answered, the judge\u2019s question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">Q: You\u2019re not the type of person who would go up and introduce yourself and say hello when you\u2019d just seen someone else, that you\u2019re not that type of person? A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">Q: And that you\u2019re not the type of person \u2014 but you are the type of person, you also testified \u2014 that would just go up and have sex with someone without introducing yourself. That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">A: Ma\u2019am, I didn\u2019t say I\u2019d just go up and have sex with somebody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">Q: So you are the type of person, based on your testimony, that would have sex with someone that you hadn\u2019t met?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">Q: But you are too shy to meet them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">A: Ma\u2019am, like I said earlier, I made a sexual motion towards her and she granted it by her actions, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">Q: PFC Watt, that\u2019s not my question. You\u2019re too shy to go up and meet her; is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">Q: But you\u2019re not too shy to go and have sex with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-17\">A: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-18\">Q: Even though you hadn\u2019t met her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-19\">A: True.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-20\">Q: Even though you didn\u2019t say hello? Even though you didn\u2019t say, \u201cMy name is PFC Ken Watt\u201d? Even though you didn\u2019t say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-21\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-22\">Q: Do you know how ridiculous you sound?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-23\">MJ: The members will disregard that last comment. It was inappropriate and should not have been made and you may not consider it for any reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-24\">Captain Ryan [trial counsel], that will not be done again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">Trial defense counsel never objected to the line of questioning by either the military judge or trial counsel. Nor did defense counsel request another Article 39(a) session to address this questioning in light of the previous session.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-29\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-30\">An honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to consent is a defense in rape cases. <em>United States v. Willis, 41 MJ 435, </em>438 (1995); <em>United States v. True, </em>41 MJ 424, 426 (1995); <em>United States v. Greaves, </em>40 MJ 432, 433 (CMA 1994); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>26 MJ 127, 128 (CMA 1988). In <em>United States v. Woolheater, </em>40 MJ 170, 173 (CMA 1994), the Court held that a defendant has a constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-31\">In <em>Greaves, </em>the Court held that the defendant\u2019s beliefs about the victim\u2019s sexual relations, if any, with persons unknown to him, were not relevant to whether the victim was actually consenting with him at that time. 40 MJ at 437-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-32\">At issue in this case is the role of the judge as to this defense. \u201c[A] military judge has a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to insure that an accused receives a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>38 MJ 126,129 n. * (CMA 1993). In performing this function, the judge should \u201cscrupulously avoid[] even the slightest appearance of partiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Shackelford, </em>2 MJ 17,19 (CMA 1976). \u201cPublic confidence in the integrity and impartiality of a judge is sustained in large part by the conduct of a judge during the proceeding____ In the military, a judge may not abandon his role as an impartial party and assist in the conviction of a specific accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>24 MJ 261, 264 (CMA 1987). The judge is not a \u201cmere figurehead\u201d or \u201csimply an umpire in a contest between the Government and accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimble, </em>23 USCMA 251, 253, 49 CMR 384, 386 (1974). The judge, pursuant to RCM 801(c), Manual, <em>supra, </em>has authority to \u201cobtain evidence in addition to that presented by the parties.\u201d Likewise, Mil.R.Evid. 614(b), Manual, <em>supra, </em>permits the judge to question witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-35\">These duties require a delicate balance by the military judge. \u201cBecause \u2018jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>are ever watchful of the words that fall from him,\u2019 a military judge must be circumspect in what he says to the parties and in how he examines witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Loving, </em>41 MJ 213, 253 (1994) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>517 U.S. 748, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 135 L.Ed.2d 36(1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Here, the military judge compounded the problem created by the questioning, and most likely encouraged the doubts of the members, by instructing them as follows on appellant\u2019s answer to trial counsel\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAq\">Members of the court, in response to a question from Captain Ryan, the accused indicated that he can\u2019t answer that question because I instructed him he could not during an Article 39(a) session in response to a question from me. The accused responded with an answer that was inadmissible as evidence and improper for you to hear, and I instructed him that he would not repeat that in this courtroom. That remains my ruling. You may not consider his answer that he can\u2019t answer that question because I told him not to for any reason whatsoever. It remains improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG8\">Far from rectifying the error, the military judge\u2019s actions and this instruction more than likely led the court members into believing that appellant had no basis (as distinguished from an inadmissible reason) for believing that the victim consented. By permitting the question but handcuffing appellant from answering, the military judge enabled the prosecution to argue that appellant was a liar, and that his explanation for believing that the victim consented was \u201cridiculous.\u201d Appellant was forced to sound like he had sex with a sleeping woman and did not know why.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Absent any assistance from the judge or defense counsel, including proper instructions, appellant was in fact left to defend himself without assistance and with no knowledge of the rules of criminal procedure or the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed. The findings of guilty and sentence are set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. A rehearing may be ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\"> Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b268-7\">GIERKE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Apf\">(concurring in part and in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">I agree with the result and rationale of the majority opinion. However, I decline to join any suggestion that defense counsel was ineffective.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b268-9\">SULLIVAN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AzFh\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">I dissent. It may well have been unfair (and perhaps legal error) for the judge to allow appellant to be put in a position while he was testifying where he could not give full answers to questions that were being asked of him. I note, however, that no legal authority for such error is cited by the majority. In any event, I believe such error, if it did occur, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Under the controlling law in this case, the prosecution was required to show that appellant had sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent. Even if the prosecution had established that the alleged victim did not consent, appellant might still have defended himself on the basis that he made an honest and reasonable mistake of fact as to the alleged victim\u2019s consent. Clearly, evidence of the alleged victim\u2019s reputation for engaging in sexual intercourse was not relevant or admissible to show that she consented to appellant on the night in question. <em>See United States v. Greaves, </em>40 MJ 432 (CMA 1994). However, evidence of an accused\u2019s knowledge of the alleged victim\u2019s sexual reputation <em>could, </em>in some circumstances, be a factor which might bear on the honesty of a claim of mistake as to consent in a particular rape case. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>41 MJ 435, 438 (1995); <em>United States v. True, </em>41 MJ 424, 426 (1995); <em>United States v. Elvine, </em>16 MJ 14, 18 (CMA 1983). Nevertheless, as this Court said in <em>Elvine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">[T]he fact that appellant knew that she had some type of reputation for \u201ccoming on\u201d in her unit was not shown to be an important issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Here, like in <em>Elvine, </em>the fact that appellant knew the sexual reputation of the victim as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cbeing easy\u201d was not important or \u201cweighty.\u201d <em>See United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 307, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 1264, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). This reputation evidence was not important here, because the victim was sick, asleep, and in such a drunken state that she could not have consented. Moreover, appellant had not even met the victim before he raped her. In these circumstances, undisputed at trial, it would not matter what the sexual reputation of the victim was \u2014 such a drunken victim could not give consent anyway since she was passed out and incoherent. <em>See United States v. Palmer, </em>33 MJ 7, 9 (CMA 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is also undisputed that appellant knew she was in this state, not only by his personal observation of her drunken condition, but because Lance Corporal Elder told him so, and even told appellant not to \u201cmess with her.\u201d Therefore, I conclude that the judge properly tried to keep out the evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual reputation pursuant to Mil.R.Evid. 412, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The judge clearly did so in a poor fashion. That may have amounted to error, but as I have said before, if it was error, it was harmless in this case. The jury properly heard all the relevant evidence concerning the alleged victim\u2019s condition and appellant\u2019s knowledge of it. In my view, it overwhelmingly showed her incapacity and appellant\u2019s knowledge of that fact. Appellant\u2019s state of mind concerning the victim\u2019s consent was simply not material in this context. <em>See generally United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982)(constitutional violation requires showing denial of testimony which would be material and helpful to defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">No one has the right to rape an unconscious, drunken female. It does not matter what the victim\u2019s reputation in this case was, or whether she was a nun or a prostitute, or what appellant believed her reputation was. <em>See United States v. Palmer, supra. </em>I would affirm. Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
