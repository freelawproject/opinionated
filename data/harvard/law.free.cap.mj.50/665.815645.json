The military judge sentenced appellant to a dismissal, confinement for six months, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, the convening authority approved a sentence to confinement for thirty days and the remainder of the adjudged sentence. Appellant\u2019s case is before the court for judicial review as mandated by Congress under Article 66, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">In a unique assignment of error, appellant requests that we set aside the convening authority\u2019s action until the Secretary of the Army<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> acts upon appellant\u2019s pending request for Resignation for the Good of the Service in Lieu of Court-Martial. Government appellate counsel agree that the court should grant \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d We find that appellant is entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Appellant, an Individual Mobilization Aug-mentee (IMA) in the Army Reserve, was ordered to active duty in September 1996 and assigned to duty with the Military Traffic Management Command in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. On 11 September 1996, appellant was issued a government American Express credit card to be used for official government business. Between 21 October and 4 December 1996, appellant charged $6,000.00 to his government credit card for \u201cadult entertainment services\u201d including live sex shows, pornographic movies, striptease shows, and prostitutes at an adult club in the red light district of Rotterdam. On 2 December 1996, appellant used cocaine at a party and lied about it in a sworn written statement to criminal investigators on 21 January 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Appellant was arraigned on 3 June 1997. He subsequently submitted a request for Resignation for the Good of the Service in Lieu of Court-Martial, dated 18 June 1997,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under Chapter 3 of Army Regulation 600-8-24, Officer Transfers and Discharges (21 July 1995) [hereinafter AR 600-8-24].</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">Thereafter, on 17 July 1997, appellant signed an Offer to Plead Guilty, which the convening authority approved on 21 July 1997. Under the terms of his pretrial agreement, appellant agreed to plead guilty to the charges and specifications of which he was convicted in exchange for the convening authority\u2019s promise to disapprove any adjudged confinement in excess of thirty days. The government further agreed to present no evidence on an additional specification under Article 134, UCMJ, charging appellant with dishonorable failure to pay just debts in the amount of $29,620.67 that appellant charged to his American Express credit card. The pretrial agreement also required appellant to submit a written request for voluntary excess leave in the event appellant completed serving his confinement before the convening authority took final action on appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Appellant was tried and sentenced on 23 July 1997. On 18 August 1997, after appellant served his agreed upon maximum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>thirty days confinement (minus applicable good time), the convening authority approved appellant\u2019s request for voluntary excess leave. Appellant returned to the United States and was placed on voluntary excess leave pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The military judge authenticated the record of trial on 2 September 1997. On 9 September 1997, the recommendation of the staff judge advocate was served on appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel. Appellant submitted a clemency petition, dated 7 October 1997, to the convening authority under Rule for Courts-Martial 1105 [hereinafter R.C.MJ. In this petition, appellant thanked the convening authority for his \u201cfairness and compassion in minimizing my confinement by accepting my pretrial offer to plead guilty. Confinement was a frightening and humbling experience, but I realize now it could have been much worse.\u201d The appellant requested that the convening authority grant him clemency by disapproving the findings and sentence of his court-martial and recommending approval of his resignation request. Neither appellant nor his trial defense counsel asked the convening authority to defer taking action on appellant\u2019s case until the Secretary acted upon his resignation request.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">On 21 October 1997, the convening authority took action on appellant\u2019s court-martial in accordance with the terms of the pretrial agreement. Five months later, the Army Review Boards Agency received appellant\u2019s resignation request. The Deputy Assistant Secretary (Army Review Boards) has apparently decided to defer any decision on appellant\u2019s resignation request pending decision by this court on \u201cthe validity of the convening authority\u2019s action on the sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>appellant\u2019s brief, Appendix C.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Appellant now argues, for the first time, that the convening authority had no authority to take action on his case because of the provisions of AR 600-8-24 and the \u201cprocedural requirements\u201d enunciated in <em>United States v. Woods, </em>26 M.J. 372 (C.M.A.1988) and <em>United States v. Moore, </em>32 M.J. 554 (A.C.M.R.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Army Regulation 600-8-24 provides that when an officer pending trial by general court-martial submits a request for Resignation for the Good of the Service in Lieu of Court-Martial, such a tender does not suspend the court-martial proceedings. However, in such cases, the convening authority \u201cwill ... not take action on the findings and sentence\u201d of the court-martial until the Secretary has acted upon that officer\u2019s resignation request. AR 600-8-24, para. 3-13b.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">In <em>Woods, </em>the issue before a divided three-member United States Court of Military Appeals was whether the Secretary\u2019s approval of a resignation in lieu of court-martial vacated the previous action of the convening authority. Chief Judge Everett and Judge Cox concluded, in separate opinions, that they \u201cshould\u201d abate, set aside, and dismiss the already completed court-martial proceedings to enforce the Secretary\u2019s intent when he accepted the resignation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Woods, </em>26 M.J. at 375. In his dissenting opinion, Judge Sullivan concluded that a Secretary\u2019s administrative act could not void a Federal conviction unless authorized by the Constitution or Federal law. <em>Woods, </em>26 M.J. at 375-76. Judge Cox agreed with the principle that courts-martial are judicial, not administrative, proceedings that require an act of judicial character to convene them, to affirm or disaffirm their findings and sentence on appellate review, or to otherwise abate them. <em>Woods, </em>26 M.J. at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">In <em>Moore, </em>this court set aside the convening authority\u2019s first action because the court was unable to determine the facts surrounding Moore\u2019s attempt to resign or what happened to his resignation request. <em>Moore, </em>32 M.J. at 554. Unlike the <em>Moore </em>case, appellant\u2019s resignation request is not lost or misplaced, but is in the Secretary\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">We find that the opinions in Woods and <em>Moore </em>are not applicable to appellant\u2019s situation and decline to expand their holdings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>beyond their specific facts. The facts in appellant\u2019s case are not only clear, but are also different from the facts in <em>Woods </em>and <em>Moore, </em>and do not entitle appellant to any relief for at least four different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">First, military appellate courts do not issue advisory opinions. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>10 M.J. 269 (C.M.A.1981); <em>United States v. Flores-Galarza, </em>40 M.J. 900, 908 (N.M.C.M.R.1994). Appellant asks this court to set aside the convening authority\u2019s action because of a <em>possibility </em>that the Secretary <em>may </em>approve appellant\u2019s resignation. Appellant asks us to <em>assume </em>that the Secretary will approve appellant\u2019s resignation thereby creating a situation similar to that in <em>Woods. </em>Those facts are not before the court at this time and we decline to issue an advisory opinion based upon a hypothetical set of facts that may never materialize. The Secretary has full legal authority to act upon appellant\u2019s request for resignation without this court first setting aside the convening authority\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Second, it is not clear that appellant was eligible to submit a request for Resignation for the Good of the Service in Lieu of Court-Martial under AR 600-8-24. When appellant submitted his resignation in June .1997 he was serving on active duty as a member of the Selected Reserve pursuant to a Presidential order to active duty under the authority of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12304.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paragraph 3-la, AR 600-8-24, states that <em>\u201c[ejxcept as provided in b below, </em>any officer of the Active Army or USAR may tender a resignation <em>under provisions of this chapter\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Paragraph 3-lb, AR 600-8-24, provides that United States Army Reserve officers on active duty \u201cpursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12304 (Presidential Selected Reserve) will request resignations under the provisions of AR 135-175. Before such a request is submitted, they must be released from their active duty status.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If appellant\u2019s resignation request did not comply with the terms of AR 600-8-24, then the convening authority was under no obligation to comply with its provisions either.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Appellant\u2019s situation differs significantly from <em>Woods </em>where \u201cthe [applicable] regulation sets forth the procedures [for submitting a resignation in lieu of court-martial], and <em>it cannot be disputed that they were followed.\u201d Woods, </em>26 M.J. at 374 (emphasis added). Ultimately, whether the Secretary intended to permit United States Army Reserve members on active duty under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 12304 to submit a request for Resignation for the Good of the Service in Lieu of CourF-Martial is a matter for the Secretary\u2019s determination, not ours. We simply note that on this record, we do not find that appellant has fully complied with AR 600-8-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Third, assuming arguendo that AR 600-8-24 applies, appellant alleges no material prejudice, and we find none, from the convening authority\u2019s action. If AR 600-8-24 applies, then the convening authority violated paragraph 3-13b thereof when he took action in appellant\u2019s case prior to a decision by the Secretary on appellant\u2019s resignation request. Assuming further that a violation of this regulation constitutes an error of law, such an error of law does not invalidate a finding or sentence of a court-martial \u201cunless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.\u201d UCMJ art. 59(a). The Secretary has appellant\u2019s resignation request and may act upon it at any time. Appellant cites no authority for the proposition that a convening authority\u2019s action in contravention of an Army regulation automatically renders that action void <em>ab initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Finally, we find that appellant intentionally negotiated away at least one of his procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>al rights in AR 600-8-24 for a more favorable pretrial agreement. Paragraph 3-13, concerning resignations in lieu of court-martial, provides that an officer \u201cwill be retained\u201d on active duty until \u201cfinal disposition\u201d of the charges or until the officer\u2019s resignation is approved. AR 600-8-24, para. 3-13c. Appellant elected to trade this right for a favorable cap on the period of confinement he must serve and an agreement not to prosecute him for his alleged dishonorable failure to pay over $29,000.00 in just debts. Appellant\u2019s willingness to go on voluntary excess leave immediately after he served thirty days of confinement undoubtedly permitted appellant to negotiate a more favorable pretrial agreement. Without such an agreement, appellant had a statutory and regulatory right to remain on active duty until the convening authority took action on his court-martial proceedings. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 76a; AR 600-8-24, para. 3-13e.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Appellant\u2019s post-trial clemency petition to the convening authority demonstrates his considerable satisfaction with the terms of his negotiated pretrial agreement. There is nothing in his clemency petition to indicate appellant\u2019s belief, or his intention, that the convening authority would keep appellant on active duty or defer taking action on appellant\u2019s court-martial until a decision by the Secretary on appellant\u2019s request for resignation. Appellant\u2019s looming confinement differs significantly from the facts in <em>Moore </em>and <em>Woods. </em>Moore received no adjudged confinement. <em>Moore, </em>32 M.J. at 554. In <em>Woods, </em>the convening authority approved Woods\u2019 written request for deferment of confinement. <em>Woods, </em>21 M.J. at 858. In this case, appellant did not negotiate or request a deferment of confinement. The convening authority had no authority to grant deferment without such a request. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 57(b) and 57a(a); R.C.M. 1101(c)(2). Under these circumstances, we are completely satisfied that there is no reason for us to set aside the convening authority\u2019s action in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Secretarial Options</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">In enacting the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Congress created a system of shared authority over military justice among the President, the judiciary, the Secretaries of the military departments, and The Judge Advocates General.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a matter of comity, military appellate 001014; decisions should avoid, whenever possible, limiting, expanding, or otherwise disturbing the Secretary\u2019s exercise of his Congressionally granted authority under the UCMJ. <em>See Woods, </em>26 M.J. at 374. We have taken great care to adhere to this principle and to not intrude on the Secretary\u2019s authority. The Secretary still has a variety of options regarding appellant\u2019s request for resignation. They include:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">1. Return appellant\u2019s request for resignation without action after a Secretarial determination that it was not submitted under the correct regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">2. Determine that appellant\u2019s request for resignation was properly submitted but disapprove it on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">3. Commute, remit, or suspend appellant\u2019s sentence, or any part of it, as the Secretary sees fit. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 71(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">4. Disapprove appellant\u2019s request for resignation, execute his dismissal, and then substitute an administrative form of discharge for the dismissal. <em>See </em>UCMJ art. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">5. Approve appellant\u2019s resignation with the specific intent to vacate the entire court-martial proceedings. This is the situation addressed in the Woods case. In our judgment, it is not certain that the current United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (formerly the United States Court of Military Appeals) would expand the <em>Woods </em>holding to the facts of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b833-18\">Appellant\u2019s request that we set aside the convening authority\u2019s action is denied. The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-19\">Senior Judge TOOMEY and Judge NOVAK concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\">. As used in this opinion, the term \"Secretary\u201d refers to the Secretary of the Army, his Under Secretary, designated Assistant Secretary, or designated Deputy Assistant Secretary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-11\">. The record of trial does not contain a copy of appellant's request for resignation. Appellate defense counsel attached a copy of appellant\u2019s request for resignation as an \"appendix\u201d to appellant's brief (Appendix A). Other appendices enclosed with appellant\u2019s brief include a 1 June 1998 letter from appellant (Appendix B) and a 25 June 1998 declaration from an assistant legal counsel for the Army Review Boards Agency (Appendix C). Appellate defense counsel have not submitted a motion for the court to consider these extra-record materials, as required by Rule 23 of the court\u2019s Internal Rules of Practice and Procedure. Because it is apparent that appellant desires the court to consider appendices A, B, and C, and in the interest of judicial economy, we have admitted them on our own motion. We remind appellate counsel to comply with the court\u2019s Internal Rules of Practice and Procedure in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\">. The record of trial in that case included an affidavit from the designated Deputy Assistant Secretary stating that when he approved the resignation \"it was my understanding and intention that all court-martial proceedings against him would be abated.\u201d <em>See United States v.
