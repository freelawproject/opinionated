These offenses occurred between September 1995 and May 1996. Appellant was sentenced by the military judge to a dishonor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>able discharge, 30 years\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, the convening authority suspended confinement in excess of 15 years, otherwise approving the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">We granted review of the following issue: WHETHER LIEUTENANT COLONEL WARRINER, THE DIRECTOR OF THE LAW CENTER AT MARINE CORPS AIR STATION YUMA, WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM BEING THE ASSISTANT TRIAL COUNSEL BECAUSE HE WAS THE ACCUSER BASED UPON HIS PREFERRAL OF CHARGES AGAINST THE APPELLANT AND HIS PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE CASE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We hold that it was not plain error for Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Warriner to act as the assistant trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">LTC Warriner, Director of the Law Center at Marine Corps Air Station, Yuma, Arizona, signed the charge sheet as the accuser. However, at trial, even though LTC Warri-ner was announced as the accuser, he was also present and serving as \u201cassociate\u201d trial counsel. When asked, LTC Warriner stated that he had not acted in a disqualifying capacity. Additionally, he requested that any request for trial by judge alone be denied and stated that he would ask for a life sentence. Appellant did not move for his disqualification at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">After a delay of more than 20 days, appellant voluntarily entered into a pretrial agreement in which he requested trial by judge alone and waived his rights to be tried by members. The convening authority agreed to the conditions in the pretrial agreement, including a provision to suspend any confinement in excess of 15 years. However, during the Government\u2019s sentencing argument, LTC Warriner asked the military judge to minimize the mitigating effects of appellant\u2019s guilty pleas and characterized appellant\u2019s action as \u201ccowardly criminal conduct of a sexual pervert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The defense argues that LTC Warriner abandoned his unbiased position, becoming an \u201cadvocate for severity,\u201d and that his actions materially prejudiced appellant. Final Brief at 2. Additionally, the defense asserts that his actions \u201ccompromised the integrity of the military justice system because a disinterested member of the public would question the fairness and impartiality of proceedings prosecuted in this manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. According to the defense, LTC Warriner\u2019s argument \u201cdemonstrated a highly personal interest,\u201d and thus, there was a clear error of law. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Further, the defense urges that the error was obvious and plain, and thus, the Court should not invoke waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">The Government argues that at no time did LTC Warriner become an accuser with a personal interest in this case. In any event, the Government asserts, waiver should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">Many individuals involved with a court-martial are disqualified from performing other activities related to that court-martial, including the staff judge advocate, <em>see </em>RCM 1106(b), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.); the Article 32<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> investigating officer, <em>see </em>RCM 405(d)(1); the trial and defense counsel, <em>see </em>RCM 502(d)(4)(A); the military judge, <em>see </em>RCM 902(b)(3); the court members, <em>see </em>RCM 912(f)(1)(C); and the convening authority, <em>see </em>RCM 504(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">Article 1(9), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 801(9), defines an \u201caccuser\u201d as one \u201cwho signs and swears to charges.\u201d However, \u201cany issue [as to] whether [a] trial counsel was so determined to convict and punish [an accused] that he became an \u2018accuser\u2019 [is] waived\u201d by that accused\u2019s failure to raise the issue at trial. <em>United States v. Rust, </em>41 MJ 472, 480 (1995); <em>see also United States v. Hamilton, </em>41 MJ 32, 37 (CMA 1994)(failure to object to errors in the preferral, forwarding, investigation, or review of charges before a plea is entered shall constitute waiver); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>RCM 905(b)(1) and (e). Likewise, the failure to object to improper argument constitutes a waiver of the objection. <em>United States v. Stadler, </em>47 MJ 206, 208 (1997); RCM 919(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The waiver rules are designed \u201cto prevent defense counsel from remaining silent, making no objection, and then raising the issue on appeal for the first time, long after any possibility of curing the problem has vanished. It is important \u2018to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time around.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Causey, </em>37 MJ 308, 311 (CMA 1993), quoting <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">To succeed under a plain error analysis, appellant has the burden of establishing that there was plain or obvious error that \u201cmaterially prejudiced\u201d his \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a); <em>see also United States v. Powell, </em>49 MJ 460 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">There is no question that LTC Warriner signed the charges and, thus, was disqualified by the Rules of Courts-Martial. This disqualification was known by the parties at trial because trial counsel announced for the record the actions taken by LTC Warriner. <em>Cf. United States v. Dinges, </em>49 MJ 232 (1998); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>45 MJ 114 (1996). Thus, the only question is whether there was a plain, obvious error that prejudiced appellant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">As to LTC Warriner\u2019s assurance on the record that he was not disqualified because he was an \u201cassociate,\u201d rather than \u201cassistant\u201d trial counsel, the court below correctly remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">The title of associate trial counsel, fabricated for Lieutenant Colonel Warriner in this case, is unknown to the Code or the Manual.... Rather than creating an office for himself, Lieutenant Colonel Warriner might have better exercised the discretion inherent in his position as Director of the Law Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Unpub. op. at 2 n. 2. LTC Warriner\u2019s conduct, however, did not impact on appellant\u2019s trial. Disqualification takes many forms, such as signing the charge sheets or obtaining privileged information as a former defense counsel. There is a vast difference between the rules applying to such circumstances and those determining when waiver should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">Appellant\u2019s voluntary pleas of guilty to the offenses and voluntary election of a judge alone trial took place after LTC Warriner argued that any judge alone request should be denied. The sentencing argument by LTC Warriner did not illustrate a personal animus but, instead, the \u201chard blows\u201d that may be struck by a prosecutor during argument on the sentence. <em>United States v. Doctor, </em>7 USCMA 126, 133, 21 CMR 252, 259 (1956). Nor did his actions show a personal interest in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Appellant pleaded guilty to very serious offenses: 2 specifications of rape, 1 specification of attempted sodomy, 2 specifications of sodomy, and 2 specifications of committing indecent acts with his 6-year-old step-daughter. He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, 30 years\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. Pursuant to the pretrial agreement, the convening authority suspended confinement in excess of 15 years. Thus, we hold that any error did not materially prejudice the substantial rights of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\">.
