Falk, United States Air Force, was tried by military judge alone at a general court-martial convened at Travis Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1996. Pursuant to his pleas, Falk was found guilty of 2 specifications of conspiracy to commit larceny, larceny, making a false claim, larceny of mail matter, and possessing child pornography, in violation of Articles 81, 121, 132, and 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 881, 921, 932, and 934, respectively. The military judge sentenced Falk to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 42 months, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved the sentence, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">We granted review of these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHr\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbiQ\">WHETHER APPELLANT\u2019S PLEA TO SPECIFICATION 1, CHARGE I, WAS PROVIDENT IN THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS NOT IN VIOLATION OF 18 USC \u00a7 2252 BECAUSE HE DID NOT POSSESS THREE OR MORE BOOKS, MAGAZINES, PERIODICALS, FILMS, VIDEO TAPES, OR OTHER MATTER WHICH CONTAINED ILLEGAL IMAGES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmX\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajo-dedup-0\">WHETHER THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLES 57(a) AND 58b, UCMJ, VIOLATES THE <em>EX POST FACTO </em>CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WITH RESPECT TO APPELLANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AML\">The first issue concerns the child pornography charge and poses two questions. One is whether appellant\u2019s guilty plea was improvident because of the great confusion on the part of all involved \u2014 including the Article 32<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> investigating officer, counsel, the military judge, and later, appellate counsel\u2014 about the statute under which appellant was being tried. The second question is whether any statute in effect at the time of Falk\u2019s alleged misconduct prohibited what he did. To understand and answer the two questions requires the consideration of several statutes and then an examination of this case\u2019s confusing procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"akz-dedup-0\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AHT\">A. Statutes Involved</p>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">Article 134 of the UCMJ prohibits conduct of a servicemember which is: (a) to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces; (b) service discrediting; or (c) a crime under generally applicable federal penal statutes. Some conduct that falls into one or both of the first two categories may also be a crime under Title 18 of the United States Code; and in that event, the conduct is punishable whether committed by a ser-vicemember or a civilian. Therefore, an accuser in preferring charges, or trial counsel in prosecuting, may opt to rely on the generally applicable federal penal statute rather than to proceed under the first two clauses of Article 134. In that way, there is no need to prove that the accused\u2019s conduct was contrary to good order and discipline or was service discrediting.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap-\">Title 18 USC contains \u00a7 2252, which Congress enacted in 1978, and which has been subsequently amended from time to time. At the time of Falk\u2019s trial and alleged offense, \u00a7 2252 provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was a crime to \u201cknowingly possess 3 or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction\u201d of child pornography.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Effective on September 30,1996, Congress added to Title 18 an additional section, \u00a7 2252A, which made it a crime to \u201cpossess[ ] ... any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains 3 or more images of child pornography.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time, no change was made in \u00a7 2252(a); instead \u00a7 2252A was a new section added to supplement the existing provisions of Title 18. Presumably, it was designed to encompass some additional means of possessing child pornography that were not already covered by existing statutes; otherwise, there would have been no need to add a new section to Title 18. The failure of some of those involved in this case to recognize that 18 USC \u00a7 2252 was supplemented \u2014 rather than replaced or amended\u2014 by the enactment of \u00a7 2252A is one source of the apparent confusion in the review of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"a5r-dedup-0\">In the Spring of 1996, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) conducted a criminal investigation of Falk as a result of larceny allegations. During this investigation, Falk\u2019s wife informed the OSI that Falk had stored on the hard drive of his computer numerous pictures of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct. A search warrant was executed, and on June 5, 1996, 126 images depicting minors engaging in various sex acts were downloaded from Falk\u2019s computer hard drive. Before downloading the images from Falk\u2019s computer, investigators found several computer directories that contained images of child pornography. Most of these images were filed in a directory entitled \u201cpre-teen.\u201d The minors who were depicted while engaged in child pornography were ages 6 to 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Charges were originally preferred against Falk on July 2, 1996, pursuant to RCM 307, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). At that time, Charge I consisted of a single specification, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-15\">Violation of the UCMJ, Article 134 ... Specification: In that AIRMAN FIRST CLASS SCOTT E. FALK, United States Air Force, 60th Aircraft Generation Squadron, did, at Travis Air Force Base, California, on or about 5 June 1996, knowingly possess three or more pictures which contain a visual depiction involving the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and such visual depiction is of such conduct, on land or a building owned by or otherwise under the control of the Government of the United States, to wit: 9 Van-denberg Court, Travis Air Force Base, California.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">Presumably, appellant was being charged at that point with violating one or both of the first two clauses of Article 134, conduct prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>udicial to good order and discipline or service discrediting. In any event, nothing in the specification referred to \u00a7 2252 or to any other section of Title 18; nor did it in any way allege that the third clause of Article 134 had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">A little more than 1 month later, on August 14, 1996, a report was submitted by the officer who had conducted the investigation required by Article 32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to Charge I, which concerned child pornography, the report recommended that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA1\">Specification 1 of Charge I should make reference to 18 USC \u00a7 2252 as being the specific United States Code which was allegedly violated by A1C Falk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A copy of \u00a7 2252 was an exhibit to the investigating officer\u2019s report, so that anyone reading the report would have ready access to the statute it cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Since Charge II in the original charge sheet also alleged that Falk violated Article 134, by stealing some credit cards from the mail, the investigating officer also recommended that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">Charge I should consist of two specifications, the first regarding the possession of child pornography, and the second specification in violation of Art 134 should be what is currently the specification of Charge II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The investigating officer\u2019s report contained a section concerned with \u201celements of the offenses.\u201d Among the elements listed for Charge I \u2014 the child pornography charge\u2014 were that the conduct be in violation of either or both of the first two clauses of Article 134. However, the discussion of the \u201celements\u201d contained no recommendation that the specification under Charge I be amended to include allegations that Falk\u2019s conduct had been contrary to good order and discipline or service discrediting; nor did it refer to the report\u2019s recommendation or to \u00a7 2252.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">At some time within the next 12 days, the words \u201cin violation of \u00a7 2252\u201d were added to what had been changed to specification 1 of Charge I in order to comply with the investigating officer\u2019s recommendation. The handwritten modification is initialed \u201cLS,\u201d who we assume is Captain (CPT) Lara R. Stutz, assistant trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Then, on August 26, 1996, the staff judge advocate sent the convening authority a pretrial advice memorandum in accordance with RCM 406. The memorandum acknowledged the recommendation by the investigating officer to add \u00a7 2252 to the charge sheet. The memorandum also alerted the convening authority to the fact that the changes had already been made at the \u201cWing level,\u201d and recommended that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">with regard to the original specification of Charge I, ... the word \u201ceach\u201d be inserted after the word \u201cwhich\u201d and before the word \u201ccontain,\u201d the words \u201cthe production of which involved\u201d be substituted for the word \u201cinvolving.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">The next day, August 27, 1996, the convening authority referred the charges in accordance with RCM 601 and approved the foregoing modifications to the charge sheet. Again, handwritten modifications were made, but this time by \u201cRD.\u201d We can only speculate that \u201cRD\u201d is CPT Robin Donato, trial counsel in the ease. The final version of Specification 1 of Charge I read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-15\">knowingly possess three or more pictures which contain a visual depiction the production of which involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and such visual depiction is of such conduct, on land or a building owned by or otherwise under the control of the Government of the United States, to wit: 9 Van-denberg Court, Travis Air Force Base, California, in violation of 18 USC \u00a7 2252.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">Sometime around September 4, 1996, defense counsel received a copy of a document purporting to contain the charges that had been referred, together with the advice of the staff judge advocate. However, defense counsel\u2019s copy of the charge sheet did not include the modifications directed by the convening authority. On approximately September 26, 1996, after the Government discovered its error, an accurate copy of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>sheet, as it had been modified, was sent to the defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">When a pretrial session was held pursuant to ROM 802, the trial counsel described in this manner the history of the charges on which Falk was to be tried:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">Charge I, Specification 1, the change is striking the word \u201cinvolving\u201d and adding \u201cthe production of which involved\u201d was made at referral. Adding at the end \u201cin violation of 18 USC 2252.\u201d This change to Charge I, Specification 1, was made to a copy of the charge sheet based on the recommendation of the Investigating Officer, probably improperly, Your Honor, by this office when we were preparing the Article 32 package for the numbered Air Force. When the numbered Air Force prepared the Pretrial Advice for the Convening Authority, they assumed these changes were made on the original charge sheet and adopted them in their pretrial advice. Two weeks ago we discovered this change was not made to the original charge sheet which was served on the Accused on 30 August 1996. Therefore, I made the pen and ink change and <em>faxed it </em>to Captain Hatch, the Accused\u2019s Defense Counsel, on 26 September 1996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Prior to Falk\u2019s trial, which took place on October 7, 1996, the trial counsel provided the military judge with proposed instructions on the elements of specification 1 of Charge I \u2014 the specification which concerns child pornography. These instructions conformed much more to the language of \u00a7 2252A\u2014 which had not been enacted at the time of the alleged crime \u2014 than to the language of \u00a7 2252.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, attached to the proposed instructions was a copy of \u00a7 2252. During the providence inquiry, the military judge did not use the language of \u00a7 2252 but gave an explanation of specification 1, Charge I, in terms that followed the proposed instructions provided by trial counsel. With that explanation before him, and having previously entered into a stipulation of fact, Falk entered his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">A. The Plea was Improvident</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">On appeal, Falk claims that his plea was improvident \u2014 because it was based on a misunderstanding of the law as a result of the military judge\u2019s misleading explanation and because the facts stipulated to did not establish guilt under the statute in effect at the time. In connection with his second contention, Falk emphasizes that he stipulated to possession of only a single computer containing many images in its hard drive, and that \u00a7 2252A was not enacted until long after charges had been preferred. The Government not only disputes appellant\u2019s contention that his conduct was not a crime under the statute then in effect, but also insists that his guilty plea waived any rights he might otherwise have to raise any issue as to the adequacy of the stipulated facts to establish that an offense had been committed under \u00a7 2252. The Court of Criminal Appeals accepted the Government\u2019s view that a waiver had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">We \u201cwill not \u2018speculate post-trial as to the existence of facts which might invalidate an appellant\u2019s guilty pleas.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Faircloth, </em>45 MJ 172, 174 (1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>42 MJ 443, 445 (1995)). However, \u201c[i]n determining the providence of [an] appellant\u2019s pleas, it is un-controverted that an appellate court must consider the entire record in a ease.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 445 (citing <em>United States v. Bester, </em>42 MJ 75 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">From the recitation of the events that led up to Falk\u2019s plea of guilty, it is apparent that great confusion existed with respect to the elements that constituted the crime with which Falk was charged. The military judge advised Falk pursuant to the instructions proposed by trial counsel; and those instructions, although corresponding substantially to the allegations of the specification as it had been amended prior to trial, did not match well with the provisions of \u00a7 2252.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Obvious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ly, the trial counsel had not noticed the discrepancy when he attached a copy of \u00a7 2252 to the instructions; nor did the military judge when he gave the instructions \u2014 apparently without comparing them with the language of the statute. Additional confusion arises because, only a week before trial, \u00a7 2252A was enacted, whose provisions fit much more closely the facts stipulated to by Falk than did the provisions of \u00a7 2252. Whether the trial counsel was even aware of the statute so recently enacted is questionable. However, appellate defense counsel have properly complained that Falk was convicted under a statute that did not exist at the time of his alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In any event, the picture of confusion that is painted by the record leads us to the conclusion that, in fairness, the plea must be held improvident and the conviction set aside. Indeed, to hold that the plea was provident could hardly conform with the premise that an accused who pleads guilty has some understanding of why the facts he has admitted establish his guilt. Even if the evidence had been sufficient to establish guilt, that circumstance would not be sufficient to compel the conclusion that Falk\u2019s plea was provident.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">B. The Stipulated Facts abe Insufficient to Establish Guilt</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">When a guilty plea is held improvident, the question presents itself whether the Government can thereafter obtain a conviction in a contested trial. To us, it is apparent from the stipulated facts that, if a trial were held, the evidence would be insufficient to establish guilt under \u00a7 2252; and for this reason as well, the plea of guilty was improvident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">We reject the Government\u2019s contention that the language of \u00a7 2252 embraces the conduct admitted by Falk. In interpreting \u00a7 2252, we must look first to the plain language of the statute and construe its provisions in terms of its object and policy, as well as the provisions of any related statutes, in order to ascertain the intent of Congress; if the statute is unclear, we look next to the legislative history. <em>See United States v. Hockings, </em>129 F.3d 1069, 1071 (9th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Northwest Forest Resource Council v. Glickman, </em>82 F.3d 825, 830 (9th Cir.1996)); <em>see also United States v. Scranton, </em>30 MJ 322, 324 (CMA 1990) (citing <em>Ladner v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 173, 79 S.Ct. 209, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958)); <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955). In the process, absent evidence to the contrary, the ordinary meaning of the words used expresses the legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Inthavong, </em>48 MJ 628, 631 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Easter, </em>981 F.2d 1549, 1558 (10th Cir.1992)). The interpretation of a statute and its legislative history is a question of law to be reviewed <em>de novo. See Quiban v. United States Veterans Administration, </em>724 F.Supp. 993, 1001 (D.D.C.1989); <em>see also Hockings, supra </em>at 1070; <em>United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>49 MJ 209 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The Government has made the argument that the reference in \u00a7 2252 to \u201c3 or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction\u201d makes criminal Falk\u2019s possession of 126 images on one computer hard drive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. A computer hard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>drive is more analogous to a single \u201cbook,\u201d which contains many chapters, words, and images.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Section 2252 requires the possession of three or more \u201cmatters\u201d which \u201ccontain\u201d one or more visual depictions. The word \u201ccontain\u201d suggests that the visual depiction must have some sort of host, such as a hard copy picture, or a book, or even a computer disk. Therefore, a person may be convicted under \u00a7 2252 for possessing 3 or more photographs, but may not be convicted for possessing 1 book with 20 pictures of child pornography in it. Whether Congress foresaw this result, we are unaware. Perhaps the premise was that someone in possession of 3 pictures, separately acquired, had a more serious interest in pornography \u2014 and so presented a greater danger to children \u2014 than someone who acquired a single book or magazine that contained several pornographic pictures. Perhaps \u00a7 2252 was worded to prevent the prosecution of someone in unwitting possession of a single book with many pictures depicting child pornography. In any event, the language of \u00a7 2252 calls for this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Furthermore, the legislative history supports our conclusion because it shows that \u00a7 2252A was added to Title 18 in order to clear up the ambiguities and omissions in coverage that arise from the most obvious construction of \u00a7 2252. Congress\u2019 purpose underlying \u00a7 2252 was to \u201cprohibit the sexual exploitation of children,\u201d in general; Congress\u2019 intent in adding \u00a7 2252A to Title 18 was because it was \u201cneeded,\u201d as reflected in this statement made when the bill which later became \u00a7 2252A was introduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">This legislation is needed due to technological advances in the recording, creation, alteration, production, distribution and transmission of visual images and depictions, particularly through the use of computers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">S.Rep. No. 358, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 1996 WL 506545 at p. 9, and in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">Current law prohibits the possession of three or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes or other material which contains any visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Since a single computer disk is capable of storing hundreds of child pornographic images, current law effectively permits the possession of substantial collections of child pornography, a loophole that will be closed under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">We do not dispute that, in some cases, \u201cCongress may amend a statute simply to clarify existing law, to correct a misinterpretation, or to overrule wrongly decided cases,\u201d and that, in turn, \u201can amendment to a statute does not necessarily indicate that the unamended statute mean[t] the opposite.\u201d <em>Hackings, </em>129 F.3d at 1072 (quoting <em>Hawkins v. United States, </em>30 F.3d 1077,1082 (9th Cir.1994)). We do, however, disagree with the Government\u2019s position that \u00a7 2252A was enacted only for clarification. The language in the legislative history clearly shows that Congress\u2019 purpose <em>was </em>to close the \u201cloophole\u201d through which Falk has fallen. While we have no fondness for \u201cloopholes\u201d which allow one to avoid responsibility for one\u2019s behavior, our system of law does not allow anyone to be convicted of a crime under a law enacted after the fact, or to plead guilty to a ciime not supported by the admitted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">Even if \u00a7 2252 may appear ambiguous and open to more than one interpretation, we will not expand the scope of this criminal statute beyond the meaning an average citizen would understand and attribute to its plain lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>guage. <em>See McBoyle v. United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931). As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 27, 51 S.Ct. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We conclude that a computer hard drive is a \u201cdisk,\u201d according to commonly used language, and constitutes a single \u201cmatter\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2252.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if many images of pornography are contained in a single hard drive, \u00a7 2252 has not been violated; and a single hard drive with three or more images is a single \u201cmatter.\u201d We hold, therefore, that Falk\u2019s conduct is not punishable under \u00a7 2252 \u2014 even though if the same conduct had occurred after the enactment of \u00a7 2252A, on September 30, 1996, it would have been punishable under the later statute. For lack of a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d in law, Falk\u2019s guilty plea must be set aside. <em>See United States v. Prater, </em>32 MJ 433, 436 (CMA 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Regarding Issue II, we note that all of Falk\u2019s remaining offenses were committed between May and December 1995, well before the effective date of the amendment to Article 57(a).

He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">With regard to Charge I, Specification 1,1 downloaded some pictures off the Internet after gaining access. <em>When sorting through these files </em>I determined that I did possess child pornography which I then filed away into their respective directories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">I disagree with the majority opinion for several reasons. <em>See generally United States v. Harrison, </em>26 MJ 474, 476 (CMA 1988) (post-trial speculation as to facts supporting offense not countenanced). First, appellant pleaded guilty and admitted violating 18 USC \u00a7 2252 (1994), as charged. He specifically admitted his possession of 126 computer files of child pornography; his organization of the files containing these pictures into four different directories on his computer; and that his conduct in government housing violated 18 USC 2252(a)(4)(B) (\u201cknowingly possess 3 or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter which contain any visual depiction____involv[ing] the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d). A conviction in similar circumstances under this same statutory provision was upheld in <em>United States v. Hockings, </em>129 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir.1997) (eight computer files). In my view, a computer picture stored in a file on a hard drive <em>is in a container for visual depictions </em>under 18 USC \u00a7 2252 (\u201cother matter which contain any visual depiction\u201d). A computer has the capacity to contain a full library of books and pictures stored in the files of its hard drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-18\">In addition, assuming appellant\u2019s admitted conduct of possessing these computer pictures did not violate 18 USC 2252(a)(4)(B) (1994), it clearly violated another subsection of that same statute, subsection (a)(2). This subsection had no multiple container requirement. It states that any person who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-19\">(2) <em>knowingly receives, </em>or distributes <em>any visual depiction </em>that has been mailed, or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or which contains materials which have been mailed or so shipped or transported, <em>by an means including by computer, </em>or knowingly reproduces any visual depiction <em>for </em>distribution in interstate or foreign commerce by any means including by computer or through the mails, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">shall be punished under the statute. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Here again, appellant admitted to the military judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">With regard to Charge I, Specification 1, I downloaded some pictures off the Internet after gaming access. When sorting through these files I determined that I did possess child pornography which I then filed away into their respective directories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayz-dedup-0\">Affirmance of his conviction based on his guilty-plea admissions to a closely related offense is permitted under <em>United States v. Felty, </em>12 MJ 438, 441-42 (CMA 1982); <em>see generally </em>Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Finally, even if appellant\u2019s admitted conduct did not violate any subsection of 18 USC \u00a7 2252 (1994), I would still affirm his conviction under Article 134, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 934. Possession of 126 computer images of child pornography, lasciviously organized into four directories on a personal computer, in government housing on a military post, is <em>per se </em>service discrediting conduct in my view. Affirmance of his conviction for this conduct under Article 134 is warranted, even if no civilian offense was established. <em>See United States v. Gallegos, </em>41 MJ 446 (1995) (manifest example of conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline affirmed as offense under Article 134, despite failure to constitute civilian offense).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b556-9\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">When investigative officers searched appellant\u2019s home in June 1996, they seized not only his computer, which contained 126 files of child pornography divided into 4 directories he had labeled \u201cChildren,\u201d \u201cPre-teen,\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d and \u201cXXX\u201d; they also seized one picture of verified child pornography and subscription information for the pornographic bulletin-board system appellant was running from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">In the end, appellant was only charged with a single specification of possession of child pornography, in addition to his larceny, conspiracy, and false claim offenses. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, appellant pled guilty to all the charges and was sentenced only to a dishonorable discharge, 42 months\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and a reduction to the lowest rank. He fared well.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Appellant now argues that his plea to the child pornography offense was improvident and that this Court should dismiss the conviction and reassess his sentence. For the following reasons, I believe that we should not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">By pleading guilty, appellant waived a trial on the facts and made a conscious decision to relieve the Government of its responsibility to prove all of the elements of its case. <em>See United States v. Faircloth, </em>45 MJ 172 (1996). Essentially, a plea of guilty by an accused changes the substance of the court-martial. Further, \u201c[bjecause [appellant] pleaded guilty, the issue must be analyzed in terms of providence of his plea, not sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d changing the substance of our review as well. <em>Id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">Thus, the bar for reversing a military judge\u2019s finding that a plea was provident must be high. As this Court has noted, this rule is \u201crooted, in part, in our respect for the obvious tactical decision by an accused and his counsel to forgo possible defenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Roane, </em>43 MJ 93, 99 (1995), citing <em>United States v. Logan, </em>22 USCMA 349, 350, 47 CMR 1, 2 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">Appellant chooses now to raise a defense he could have raised before the military judge at his trial on October 7, 1996. He even failed to mention it in his November 22 response to the Staff Judge Advocate Recommendation on his court-martial. That defense hinges on an amendment to the federal child pornography statute proposed at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on June 4, 1996, written into Senate Report No. 104-358 on August 27, 1996, debated on the Senate floor on September 28, 1996, and signed into law on September 30, 1996. It is important to note that, although appellate defense counsel at oral argument conceded that the trial defense team \u201cmissed the boat,\u201d appellant does not claim ineffective assistance of counsel but, rather, improvidence of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The mere possibility of a defense that appellant could have raised was that, because the law in June 1996 stated that it was a crime to knowingly possess \u201c3 or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other matter\u201d which contained child pornography, and because appellant was only charged with possessing one hard drive containing child pornography, his charged conduct did not constitute a crime under 18 USC \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(A) (1994). The 1996 amendment on which appellant pins this argument changed the law to prohibit knowing possession of \u201cany book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains 3 or more images of child pornography.\u201d <em>See </em>18 USC \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(A) (1996). It is appellant\u2019s contention that by amending the law clearly to include his behavior, Congress somehow admitted that the law had not previously encompassed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">However, what appellant ignores in making this argument, and the majority undervalues in agreeing with it, is that \u201cCongress may amend a statute simply to clarify existing law, to correct a misinterpretation, or to overrule wrongly decided cases. Thus, an amendment to a statute does not necessarily indicate that the unamended statute meant the opposite.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. United States, </em>30 F.3d 1077, 1082 (9th Cir.1994). The language of the Senate Report on which appellant relies does not necessarily mean what he wants it to mean \u2014 a determination that should have been left to the military judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Had appellant raised this defense in the first place, the Government would have been forced to prove that the 4 directories of child pornography, or possibly the 126 files of child pornography, on his hard drive constituted \u201cother matter\u201d as used in the preamendment statute. This is not an absurd argument and may, in fact, have been considered by appellant and his trial defense team in deciding to sign the pretrial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">A similar defense as that which appellant now raises was tried and rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Alpers, </em>338 U.S. 680, 70 S.Ct. 352, 94 L.Ed. 457 (1950). There, the Court applied the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to determine that phonograph records, a fairly new and increasingly prevalent technology at the time, though not specified in the federal obscenity statute\u2019s outdated list, could constitute \u201cother matter.\u201d The Court\u2019s words then are relevant now: \u201cThe most important thing to be determined is the intent of Congress. The language of the statute may not be distorted under the guise of construction, or so limited by construction as to defeat the manifest intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681-82, 70 S.Ct. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">It may be appropriate at this point to remark on the sloppiness with which the Government approached its duty in preferring charges and making its case at court-martial. It is the Government\u2019s failure to mirror carefully the language it chose in writing out the specification and preparing proposed instructions to that of the actual statute that gives appellant\u2019s appeal the most vitality. However, this does not absolve defense counsel of their own carelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Despite these flaws, I fail to see how they could have misled appellant and his defense team or prejudiced him in any way. In <em>United States v. Felty, </em>12 MJ 438, 442 (CMA 1982), this Court found that a \u201ctechnical variance between the offense alleged and that which is established from an accused\u2019s own lips does not require setting aside the plea of guilty.\u201d There, the appellant pleaded guilty to escape from custody but was, in reality, guilty of escape from confinement, two \u201cdifferent offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. Included amongst the factors we considered to reach our decision was that the appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayz-dedup-1\">believed that he was guilty of an escape; according to his answers during the providence inquiry, he <em>was </em>indeed guilty. There is no reason to believe that the variance impaired his ability to prepare for trial, and the finding of guilty, if affirmed, would protect him from prosecution on any other charge of escape arising out of the same course of conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">Though the wording of the Article 134 specification charging the possession of child pornography was not the same as that in the statute, the statute was properly referenced as part of the charge and should have been within easy grasp of both detailed defense counsel and individual defense counsel. Likewise, a copy of the statute was attached to the Government\u2019s proposed instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>In <em>United States v. Meyer, </em>802 F.2d 348 (9th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 817, 108 S.Ct. 71, 98 L.Ed.2d 35 (1987), the appellant there made a similar argument to that of appellant here. In that case, the appellant was also charged under the child pornography statute, and the indictment also misstated the wording of the statute. The indictment used statutory language which had been amended just prior to the appellant\u2019s offense, stating an element of the crime was the \u201clewdness\u201d of the exhibition depicted, not the \u201clasciviousness,\u201d as Congress had just adjusted it to read. <em>Id. </em>at 351. The Ninth Circuit rejected the appellant\u2019s argument, stating that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">fail[ed] to see how the wording of the indictment impaired his defense. <em>See United States v. Pheaster, </em>544 F.2d 353, 363 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Inciso v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 1099, 97 S.Ct. 1118, 51 L.Ed.2d 546 (1977).... Appellant does not seriously suggest that he was confused as to the charges he had to meet, <em>see Pheaster, </em>544 F.2d at 363, and under the circumstances the indictment\u2019s correct citation to the statute was adequate to inform him that lasciviousness was an element of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">802 F.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The bottom line is that for the offenses to which appellant pleaded guilty, he could have faced a maximum punishment of a dishonorable discharge, 30/\u00e9 years\u2019 <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> confinement, total forfeitures, a reduction to the lowest enlisted rank, and an unlimited fine. His decision to sign the pretrial agreement removed the possibility of a fine, and, in the end, his confinement amounted to only 42 months. He got the benefit of his bargain. No amount of after-the-fact legal maneuvering should be allowed to break that legitimate deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Because I find appellant\u2019s plea provident, I do not consider whether the substance of his defense is persuasive, an analysis best left to the factfinder. For these reasons, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">ON PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"AKN\">The United States, appellee, petitioned this Court for reconsideration, citing various precedents relating to the construction of 18 USC \u00a7 2252(a). It also appears that the issue of the proper construction of 18 USC \u00a7 2252(a) has been raised in other cases presently pending in this Court and can be considered in the disposition of those eases. <em>United States v. Augustine, </em>No. 98-5026, and <em>United States v. Sapp, </em>No. 99-0260.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">However, the United States did not cite any new authorities which might warrent reconsideration of this Court\u2019s earlier decision that appellant\u2019s pleas of guilty were improvident and that the findings and sentence based thereon should be set aside. 50 MJ 385, 390 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Accordingly, it is, by the Court, this 30th day of September 1999</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">That the Petition for Reconsideration as it relates to the construction of 18 USC \u00a7 2252(a) is granted and the opinion of the Court is withdrawn insofar as it relates thereto. Reconsideration of the Court\u2019s pri- or decision setting aside the findings and sentence is denied. The Court reserves the issue concerning the proper construction of 18 UCS \u00a7 2252(a) for further consideration if raised in some other case, or if raised again in this case after further proceedings in the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">[AND]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">That the second sentence of the first paragraph of Part IV is amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-17\">The finding of guilty of specifiaction 1 of Charge I and the sentence are set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">[AND]</p>\n<p id=\"b558-20\">That the last sentence of the first paragraph of Part IV is amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-21\">A rehearing on specification 1 of Charge I and the sentence may be ordered.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">.
