We think it appropriate expressly to reject the Commission\u2019s misstatement of the case in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">First, the Commission says that the Court declared an \u201cartificial bright-line\u201d rule that an investment is not a security \u201cif the efforts of promoters or others on which investors rely occur just before, rather than after, the investors commit their money.\u201d Indeed, according to the Commission, the Court holds that all pre-purchase efforts are \u201cirrelevant.\u201d While that position may have been the one originally advanced by Life Partners, Inc., it is not the one taken by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">In order to qualify as a security, an investment must have been made in an enterprise the profits of which are derived from the efforts of others. <em>SEC v. W.J. Howey, </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). To the extent that we established any rule in applying the \u201cefforts of others\u201d test, we held only \u201cthat [1] prepurchase services cannot by themselves suffice to make the profits of an investment arise predominantly from the efforts of others, and that [2] ministerial functions should receive a good deal less weight than entrepreneurial activities.\u201d 87 F.3d 536, 548. We examined both \u201cLPI\u2019s pre-purchase services as a finder-promoter and its largely ministerial post-purchase services,\u201d and we concluded that the two in combination were not enough to establish that the investors\u2019 profits flow predominantly from the efforts of others. <em>Id. </em>Nothing in our application of the <em>Howey </em>test can reasonably be construed to suggest that pre-purchase efforts are \u201cirrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">Absent even one entrepreneurial post-purchase service \u2014 and the SEC could identify none \u2014 there simply is no on-going common enterprise involved in owning an interest in an insurance contract from which the profit depends entirely upon the mortality of the insured. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Commission concedes in its petition that \u201cin other cases where pre-purchase efforts were considered, those courts also found significant post-purchase efforts.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Banco Central Corp., </em>990 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1993) (interest in undeveloped land not security without post-purchase managerial efforts by promoter); <em>Noa v. Key Futures, Inc., </em>638 F.2d 77, 79-80 (9th Cir.1980) (same with respect to silver bars); <em>McCown v. Heidler, </em>527 F.2d 204, 211 (10th Cir.1975) (interest in undeveloped land would not have been security but for \u201csubstantial improvements pledged by\u201d promoters).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">The second matter worthy of comment is the totally unsubstantiated assertion in the Commission\u2019s petition for rehearing that the Court has \u201cplace[d] in question the applicability of the federal securities laws to ... certain asset-backed securities,\u201d including mortgages and securitized interests in commercial real estate, which account for a vast amount of investment capital. Having leveled this astonishing charge, however, the Commission does not favor us with a single example of a formerly regulated instrument that will now escape SEC scrutiny. In fact, the Commission admits that \u201cmany asset-backed securities may be encompassed under other definitional terms in the securities laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>... and some might have sufficient post-purchase efforts\u201d to make LPI distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">In contrast to an LPI viatical settlement, a mortgage pool must be managed on a continuing basis. Among the post-purchase services that should easily meet the \u201cefforts of others\u201d test as we have interpreted it are: collecting late mortgage payments, initiating foreclosures, structuring and monitoring work-outs, negotiating concessions in order to avoid refinancing, and arranging for a secondary market. In the case of commercial real estate, the property must be kept in compliance with an array of tax, safety, and environmental laws; it must be advertised, leased, re-leased, improved, repaired, cleaned, heated, and perhaps resold. It seems fair to say, therefore, that the Commission\u2019s concern with the effect of this decision is, at the least, overblown.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b211-5\">WALD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1r\">dissenting from denial of rehearing and rehearing in banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Judges Ginsburg and Henderson contend that the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), in petitioning for rehearing, is mistaken when it claims that the majority decision in this case sets forth a bright-line rule to the effect that \u201can investment is not an \u2018investment contract\u2019 \u2014 and hence not a security if the efforts of promoters or others on which investors rely occur just before, rather than after, the investors commit their money,\u201d and when it predicts that this holding poses a serious potential obstacle to enforcement of the federal securities laws. With due respect, I believe that the SEC is correct in both allegations and it is my colleagues who are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">This case arose out of an attempt by the SEC to require Life Partners, Inc. (\u201cLPI\u201d) to register its offerings under the federal securities laws. LPI sells fractional interests in the life insurance policy of terminally ill people to investors, and markets the policies through a network of commissioned licensees. <em>SEC v. Life Partners, Inc., </em>87 F.3d 536, 537-39 (D.C.Cir.1996). The majority held that LPI contracts are not securities because they do not meet the <em>Howey </em>test for what constitutes an investment contract. Under the <em>Howey </em>test, \u201can investment contract is a security subject to the Act if investors purchase with (1) an expectation of profits arising from (2) a common enterprise that (3) depends upon the efforts of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542; <em>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). As the SEC notes, the court unanimously agreed that the first two prongs of the <em>Howey </em>test were met here. In particular, the majority noted that \u201chorizontal commonality \u2014 defined by the pooling of investment funds, shared profits, and shared losses \u2014 is ordinarily sufficient to satisfy the common enterprise requirement\u201d and specifically held that \u201cpooling is in practice an essential element of the LPI program.\u201d <em>Life Partners, Inc., </em>87 F.3d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The court did not hold that the LPI contracts were not investment contracts because there was no common enterprise, but rather because the entrepreneurial efforts of LPI occurred before purchase, so that any expectation of profits did not arise from such efforts and Howey\u2019s third prong was not satisfied. The court held that \u201cpre-purchase services cannot by themselves suffice to make the profits of an investment arise predominately from the efforts of others, and ... ministerial functions should receive a good deal less weight than entrepreneurial activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. The court then proceeded to emphasize that \u201c[t]he SEC ... has identified no post-purchase service provided by LPI ... that could fairly be characterized as entrepreneurial,\u201d <em>id., </em>a point that my colleagues underscore again here in their denial of rehearing by remarking on the absence of \u201ceven one entrepreneurial post-purchase service.\u201d Statement concurring in denial of rehearing at 190. It seems clear, therefore, that in concluding that LPI\u2019s contracts are not securities the court did in fact adopt a bright-line rule to the effect that in order for an investment contract to count as a security the promoter must provide at least one entrepreneurial service after purchase. Moreover, although my colleagues now admit that pre-purchase activities are important in the overall determination of whether the <em>Howey </em>test is met (presumably after some post-purchase activity has been identified), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>majority\u2019s original opinion, with its comment that \u201cwe doubt that pre-purchase activities should ever count for much,\u201d <em>Life Partners, Inc., </em>87 F.3d at 548 and its conclusion that the \u201cundeniably essential\u201d activities performed by LPI do not create a security because they occur prior to purchase, <em>id. </em>at 547-48, leaves the distinct impression that pre-purchase activities are largely irrelevant and never, by themselves, sufficient to support finding that a security exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">As I stated in dissent, I continue to believe that the court\u2019s bright-line rule distinguishing between pre-investment and post-investment efforts is at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s frequent remonstrance that courts should apply the securities laws flexibly to achieve the goal of investor protection. <em>See, e.g., Pinter v. Dahl, </em>486 U.S. 622, 653, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 2081-82, 100 L.Ed.2d 658 (1988); <em>Tckerepnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 553, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967). The new rule cannot but pose difficulties for enforcement of the securities laws. Investors in viatical settlements depend on viatical settlement brokers to provide accurate and honest assessments of an insured\u2019s health as well as of the likelihood of medical developments occurring that might extend the insured\u2019s life expectancy. <em>See </em>David W. Dunlap, <em>Recalculating Deathr-Benefit Math: AIDS Progress Alters an Industry, </em>N.Y. Times, July 30, 1996, at Dl. Moreover, the viatical settlement industry has grown tremendously in recent years, and is in the process right now of expanding from AIDS to other terminal illnesses. A further spur to the industry\u2019s growth is the recently enacted KennedyKassebaum bill, which made the income from sale of insurance policies not taxable. <em>See </em>Arthur Allen, <em>The Invisible Hand: Greed, Ethics and the New Value of Dying, </em>Wash. Post, Nov. 17, 1996, Magazine, at 12; Dunlap, <em>supra, </em>at DI, D4. The panel\u2019s decision prevents the SEC from protecting investors in these viatical settlements from dishonest and unscrupulous profiteers. And while it is true, as my colleagues point out, that interests in mortgage pools or commercial real estate (familiar examples of asset-backed investments) would likely qualify as securities even under their test, because of the post-purchase entrepreneurial and managerial activities required to make these investments succeed, it is not difficult to conjure up instances where them rigid \u201cbefore-or-after\u201d measuring stick would result in exempting the sale of other risky asset-backed interests from the scope of the securities laws. One example is a promoter selling interests in a package of long-term bonds, where the realization of profits turns on the promoter\u2019s skill in selecting what bonds to purchase; another is a dealer organizing a complex set of derivative transactions for a group of investors, where realization of profits depends predominantly on the dealer\u2019s expertise in balancing positions in different markets. In any event, the SEC\u2019s understandable reluctance to identify arrangements that it will acknowledge in advance as falling outside of the securities laws if the court\u2019s bright-line rule stays does not mean that its basic concerns are \u201coverblown.\u201d As the Supreme Court has remarked, the importance of retaining flexibility in the definition of a security is so that our securities laws are \u201ccapable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\u201d <em>Howey, </em>328 U.S. at 299, 66 S.Ct. at 1103. Experience shows that the novelty and ingenuity of exploitative investment schemes can rarely be contemplated ahead of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Because the panel\u2019s decision is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent and holds the potential for obstructing enforcement of the nation\u2019s securities laws, I believe the panel\u2019s opinion merits review by the full court and should be reversed. I therefore dissent from the court\u2019s decision to deny rehearing or rehearing <em>in banc.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
