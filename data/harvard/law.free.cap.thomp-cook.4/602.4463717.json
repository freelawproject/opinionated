In May, 1873, the respondent Catherine T. Hill propounded for probate a paper purporting to be the last will of Joseph Fellows, deceased, she being one of a large number of beneficiaries named in the will. The appellant, John 'Heermans, appeared and contested the probate. Proof was taken by the surrogate, but before the matter was finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>submitted, the proponent applied to withdraw the will and discontinue the proceedings, which application was granted and the order appealed from made.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-5\"><em>Brown &amp; Hadden, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_1\">cited <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>12 Wend. 494; <em>Corwin </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>3 Barb. 341; <em>Paff </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>1 Bradf. 1; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>5 <em>N. </em>Y. 497; <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Oliphant, </em>19 Barb. 30; 2 R.

Darwist Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHZ\">The single question presented upon this appeal is, whether the surrogate had power to allow the respondent to withdraw the will from probate and to discontinue proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">It is difficult to see upon what principle a court or judicial officer authorized to entertain any suit or proceeding of a judicial character is not necessarily possessed of the power to dismiss such a proceeding or to allow the same in his discretion to be discontinued. Surrogate\u2019s courts possess the incidental powers common to all courts or officers .exercising judicial functions. <em>Sipperly </em>v. <em>Baucus, </em>24 N. Y. 46. The necessity for the existence and exercise of such powers has been repeatedly asserted in the courts. <em>Pew </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>1 Barb. Ch. 454; <em>Vreedenburgh </em>v. <em>Calf, </em>9 Paige, 128; <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 id. 316; <em>Matter of Brick\u2019s Estate, </em>15 Abb. 12; <em>Campbell v. Thatcher, </em>54 Barb. 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Surrogate\u2019s courts, it is true, are courts of special and limited \u2022jurisdiction. Such courts must show their authority in the statute book for taking jurisdiction of any particular subject-matter, but in respect' to all matters committed to their cognizance after they have fully acquired jurisdiction, they must possess the ordinary incidental common-law powers necessary to the due discharge of the duties intrusted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The power to entertain a suit or proceeding implies a power to dismiss or discontinue it, and we can see no reason why this power should be denied to surrogate\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">We think the surrogate clearly possessed the power to allow the proponent in this case to retire from an impending litigation upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the will in question, and to leave to others its assertion who might be disposed to encounter the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
