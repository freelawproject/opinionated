The defendant was sheriff of Oneida county. On the 18th of December, 1871, an execution issued upon a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in favor of Clark Stewart against Thomas Waid, was placed in the hands of W. A. Matthewson, a deputy sheriff. He went to the residence of the said Thomas Waid (which was with his father, Isaac Waid, the plaintiff in this action), and inquired of said Thomas in regard to the ownership of the property in question. Being unable to ascertain whether Thomas in fact owned the property, he levied upon the <em>right, title and interest of said Thomas </em>in the property, and indorsed the levy in those terms on the back of the execution, and did nothing else. He left every thing just as it was, and did not then or afterward attempt to take possession of or remove any part of the property. He merely notified the said Thomas of what he had done. Subsequently Matthewson advertised the <em>'right, title and interest </em>of Thomas Waid for sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">This action was brought by Isaac Waid, claiming to be the owner of the property so levied on, to recover the possession thereof, and ' the same was delivered to him and remained in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">The action was referred to a referee, who found that the property levied on all belonged to the plaintiff, and that Thomas Waid had no right, title or interest therein whatever. The defendant moved for a nonsuit on these grounds: 1. That the deputy only levied on the interest of Thomas Waid in the property. <em>2. </em>That the property was never seized or taken by the defendant. 3. That there was no demand of the property before suit brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">The referee denied the motion, and found and decided as matter of law, that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment against the defendant, for the possession and retention of said property with costs. Judgment was entered accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-8\"><em>Southworth &amp; Parks, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQx\">The action under the Code. is a <em>possessory </em>action.
