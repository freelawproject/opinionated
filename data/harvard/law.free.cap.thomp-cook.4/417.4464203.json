J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyY\">We think the complaint sets out a cause of action. The plaintiffs and the defendant are stated therein to have entered into a partnership for one year, from July 20, 1869, in the manufacture of oil; the plaintiffs to furnish capital, and the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tiffs to bear half the losses and the defendant half, and to share profits in same proportion. A loss is averred at the expiration of the partnership of $3,376.76, and the complaint asks to recover one-half thereof of defendant, namely, $1,638.88. If the facts are true, the plaintiffs will be entitled to recover. The partnership is terminated; a loss has been realized; and the defendant, in the article of agreement of copartnership, has agreed to pay one-half to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">If the answer admits the complaint, the plaintiffs will be entitled to recover a money verdict, as in an action at law. If an issue should be made by the answer, calling for an accounting, an accounting would be ordered; notwithstanding a money judgment is demanded in the complaint. The demurrer is simply to the pr\u00e1yer for judgment, and must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Judgment is reversed, with leave to defendant to answer within twenty days, on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
