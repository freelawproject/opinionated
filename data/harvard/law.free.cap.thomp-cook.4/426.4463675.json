Swanstrom, from whom the drafts in question had been purchased, had been authorized by defendants to draw his own drafts upon the correspondents of defendants in Europe and to use therefor certain printed blanks furnished by defendants <em>at </em>this form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Exchange for ..............., 187 .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">On demand of this first of exchange (second unpaid) pay to the order of.......................................value received, and charge the same to the account of G.

Evidence was introduced- showing that Swans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>trom was allowed by defendants a commission for selling these drafts. The drafts in question, which were drawn upon the printed form mentioned, were not paid, and it was shown that the reason for their non-payment was that Swanstrom had not paid the amount represented by them to defendants. Evidence was also given on the part of plaintiff to show that Swanstrom held himself forth as selling these drafts for defendants, and that defendants had admitted that he had been their agent, but one of the defendants testified that Swanstrom had only authority to draw on certain conditions. Upon the motion of counsel a verdict was directed for plaintiff. From an order denying a new trial and from the judgment entered upon the verdict, defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-5\"><em>H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGUb\">The defendants are bankers. They sell drafts payable in the various countries of Europe. They employed one Swanstrom to act as their agent in selling such drafts in the city of Brooklyn, paying him one and one-half per cent on the sale of each draft. By the printed instructions given him at the time <em>pi </em>his employment he was directed to draw his bwn- drafts on defendants\u2019 correspondents abroad, and report promptly the number-and date of the draft, and on whom, and in whose favor, and for what amount drawn. Lists of persons on whom drafts might be drawn in different countries were given in the instructions, and by those instructions \u201c Such drafts are to be covered with us in funds par in New York, and 'will then be duly advised for protection by our regular advices to Europe.\u201d The defendant furnished these drafts to Swanstrom, and he sold a number of them to plaintiff which were regularly paid. The draft in question was not paid. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>agent did not, in this instance, cover the draft, hnt applied the money received from plaintiff to his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">I think the defendants are liable upon it. Swanstrom did what he . was employed to do. He sold drafts payable by defendants drawing on their agents as he was authorized to do, in his own name. He received plaintiff\u2019s money, with full power from defendants. As between defendants and Swanstrom he was bound to pay the' money to defendants; but his failure to do this did not affect the plaintiff\u2019s rights. He could not know of the instructions given by defendants to their agent. If he did, the requirement by the defendants of their agent to pay the price of draft to them, is no more than the law would exact in the absence of any written directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The defendants cannot authorize a sale of their drafts, and make their validity depend upon the fact, whether the agent pays them, the money received for them, in the absence of knowledge of such a condition by the purchasers. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
