Smith. Judgment was entered on the note January 2, 1894, after the death of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-7\">The material portion of the testimony of Mr. Smith, the subscribing witness, will be found fully quoted in the opinion of the Supreme Court, together with the other facts necessary to an understanding of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-8\">The court, in an opinion by Swartz, P. J., held that the evidence was insufficient to contradict the terms of an instrument under seal, citing Jackson v. Payne, 114 Pa. 67; Fulton v. Hood, 34 Pa. 365; Thomas v. Loose, 114 Pa. 45; Yan Yoorhis v. Rea Bros., 153 Pa. 19, and discharged the rule to open a judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-9\"><em>JError assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-10\"><em>Jacob V.

Such a use will not be tolerated: Parke v. Chadwick, 8 W. &amp; S. 96; Miller v. Henderson, 10 S. &amp; R. 290; Lyon v. Huntingdon Bank, 12 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 61; Hain v.

Webster, 160 Pa. 473.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-11\"><em>Charles </em>Bknsieher, for appellee, filed no paper-book.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0Z\">October 7, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AU8\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">It may be conceded that the note on which the judgment was entered was executed and delivered by defendant on or about April 4, 1887 ; but there appears to be little if any doubt that, at the time it was given, the payee was indebted to the maker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>on an unsettled account, in a sum equal to or greater than the face of the note. Mr. Smith the subscribing witness to the note, and the only person who appears to have been present when it was signed and delivered, testified in substance that the defendant objected to signing it, and said to the plaintiff: \u201cIt is not right for me to sign the note. You know we have not had a settlement and you owe me; \u201d to which plaintiff assented, and gave as his reason for requesting the note, that he wanted \u201c to show it to some one, .... so they could see where the money went,\u201d etc. Defendant then said: \u201cI will sign it, but it is not right; .... if you die I will lose this money.\u201d In reply to this, the witness said: \u201cNo, not if I am living you won\u2019t, but it is a queer way of doing business.\u201d Defendant thereupon signed the note. The same apparently disinterested witness further testified that plaintiff admitted he was then indebted to defendant on an unsettled account; that subsequently, in conversations with him in relation to the transaction, he said it was all right, that he and the defendant did business that way between themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As tending to corroborate the testimony to which reference has been made, it was also shown by a witness, familiar with defendant\u2019s books, that they show an indebtedness of about $1005, by plaintiff to defendant at the time the note was given. An additional circumstance that may have some weight, in connection with other evidence, is the fact that, although plaintiff became insolvent shortly after the note was given and continued so until his decease, he never entered up the note or demanded either principal or interest thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Without further reference to the evidence in support of the rule, we think it tends to show that whatever object the parties may have had in view when the note was signed and delivered, it was not their intention that it should be regarded as evidence of the maker\u2019s then indebtedness to the plaintiff, payee therein named, or be enforced as such. While the case is involved in considerable doubt, we are of opinion that it presents questions of fact which the defendant should have an opportunity of submitting to a jury for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Decree reversed, with costs to be paid by the appellee, and it is now adjudged and decreed that the rule to show cause be made absolute and an issue in proper form awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
