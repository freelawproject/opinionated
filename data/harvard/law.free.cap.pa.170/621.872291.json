Objection overruled, exception and bill sealed.\u201d [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-13\">The court refused to sustain the defendants\u2019 exception to the offer in evidence of writ of scire facias, Gustavus Conklin\u2019s use v. J. C. Cleveland and Florence A. Cleveland, terre tenant, being the sci. fa. in this case. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-4\">\u201c [Under our view of the law, as we have instructed you, the plaintiff would be entitled to the balance due upon this judgment, which has been computed to be $2,185, and we instruct you to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for that amount.] \u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1, 2) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions; (4) portion of charge as above, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-7\"><em>Edward </em>Overton, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1t\">A judgment regularly revived by scire facias is not void, even if the original judgment is void: Duff v. Wynkoop, 74 Pa. 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-8\">As a judgment is the end of the law in settling controversies, there is no reason why one of revival on agreement of the parties shall not be as conclusive as one taken on a writ of scire facias, unless impeached for fraud: Lamb\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-9\">A scire facias is the equivalent of an action of debt. It has with us all the qualities of an action. A use plaintiff cannot split the judgment on the line of his own interest: Hopkins v. Stockdale, 117 Pa. 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-10\">A prior recovery of a final judgment in other proceedings is a bar to the recovery of a judgment in attachment whether a bond be filed or not: Miller v. Roher, 127 Pa. 384; Baxley v. Linah, 16 Pa. 241; O\u2019Neal v. O\u2019Neal, 4 W. &amp; S. 130; Walton\u2019s App., 153 Pa. 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-11\">Each successive writ of scire facias to revive a judgment must be founded upon the judgment which immediately preceded it. A recovery upon a writ of scire facias is a bar to any subsequent recovery upon the original judgment: Collingwood v. Carson, 2 W. &amp; S. 220; Custer v. Detterer, 3 W. &amp; S. 28; Wetmore v. Wetmore, 155 Pa. 507; Sayer v. Shr\u0153der, 2 Penny. 79.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-12\"><em>J. </em>C. Ingham, D\u2019A. <em>Overton </em>with him, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9B\">The rule deducible from all' the cases would seem to be that, if the judgment is regularly revived against the defendant, and the plaintiff has no knowledge, actual or constructive, of any terre tenant, then the lien of the original judgment is continued and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>preserved against the land in the hands of the terre tenant: Buck\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 109; Meinweiser v. Hains, 110 Pa. 468; Hughes v. Torrence, 111 Pa. 611.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-3\">And while the lien is so preserved a scire facias may issue on the original judgment to revive it against the terre tenant: Freeman v. Phelps, 15 Pa. 36; Porter v. Hitchcock, 98 Pa. 625.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-4\">We can find neither principle nor precedent for the contention that an amicable scire facias is not just as efficacious to preserve the lien in such a case as a writ of scire facias sued out: Fish\u2019s Troubat &amp; Haly\u2019s Practice, vol. 2, p. 540; Armstrong\u2019s App., 5 W. &amp; S. 555; Porter v. Hitchcock, 98 Pa. 625.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-5\">It is the original judgment that is to be revived against the terre tenant: Fursht v. Overdeer, 3 W. &amp; S. 470; Little v. Smyser, 10 Pa. 381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-6\">The judgment on the amicable scire facias in this case could not be revived against the terre tenant, as she was not a party to it: Davidson v. Thornton, 7 Pa. 133; Wetmore v. Wetmore, 155 Pa. 507.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANbV\">October 7, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AEB\">Mr. Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">This case arises upon the same facts considered in Conklin v. J. C. Cleveland, ante, p. 611, in which case an opinion has just been filed. The judgment now appealed from is that which was rendered by the court below upon the trial on the writ of scire facias issued in 1892, to revive the judgment of 1886 against J. C. Cleveland, defendant, and Florence A. Cleveland, his wife, as terre tenant. The reasons for holding this judgment to be erroneous are stated with sufficient fullness in the opinion just referred to, and we shall do no more at this time than to refer to it as sustaining the judgment now to be entered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
