J., specially presiding, filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-8\">\u201c On January 21, 1890, Z. D. Jenkins, committee of Samuel N. Fessenden, a lunatic, presented his petition to the orphans\u2019 court of Susquehanna county, to enforce a legacy charged upon land in favor of the lunatic. The will of Asa Fessenden, probated the 22d day of August, 1865, provided among other things as follows: \u2018 I give and bequeath unto my son Frederick A. Fessenden, and his heirs and assigns forever, all my real estate situate in the township of Bridgewater, aforesaid, one piece or parcel thereof on which my dwelling now stands, containing about eighteen acres, one other piece thereof adjoining lands of Geo. Fessenden and Ezra Beebe on the north, on the west by the highway, on the south by William Kelly, and on the east by Moses S. Tyler, containing about fifty-seven acres, more or less, subject however, to the support and maintenance of my son Samuel N. Fessenden and my daughter, Lora E. Fessenden, during their natural lives and the said Frederick A. Fessenden is not to dispose of the said lands during the natural lives of the said Samuel N. and Lora E., except that he shall make provisions for the faithful support and maintenance of the said Samuel N. and Lora E., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>as shall be approved by the orphans\u2019 court of Susquehanna county.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-4\">\u201c Frederick A. Fessenden accepted the land in pursuance of this devise and entered into possession of it. In 1867 a judgment was entered against him by D. D. Searle, and by process issued upon this judgment the 18 acre piece was sold by the sheriff to D. D. Searle, and deed made to him on the 22d of April; 1874. On the 7th of March, 1868, F. A. Fessenden sold the 57 acre piece to Moses Tyler, who by his will devised it to B. A. Tyler in 1894, who has since been in possession of it. Due notice has been given to the parties in interest. The petitioner seeks to enforce the legacy given for the support of Samuel N. Fessenden out of the land mentioned in the above recited devise. The matter was referred to an auditor and is now before us on exceptions to his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-5\">\u201c One objection to looking to the land for Samuel\u2019s support is founded upon the 7th section of the act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 369, Pur. 1064, pi. 11, which provides as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-6\">\u201c \u2018 In all cases where no payment, claim or demand shall have been made on account of, or for any ground-rent, annuity or other charge upon real estate, for twenty-one years, or no declaration or acknowledgment of the existence thereof shall have been made within that period, by the owner of the premises, subject to such ground-rent, annuity or charge, a release or extinguishment thereof shall be presumed, and such ground-rent, annuity or charge shall thereafter be irrecoverable.\u2019 It is contended by counsel for B. A. Tyler that, as the 57 acre piece was deeded to him or his grantor on the 7th of March, 1868, and that this petition was presented to the court on the 20th of January, 1890, a period of about 22 years, during which no payment, claim or demand had been made upon him or his immediate grantor, on account of this charge upon the land, and no declaration or acknowledgment of the existence thereof had been made within that period by him, or his immediate grantor, the charge upon the 57 acre piece was extinguished. Now the act above referred to is constitutional: Biddle v. Hooven, 120 Pa. 221, and it applies to a legacy on land. Pratt v. Eby, 67 Pa. 396; Wingett\u2019s Appeal, 122 Pa. 486. There is no exception in the act in favor of lunatics: Metz v. Hipps, 96 Pa. 15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201c In deciding whether this act bars the claim against the 57 acre piece we must bear in mind the situation of the parties. F. A. Fessenden, by accepting the legacy of the two pieces of land, assumed and substantially agreed to perform the conditions annexed to the gift. He became personally and primarily liable for the support of Samuel, and the support of Samuel is charged upon these two pieces of land by the will. And Samuel may resort to the laud when Frederick Fessenden fails to discharge the personal liability resting upon him. It is an undisputed fact in the case that Frederick has supported Samuel from the death of Asa Fessenden, the testator, in 1864, until October 28, 1889. Up to this time there was no occasion for Samuel to resort to the land and no power in him to do so, for Frederick was performing the conditions of the devise, and to that extent exonerating the land. Undet such circumstances can it be said that no payment has been made on account of this charge upon real estate for 21 years, or that no acknowledgment of the existence of it has been made within that period by the owner of the premises ? True it may be said that Tyler was the owner under an absolute conveyance from March 7,1868, to the filing of this petition on January 21,1890, and that during that time no claim had been made upon Tyler, neither did Tyler make any acknowledgment of its existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-4\">\u201c The word \u2018 owner \u2019 in this act of assembly we think means in this case the devisee and his grantees. The act was never intended to bar a claim or a charge while it was being performed by the person primarily liable. If it could be made to-apply under such circumstances, then one who has accepted a legacy conditioned for the support of another can sell the land upon which the legacy may be charged, faithfully perform his liability for 21 years and free the land from the charge. That the statute does not run while the condition is being performed is held in Brown\u2019s Petition, 9 Phila. B. 548. Of course there is no pretense for invoking this act to relieve the 18 acre piece, for Frederick Fessenden was in possession of it down to the-time of the sheriff sale on the 22d of April, 1874, and, according to the report of the auditor, down to 1890. Under this act it may well be contended that the charge upon the land for Lora E. Fessenden is barred, if nothing has been done for her for the-period of 21 years, but Samuel\u2019s claim we think is not barred, and he may resort to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>u The next question raised here is to the order in which these pieces of land must contribute to his support. It is claimed that the land first sold by Frederick Fessenden must be looked to last, and that the lands sold last by him should be resorted to first. If Frederick Fessenden sold the 18 acre piece first, and kept the 57 acre piece, as between him and the grantee of the 18 acre piece, we should certainly require the 57 acre piece to be exhausted first. And Frederick Fessenden could not sell the 57 acre piece so as to put the purchaser in-any better position than he was himself, (for the purchaser would sit in the seat of the grantor): Cowden\u2019s Estate, 1 Pa. 267; Nailer v. Stanley, 10 S. &amp; R. 453. Under the authority of Cowden\u2019s Estate, the title of Searle to the 18 acres piece relates back to the entry of his judgment in 1867, about a year prior to the purchase by Tyler. The legacy for the support of Samuel is a charge upon both pieces of land, but we will exhaust the 57 acre piece before we go upon the 18 acre piece. Searle\u2019s judgment was a lien upon both pieces. When he attempted to make the money on his judgment by the sale of the real estate in 1874, he found that the 57 acre piece had been conveyed to Tyler, and under the rule that the real estate must be sold in the inverse order of its alienation, was compelled to sell the 18 acre piece first. And this sale satisfying the judgment, left Tyler in the undisturbed possession of his purchase. We are now applying the same rule with regard to the order of the sale of pieces of land aliened at different times, which was probably applied to Searle in 1874. It may seem a hardship to require the 57 acre piece to contribute to the support of Samuel N. Fessenden, but when Tyler purchased in 1868 he must have inquired how it was that Frederick, one of three children, could convey the whole title. He was bound to inquire\" into Frederick\u2019s title, and finding it was by will of his father, to look at the conditions of it. He knew, or must be supposed to have known, that this charge rested upon the land. The owner of that piece is in no position to complain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-4\">\u201c The auditor has found that $3.00 per week from the 22d day of March, 1892, is a reasonable sum to pay for his support. The costs in the proceeding we divide equally between the owners of the two pieces of laud. If the costs and weekly charges are paid it will not be necessary to order a sale, if how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ever they are not paid, a sale may be ordered on application to court, and counsel may prepare a decree in accordance with this opinion. Numerous other questions have been raised in this case, but we deem it unnecessary to discuss them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-4\">August 28, 1894, the court, upon motion of T.

And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that D. D. Searle pay one half the costs in these proceedings, and B. A. Tyler the other one half of said costs. That said costs be paid within thirty days from this date, and that in default thereof the respective pieces of real estate described in the petition aforesaid be sold for the payment of said costs at public sale on a writ of levari facias.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-6\">\u201c And it is further adjudged and decreed that the 57 acre piece shall first be exhausted in payment of the aforesaid sum due the estate of Samuel N.

Is is an important finding because upon it is based so much of the decree appealed from as requires that the fifty-seven acre lot purchased by Moses S. Tyler on the 12th of March, 1868, \u201cshall be exhausted in payment of the sum due the estate of Samuel N. Fessenden \u201d before resorting to the eighteen acres for the payment of any portion of the same. The general rule is that the finding of an auditor approved by the court will be sustained on appeal, if there is any evidence which warranted it, but his finding of a material fact without evidence or palpably against it constitutes ground for reversal. In the case before us it seems to be conceded by the learned counsel for the appellee that no evidence was submitted to the auditor on the hearing by either of the litigants showing when the judgment on which the eighteen acre lot was sold on the 22d of April, 1874, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>entered. As the purchaser of this lot acquired his title to it more than seven years after Tyler purchased the fifty-seven acre lot, it was incumbent on the former to prove the existence of facts which gave him as against the latter the position and rights of a first purchaser. These lots prior to the sale of either of them were alike subject to the charge laid upon them by the will of Asa Fessenden, in favor of his sou Samuel. Prima facie, Tyler by his purchase acquired the right, in equity, to have the eighteen acre lot sold in satisfaction of this charge before resorting to his lot for payment of it. If his grantor still owned the eighteen acre lot, or had subsequent to his purchase of the fifty-seven acres sold and conveyed it to the present owner of it, there can be no doubt that this equity could be enforced. We think it is equally clear that it could be enforced if the lot was sold on a judgment entered after the Tyler purchase. B ut the learned court below appeared to think it was sold on a judgment entered before this purchase and that, therefore, the present owner of it must be regarded as the first purchaser of a portion of the property charged with the support of Samuel. Whether the conclusion is warranted by the premises is a question which was <em>not </em>discussed or raised in the paper-books, or on the argument at bar, and we express no opinion in regard to it. To do so intelligently we ought to know when the judgment was entered and when it was revived, because, if it was entered before the Tyler purchase, a timely revival was necessary to continue the lien of it beyond the 12th of March, 1873. It is claimed by the appellant that the lien of the Read, Watrous &amp; Foster judgment was lost before the sale in 1874, and that the Meacliam judgment was entered on the 6th of April, 1870, and to show the good faith of his contention in this respect, his counsel exhibited on the argument at bar an exemplification of the record which appeared to sustain it. We may add that the registry of the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed shows that the lot was sold on the Meacham judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">It seems to us that justice to all concerned requires that we sustain the first specification and reverse the finding on which it is based, so that it may be ascertained, on competent evidence, upon what judgment the lot was sold, the time of its entry, and of the revival or revivals of it, if there were any before the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>We are not satisfied from our examination of the testimony that the learned auditor erred in the finding complained of in the third specification, or in not finding as it is claimed in the second specification he should have found as to the matters mentioned therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">We think that as F. A. Fessenden was made a party defendant in this proceeding, and was by reason of his acceptance of the devise personally and primarily liable for the support of Samuel, the decree should have been entered against him for the amount due Samuel\u2019s estate, to be levied, on his and his vendees\u2019 failure to pay it within a time specified, on the lands secondarily liable for it, in the inverse order of their alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We agree with the learned court below in its conclusion that the charge upon the Tyler lot is not extinguished by the act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 369, or by the supplement thereto of Feb. 2,1869, P. L. 3. The reasons given for this conclusion are quite sufficient to sustain it. There was no default on the part of the person primarily liable for Samuel\u2019s support prior to 1890 and Tyler kuew there was none. From 1864 to 1890 Samuel was maintained by his brother Frederick in accordance with the provisions of his father\u2019s will and to that extent the burden on the lands on which his support was charged was lightened. Frederick\u2019s support of him during this period was in relief of his vendees, who were advised by the will of his father of the terms on which he might dispose of the lands devised to him, but it cannot be construed as an extinguishment of the charge upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We are not convinced that the proceedings to ascertain the amount due Samuel\u2019s estate were premature or tainted with fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">To the extent that the rulings complained of conflict with the views herein expressed the specifications are sustained. The remaining specifications are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Decree reversed at the costs of the appellee, and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
