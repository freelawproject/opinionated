The bill contained a minute description of the bridge, a statement of its strength, the weight of the cars, etc., and the danger to be apprehended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-3\">The prayer was for a preliminary injunction, to be made perpetual, restraining the defendant company from the use of the bridge for their street railway traffic; from connecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>rails and wires upon the streets, and from interfering with the complainants in their management and control of the bridge, and doing such work thereon as they might deem necessary and proper for the preservation of the bridge and the safety of the public in its ordinary use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">Defendants in the answer admitted that the bridge was not strong enough for the ordinary use of the public, and that it would not be strong enough with the street car traffic added thereto. They averred that they did not intend to use or run their cars over the same until it should be so strengthened as to make it perfectly safe for such use; that they had proposed to the complainants to make the necessary changes or additions at their own expense. They admitted that they intended to use the bridge for street car traffic. They also admitted their request to the county commissioners for permission to use the bridge, and the refusal of such request; but denied that the commissioners had any valid power to grant or refuse. They averred that they had the permission of the city authorities, and that the city authorities were the \u201c local authorities \u201d under the act, etc., and admitted that the commissioners were charged with the duty of maintaining the bridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">The evidence showed that the bridge, unless materially strengthened and enlarged, was neither safe nor of sufficient capacity to accommodate both the general traveling public and the defendant company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">The court in an opinion by Taylor, P.

The details of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>that legislation will be found in the act of February, 1865, P. L. 729, supplement thereto of March 10, 1865, P. L. 731, and general laws for the protection of bridges, etc., which were made applicable to said acts. By the second section of the supplement the town council of the borough was authorized \u201c to collect toll from all persons except foot passengers, using \u25a0said bridge, until the proceeds arising from said tolls will liquidate the bonds \u201d that were issued to pay for the construction of the bridge. As required by the act of 1870, P. L. 997, under which it was purchased by the county, the bridge was declared \u201c free of all tolls for all purposes thereafter.\u201d By that purchase, the county became the owner of the bridge as fully to all intents and purposes as if it had been erected by the county under the general law relating to county bridges. The burden of maintaining the bridge was thus shifted from the borough to the county at large. As was said in Berks County v. Reading City, etc. Cos., 167 Pa. 118, the county thus became liable for its safety as a part of the public highway; and in consequence of the duty thus cast upon the county, it is clothed with the powers necessary to enable it to regulate the public use of the bridge so far as its own protection and the safety of \u2022those using it may require. The county cannot close it against \u25a0the public as an owner might close his house. It is bound to keep it open and in good repair, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">There appears to be no question as to the validity of defendant company\u2019s charter. So far as they had the power to do so, the proper \u201c local authorities \u201d of the city within whose limits the bridge is located appear to have given their consent, in due form, as required by the constitution ; and, so far as the streets designated in its charter are concerned, the company\u2019s right to proceed with the construction and operation of its road, with due regard to the rights of the general public therein, is not questioned by anyone, as the case is now presented. But, that \u25a0does not give the defendant company the right to exclude the public from the use of the bridge which forms a link in the street or highway on which it is erected, or to so use the bridge as to render it unsafe for public travel. If the bridge is either of insufficient strength or of insufficient capacity to accommodate the general public travel and also defendant company\u2019s \u25a0cars and cannot be so strengthened or enlarged as to do so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>it is very clear that neither the city nor the county at large is bound to provide the defendant with a suitable viaduct or other means of crossing Oil creek at the point in question. It may be that there are kindly disposed municipalities who gratuitiously open, grade and pave streets, and bridge streams for the accommodation of street railway companies, but they are certainly under no legal obligation to do so. As the case is now presented, the evidence tends to show, what is practically conceded, that unless the bridge in question is materially strengthened and enlarged, it is neither safe nor of sufficient capacity to accommodate both the general traveling public and the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">If that is found to be so, the question will be whether it is practicable to so enlarge or strengthen the bridge, or both, as to safely and conveniently accommodate all parties concerned. If it is found to be practicable to do so, and the parties litigant cannot come together and agree upon a proper mode of accomplishing that result, the only remedy appears to be something similar to that suggested in the supplemental opinion and decree in Berks County v. Reading City, etc. Cos., 167 Pa. 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In view of what has been so well said on the general subject by our Brother Williams, in the case above referred to, we think that further elaboration is neither necessary nor desirable. The case goes back for further hearing and final decree, and sufficient has been said to indicate the course to be pursued in case the controlling facts are found to be as now suggested by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">We are not prepared to say there was any error in continuing the preliminary injunction. The appeal is therefore dismissed, and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for further proceedings. Costs to abide the result of the final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
