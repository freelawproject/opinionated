Bill sealed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">A. \u201c Depreciates it, $25.00 to $30.00 an acre.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">When John E. Huey, witness for defendant, was on the stand, he was asked this question : \u201c Q. What in your judgment was the damage done to that property by reason of the pipe line being laid upon it? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">Wm. M. Hayes : \u201c Do you mean the construction damages ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQH\">Mr. Reid: \u201cYes, sir; and everything.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">Wm. M. Hayes: \u201cI object. He does not know anything about the construction damages ; he was not there when it was done, and knows nothing more than the jury or our witnesses. He was not there and did not see how it was done, and cannot form any better judgment than the jury. Our witnesses were not allowed to speak of that except those that were there when the construction was going on.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-10\">By the Court: \u201cQ. Were you there when the construction was going on? A. No, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-11\">Mr. Reid: \u201c He knew the property before the pipe line went on it, and has known of sales of property with pipe lines on them. I asked him what was the difference in value, taking everything into consideration, before and after.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-12\">The Court: \u201c I do not think he is competent to pass on construction damage; he can pass on the other. There are so many elements that enter into the construction that might not appear on the face of the ground, such as destruction of fences, and the injury that is temporarily done, and does not show after it is filled in. Unless he saw the way it was constructed I do not think he is competent to testify on construction damages, \u2014 not as to the damages that were occasioned by reason of the construction. Unless he has knowledge of how it was constructed, how badly the ground was trampled over or cut up, the destruction of trees and fences, I do not see how he can testify; he can see nothing more than the jury saw. The objection is sustained. Bill sealed.\u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-13\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,180.

Schraek, had not sufficient knowledge of the effect of the existence of pipe line easements upon the sale of property to make them competent to give an estimate or an opinion of the effect of such easements upon the market value of the property.: Rogers on Expert Testimony, sec. 153; Penna. P. &amp; B. R. R. v. Root, 53 N. J. L. 255; Michael v. The Crescent Pipe Line Co., 159 Pa. 104; Curtin v. R. R., 135 Pa. 30; Pittsburg etc. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 325; R. R. Co. v.

Decker, 82 Pa. 119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-4\">John E. Huey was a competent witness. Any farmer passing over the line immediately after its construction, and observing the results, could form an estimate of the damages occasioned by the construction with reasonable accuracy. It was not necessary for him to be on the property every day the pipe line men were there and see every shovelful of dirt thrown in and out, to make an estimate of the damage done thereby.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-5\"><em>Wm.
