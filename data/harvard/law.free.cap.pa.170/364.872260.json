Mewes was not qualified to give an opinion as to the depreciation in the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s farm, because of the existence of the pipe line\u2019s easement upon it: Michael v. Crescent Pipe Line, 159 Pa. 99; Pittsburg etc. Ry. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 332; Beck v. Penna. P. &amp; B. R. R., 148 Pa. 271; Jones v. R. R., 151 Pa. 30; Penna. &amp; Poughkeepsie R. R. v. Root, 53 N. J. L. 253; Lawson on Expert and Opinion Evidence, 447; Brown v. R. R., 12 R. I. 238.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-15\">R. W. Schrack had not sufficient knowledge of the effect of such an easement upon the selling value of property to qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>him to give an opinion: R. R. v. Patterson, 107 Pa. 464; Pittsburg etc. R. R. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 331; Curtin v. R. R., 135 Pa. 20; Michael v. Crescent Pipe Line Co., 159 Pa. 99.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-3\">If Schrack was competent to testify upon the effect of pipe line easement upon the selling value of farm lands on which they were located, it was error to reject the testimony of Eli Thompson to the same effect. He had sold a property with a pipe line easement upon it. Each knew of but one property sold thus affected.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-4\"><em>Holding, </em>of <em>Monaghan Sf Holding, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auu\">The witness must have a fair knowledge of the land in question, the extent and condition of its improvements, its quantity, quality, and productiveness, and the uses to which it may be reasonably applied, together with the general selling price of lands in the neighborhood at the time: Michael v. Crescent Pipe Line, 159 Pa. 99; Pitts., Virginia &amp; Charleston R. R. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 325.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">It has never been required of a witness, in order to make him competent, to give his opinion of the value of property and its depreciation by reason of the construction of a railroad, that he have knowledge of sales of real estate incumbered by a similar easement: Curtin v. R. R., 135 Pa. 20; Jones v. R. R., 151 Pa. 30; Beck v. R. R., 148 Pa. 271; Schuylkill R. R. v. Rees, 26 W. N. C. 502; R. R. v. Playford, 13 Cent. 94; R. R. v. Stocker, 128 Pa. 233.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6b\">October 7, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AlOy\">Mr. Chief Justice Sterrett,</author>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">This ease came into the court below on plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the report of viewers appointed to assess the damages he sustained by the defendant company\u2019s location, construction, etc. of its oil pipe line across his farm. On the trial of the issue, he called eleven witnesses for the purpose of showing the character of his farm, its size and productive qualities, the extent and condition of the improvements thereon, the manner in which it had been cut by the construction of defendant\u2019s pipe line, the way in which the soil had been broken, etc. in the process of its construction, the market value of the farm before and' after the pipe line was constructed, etc. Nine of these witnesses were admittedly competent, and their testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>not excepted to. The other two, Josiah E. Mewes and R. W. Schrack, were objected to on the ground that they were incompetent to testify to the market value of the farm either before or after the construction of defendant\u2019s pipe line; but the objection was overruled and they both testified under exception. Eli Thompson, one of defendant\u2019s witnesses, was excluded by the court on the grouud of incompetency. These rulings, admitting the testimony of the two first named witnesses and excluding that of the latter constitute the only assignments of error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Without i*eferring at length to the testimony bearing on the qualifications of the two witnesses, Mewes and Schrack, it is enough to say that their competency to testify as they did was sufficiently established by competent evidence. It was shown in substance that Mr. Mewes lived upon the adjoining farm, and knew the one in question for over fifty years, knew the character and productiveness of its soil, the kind and quality of the improvements, extent and sources of the water supply, etc. He also knew the prices at which lauds in the neighborhood were held, and the prices at which they had been sold prior to the construction of defendant\u2019s pipe line and up to within six months of the trial. These and other qualifying- facts were sufficiently established before the Avitness Avas asked to give his opinion as to the market value of his brother\u2019s farm. In like manner, and by substantially the same kind of testimony, the competency of Mr. Schrack, the other Avitness, was sufficiently shoAvn to justify his admission also.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Tested by the principle recognized in Michael v. Crescent Pipe Line Co., 159 Pa. 99, wherein Railway Co. v. Vance, 115 Pa. 325, and other cases are approvingly cited and followed, we are all o'f opinion that the testimony complained of was rightly admitted. In that case, the source, extent and character of the witnesses\u2019 knowledge did not satisfactorily appear. In the case now under consideration, we think it does; and hence the difference resulting from application of the same recognized test. It was not intended to adopt a severer test of competency in that case than had theretofore been applied to the same class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">As to Mr. Thompson, the witness called by the defendant, his knowledge of the property was clearly not sufficient, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the rule, to justify the admission of his testimony. He had never.seen the property, nor was there any testimony to show that he had even been in the neighborhood. Unlike the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, it did not appear that he had any personal knowledge of the \u201c subject-matter of the inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
