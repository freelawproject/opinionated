Fine imposed, $6.00 and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">The ease was tried by Furst, P. J., specially sitting, without a jury. The opinion of the court was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-11\">FACTS FOUND.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-12\">\u201c 1. The Lewisburg and Mifflinburg turnpike road is a part or portion of the old Waterford and Erie turnpike, chartered under the act of 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-13\"><em>\u201c2. </em>George Kling, the informer, owns a lot sixty-six feet wide adjoining this turnpike road on the north side, in said East Buffalo township. The turnpike road is sixty feet in width. He became the owner of this lot in the year 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u201c 3. About ten years ago a pavement, five feet in width, made of cinder and gravel, was constructed along this turnpike. It was constructed by, and under the management and direction of, the superintendent of said turnpike company. Various persons contributed toward the expense of its construction, including the defendant. It has been kept in repair by the turnpike company and by those persons desiring a sidewalk along the pike, voluntarily, ever since. This pavement extended the whole distance of this lot and some distance farther. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-3\">\u201c 4. The informer, George Kling, did not build or erect this sidewalk along his premises. It existed there at least five or six years before he became the owner of the lot. There is no evidence that he ever contributed toward the erection of this sidewalk. It is five feet in width, and it is wholly within the township of East Buffalo, some distance west of Lewisburg, in Union county. [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\">\u201c5. James B. Forrest, on July 9, 1844, rode on a bicycle over this sidewalk; he committed no injury thereto. It does not appear upon what part of the sidewalk he rode. Before doing so, he asked and obtained permission of the manager of the turnpike company to ride thereon. [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">\u201c 6. This sidewalk was not erected by the predecessor in title of George Kling, but by neighbors generally in connection with the turnpike company. The defendant did not, in riding over it on July 9, do so maliciously or with any intent to commit injury thereto. His act in so doing was devoid of the least injury. The sidewalk is wholly within the limits of the turnpike road or highway. It is not upon lands adjoining the highway but upon the highway itself. It is not maintained by George Kling or kept in repair by him. It was built about the year 1883 or prior thereto. [11]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">\u201c 7. The defendant submitted certain propositions of fact which are incorporated herewith, with our findings thereon; many of them, however, are embraced in our general findings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">\u201c CONCLUSIONS OS\u2019 LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">\u201c1. We find the following propositions of law, viz: That defendant did not violate the third section of the act of May 7, 1889, P. L. 110, and hence he could not be convicted thereunder. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201c 2. That defendant did not ride or drive any horse or other animal over this sidewalk or footway, and therefore he could not have done so willfully or maliciously. That riding a bicycle is not equivalent to riding or driving \u2018a horse or any other animal,\u2019 within the meaning of the third section of said act. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">\u201c 3. That penal statutes cannot be extended by construction so as to embrace acts and persons not within either the purview or express meaning of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">\u201c 4. That persons riding a bicycle are not embraced within the act of May 7, 1889, supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">\u201c 5. This act was intended to apply to sidewalks erected after its passage; but whether this be so or not defendant is not within its penal provisions. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">\u201c 6. That the act of April 23,1889, P. L. 44, was intended to regulate and define the rights, privileges and duties of persons using bicycles, etc., as a means of locomotion or of travel upon the public highways of this commonwealth, and hence has no application to the present case. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">\u201c 7. That under the facts of this case there was nothing in the act of defendant in riding upon this footway, in East Buffalo township, which subjected him to a fine or prosecution for so doing. In connection with these findings, we incorporate our answers to the points submitted by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">\u201c 8. That defendant was improperly convicted and fined. That he is therefore entitled to be discharged, and hence relieved from said conviction. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-10\">\u201c 9. That judgment be entered in favor of the defendant.\u201d [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-11\"><em>JSrrors assigned </em>were, (1-6) to the conclusions of law as above, quoting them; (8-11) to the finding of facts as above, quoting them; (7) entering judgment for defendant; (12) entering the following decree: And now, November 14, 1894, the exceptions filed are dismissed. Defendant discharged. Cost of record arising in the quarter sessions to be paid by the county.

Outside the borough of Lewisburg, and in the township of East Buffalo, is the village of Linnville, which is built up on both sides of and along the turnpike for the distance of about a mile. Although most of the houses are along the turnpike, the village is regularly laid out, and to some extent built upon streets and squares. For a mile on the north side of the turnpike, a smooth footwalk about four feet wide is constructed for the use of the residents of the village. This walk is within the limits of the sixty feet, which the turnpike company had appropriated for its highway, but the walk had been put there by permission of the company. It had been constructed and kept up by contributions from the residents of the village and by the turnpike company, and had been in existence about ten years on July 9, 1894. On that day, Forrest, the defendant, rode a bicycle on this walk, and on information made before a justice by George Kling, an owner of property fronting on it, was arrested for violation of the sidewalk act of May 7, 1889. After hearing, judgment was given against him, and a fine of six dollars for the use of the school district, as directed by the act, imposed. From this judgment, the defendant appealed to the court of quarter sessions, which after a rehearing, reversed and set aside the judgment, and from that the commonwealth appeals. The controlling reason assigned for setting aside the judgment of the magistrate by the learned judge of the court below is, that a bicycle, not being \u201c a horse or other animal,\u201d as specified in the act of May 7,1889, no penalty can be imposed for propelling it upon a sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">The 3d section of the act is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">\u201cIf any person or persons shall willfully and maliciously ride or drive any horse or any other animal, upon or into any boardwalk or sidewalk or foot way laid, erected or being on and along the side of any road or highway in any township of this commonwealth, or shall otherwise willfully break, injure or destroy the same, the person or persons so offending shall upon conviction thereof before any magistrate, etc., be sentenced,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Standing by itself, we think this act, being penal in its provisions, would not have embraced the bicycle rider; but read in connection with the act of 23d of April, 1889, an opposite conclusion is clearly warranted. The last named act is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u201c Bicycles, tricycles and all vehicles propelled by hand or foot, and all persons by whom bicycles, tricycles and such other vehicles are used, ridden or propelled upon the public highways of this state, shall be entitled to the same rights and subject to the same restrictions in the use thereof, as are prescribed by law in the cases of persons using carriages drawn by horses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The first named act imposed a penalty upon the driver of a horse who should willfully drive him upon any sidewalk in any township within the commonwealth; the last named act subjected the bicycle rider to the same restriction as the driver of the horse; the driver of the carriage and the bicycle have the same rights, and are subject to the same restrictions and penalties; the one by whip and lines drives his horse, with vehicle, upon the sidewalk; the other drives his vehicle upon it with his feet and legs. It will scarcely be disputed that a bicjmler is within the spirit of the act; it is wholly improbable the legislature intended to exempt him. The sidewalk is for foot travelers, men, women and children ; a very few years of observation and experience in the new mode of traveling by bicycle has resulted in the conclusion, that this vehicle is fully as dangerous to those walking on the same road as the carriage drawn by a horse. A carriage, with rider, weighing together two to three hundred pounds, propelled w.ith the speed of a trolley car\u00f3n a sidewalk, is full of peril to the life and limb of the foot traveler. No bicjmler, with due regard to the safety and rights of his fellows, should demand the use, in common with foot travelers, of a walk with such a vehicle, and the intention of the legislature to debar him from such use is manifest, not only from the terms of the two acts, when read together, but also from the reason and spirit that prompted their passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">To the argument here, that the act of May 7 only specifies the driving of a horse not hitched to a wagon or carriage, and that although a bicycle may be a carriage or vehicle, yet by no liberality of construction can it be called a horse, we can only answer that such construction of the act is absurd; the legislature declared that \u201cif any person or persons shall willfully or maliciously ride or drive any horse or other animal;\u201d by this, they meant the two and only known methods of using the horse, riding astride of him, or driving him in a vehicle. To suppose they intended to prohibit that, which no one had done or would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>do, drive a horse by following at his heels on foot, would be altogether an unreasonable interpretation. Where one of two constructions would lead to absurdity, the absurd construction ought not to be adopted: Phila. v. Ry. Co., 102 Pa. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">We do not think it material that the informer in this case, had not contributed to the original construction of the sidewalk; nor, although he aided in keeping it in repair, do we think that fact material. It was a sidewalk, by design, construction and use, alongside a highway in a township, and he with his family, had the right to its use to the exclusion of a dangerous vehicle; and this, even though he had in no way aided in constructing or keeping it in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Nor does the fact that the walk was on land appropriated by the turnpike company deprive it of its character as a sidewalk; the company was asserting no right; if it had been constructed and used as a sidewalk by its consent, it had none to assert; that it was so constructed and used clearly appears by the testimony of the company\u2019s manager. And the consent of the company to its use by bicyclers would not avail defendant; a law of the commonwealth cannot be repealed by the manager of a turnpike company. If this was an established sidewalk alongside a highway in a township, as it clearly was, then it is subject to the laws of the commonwealth regulating and restricting its use. It is not in the power of any individual or corporation to license a violation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The further argument of appellee, that he and all other bicyclers have used the sidewalk heretofore without complaint, avails nothing as a defense, for it onty demonstrates the extent of the grievance, which at last became unbearable; such use, in any considerable numbers by such vehicles, of a four feet sidewalk, would soon result in foot passengers, men, women and children, taking to the turnpike for safety ; this would not continue long, until the law would be invoked to decide whether the sidewalk was for foot travelers or for vehicles; whether the bicycler was in the exercise of a lawful right or was an usurper of the rights of others. We have tried to answer this question in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Therefore the judgment of the court below is reversed, and it is directed that judgment for the amount of the fine imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>by the magistrate, six dollars, be entered in favor of the commonwealth and against defendant, with costs, appellee to pay the costs of proceedings on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
