C. Harris sold to Samuel Marsh.two tracts of land in Clinton county, and on December 24, 1891, conveyed the premises by deed of special warranty at the request of Marsh to the plaintiffs. At the time of the execution of said deed there was assessed and unpaid taxes upon the land for the years 1890 and 1891, amounting to $393.40. On June 13,1892, the treasurer of Clinton county sold the lands for the payment of said taxes to one Frank T. Quiggle. The plaintiffs notified the defendant of said sale, and upon his neglecting and refusing to redeem the land the plaintiffs, on Feb. 25, 1894, redeemed the land, paying for that -purpose the sum of $491.72, and brought this suit to recover the same from the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-13\">Defendant filed the following affidavit.of defense :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-14\">\u201c 1.

That the deed to the plaintiffs was made at the request of the said Marsh, he having sold to said plaintiffs as before stated.

Ewalt, 2 Binney, 95, is not clearly expressed, but I take it to be a covenant that the grantor had done no act, nor created any incumbrance, whereby the estate granted by him might be defeated; that the estate was indefeasible as to any act of the grantor: Dorsey v.

The incumbrance, for which it is claimed he is liable under his deed, is alleged to have resulted from the nonpayment of taxes for the years 1890 and 1891, amounting together to three hundred and ninety-three dollars and forty cents. How much of this sum represents each year\u2019s taxes is not stated, and we have no means of ascertaining the same. As to so much of the claim as represents taxes for the year 1891, we are of opinion that the facts averred in the affidavit of defense are sufficient to have prevented judgment. If said taxes were assessed after defendant sold the land by articles of agreement to Samuel Marsh in July, 1890, and were permitted to remain unpaid by the vendee, the incumbrance thus created cannot, under a proper construction of the law, be regarded as an incumbrance \u201c done or suffered from the grantor,\u201d the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
