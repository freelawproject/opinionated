Code, sec. 3795-c, for desertion and non-support of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The evidence sustains both allegations of the indictment; and, therefore, if a motion to direct a verdict in favor of the accused were permissible at all und'er our procedure, it was properly overruled in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The other errors assigned by the accused which demand notice are these: (1) The refusal of the court to admit evidence to show that the accused had two small children by a former marriage dependent upon him for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Such evidence is inadmissible where the non-support of the wife, as in this case, <em>was total.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">(2) The second instruction asked by the accused and refused by the court amounts to this: that a husband cannot be found guilty of non-support of his wife when, after a separation between them, caused by his misconduct, the wife takes service and supports herself. In other words, that such action on the part of the wife operates a condonement of the offense. To state the proposition is to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">(3) The last instruction, which the court also refused, told the jury \u201cthat if they believed from the evidence that the wife . . . caused this indictment to be made because of her ill-will and hatred for her husband, and not because of his alleged desertion and neglect, then they must find for the defendant not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">There is no evidence to sustain this instruction; but, if there had been, this is a prosecution by the Commonwealth against the accused for violation of the criminal law of the State, and whatever motive may have actuated the wife to testify against him is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">In any view of the case, the judgment is plainly right and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
