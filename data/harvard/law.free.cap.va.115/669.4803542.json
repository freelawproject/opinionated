In the case in judgment, the option on one tract of land provided that the proposed purchaser should pay a stated price per acre for the land, and also reimburse the vendor for certain expenses that he would necessarily have to incur pending an option given by the same vendor to the same proposed purchaser on an entirely different and larger tract. These expenses the proposed purchaser refused to pay, and as the vendor had the right to fix his own terms in the option, and the vendee refused to accede to them, there was no completed contract between the parties for the sale and purchase of that tract of land.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-8\">Appeal from a decree of tlie Circuit Court of Shenandoah county.

Then as the season for seeding the orchard to clover, the spraying of the trees and the setting of fillers, &amp;c., is at hand it must b\u2019e understood that I am to be reimbursed with the expense of same, at cost, as incurred during the existence of the option.

After the agreement for the sale of the orchard tract had been signed by the parties, and on the same day, the appellee claims that he exercised his right to purchase the sixty-eight acre tract under his option on that tract and paid the appellant the sum of twenty dollars thereon, as shown by a receipt given by the latter in the following language: \u201cReceived of Mr. O. E. Gudebrod twenty dollars on option of 68 acres and acct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">As will be seen from the option given upon the 68 acre tract, it provides, among other things, that \u201cas the season <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>for seeding tlie orchard to clover, the spraying of the trees and the setting of fillers, &amp;c., is at hand, it must be understood that I am to be reimbursed with the expense of same, at cost, as incurred during the \u2019existence of the option.\u201d It is a concession in the case that there was no orchard on the 68 acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The first question to be considered is whether or not the appellee accepted the offer for the sixty-eight acre tract upon the terms submitted in the option; or, in other words, whether or not the minds of the parties met in making and accepting the offer. The appellee claims that when he agreed under his option to purchase the sixty-eight acre tract, paid the twenty dollars and took the receipt therefor, his understanding of the matter, and his intention, was to pay $75.00 per acre for the land in cash, or its equivalent, and to pay twenty dollars additional on account of certain plowing, etc., that had been done on the sixty-eight acre tract during the existence of the option. The appellant, on the other hand, claims that his understanding of the matter, and his intention, was that he was to receive for the sixty-eight acre tract of land the price of $75.00 per acre in cash, or its equivalent, and the cost incurred by \u201chim in seeding the orchard tract in clover, spraying the trees and setting out fillers, amounting to about $500 during the thirty days the orchard tract option was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">After the receipt for the $20 had been given, the attorney of the appellant, who was present, was directed to prepare an agreement embodying the terms of sale and purchase. On the next day when the appellee returned to the.office of the appellant to sign the agreement of sale, the parties differed as to that provision in the writing which provided for the payment of $500, the orchard account or claim of the appellant. The appellee refused to agree to pay that account, and the appellant refused to enter into an agreement for the sale of the sixty-eight acre tract unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>appellee did pay, or agree to pay, the orchard tract account, and the parties separated. Within the next thirty days the appellee, as he claims, made a tender of $5,085.75, the purchase price of the sixty-eight acre tract. (67.81 acres) at $75 per acre. The appellant declined to receive the money. Thereupon the appellee made a special deposit of the same money, or the same amount of money, in bank. The language of the special deposit and the receipt of the bank therefor is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\n<em>\u201cMemo, of instructions.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\u201cTo the Shenandoah Valley National Bank of Winchester, Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201cWinchester, Va.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cI, the undersigned, C.

Upon the appellant\u2019s declining to comply with the terms and conditions of the special deposit, the money was turned over to the clerk of the court, when this suit was instituted, which was in June following.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">According to the appellee\u2019s evidence, he never agreed to the terms of the option contract for the sale of the sixty-eight acre tract. He testifies that when the proposition was made to him to pay the cost of sowing clover seed, spraying, etc., on the orchard tract, whether made when closing the option on the orchard tract or when the option on the sixty-eight acre tract was accepted by him, he continuously and positively refused, to entertain the proposition, and that the $20 paid on option of sixty-eight acre tract and account was made for plowing on that tract. The testimony of the appellant and his brother, who was present when the $20 was paid and the receipt given, is equally positive that the \u201caccount\u201d referred to in that receipt was for labor performed on the orchard tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The weight of evidence is in favor of the appellant\u2019s contention on this question. He and his brother sustain it. The appellee alone testifies to his understanding and intention when he paid the $20 and took the receipt. The receipt itself tends to sustain the appellant\u2019s view. It shows that the $20 was paid and received \u201con the option of the sixty-eight acre tract and acct.\u201d There was no option on that tract except that which provided for the plaintiff\u2019s reimbursement of the expense incurred on the orchard tract. In the absence of parol evidence, the natural if not the necessary meaning to be placed upon the receipt is that the $20 was paid on account provided for in the option on the sixty-eight acre tract. Without the appellant\u2019s assent the appellee could not acquire the sixty-eight acre tract, except upon the terms contained in the option. The fact that the labor, etc., the payment of which was provided for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>in the option, related to the orchard tract conld not, as it se'ems to us, affect the question. The appellant had the right to impose such terms and conditions in that option as he saw proper. Indeed, it appears that the principal object the appellant had in writing the letter of March 11, 1911, giving the option on the sixty-eight acre tract was to secure the payment of the expense, which he testified he knew had to be, or should be, incurred in caring for the orchard tract during the existence of the option upon it. The option on the orchard tract, as prepared by the appellee not only did not provide for the payment of that expense, as the appellant claims it should have done, but used language which excluded that item of expense in the purchase price of the land. This fact the appellant claims he did not know when he signed the option on the orchard tract. That paper shows on its face that it was prepared hurriedly, as does the parol evidence, certainly without much care, for it wholly fails to make provision for the time when the last ten thousand dollars of the purchase price was to be paid, or to make any reference to the sixty-eight acre tract, which both parties seem to have considered had some connection with the orchard tract in their offers to buy and sell. It is true that when the terms of the agreement for the sale and purchase of the orchard tract were being considered, the item of expense for labor, etc., was mentioned, and the appellee refused to pay it. This, under the terms of his option on that tract, he clearly had the right to do, but when he determined to accept or take up the option on the sixty-eight acre tract, he could not accept it upon any other terms than those which the option contained. He did not at the time he claims to have accepted the option offer or agree to pay the labor, etc., account; and he did not do so when he made the tender of the purchase price of th\u2019e sixty-eight acre tract, nor when he made the special deposit of the money so tendered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>bank, nor when he filed his bill. On the contrary, the conduct of the appellee, as well as his words, clearly shows that he not only never offered or agreed to pay the labor, etc., account, whose payment was required by the terms of the option, but that he had no intention of doing so. Th\u2019e appellee never having accepted the terms of the option which gave him the right to purchase the sixty-eight acre tract of land, he was not entitled to a specific execution thereof, and the trial court erred in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The decree complained of must be reversed, and the bill dismissed, with costs to the appellant, subject to a credit of $20, the amount paid by the appellee to the appellant as evidenced by the receipt of April 10,1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
