Judgment for the plaintiff. Defendant assigns error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b521-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">The plaintiff, D. G. Ruckman, instituted four separate suits in the circuit court of Augusta county against the defendant railway company to recover damages for the alleged negligence of the defendant in failing to deliver four shipments of cattle in time for a certain market. The four cases were, on motion of the defendant, heard together as one case, and upon a demurrer to the evidence by the defendant a single judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the damages ascertained by the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-10\">These shipments were made by the plaintiff from Bar-tow, West Virginia\u2014three of them to Jersey City, IST. J., and one to York, Pa. The defendant company contends that no valid contract for the delivery of the cattle was either alleged or proven, and that it was only under obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>gation to use ordinary diligence to deliver them in a reasonable time. The allegations of the declaration are that the said live stock was shipped by and with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, and at its special instance and request, for sale on Friday\u2019s market next after the shipment, and that the damage resulted from the defendant\u2019s default in not delivering the cattle in time for that market.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">The evidence sustains these allegations. The plaintiff testifies that in each instance he notified the defendant that he desired to make the shipment; that he stated the time and place at which he wished cars placed for the receipt of the cattle, and named the date on which he wished them to arrive at their destination and the reason therefor; and that in compliance with his request the transportation was provided and the cattle went forward.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">The allegations of the declaration and the proof sustaining them establish a special contract for the delivery of the cattle on the day agreed upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">What the plaintiff sought, and what was accorded him in the trial court, was damages for the breach of the special contracts for the delivery of the cattl\u2019e on designated days\u2014a special arrangement with him not published by the carrier and not open to other shippers. The rate charged was the regular published rate for like shipments to other shippers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">In <em>Chicago &amp; Alton R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>225 U. S. 155, 32 Sup. Ct. 648, it is held that a carrier may enter into contracts to expedite shipments and charge a higher rate therefor, but to do so it must make and publish a rate open to all. It was said that the broad purpose of the commerce act was to compel the establishment of reasonable rates and their <em>uniform application, </em>and that such purpose would be defeated if sanction were given to a special contract by which there was guaranteed to a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>shipper \u00e1 particular connection and transportation by a particular train, as this would give to the particular shipper an advantage and preference not open to all and not provided for in the published rates\u2014an advantage to the shipper and a discrimination in his favor prohibited by the interstate commerce act, although no extra charge was made for the service.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-4\"><em>J.
