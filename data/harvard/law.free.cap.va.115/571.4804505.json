The court instructs the jury that while the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff, Warthen, to show that he sold the three horses to Jacobs, yet the burden of proof is upon-Jacobs to establish that the horses came into his possession in some way other than by bargain and sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>II. The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that Warthen offered to sell to Jacobs the Pendennis mare, the Black Cock horses, and the Semper Ego horse at the price of $1,050, and that said offer was accepted by Jacobs, and nothing remained to be done by Warthen to complete the contract, then title passed from Warthen to Jacobs as soon as the said offer was accepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-4\">III. The court further instructs the jury if they believe from the evidence that there was a sale of the three horses by Warthen to Jacobs, then in considering whether the said hoses or any of them were unsound, the jury are confined to the condition in which the said horses were at the time the said sale was consummated and title passed, the court telling the jury that it is immaterial whether the horses or any one of them were injured or in a crippled condition after title passed to Jacobs, provided they were uninjured and sound when title did pass.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">IY. The court instructs th'e jury that in all sales of personal property, the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor, </em>or let the buyer beware, applies, except when there has been a warranty or deception or some fraud, or a deception upon the part of the seller, misleading the buyer to his injury, and upon which the buyer relied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-6\">V. The court instructs the jury that although they may believe from the evidence that the defendant purchased the horses at an agreed price to be paid for when sold, yet as a matter of law the time of payment in such a case would be a reasonable time after the delivery of said horses to the defendant. The court also instructs the jury that if the defendant relies upon the representation of the plaintiff which he alleges to be untrue, the burden of the proof is Upon the defendant to establish that th\u2019e plaintiff made the representations, that the same were false, and that the defendant'relied upon them, and was injured by reason of their falsity, the court telling th'e jury that to bear this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>burden the defendant must do so by preponderance of affirmative testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">VI. Th\u2019e court instructs the jury that although they may believe from the evidence that the Semper Ego horse is now-crippled and was crippled when he arrived at Jacob\u2019s place, yet if they believe that the said horse was sold to Jacobs, then Warthen cannot be held responsible for any injury which may have occurred after said sale was consummated and title passed, the court telling the jury that this is true \u25a0even though they should believe from the evidence that Warthen warranted his soundness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">VII. The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that there was a sale by Warthen to Jacobs, and that at the time of the sale the Semper Ego horse was apparently sound, it matters not what the condition of the horse was on the road or when he arrived at Jacob\u2019s place, unless they believe from the evidence that Warthen expressly warranted his soundness or knew that he was unsound, or had any knowledge of his being unsound, the court telling the jury that the burden of the proof is upon Jacobs to establish such a warranty or knowledge on the part of Warthen by a preponderance of affirmative testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-7\">VIII. The court instructs the jury that if a seller warrants the property sold, and there is a breach of the warranty, the purchaser has the election between two remedies. First, he may rescind the contract, if within a reasonable tim'e he notifies the seller of his intention so to do, and offers to restore the property. In such case the contract is terminated, and the rights of the parties revert as if no contract had ever existed between them. The property belongs to the seller and the purchaser is not liable for the purchase price, and may recover any reasonable expenses to which he may have been exposed. But 'in order to entitle the purchaser to this remedy, he must, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>discovery of the breach, act with reasonable promptness in notifying the seller and making offer to restore the property. If he unreasonably delays or does any act in recognition of the contract after knowledge of the breach, he is concluded by the election he has made and must take the property. Nor is he permitted to rescind the contract in part, enforcing it so far as it is favorable to him and reject it so far as it is unfavorable to him. He must rescind as a whole or accept as a whole. He has also but one election. Having elected'to stand on the contract he cannot after-wards reject it. Secondly, he may accept the goods and abide by the contract, and rely upon his damages for the breach of the warranty, in which case the property is the property of the purchaser, but he is entitled to set off against the purchase price such damages as he may be entitled to by reason of the breach of the warranty. The measure of damages in such a case is the difference between the value of the property as warranted, and the value of the property as it actually was at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-5\">IX. If the jury believe from the evidence that there was no sale, but that the property was delivered to the defendant to be sold at an agreed price upon a warranty that the property was sound, and the property was unsalable because the property was not as warranted, then it was the duty of the defendant to notify the plaintiff of the breach of the warranty and offer to return the property to him, and he can recover no damages until his offer to return has been made to the plaintiff. His damages in such case would be any expense to which he may have been exposed for the keep of the property after he has offered to return the same, less any profit he may have made out of the contract. The jury are instructed that the defendant should be entitled to set off the $25.00 due by the plaintiff to him if they believe that plaintiff owes bim that sum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>At the request of the defendant the court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-4\">1. The court instructs the jury that to constitute a warranty no particular form of expression is required, an apparent intention to warrant is sufficient. It is enough if the words used import an engagement on the part of the vendor that the article is what he represents it to be. Any distinct affirmation of quality made by the vendor, at the time of the sale, or during the negotiations that led up to the sale, not as an expression of opinion or belief but as an assurance to the purchaser of the truth to the fact affirmed and an inducement to him to make th\u2019e purchase, is, if accordingly received and relied on and acted upon by the purchaser, an express warranty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-5\"><em>Marshall McCormick </em>and <em>F.

L. Warthen, upon notice under the statute, to recover of the defendant, E. B. Jacobs, the sum of one thousand and fifty dollars ($1,050.00) the purchase price of three horses, named Semper Ego, Black Cock and P\u2019endennis, which were delivered to the defendant at the plaintiff\u2019s stables on April 1, 1911. The defendant at the calling of the case for trial filed the plea of the general issue in assumpsit and two special pleas, under oath, setting forth his defense: (1) That he had never bought the horses; and (2) that he took them to sell for the plaintiff, and had incurred expenses in the care and keep of them in the sum of $564.00, for which amount he was entitled to a judgment against the plaintiff, and al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>leging that the plaintiff had warranted the horses to be sound and high class.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The theory of the plaintiff is, (1) That he sold to the defendant the three horses at the agreed price of \u00a71,050, without a warranty; and (2) that although he did not warrant the horses to be sound, yet as a matter of fact they were sound when delivered to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Upon the issue joined and the evidence introduced by the respective parties, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, assessing his damages at one thousand and twenty-five dollars, for which amount and interest thereon from the date of the verdict the court entered its judgment, to which this writ of error was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">It appears from the evidence that on March 30,1911, the defendant, who resides in Clarke county, Ya., and who was engaged in the buying and selling of horses, came to Front Royal, Warren county, and looked over the stables of the plaintiff. After doing so he informed the plaintiff that he had a customer in New York who would probably be pleased with the horse, Pendennis; and that he might also handle the Black Cock horse; but that he would be especially pleased to purchase Semper Ego, since he liked this animal better than any of the other horses which the plaintiff owned. Plaintiff informed defendant that Semper Ego was not for sale; that he had purchased him for his own use, but that he would be glad to dispose of any of the other horses which he then had in his stables. During the afternoon of the day of defendant\u2019s visit to plaintiff\u2019s stable, he asked permission to ride Semper Ego to the horse show grounds, a distance of about one mile from Front Royal, which was granted, and at the same time he took with him the horse Black Cock. The defendant, accompanied by a son of the plaintiff, and one William Smith, went to the show grounds, and attempted to jump Semper Ego. The horse, being green, never having been trained or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>schooled, refused to jump, but this did not seem to lessen defendant\u2019s admiration for the animal, he making the remark in the presence of young Warthen and Smith that he \u201chad a boy who could break him if there was any br-'eak in him.\u201d Defendant rode Semper Ego back to plaintiff\u2019s stables, and left on the evening train for his home. The plaintiff was not then at home, and hence he had no further conversation with plaintiff since his refusal to sell or price the horse, Semper Ego. Upon defendant\u2019s arrival at his home, he called plaintiff over the \u2019phone, telling him that Semper Ego had \u201cbehaved very badly,\u201d but that nevertheless he liked him, and again insisted upon plaintiff selling him. Plaintiff, however, again refused to 'entertain any proposition of sale, again giving as his reason, that the horse was of a type that he liked and that he had determined to keep him for his own riding. On the following morning defendant wrote plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cMarch 31st, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201cDear Mr. Warthen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201cThe girl to buy your Pend\u2019ennis mare arrives Tuesday night, the 1th, and if the mare goes anything like right she will buy her. I wrote the man who was to come Sunday to put it off until he heard from me. I think he would buy your Black Cock or Mitchell horse. Also have a party who wants a hack for himself and one for his wife. I would like very much indeed to have your Semper Ego, and will run up to see you almost any time you have time to have an hour of heart to heart talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201cDon\u2019t fail me on the Pend\u2019ennis mare, as I will be in a real hole if I don\u2019t get her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\u201cSincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\u201cEdward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\u201cWill send for Pendennis mare Monday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>About the middle of the day that this letter was written defendant again called plaintiff over the \u2019phone to inquire if he had received the letter. Plaintiff replied that he had received it, and that rather than send the Pendennis mare alone, he would sell defendant the three horses, Black Cock, Pendennis and Semper Ego, for $1,100. Defendant replied that he didn\u2019t have the money at that time, and plaintiff then said that he didn\u2019t care for the money at that time, and if he (defendant) would take the three horses at $1,100 he could pay for them \u201cas he got it out of the horses;\u201d whereupon, defendant offered $1,000 for the three horses, and they finally \u201csplit the difference,\u201d fixing the price at $1,050, defendant agreeing to send his men for them on the following morning, April 1, 1911. On April 1 defendant sent two negroes for the horses, who arrived at plaintiff\u2019s stables after he had left for Baltimore, and the horses were turned over to them by William Smith in the presence of five other disinterested persons, one of them a veterinarian, all of whom have testified in this case that the horses were sound and uninjured when they departed for defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Plaintiff heard nothing whatever from the defendant or the horses until the lapse of thre\u2019e weeks, when, on April 21, defendant wrote him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cDear Mr. Warthen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201cI have been trying to get you over the \u2019phone for the past three days, but my \u2019phon\u00e9 has been out of order. I want you to come here to see the Semper Ego horse. My boy was all day getting him here, as he staggered and had to be led down some of the hills. He is better than he was, but when I brought him out yesterday to show to Twigg, I had to have a man on each side of the door to keep him from hitting his hips. Neither Twigg nor the Captain noticed it, so I had him put back as quick as I could, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>told them he was too green yet for what Twigg wanted. I have phoned Humphrey and Cameron to come here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cSincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cEdward B. Jacobs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">It is readily to he observed that defendant admits that he was able to \u2019phone for veterinaries, but why, at the same time, he was unable to \u2019phone the plaintiff he does not explain; nor does h\u2019e explain why his efforts to \u2019phone plaintiff were confined to the \u201cpast three days,\u201d when the hors'es had been in his possession for the past three weeks; hence, it was but natural for the plaintiff to believe, as he claims he did, that defendant or his employees, while attempting to school and jump the horse, Semper Ego, injured him, and having every reason to conclude that if, as defendant stated, the horse was injured when he arrived at defendant\u2019s home, he would not have waited three weeks before making complaint and paid no attention to the letter. The impressions of plaintiff, as was to be expected, were strengthened when on May <em>\u00e1 </em>defendant sent him a certificate from the veterinary to the effect that the horse was \u201csuffering from a severe strain over the loins which gives him a tottering gait.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Having heard nothing from defendant, plaintiff, on May 18, wrote him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201cDear Edward:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201cI hope the Semper Ego has gotten O. <em>K. </em>I did not go into the matter with you, as I knew the horse was absolutely sound when he l'eft my stable, and that I would have no trouble establishing that fact. Indeed, I think he was hurt after reaching \u2018Rosslyn,\u2019 but as I had no doubt that he would soon come around, I thought it useless to go into that. My understanding of the deal was that you were to pay me $1,050 for the three horses as they were sold. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Of course, I did not understand that I was to assume any risk as to th\u2019eir being crippled or killed. Had they all three died next day I should have expected the $1,050. I have always thought you fair, and still think so, and am only writing that you may know my understanding. I would not have sold them to any one else on such terms, as I had to pay cash for them and did not make much profit on the three. Let m\u2019e hear from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cWith kind regards to Mrs. Jacobs, I am</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A09\">\u201cSincerely yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201cArthur L. Warthen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\u201cPerkins did not buy a horse from any one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In this letter, as will be readily noted, plaintiff sets forth his idea of the contract and reminds defendant that he would not have sold the horse, Semper Ego, to any one else on the same terms. Defendant in his reply to this letter on June 7, 1911, instead of denying a sale of the horses to him, enclosed to plaintiff his note for $450 for the Pendennis mare and the Black Cock horse, saying among other things: \u201cThese two horses, as you know, I would not have bought except to get the Semper Ego. They came here in the shape I saw them and I accept them. Th'e Semper Ego came wabbling and stumbling.\u201d Notwithstanding, defendant also stated in the letter just mentioned that he was told of Semper Ego\u2019s injuries the next morning after he got him, he never mentioned the subject to the plaintiff for three weeks thereafter, and then by letter of April 21, 1911, copied above, said: \u201cMy boy was all day getting him here, as he staggered and had to be led down some of the hills. H'e is better than he was, but when 1 brought him out yesterday to show to Twigg, I had to have a man on each side of the door to keep him from hitting his hips. Neither Twigg nor the Captain noticed it, so I had him put back as quick as I could, and told them that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>was yet too green for what Twigg wanted.\u201d To the letter of the defendant of date June 7, 1911, supra, plaintiff replied on June 9,1911, declining to accept the note enclosed to him by defendant, and returned the same to him, and again insisted that he sold the three horses to the defendant for $1,050; that he could prove by others who saw the horses the afternoon before they started to defendant\u2019s home that the horse, Semper Ego, \u201cwas sound, nimble and nothing the matter;\u201d that he could prove by defendant\u2019s neighbors that the horse was not crippled after he had gone two miles of the journey to defendant\u2019s home; and that defendant never mentioned to plaintiff or to his (defendant\u2019s) neighbors, or to any of plaintiff\u2019s friends, for ten days after the horse was received at defendant\u2019s home any trouble with the horse. \u201cThe certificate you sent me shows that the horse was probably hurt trying to jump him, and he never once saw a jump in my hands since you had him out at the show grounds. I, of course, would hate for you to lose money on th'e horses, but I neither guaranteed their life, nor did I guarantee that you would make money . . . Had I said to you, as I would to most men, the night before, \u2018Send me your note for $1,050.00 and you can have the horses,\u2019 you know you would have done it. Now because I trusted you I ought not to have to beg for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Defendant later agreed to give his note, endorsed by his wife, for the purchase price of the three horses, but on the following day he forwarded to plaintiff a note for $650 instead of the amount agreed upon, which note was returned, and on April 12, 1912, this action was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We deem it unnecessary to review the evidence further than we have done in stating the case, for it is sufficient to say that if the trial court did not err in admitting certain evidence objected to, or in giving or refusing instructions, the evidence, viewed as upon a demurrer thereto, is not only amply sufficient to sustain the. verdict of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>jury, but no other finding could have been properly made thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Did the court err in permitting certain evidence to go to the jury? This question arises on defendant\u2019s bills of exceptions Nos. 1, 2 and 3, the first being to the court\u2019s ruling in permitting Captain Conrad, a witness offered in rebuttal by the plaintiff, \u201cto be asked and to answer the question: \u2018Will you tell the jury whether or not that horse (referring to Semper Ego) was sound?\u2019 \u201d Not only does the court certify in this bill of exceptions that both sides were given the fullest opportunity to develop their case, but the exception fails to set out what answer, if any, was given to the question, or was expected when the question was propounded; nor does it in any way bring to the attention of this court the evidence that preceded it, but leaves the court to an examination of the whole of the preceding evidence in order to know whether or not the question and the answer, or expected answer, thereto were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The same is true of bill of exceptions No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Bill of exceptions No. 3 does not set out the questions ask'ed the witness, over the objection of the defendant, and the answers made by the witness thereto, but as in exceptions Nos. 1 and 2, no reference is made to the evidence that preceded this evidence objected to, thus leaving this court to an examination of the whole of the preceding evidence in order to know whether the questions and answers were proper or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\u201cA bill of exception to the ruling of the court on the admissibility of evidence is not sufficient, although it gives the question asked the witness and his answer thereto, unless it also contains sufficient of the evidence which has preceded to give this court a clear apprehension of the propriety or impropriety of the ruling of the trial court.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>Holleran </em>v. <em>Meisel, </em>91 Va. 143, 21 S.

E. 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The principal object, however, in the three bills of exceptions just adverted.to, was to save the point for review by this court, that the lower court erred in admitting in <em>rebuttal </em>the testimony of the <em>witnesses named </em>in the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Shaver, </em>92 Va. 345, 23 S. E. 749, it was held: \u201cThe examination of Avitnesses lies chiefly in the discretion of the trial court, and its exercise is rarely, if ever, to be controlled by an appellate court. Much latitude of discretion should be allowed the trial court in the matter of recalling witnesses, and its action will not be reversed by an appellate court except for palpable error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In <em>N. &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>101 Va. 422, 44 S. E. 719, this rule was sanctioned and approved, the opinion saying: \u201cIt (this court) will not reverse merely because evidence proper in chief Avas introduced in rebuttal.\u201d See also <em>Pocahontas C. Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>105 Va. 708, 54 S. E. 868; <em>Bettman </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>113 Va. 24, 73 S. E. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Even if bills of exceptions Eos. 1, 2 and 3 in the present case were properly to be considered, we find nothing in the record that Avould warrant us in regarding it as coming within an exception to the established rule to which we have just adverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The learned judge of the trial court gave to the jury seven instructions asked for by the plaintiff, two (8 and 9) of its own volition, and also instruction Eo. 1, asked by the defendant, rejecting defendant\u2019s instruction Eo. 2, to which ruling defendant excepted. The instructions given (and set out in the official report of this opinion) fairly and fully submitted to the jury the case on every material point involved, stating, as we view the instructions and the record, the defendant\u2019s rights and duties liberally, as well as- justly and fairly. But even if th'e instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>were not correct, it is unnecessary to consider the rulings of the trial court thereon, since no other verdict than that rendered by the jury could, in our opinion, have been properly found. <em>Schwalm </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>106 Va. 407, 56 S. E. 135; <em>Ches. &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Fortune, </em>107 Va. 412, 59 S. E. 1095; <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Pleasonton, </em>112 Va. 508, 71 S. E. 529; <em>W. V. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Bouknight, </em>113 Va. 696, 75 S. E. 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The rulings of the trial court complained of are without error and its judgment upon the verdict of the jury is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
