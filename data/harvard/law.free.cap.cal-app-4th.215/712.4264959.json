Our three previous decisions affirmed the judgment after rejecting Barba\u2019s contention that the court erred by admitting certain evidence on DNA findings. In each, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the matter with directions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>reconsider our decision in light of that court\u2019s then newest decision concerning whether evidence of forensic laboratory reports violated a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront and examine adverse witnesses when the laboratory personnel who prepared those reports did not testify at trial. After considering the high court\u2019s latest ruling, we once more affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Cabdriver Keum Kim was robbed and stabbed to death by a fare he had driven from Santa Monica to Venice in the early morning hours of July 8, 2001. Kim was dispatched in response to a phone call from a man identifying himself as \u201cSergio,\u201d who said he needed a ride to Brooks Avenue in Venice and wondered whether the driver might have change for a $50 bill. The murder was witnessed by a man who had stopped his car behind Kim\u2019s parked cab on the 800 block of Brooks Avenue. The witness saw Kim and the passenger struggle and then saw the passenger run from the cab into some nearby bushes. According to the witness, the passenger was wearing a blue, hooded sweatshirt that was covered with blood. However, the witness did not see the passenger clearly and was therefore unable to identify him. A search of the area by the police turned up a bloody kitchen knife and a dark sweatshirt covered with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Los Angeles Police Detective Paul Inabu was the primary detective assigned to investigate Kim\u2019s murder. On July 10, 2001, Inabu requested that the knife and sweatshirt be sent to a crime lab for DNA analysis. Even though no suspect had as yet been identified, Inabu made that request to determine whether those items were even connected to the crime and, if so, to preserve them in case a suspect was identified later on. DNA testing of blood samples from those two items showed the blood was Kim\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">On July 25, 2001, Inabu received an anonymous phone call from a woman who claimed Antonio Barba had killed Kim. After getting a search warrant, Inabu searched Barba\u2019s apartment, which was right near the spot where \u201cSergio\u201d asked the taxi dispatcher to have Kim pick him up. The search turned up a knife that was identical to the murder weapon, but no physical evidence linking Barba to the crime. Barba was arrested on August 2, 2001, and was formally charged with the murder and robbery of Kim in October 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">A police criminalist removed some hairs from the bloody sweatshirt and sent them to Orchid Cellmark (Cellmark), a DNA testing lab. A November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>2001 test by Cellmark analyst Linda Wong produced no interpretable results from the hair samples. In February 2002, a police criminalist retrieved more hairs from the sweatshirt. Although they were not initially considered suitable samples for DNA testing, the hair was eventually sent on to Cellmark for a testing process that involved combining the hairs. When that was accomplished, there was only enough DNA to analyze nine genetic locations, not the 13 typically examined by Cellmark. Six of them were consistent with Barba\u2019s DNA profile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Barba was tried for murder and robbery, but a hung jury led to a mistrial in February 2004. Barba was retried starting in August 2004. Cellmark\u2019s lab director, Dr. Jennifer Reynolds, testified for the prosecution about DNA evidence in general and about the results of the tests performed by Wong, who no longer worked for Cellmark. Reynolds acknowledged that hair samples sent for testing could, in the abstract, have become contaminated from saliva, skin, blood, mishandling by the lab, and the failure to wash samples. Such contamination was always a possibility, she testified. Wong\u2019s notes did not indicate that she had washed the hairs that yielded the positive test results for Barba\u2019s DNA. The defense introduced evidence of several unrelated instances of lab contamination by police criminalists, along with evidence of 53 reported control discrepancies at Cellmark between March 2001 and December 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The jury convicted Barba of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)), but deadlocked on the robbery count (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), which was then dismissed. Barba was given a sentence of life without possibility of parole, plus one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In his original appeal Barba contended (1) the court committed error by denying his motion which charged that the prosecutor peremptorily challenged an African-American prospective juror because of his race; (2) the court erred by allowing in evidence the anonymous phone tip and portions of Barba\u2019s jailhouse conversations that were recorded by the police; and (3) the DNA evidence was inadmissible because \u2019the test results were hearsay and because allowing Reynolds to testify about Wong\u2019s test results violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. In November 2007, we issued our first opinion in this matter, affirming the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barba </em>(Nov. 21, 2007, B185940) [nonpub. opn.] <em>9Barba I).) </em>On June 29, 2009, the United States Supreme Court granted Barba\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our earlier decision, and remanded the case to us with directions to reconsider our decision in light of its holding four days earlier in <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts </em>(2009) 557 U.S. 305 [174 L.Ed.2d 314, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>129 S.Ct. 2527] (Melendez-Diaz), which concerned a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses where the results of scientific tests were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">On remand, we affirmed again, distinguishing this case from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>because the disputed DNA test report was admitted as part of the basis for the independent opinion of another expert witness. <em>(People v. Barba </em>(Feb. 19, 2010, B185940) [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Barba II).) </em>We also concluded that even if the report should not have been admitted in evidence, the error was harmless. Even though the only issue before us on remand was the applicability of Melendez-Diaz, because our entire decision in <em>Barba I </em>had been, vacated, we restated our discussion as to the other issues that had been before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On June 28, 2011, the United States Supreme Court granted a new petition for certiorari from Barba, vacated our decision in <em>Barba II, </em>and remanded the case to us with directions to reconsider our decision in light of its holding in <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico </em>(2011) 564 U.S._[180 L.Ed.2d 610, 131 S.Ct. 2705] <em>(Bullcoming), </em>which considered whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional confrontation rights were violated by having someone other than the person who conducted a laboratory analysis testify about the results and report of the person who actually conducted the test. On remand, we again affirmed the judgment. <em>(People v. Barba </em>(Jan. 23, 2012, B185940 [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Barba III).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">On November 13, 2012, the United States Supreme Court granted Barba\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari in <em>Barba III </em>and asked us to reconsider our decision in light of its decision in <em>Williams v. Illinois </em>(2012) 567 U.S._ [183 L.Ed.2d 89, 132 S.Ct. 2221] <em>(Williams). </em>As we did in <em>Barba II </em>and <em>Barba III, </em>although the United States Supreme Court has directed us to reconsider our decision only in light of its most recent confrontation clause decision, because it vacated our decision in <em>Barba III, </em>in the unpublished portion of our opinion, we restate our analysis and holding from <em>Barba I, Barba II </em>and <em>Barba III </em>as to the issues not implicated by <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">CONFRONTATION CLAUSE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">1. <em>The DNA Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">Hairs from the blood-soaked sweatshirt discarded by Kim\u2019s killer were sent to Cellmark for DNA analysis. Three hair samples taken by the LAPD (Los <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Angeles Police Department) in September 2001 matched Kim\u2019s DNA, not Barba\u2019s. More hair samples taken from the sweatshirt in March 2002 also matched Kim\u2019s DNA, not Barba\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The hair samples that implicated Barba were removed from the sweatshirt on February 21, 2002, by LAPD Criminalist Michael Mastrocovo. He found 14 hairs and gave them to LAPD Criminalist Susan Brockbank, who examined them and concluded they had telogen roots, which were not suitable for DNA analysis. In May 2002, Mastrocovo told the prosecutor those hairs could be combined to produce a testable sample, but that doing so would destroy the sample, thereby precluding any further testing. The prosecutor said to perform the test, and Mastrocovo sent the 14 hairs to Cellmark with instructions to consume the samples if necessary. The LAPD\u2019s lab procedure manual recommended that before DNA testing was performed on hair samples, the hairs should be washed to reduce the presence of any contaminants. Mastrocovo did not wash these hair samples because he did not extract them.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In June 2002, Cellmark DNA analyst Linda Wong tested the 14 hairs sent by Mastrocovo. Wong had performed the previous DNA tests but, unlike for those tests, her notes did not reflect that she performed the Chelex procedure, which involves washing the hairs to remove any contaminants that might have been deposited on them. Wong cut and combined the hair shafts and was able to locate only nine genetic locations instead of the 13 that were usually present. Of those nine, six were consistent with Barba\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Instead of lab analyst Wong, Dr. Jennifer Reynolds, the director of Cellmark\u2019s Maryland laboratory, testified about the DNA results. Reynolds\u2019s duties included performing technical reviews of case folders created by the lab\u2019s test analysts, independently drawing conclusions from the test results based on her own expertise and training, and either cosigning the reports or testifying about them in court. Reynolds ended this description of her job duties by stating, \u201cas I have done today.\u201d According to Reynolds, the case file for the June 2002 testing included correspondence from the LAPD, test data and results, Wong\u2019s worksheets and handwritten notes, and reports of the test\u2019s conclusions. Analysts complete their lab notes and other documents at or near the time of the events. The materials in the file included all of the lab notes and worksheets that an analyst would have to fill out in the course of DNA testing. The information in the file was detailed enough to allow any qualified scientist to look at the file and determine what procedures had been used. For instance, Reynolds testified, the file included electropherograms, from which anyone with the proper training could determine how the testing was done. Those records were kept and maintained in the normal course of Cellmark\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Along with Reynolds\u2019s testimony, four DNA test reports were admitted in evidence: (1) Wong\u2019s November 27, 2001 report, which determined that three hair samples taken from the killer\u2019s sweatshirt contained only Kim\u2019s DNA (exhibit 27); (2) Wong\u2019s March 26, 2002 report, which determined that another sample taken from the sweatshirt contained only Kim\u2019s DNA (exhibit 28); (3) Wong\u2019s June 28, 2002 report, which determined that the 14 hairs found in the sweatshirt matched Barba\u2019s DNA (exhibit 29); and (4) A June 10, 2004 report by lab analyst Terrill that another hair sample from the sweatshirt belonged to Kim, and not to Barba (exhibit 35).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">These four reports were prepared in an identical format. Each was on Cellmark letterhead, addressed to a police investigator. Each bore the title \u201cREPORT OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION.\u201d Each described the items being tested and the type of test performed\u2014polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Under the heading \u201cRESULTS,\u201d the reports said that DNA extracts were isolated from the items tested by using the \u201cAmpF/STR Profiler Plus and/or AmpF/STR COfiler PCR Amplification Kits.\u201d The RESULTS section said that the DNA loci tested and the types obtained for each sample were listed in an attached table.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Under the heading \u201cCONCLUSIONS,\u201d the reports stated whether the DNA matched Kim or excluded Barba. A population database and frequency table was provided to show the frequency of unrelated individuals having the same DNA results depending on whether they were African-American, Caucasian, or Hispanic. The third page of the reports contained a table identified as \u201cALLELES DETECTED\u2014PROFILER PLUS,\u201d and then set forth certain alphabetical or numerical designations that corresponded to certain DNA loci.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Exhibits 27, 28, and 35 all stated that Barba was excluded as the source of the DNA. Exhibit 29, which implicated Barba, stated in the RESULTS section that \u201c[a] portion of the hair shafts adjacent to the roots was used as a control. Any results obtained from this hair shaft control are likely due to DNA deposited on the exterior of the hair shaft.\u201d Under CONCLUSIONS, the report said that the DNA profile used six of nine loci and that Barba could not be excluded as the source. No conclusion about Barba could be reached as to the other three loci. The report\u2019s database frequency table said that only one in six million unrelated Hispanics would have the same DNA at those six loci. Under the ALLELES DETECTED table on the third page was the following notation: \u201cIn addition to the profiles obtained from the items referenced in this report, weak results were observed. These results may be due to the presence of DNA from more than one individual or to technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>artifacts, and therefore were not interpreted.\u201d Each report was signed by the analyst and by a lab director.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Barba objected that having Reynolds testify instead of Wong violated his confrontation rights. Defense counsel said she believed the incriminating hair samples had been contaminated while in the LAPD\u2019s custody before being sent to Cellmark for testing, but that Wong\u2019s testimony was required because there was evidence she had not washed the hair samples, which would have eliminated any contamination. Without Wong\u2019s testimony, there would be no explanation of why that happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The trial court overruled the objection because it believed Wong\u2019s reports qualified as business records. However, Reynolds was allowed to testify only as to procedures that Wong\u2019s notes showed were actually conducted, or as to what the lab\u2019s standard protocols were. Reynolds was not allowed to speculate as to any procedures not reflected in Wong\u2019s notes, or why they might not have been performed. Reynolds testified that, in accord with her job duties, she was in court to give her own independent conclusions based on the contents of Wong\u2019s case file. According to Reynolds, only one in six million Hispanics would have the same six genetic markers as those that matched Barba.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Reynolds was vigorously cross-examined about Wong\u2019s testing procedures. Reynolds said that because the notes did not state that Wong had washed the hair samples before testing, Wong probably had not done so. Reynolds also testified that even though the test results were accurate as to the DNA found on the hair shafts, that did not mean the DNA had not been deposited there before testing. Nor could she rule out that contamination had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">2. <em>Relevant Confrontation Clause Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a defendant in a criminal trial has the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (the Confrontation Clause). This provision bars the admission at trial of a testimonial statement made outside of court against a defendant unless the maker of the statement is unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine that person. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 569, 580-581 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 286 P.3d 469] <em>(Lopez), </em>citing <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36, 59 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford).) </em>To be considered testimonial, the out-of-court statement (1) must have been made with some degree of formality or solemnity and (2) must have a primary purpose that pertains in some fashion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>to a criminal prosecution. However, the United States Supreme Court has been unable to agree on a precise definition of those requirements. <em>(Lopez, </em>at p. 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A. <em>The </em>Geier <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The defendant in <em>People v. Geier </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 555 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 580, 161 P.3d 104], was convicted of murder and rape based in part on DNA evidence tested by Cellmark. The analyst who performed the testing did not testify at trial. Instead, a lab director who cosigned the report did, and, based on the results and her review of the case file, testified that in her expert opinion the incriminating DNA matched that of the defendant. Geier contended his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses was violated because the lab analyst did not testify. Our Supreme Court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">After examining disparate state and federal authority on the issue of whether scientific test reports were testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, the <em>Geier </em>court relied in large measure on <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 813 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266] <em>(Davis), </em>which involved two consolidated cases. The first involved the admissibility of a recording of a 911 phone call by a victim who was describing an attack upon her as it occurred. The second arose from the police response to a domestic disturbance call. After arriving at the scene and separating the couple, the officers questioned the victim and had her fill out and sign an affidavit describing the battery, which was later admitted at her attacker\u2019s trial. The <em>Davis </em>court held that the tape of the 911 call was admissible under the Confrontation Clause because the victim was describing events as they occurred and had the primary purpose of enabling the police to respond to an ongoing emergency. <em>(Geier, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 603-604, citing <em>Davis, </em>at pp. 822, 827.) The domestic violence victim\u2019s statements were testimonial, the <em>Davis </em>court held, because they were made after an ongoing emergency had ended and their primary purpose was to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution. <em>(Geier, </em>at pp. 603-604, citing <em>Davis, </em>at pp. 822, 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Based on this, the <em>Geier </em>court concluded a statement was testimonial only if three requirements were all met: (1) it was made to a law enforcement officer or by a law enforcement officer or agent; (2) it describes a past fact related to criminal activity; and (3) it will possibly be used at a later trial. <em>(Geier, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 605.) The <em>Geier </em>court found the second point determinative. Even though the analyst was working for the police and could reasonably anticipate the use of her test results at trial, those results \u201cconstitute[d] a contemporaneous recordation of observable events rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>documentation of past events.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result, when the analyst recorded the results, she was not acting as a witness and was not testifying. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 605-606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The <em>Geier </em>court believed that under <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. 813, various types of laboratory reports were not testimonial because they were contemporaneous observations of recordable events. <em>(Geier, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at pp. 606-607.) Even before <em>Davis, </em>the <em>Geier </em>court observed, numerous courts looked to the circumstances under which statements in laboratory reports and other forensic evidence were made in order to conclude that they were not testimonial despite their possible use at trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The circumstances under which the DNA documents at issue in <em>Geier </em>were created led that court to conclude that they too were not testimonial. First, they were generated as part of a standardized scientific protocol conducted pursuant to the analyst\u2019s employment at Cellmark. Even though the prosecutor hoped to obtain evidence against Geier, the analyst\u2019s work product was part of her job, and was not intended to incriminate him. Second, to the extent the analyst\u2019s notes and reports recounted the procedures used, they were not accusatory because DNA analysis can lead to either incriminatory or exculpatory results. Third, the accusatory opinions that the DNA evidence matched Geier \u201cwere reached and conveyed not through the nontestifying technician\u2019s laboratory notes and report, but by the testifying witness, [the lab director].\u201d <em>(Geier, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 607.) Accordingly, it was the circumstances under which the DNA report and notes were generated that led the <em>Geier </em>court to determine that those documents were not testimonial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">B. <em>The </em>Melendez-Diaz <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The defendant in <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>557 U.S. 305, was convicted in Massachusetts state court of selling cocaine. A substance in the defendant\u2019s possession that was believed to be cocaine was sent to a lab for analysis, and the lab test confirmed it was cocaine. At trial, as permitted by Massachusetts law, a sworn affidavit known as a \u201ccertificate of analysis\u201d was allowed in evidence in order to prove that the substance tested positive as cocaine. The analyst who performed the test did not testify at trial. The certificate said nothing more than that the substance was found to contain cocaine. At the time of trial, the defendant did not know what tests the analyst performed, whether those tests were routine, or whether interpreting their results required the exercise of judgment or skills the analyst did not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">The <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>court held that the affidavits fell within the core class of testimonial statements\u2014such as depositions, prior testimony, declarations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>and affidavits\u2014whose admission violates the Confrontation Clause. <em>(Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>557 U.S. at pp. 309-310.) Therefore, the analysts were witnesses and their affidavits were testimonial, meaning that the defendant had a right to \u201cconfront\u201d them at his trial unless the analysts were unavailable for trial and the defendant had a previous opportunity to cross-examine them. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 311.) In short, \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its case via <em>ex parte </em>out-of-court affidavits, and the admission of such evidence . . . was error.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 329, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In <em>Barba II </em>we held that <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>did not apply because that decision did not consider the scenario present here, where the reports themselves did not contain a sworn certificate or affidavit attesting to their genuineness and accuracy and the DNA evidence came in through the in-court testimony of an expert witness who used the analyst\u2019s test materials to form her own independent opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">C. <em>The </em>Bullcoming <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Bullcoming was arrested in New Mexico for drunk driving, and his blood sample was sent to a New Mexico state lab for testing. The analyst who tested the sample determined that Bullcoming\u2019s blood-alcohol level was 0.21 grams per 100 milliliters, which was very high. The analyst recorded his results on a state-prepared form titled \u201cReport of Blood Alcohol Analysis.\u201d <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p._ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2710].) The report included a \u201ccertificate of analyst,\u201d affirming that the sealed sample he tested was received at the laboratory intact, with the seal unbroken; the statements made by the analyst were correct; and that he had followed the procedures set out on the back side of the form. Those procedures required analysts to retain the sample container and raw data from the analysis and to note anything that might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise affect the validity of the analysis. No such notations appeared on the certificate for Bullcoming\u2019s test results. Finally, under the heading \u201ccertificate of reviewer,\u201d a state lab examiner who reviewed the analysis certified that the person who tested the sample and prepared the report was qualified to do so and had followed the established procedures for conducting the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">At Bullcoming\u2019s trial, the analyst who tested his blood sample did not testify because he had been placed on disciplinary leave. Instead, the prosecution called another analyst who was familiar with the lab\u2019s testing procedures but had not participated in or observed the test on Bullcoming\u2019s sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">The trial court overruled Bullcoming\u2019s objection that allowing the other lab analyst to testify about the report violated his confrontation rights, and he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>convicted of aggravated drunk driving. The New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed. That court said the certifying analyst was a mere scrivener who did nothing more than transcribe the results generated by the machine used to conduct the test. The substitute analyst who testified at trial was a qualified expert on the use of that machine and provided live, in-court testimony that was subject to cross-examination. As a result, the New Mexico court concluded, even though the certificate was testimonial, Bullcoming\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In <em>Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. _ [131 S.Ct. 2705], the United States Supreme Court reversed. In a plurality opinion, the court held that the analyst\u2019s certificate was a testimonial statement that could not be introduced unless the analyst was unavailable for trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to confront that witness. Justice Ginsburg delivered the four-part decision. However, part IV did not command a majority, and the concurring opinion of Justice Sotomayor, who also declined to join in part IV, sets the parameters of Bullcoming\u2019s reach. <em>(Panetti </em>v. <em>Quarterman </em>(2007) 551 U.S. 930, 949 [168 L.Ed.2d 662, 127 S.Ct. 2842] [if no majority opinion, the narrower holding controls]; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 188, 193 [51 L.Ed.2d 260, 97 S.Ct. 990] <em>(Marks) </em>[in plurality decision, court\u2019s holding is viewed as the position taken by the justices who concurred on the narrowest grounds].)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Part I of the <em>Bullcoming </em>decision contained the facts and procedural history. Part II explained why the surrogate analyst was an inadequate substitute for the analyst who performed the test. The court noted that the analyst\u2019s certification reported more than a machine-generated number. It also included the analyst\u2019s certification that he received the blood sample intact with the seal unbroken, that he had properly followed certain specified procedures, and that nothing happened to affect the integrity or validity of the testing process. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p. __ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2714].) Even so, the comparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report derived from machine-generated data does not overcome the Confrontation Clause, and analysts who write reports that the prosecution puts in evidence must be made available for examination at trial. (564 U.S. at p.__ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2715].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Surrogate testimony by someone who qualified as an expert regarding the machine used and the lab\u2019s procedures could not convey what the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>analyst knew or observed when testing Bullcoming\u2019s blood sample, and cross-examination would not expose \u201cany lapses or lies\u201d by the certifying analyst, the <em>Bullcoming </em>court held. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p. __ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2715].) This was especially significant because the analyst was on disciplinary leave, but was not declared unavailable by the prosecution. As a result, Bullcoming\u2019s lawyer could not question the analyst to determine whether he was incompetent or dishonest. <em>(Bullcoming, </em>564 U.S. at pp. __ - __ [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2715-2716].) In short, if the Sixth Amendment is violated, \u201cno substitute procedure can cure the violation . . . .\u201d (564 U.S. at p.__ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2716].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Part III of <em>Bullcoming, </em>which commanded a majority of the court, explained why the analyst\u2019s certificate was testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause. The court rejected New Mexico\u2019s contention that the report was not adversarial or inquisitorial because it contained nothing more than the observations of an independent scientist created pursuant to a nonadversarial public duty. As the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>court held, a document created solely for an evidentiary purpose in aid of a police investigation is testimonial. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at pp. __ - __ [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2716-2717].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Even though the analyst\u2019s certificate was not signed under oath, as was the case in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the two documents were similar in all material respects, the <em>Bullcoming </em>court held. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p._ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2717].) As in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>a police officer provided a sample to a lab for testing to assist in a police investigation. An analyst tested the sample and prepared a certificate concerning the results. Finally, the certificate was formalized in a signed document that was sufficient to qualify the analyst\u2019s statements as testimonial despite the absence of notarization present in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>In short, the certificate was testimonial. <em>(Bullcoming, </em>at p.__ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2717].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Part IV explained why the court did not believe that application of its holding would impose an undue burden on the prosecution by requiring it to produce the analyst who actually conducted a test and prepared a report. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at pp. __ - __ [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2717-2719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion had two express purposes: (1) to explain why the analyst\u2019s report was testimonial and (2) \u201cto emphasize the limited reach of the Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p.__ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2719] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">As to her first purpose, Justice Sotomayor reaffirmed the principle that a statement is testimonial if its primary purpose was evidentiary\u2014to create an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>out-of-court substitute for trial testimony. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at pp. __-__ [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2719-2720] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).) She agreed with the majority that the lab analyst\u2019s certificate was sufficiently formal to suggest its evidentiary purpose despite the absence of an affirmation under oath that was present in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>However, she noted that formality is not the only test to determine whether a report is testimonial. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. __-__ [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2720-2721] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">As to her second purpose, Justice Sotomayor pointed out four circumstances not present in <em>Bullcoming. </em>First, this was not a case where the state suggested an alternate primary purpose for the report, such as medical reports created while treating a patient. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p. __ [131 S.Ct. at p. 2722] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Second, because the surrogate analyst testified that he had no part in producing any portion of the report and did not observe the testing process, \u201cthis is not a case in which the person testifying is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal, albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.\u201d <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p.__[131 S.Ct. at p. 2722] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).) For example, a supervisor who observed an analyst conducting the test might be allowed to testify about the results. Justice Sotomayor did not address the precise degree of involvement necessary to justify testimony by someone other than the analyst because the surrogate analyst who testified at Bullcoming\u2019s trial had no involvement in the test and report. <em>(Ibid. </em>(conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Third, this was \u201cnot a case in which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p. __[131 S.Ct. at p. 2722] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).) That scenario would present a different question, Justice Sotomayor explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">Fourth, the case did not involve only machine-generated results. Instead, the prosecution introduced the analyst\u2019s statements about the results of the test, the procedures used, and their validity and integrity. Therefore, the decision did not consider whether the prosecution could introduce raw, machine-generated data in conjunction with expert witness testimony. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p.__[131 S.Ct. at p. 2722] (conc. opn. of Sotomayor, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">In <em>Barba III, </em>we again affirmed, holding that as to Reynolds\u2019s testimony alone, it fell under the exception for the independent opinion of an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>witness based on underlying testimonial reports not placed in evidence, as suggested in Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion. As for admitting in evidence the three DNA reports that excluded Barba as a DNA donor, we held that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As for admitting in evidence the one report that found a \u201cmatch\u201d with Barba\u2019s DNA, we held that the error was harmless because (1) it contained no affirmations that all testing procedures had been correctly followed; (2) Reynolds was forced to concede that Wong had not washed the hair samples, which confirmed the key defense claim against Cellmark\u2019s handling of the samples; (3) Reynolds conceded on cross-examination that she could not rule out the possibility that the samples had been contaminated; and (4) the report was virtually meaningless without Reynolds\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">D. <em>The </em>Williams <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\"><em>Williams </em>arose from the kidnap, rape, and robbery of a Chicago woman in February 2000. Vaginal swabs were taken as part of a sexual assault examination and the Illinois State Police sent those swabs to a Cellmark lab for DNA analysis. Cellmark tested the swabs and produced a DNA profile of the semen donor. Defendant Williams had not been identified as the perpetrator and was not considered a suspect in that crime when the Cellmark DNA profile was created. Williams was arrested in August 2000 on unrelated charges. A sample of his blood was taken at that time, from which the state police lab created a DNA profile. Sometime later, state police crime lab analyst Sandra Lambatos conducted a computer search of DNA profiles in the state police database to see if any matched the DNA profile that Cellmark had produced from the rape victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. Lambatos determined that the Cellmark profile from the vaginal swabs matched the state crime lab\u2019s DNA profile of Williams produced from his August 2000 blood sample. Williams then took part in a lineup where the rape victim identified him as her attacker. At trial, Lambatos testified about her conclusions based on the Cellmark DNA report, but the report itself was not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Williams was found guilty at a bench trial and the Illinois Court of Appeals and Supreme Court each affirmed that judgment. At issue in those appeals was whether Lambatos\u2019s testimony concerning the match between the state police lab and Cellmark DNA profiles violated Williams\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, yet remained as fractured as it had in <em>Bullcoming. </em>In a plurality opinion written by Justice Alito, the court set forth two independent grounds why Lambatos\u2019s expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause. In the first of these, Justice Alito said that the testimony was not admitted for its truth. Instead, the prosecution expert\u2019s references to the underlying DNA reports had the limited purpose of explaining the basis of Lambatos\u2019s independent expert conclusion that Williams\u2019s DNA from the state police lab profile matched the profile that Cellmark produced from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. <em>(Williams, </em>supra, 567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2228] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).) Because this was a bench trial, it was far more likely that the trial judge was able to evaluate this evidence for this limited purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. __-__ [132 S.Ct. at pp. 2236-2237] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The plurality\u2019s alternative ground rested on the conclusion that the Cellmark DNA report was not testimonial for purposes of Confrontation Clause analysis. The <em>Williams </em>plurality reasoned that the confrontation clause had not been violated because the Cellmark report was prepared for the primary purpose of finding a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not for the primary purpose of targeting an accused individual. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p.__[132 S.Ct. at p. 2243] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Justice Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion, concluding that even though Lambatos\u2019s testimony about the Cellmark DNA report went to the truth of that report, the report was not testimonial because it \u201clack[ed] the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition.\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p.__ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2260] (conc. opn. of Thomas, J.).) Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, dissented. According to the dissent, testimony about the Cellmark DNA by Lambatos (who was not affiliated with Cellmark) violated Williams\u2019s right to confront the Cellmark analyst who prepared the report because the expert\u2019s statements went to the truth of that report. <em>(Id. </em>at p.__ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2276] (dis. opn. of Kagan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">E. Post-Williams <em>Decisions of the California Supreme Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"AeI\">(i) <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">On October 15, 2012, the California Supreme Court issued a trio of companion cases interpreting <em>Williams: Lopez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 569; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dungo </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 608 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 286 P.3d 442] <em>(Dungoy, </em>and <em>People v. Rutterschmidt </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 650 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 286 P.3d 435] <em>(Rutterschmidt).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The defendant in <em>Lopez </em>was found guilty of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (b).) At trial, a sheriffs department criminalist testified that he had reviewed a lab report\u2014made by a colleague\u2014which showed that the defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was 0.09 percent two hours after the collision. The criminalist testified that based on his own separate abilities he too concluded that the defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was 0.09 percent. The criminalist testified that he had worked at the lab for 17 years, knew its procedures for processing and testing blood samples, had trained the analyst who actually tested the defendant\u2019s blood, and that all lab technicians receive the same training. The report was also allowed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, our Supreme Court granted review and ordered the appellate court to reconsider its holding in light of <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>The Court of Appeal then reversed the judgment, and the California Supreme Court granted review. The <em>Lopez </em>court noted <em>Geier\u2019s </em>holding that the DNA evidence at issue in that case was not testimonial because it was a contemporaneous recordation of observable events. <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 577, 581.) However, the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming </em>courts held that the lab reports at issue in those cases were testimonial even though they contained near contemporaneous observations of a scientific test. <em>(Ibid, </em>citing <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>557 U.S. at p. 315, and <em>Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at pp. __-__ [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2714-2715].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">To resolve this issue, the <em>Lopez </em>court looked to <em>Crawford, Melendez-Diaz, Bullcoming, </em>and <em>Williams. (Lopez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 581.) It held that the portions of the lab report that contained nothing other than the machine-generated results of the test performed were not sufficiently formal or solemn to be testimonial under the Confrontation Clause because they lacked any attestations or assertions of validity, and because there was no way to cross-examine the machine that generated those results. (55 Cal.4th at pp. 582-583.) The same was true as to portions of the report that functioned like a chain of custody report by showing that it was the defendant\u2019s sample being tested. Those notations, on a chart captioned \u201cFOR LAB USE ONLY,\u201d were instead nothing more than an informal record of data for internal purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 583-584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">(ii) <em>People v. Dungo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The defendant in <em>Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 608, was convicted of murder. A prosecution forensic pathologist testified that the victim had been strangled. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>That expert\u2019s opinion testimony was based on objective facts concerning the condition of the body that another pathologist observed and recorded in the autopsy report. The report itself was not placed in evidence. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, concluding that the defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The <em>Dungo </em>court reversed. Justice Kennard\u2019s lead opinion, in which four other justices concurred, determined that the autopsy report was not testimonial under the Confrontation Clause. First, the expert testified as to only the physical observations recorded in the autopsy report, not as to the conclusions reached by the pathologist who conducted the autopsy and prepared the report. Such observations lack the formality required under the Confrontation Clause. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 619-620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Second, the court held that autopsy reports do not have the primary purpose of targeting an accused individual. Autopsy reports are required by law for certain types of deaths\u2014some related to criminal activities and some not. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 620.) Such reports therefore serve many purposes: to allow a decedent\u2019s family to learn whether a wrongful death action is warranted; for insurance companies to determine whether a death is covered under one of its policies; and to provide answers to grieving family members or satisfy the public\u2019s interest in the death of newsworthy persons. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 621.) Although autopsy reports are sometimes prepared for criminal investigations, their primary purpose is to provide an official explanation for an unusual death. Such official records are not ordinarily testimonial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Justice Chin wrote a concurring opinion, which was joined by three other justices. In it, he amplified the lead opinion\u2019s reasoning in light of the plurality opinion in <em>Williams. </em>According to Justice Chin, the autopsy report did not have the primary purpose of accusing the defendant or any other targeted individual of having committed a crime. Instead, its primary purpose was to describe the condition of the victim\u2019s body. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 630 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">(iii) <em>People v. Rutterschmidt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The court in <em>Rutterschmidt, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 650, considered the appeal of a murder conviction from a trial where a lab director testified as a prosecution expert that, based on lab tests conducted by others, the victims had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>drugged. The <em>Rutterschmidt </em>court declined to address whether a Confrontation Clause violation occurred, opting instead to affirm on the ground that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt based on other overwhelming evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt. (55 Cal.4th at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">F. Post-Williams <em>Decisions by the California Courts of Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">(i) <em>People </em>v. <em>Huynh</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The defendant in <em>People v. Huynh </em>(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 285 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 170] <em>(Huynh) </em>was charged with drugging and murdering one man, and with drugging and sexually assaulting another. The surviving victim had no memory of what occurred and was taken to a medical facility, where a sexual assault exam was performed. The nurse who conducted that exam observed and photographed various signs that the victim had been sodomized and otherwise sexually assaulted. That nurse was unavailable to testify at the defendant\u2019s trial, so her supervisor testified about the examination results in her stead, opining based on the photographs that the victim\u2019s anus showed signs of significant trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Division One of the Fourth Appellate District rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the substitute witness\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause. After discussing recent United States Supreme Court Confrontation Clause decisions, including <em>Williams, </em>along with the California Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Dungo, </em>the <em>Huynh </em>court found <em>Dungo </em>most analogous. Because the defendant was not a suspect and was not the target of a criminal investigation when the exam was performed, the court held that the primary purpose of the sexual assault exam and the photographs was to show the condition of the victim\u2019s body, not to accuse a targeted individual. <em>(Huynh, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.4th pp. 320-321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">(ii) <em>People v. Holmes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 431 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 914] <em>(Holmes), </em>Division Six of this court considered a case similar to ours; a defendant convicted of burglary, robbery, and murder challenged the judgment under the Confrontation Clause because lab supervisors testified about DNA results found on evidence at the crime scene, not the analysts who conducted those tests. Relying on <em>Dungo, </em>the appellate court held that no Confrontation Clause violation occurred because the unsworn and uncertified lab reports lacked the formality required to find such a violation. (212 Cal.App.4th at pp. 437-438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>(iii) <em>People v. Westmoreland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The court in <em>People v. Westmoreland </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 602 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 267] affirmed the murder and robbery convictions of a defendant who claimed his Confrontation Clause rights were violated when a forensic expert testified based on both the observations and conclusions contained in an autopsy report prepared by someone else. The appellate court noted that the case was unlike <em>Dungo </em>because the expert testified about someone else\u2019s conclusions, not just his observations, and because the autopsy report itself was placed in evidence. Even so, no Confrontation Clause violation occurred, the court held, because Dungo\u2019s conclusion about the primary purpose of autopsy reports extended beyond the more limited facts of that case. (213 Cal.App.4th at pp. 623-624.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">(iv) <em>People v. Steppe</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The court in <em>People v. Steppe </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1116 [152 Cal.Rptr.3d 827] affirmed a conviction for attempted murder against the defendant\u2019s contention that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated when a laboratory\u2019s technical reviewer gave her own independent opinion that the defendant\u2019s DNA matched that retrieved from certain evidence, as opposed to having the technician who performed the tests testify at trial. Interpreting both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Lopez, </em>the <em>Steppe </em>court held that no Confrontation Clause violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">First, as to the testimony referring to the raw data generated from the tests, such machine-generated results are not testimonial under <em>Lopez. (Steppe, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 1126.) As to the reviewer\u2019s testimony that she reached the same conclusion about a DNA match as did the analyst who performed the test, the court found no Confrontation Clause violation for the following reasons: (1) there had already been testimony that the lab would not issue a report unless a reviewer concurred in the analyst\u2019s finding, meaning that the jury already knew that the analyst and the reviewer had reached the same conclusion; (2) under <em>Williams </em>and <em>Lopez, </em>such reports are not formal and solemn enough to be testimonial; and (3) the reviewer\u2019s brief reference to the analyst\u2019s report and her reliance on the raw data it contained were proper under California law because \u201csuch items are reasonably relied on by experts in the field of DNA analysis in forming their opinions.\u201d <em>(Steppe, </em>at pp. 1126-1127, citing <em>People v. Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 618 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713] [for the third reason].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>3. <em>How to Interpret </em>Williams</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In <em>Barba III, </em>we interpreted <em>Bullcoming </em>in accord with Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion under the rule that a fragmented court\u2019s holding may be viewed as that position taken by a majority of justices who concurred on the narrowest grounds. <em>(Marks, supra, </em>430 U.S. at p. 193.) When the California Supreme Court set out to interpret <em>Williams, </em>however, it found that rule ill suited to the disparate reasoning employed by the plurality and Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring'opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In <em>Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 608, the court held that one pathologist could testify about an autopsy report prepared by another because such reports had multiple purposes and therefore did not have the primary purpose of serving as testimony at trial. Justice Kennard wrote the lead opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye and Justices Werdegar, Baxter, and Chin. However, Justice Chin wrote a concurring opinion, joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Baxter and Werdegar, that amplified the reasoning of the lead opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Justice Chin\u2019s first task was to stake out the analytic guideposts for a decision as fractured as that in <em>Williams. </em>Because Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion at least partly contradicted the <em>Williams </em>plurality, it could not be a logical subset of the plurality opinion, thereby making the <em>Marks </em>rule inapplicable. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 628 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) However, a legal opinion that commanded a majority of the Supreme Court is not required to find that court\u2019s reasoning. Instead, we need find nothing more than a legal standard which, when applied, will necessarily produce a result with which a majority of that court would agree. <em>(Ibid. </em>(conc. opn. of Chin, J.), citing <em>U.S. v. Williams </em>(9th Cir. 2006) 435 F.3d 1148, 1157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Justice Chin explained that under this interpretive rule, the <em>result </em>in <em>Williams </em>allowed a majority of our Supreme Court in <em>Dungo </em>to discern a standard that would command the support of a majority of the <em>Williams </em>court. Because a majority of that court found no Confrontation Clause violation, albeit for different reasons, if such a ruling in <em>Dungo </em>would comport with the reasoning of both the plurality and concurring opinions in <em>Williams, </em>then an affirmance was possible. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 628 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) \u201cAccordingly, we must determine whether there was a confrontation clause violation under Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion <em>and </em>whether there was a confrontation clause violation under the plurality\u2019s opinion. If there was no violation under both opinions, then the result (finding no confrontation clause violation) would command the support of a majority from the high court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Williams </em>case. Such a test satisfies the requirements of both the plurality opinion and Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 629 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.), original italics.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">4. <em>The </em>Williams <em>Plurality\u2019s Holding Regarding the Primary Purpose of DNA Testing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Under the interpretive rule announced in <em>Dungo, </em>we may affirm if we can find that there was no Confrontation Clause violation under the rationales employed by both the plurality and Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Williams. </em>In our view, Justice Thomas would likely affirm because the DNA reports created by Wong for this case were not sworn or certified declarations of fact that attested to their accuracy and reliability, and were therefore not sufficiently formal or solemn enough to invoke the protections of the Confrontation Clause. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2260] (conc. opn. of Thomas, J.).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We must then determine whether the <em>Williams </em>plurality would have reached the same result, albeit for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The alternative ground for the <em>Williams </em>court\u2019s plurality opinion was the determination that the Confrontation Clause would not have been violated even if the Cellmark DNA report had been admitted in evidence. According to the plurality, the report in that case did not have the primary purpose of targeting an accused individual and therefore was not testimonial. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at pp. __-__ [132 S.Ct. at pp. 2242-2243] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).) Barba understandably latches onto this language because he was not only a suspect in Kim\u2019s death when the DNA tests were conducted, he was in custody after having been charged with the crime. However, as we indicated earlier, we believe the <em>Williams </em>plurality has a broader reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We begin by setting forth in full the <em>Williams </em>plurality\u2019s rationale for concluding that DNA test reports were not testimonial under the Confrontation Clause. In describing the holding that would appear later in the decision, the plurality noted that \u201c[t]he Cellmark report is very different from the sort of extrajudicial statements, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and confessions, that the Confrontation Clause was originally understood to reach. The report was produced before any suspect was identified. The report was sought not for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against petitioner, who was not even under suspicion at the time, but for the purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose. And the profile that Cellmark provided was not inherently inculpatory. On the contrary, a DNA profile is evidence that tends to exculpate all but one of the more than 7 billion people in the world today. The use of DNA evidence to exonerate persons who have been wrongfully accused or convicted is well known. If DNA profiles could not be introduced without calling the technicians who participated in the preparation of the profile, economic pressures would encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA testing and rely instead on older forms of evidence, such as eyewitness identification, that are less reliable. [Citation.] The Confrontation Clause does not mandate such an undesirable development. This conclusion will not prejudice any defendant who really wishes to probe the reliability of the DNA <em>testing done </em>in a particular case because those who participated in the testing may always be subpoenaed by the defense and questioned at trial.\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. __ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2228] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">When the <em>Williams </em>plurality turned to its analysis and discussion of this issue, it noted that the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming </em>courts did not hold that all forensic reports were testimonial statements. In those cases, the reports violated the Confrontation Clause \u201cbecause they were the equivalent of affidavits made for the purpose of proving the guilt of a particular criminal defendant at trial. There was nothing resembling an ongoing emergency, as the suspects in both cases had already been captured, and the tests in question were relatively simple and can generally be performed by a single analyst. In addition, the technicians who prepared the reports must have realized that their contents (which reported an elevated blood-alcohol level and the presence of an illegal drug) would be incriminating, [f] . . . [f]</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\u201c. . . The Cellmark report is very different. It plainly was not prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual. In identifying the primary purpose of an out-of-court statement, we apply an objective test. [Citation.] We look for the primary purpose that a reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>have ascribed to the statement, taking into account all of the surrounding circumstances. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\u201cHere, the primary purpose of the Cellmark report, viewed objectively, was not to accuse petitioner or to create evidence for use at trial. When the [state police] lab sent the sample to Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time. Similarly, no one at Cellmark could have possibly known that the profile it produced would turn out to inculpate petitioner\u2014or for that matter, anyone else whose DNA profile was in a law enforcement database. Under these circumstances, there was no \u2018prospect of fabrication\u2019 and no incentive to produce anything other than a scientifically sound and reliable profile. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\u201cThe situation in which the Cellmark technicians found themselves was by no means unique. When lab technicians are asked to work on the production of a DNA profile, they often have no idea what the consequences of their work will be. In some cases, a DNA profile may provide powerful incriminating evidence against a person who is identified either before or after the profile is completed. But in others, the primary effect of the profile is to exonerate a suspect who has been charged or is under investigation. The technicians who prepare a DNA profile generally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating or exonerating\u2014or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\u201cIt is also significant that in many labs, numerous technicians work on each DNA profile. . . . When the work of a lab is divided up in such a way, it is likely that the sole purpose of each technician is simply to perform his or her task in accordance with accepted procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\u201cFinally, the knowledge that defects in a DNA profile may often be detected from the profile itself provides a further safeguard. In this case, for example, [police laboratory analyst] Lambatos testified that she would have been able to tell from the profile if the sample used by Cellmark had been degraded prior to testing. As noted above, moreover, there is no real chance that \u2018sample contamination, sample switching, mislabeling, [or] fraud\u2019 could have led Cellmark to produce a DNA profile that falsely matched petitioner. <em>Post, </em>[132 S.Ct.] at [2275] (Kagan, J., dissenting). At the time of the testing, petitioner had not yet been identified as a suspect, and there is no suggestion that anyone at Cellmark had a sample of his DNA to swap in by malice or mistake. And given the complexity of the DNA molecule, it is inconceivable that shoddy lab work would somehow produce a DNA profile that just so happened to have the precise genetic makeup of petitioner, who just so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>happened to be picked out of a lineup by the victim. The prospect is beyond fanciful.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\u201cIn short, the use at trial of a DNA report prepared by a modem, accredited laboratory \u2018bears little if any resemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at pp. - [132 S.Ct. at pp. 2243__-__2244] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.), citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">5. <em>The </em>Dungo <em>Court\u2019s Analysis of </em>Williams</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We next examine Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 608, which commanded a majority of the court. Justice Chin concluded that the autopsy report statements relied on at trial by the expert witness were not testimonial because their primary purpose was to describe the condition of the victim\u2019s body. In doing so, Justice Chin stated that \u201cthere was no prospect of fabrication or incentive to produce anything other than a scientifically reliable report. The purpose of this part of the autopsy report is \u2018simply to perform [the pathologist\u2019s] task in accordance with accepted procedures.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 630 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.), quoting <em>Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion went on to observe that \u201cpractical considerations\u201d helped to inform the <em>Williams </em>plurality, pointing to the plurality\u2019s statement that economic pressures would likely cause prosecutors to forego the use of DNA testing if they had to call the technicians who helped prepare a DNA profile. Similar considerations were at play for autopsy reports, Justice Chin wrote. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 631 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.), citing <em>Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Justice Chin acknowledged that the circumstances in <em>Dungo </em>supported the contention that the autopsy report\u2019s primary purpose was to accuse the defendant in that case of a crime. \u201cUnlike the situation in <em>Williams, </em>defendant was a suspect at the time the autopsy report was prepared. An investigator was present during the autopsy, and the pathologist had been told of defendant\u2019s confession before the autopsy report was written.\u201d <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 632 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) Even so, he did not believe that the <em>Williams </em>plurality intended to allow evidence of DNA reports only when there was no identified suspect at the time the report was prepared. \u201cAlthough the plurality in <em>Williams </em>stated that the defendant in that case happened not to be a suspect or in custody at the time the report was prepared, nothing in its opinion suggests that this is a <em>requirement </em>rather than merely one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\u2018surrounding circumstances\u2019 of which the court must take account.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. __ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2243], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The key distinction for Justice Chin was that the opinion concerning the manner of death came from the testifying expert who was subject to full cross-examination, and not from the report, which was not placed in evidence. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 632 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) In forming his opinion, the testifying expert relied on statements in the autopsy report concerning the condition of the victim\u2019s body. Such statements \u201care objective observations of the type routinely placed into autopsy reports, whether or not a specific suspect exists. They are not statements with a primary purpose of accusing defendant, or anyone else, of criminal conduct. The fact that the larynx and hyoid bone were not broken, like most of the other observations memorialized in the report, \u2018was not inherently inculpatory.\u2019 [Citation.] There was no prospect of fabrication or incentive to produce anything other than an accurate description of the state of the body.\u201d <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 632 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.), quoting <em>Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at pp.__,__[132 S.Ct. at pp. 2228, 2244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">A majority of the California Supreme Court therefore interprets the <em>Williams </em>plurality to mean that a DNA profile report is not necessarily testimonial simply because the defendant had been identified as a suspect when the report was prepared. Instead, according to Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dungo, </em>that is merely a factor to consider when evaluating the circumstances under which reports of forensic test results are prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">6. <em>The Absence of an Identified Suspect Is Not Required Under the </em>Williams <em>Plurality\u2019s Analysis of the Primary Purpose of DNA Testing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">We agree with Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dungo </em>that the <em>Williams </em>plurality did not make the absence of a targeted individual a requirement for finding that a DNA test report is not testimonial. Even though the <em>Williams </em>plurality can be plausibly read as limited to situations where no suspect had been identified when a DNA profile was produced, that narrow language actually serves as the jumping-off point for a broader interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">As we explained above, the <em>Williams </em>plurality said that when the police sent the samples to Cellmark for DNA testing, the primary purpose was to identify and catch the rapist. The same was true for the Cellmark technicians, who could not have known that their test results would point to the defendant or anyone else with a DNA profile in the state\u2019s database. However, the plurality then said in essence that the Cellmark technicians who tested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>incriminating samples that were later linked to Williams were no different from DNA lab technicians in general, who never know whether their work will incriminate or exonerate someone <em>whether or not that person has been identified as a suspect or charged with a crime. (Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p.__132 S.Ct. at p. 2244] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The <em>Williams </em>plurality elsewhere extolled the virtues of DNA testing in general, noting that its use \u201cto exonerate persons <em>who have been wrongfully accused or convicted </em>is well known.\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2228] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.), italics added.) The plurality warned that requiring testimony from the technicians who prepared DNA profiles would encourage prosecutors to forego the use of DNA testing and resort to less reliable forms of identification evidence, an \u201cundesirable development\u201d that the Confrontation Clause did not require. (567 U.S. at p. __ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2228] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).) A safeguard for defendants existed because those who \u201creally wishe[d] to probe the reliability of the DNA testing done in a particular case\u201d may always subpoena those who took part in the testing and question them at trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Finally, the <em>Williams </em>plurality ended by stating that DNA reports prepared by modern accredited laboratories bear little or no resemblance to the kinds of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">If, as Barba contends, the <em>Williams </em>plurality is limited to DNA testing conducted only in the absence of an identified suspect, why did Justice Alito contrast that scenario with DNA testing in general, pointing out in broadly favorable language how such testing can exonerate as well as implicate someone already charged with a crime? And why conclude the analysis by stating that DNA testing is essentially exempt from the Confrontation Clause without specifying that this was so only when the test was performed at a time when no suspect had yet been identified? The answer must be\u2014as Justice Chin wrote for a majority of four justices in Dungo\u2014that the absence of a targeted individual is not required by the <em>Williams </em>plurality in order to find that a DNA test report is not testimonial under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">The practicality of this conclusion is borne out by the facts of this case. Two days after Kim\u2019s murder and more than two weeks before an anonymous tipster identified Barba as his killer, lead detective Inabu asked that the bloody knife and sweatshirt found at the scene be tested in order to determine the killer\u2019s identity. Under Barba\u2019s reasoning, any DNA test results obtained during that period would not be testimonial under the <em>Williams </em>plurality. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>However, once Barba had been targeted as a suspect, reports concerning the results of any testing done after that time became testimonial. The benefits of DNA testing praised by the <em>Williams </em>plurality would not simply disappear upon the discovery of a possible suspect. In either case, the same objects would be tested using the same methods by lab technicians who, as Justice Alito observed, have no idea whether their work will exonerate or implicate someone who has been \u201ccharged or is under investigation.\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2244] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">7. <em>Barba\u2019s Confrontation Rights Were Not Violated</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Making sense out of the case law in this area is to some extent an exercise in \u201ctasseomancy.\u201d The <em>Williams </em>plurality believes that DNA reports themselves are not testimonial. A majority of the justices in <em>Dungo, </em>as represented by Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion, reads that opinion to mean that its rationale may apply even if the reports were prepared when a suspect had been identified or charged. Those same four justices concluded that the autopsy report evidence at issue in that case did not violate the Confrontation Clause because it came in through the testimony of the expert witness, who was subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Meanwhile, the two post <em>-Williams </em>decisions by the Courts of Appeal that concern DNA evidence have taken somewhat different approaches. The court in <em>Holmes, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.4th 431, concluded that DNA reports were not testimonial because they lacked the requisite formality and solemnity. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 437-438.) The court in <em>Steppe, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th 1116 found no Confrontation Clause violation on facts similar to those here for three reasons: (1) there had already been testimony that the lab would not issue a report unless a reviewer concurred in the analyst\u2019s finding, meaning that the jury already knew that the analyst and the reviewer had reached the same conclusion; (2) under <em>Williams </em>and <em>Lopez, </em>such reports are not formal and solemn enough to be testimonial; and (3) the reviewer\u2019s brief reference to the analyst\u2019s report and her reliance on the raw data it contained were proper under California law because \u201csuch items are reasonably relied on by experts in the field of DNA analysis in forming their opinions.\u201d <em>(Steppe, </em>at pp. 1126-1127, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 618 [for the third reason].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In some ways, the end of this lengthy exposition takes us back to the beginning and the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Geier, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th 555. Although the <em>Geier </em>court used the label \u201ccontemporaneous recordation of observable events\u201d to describe why DNA test results were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>testimonial <em>(id. </em>at p. 606), it did so through the prism of \u201cthe circumstances under which [a] statement was made\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 607).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">There were three circumstances that led the <em>Geier </em>court to conclude the DNA results at issue in that case were not testimonial. First, the results were generated as part of a standardized scientific protocol conducted pursuant to the analyst\u2019s employment at Cellmark. Although the prosecutor hoped to obtain evidence against Geier, the analyst\u2019s work product was part of her job, and was not intended to incriminate him. Second, to the extent the analyst\u2019s notes and reports recounted the procedures used, they were not accusatory because DNA analysis can lead to either incriminatory or exculpatory results. Third, the accusatory opinions that the DNA evidence matched Geier \u201cwere reached and conveyed not through the nontestifying technician\u2019s laboratory notes and report, but by the testifying witness, [the lab director].\u201d <em>(Geier, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">This reasoning overlaps that of the <em>Williams </em>plurality. When determining the primary purpose of an out-of-court statement, the plurality took into account all the surrounding circumstances. Just like the lab technicians who worked on the defendant\u2019s samples in <em>Williams, </em>DNA lab technicians in general perform their tasks in accordance with accepted procedures and have no idea beforehand whether their work will exonerate or inculpate a known suspect. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at pp. __-__ [132 S.Ct. at pp. 2243-2244] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Not addressed by the <em>Williams </em>plurality is the <em>Geier </em>court\u2019s third factor: that the DNA evidence was conveyed through the independent opinion of the DNA expert who testified at trial. This thread is picked up by Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dungo, </em>where he wrote that the autopsy evidence was not testimonial because it came from the expert who testified at trial, and whose opinion was based on the nonaccusatory statements about the victim\u2019s physical condition that were contained in the report, not from the report itself. <em>(Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 632 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) Although Geier\u2019s continued validity has been questioned in light of later United States Supreme Court decisions, it has never been abrogated by the United States Supreme Court, which denied a petition for certiorari in that case just four days after deciding <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>Nor has the California Supreme Court overruled <em>Geier, </em>which cited it without qualification in <em>Lopez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pages 576-577, 581, 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">We therefore arrive at a jurisprudential crossroads. The United States Supreme Court has asked us to reconsider our decision in <em>Barba III </em>in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of <em>Williams. </em>We believe that a majority of that court would approve of an affirmance here for two reasons. Justice Thomas would approve because DNA reports lack the solemnity and formality required to be deemed testimonial. The plurality would approve because, at least as we read the opinion, DNA test reports are not testimonial in part due to practical considerations, and in part because their primary purpose is not to accuse a targeted individual. The former rationale squares with at least part of our analysis in <em>Barba III, </em>where we distinguished the Cellmark DNA reports from the affidavit-like documents at issue in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. </em>It also aligns with the reasoning in <em>Holmes, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.4th 431 and part of the analysis relied on in <em>Steppe, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">It appears likely that at least four justices of the California Supreme Court\u2014as represented in Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in Dungo\u2014would agree that the primary purpose of the DNA test materials produced by Cellmark were not testimonial under the <em>Williams </em>plurality\u2019s primary purpose test and would reach that conclusion without regard to whether the police had identified a suspect. However, their admissibility would be proper only through the testimony of expert witness Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The somewhat competing analyses represented by the <em>Williams </em>plurality and the <em>Dungo </em>concurrence are almost \u00bfally reconciled by the reasoning of <em>Geier. </em>The primary purpose of the DNA reports was not testimonial because (1) they were generated by a lab technician pursuant to standardized procedures; (2) even though Barba had been charged with the crime, lab technicians such as Wong have no idea what their results might show, and DNA testing is routinely used to inculpate or exonerate those charged with crimes; and (3) the accusatory opinions came from expert witness Reynolds, who was subject to vigorous cross-examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">As for the practical considerations that motivated the plurality in <em>Williams, </em>we agree that it makes no sense to exclude evidence of DNA reports if the technicians who conducted the tests do not testify. So long as a qualified expert who is subject to cross-examination conveys an independent opinion about the test results, then evidence about the DNA tests themselves is admissible. Finally, as the <em>Williams </em>plurality observed, defendants who question the validity of DNA test results have an additional safeguard available through their power to subpoena anyone who took part in the DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>testing process. Accordingly, we hold that Barba\u2019s confrontation rights were not violated by Reynolds\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">8. <em>Admission of the Reports Was Harmless Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Although the plurality opinion in <em>Williams </em>could arguably be read to allow DNA reports in evidence without expert testimony, both <em>Geier </em>and Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dungo </em>endorsed reference to forensic test reports in part because evidence about them came by way of expert testimony. We need not reach that issue, however, because even if the one DNA report that implicated Barba should not have been allowed in evidence, we conclude the error was harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Loy </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 46, 69-70 [127 Cal.Rptr.3d 679, 254 P.3d 980] [Confrontation Clause violations subject to harmless error analysis, where we ask whether it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have reached the same verdict without the error].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The report contained nothing remotely approaching a direct affirmation that certain correct procedures had been properly followed. The key defense theory at trial was that the hair samples had been contaminated by the police before being sent to Cellmark, and that Wong\u2019s failure to wash the samples explained why Barba\u2019s DNA was on the hairs. However, Reynolds was not allowed to speculate about procedures Wong might have performed. Although she could testify about the lab\u2019s usual protocols, the jury was told that it did not mean the protocols were followed unless it was reflected in Wong\u2019s notes. As a result, Reynolds was forced to concede that Wong had not washed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>hair samples that implicated Barba, even though that was usually done in order to eliminate a DNA result from genetic material that had been deposited on the hair shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">According to Reynolds, the hair shaft does not contain DNA, but the root does. The shaft was tested separately and was found to have Barba\u2019s DNA on it, meaning that it had been deposited there somehow. On direct examination, Reynolds testified that if the hair had belonged to someone other than Barba, but his DNA had been deposited on the hair, then the test results would have shown a mixture\u2014meaning the DNA of two separate persons was present. No mixture was present, she testified. However, on cross-examination, she conceded that she could not rule out the possibility of contamination before Cellmark received the hair samples, and could not say with certainty that the test results came from the hair donor or were deposited there. The report itself noted that in addition to the listed profile results, \u201cweak results\u201d were obtained that could have come from someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In short, even if the report should not have been admitted into evidence, it was virtually meaningless without Reynolds\u2019s testimony to explain it. Had the report itself been excluded, Reynolds\u2019s opinion would have still been before the jury. Also, the court\u2019s order preventing Reynolds from speculating about test procedures that did not appear in Wong\u2019s notes allowed defense counsel to perform a skillful and thorough cross-examination that allowed the jury to doubt the reliability of the test results. And, as noted, the report itself stated that weak results were obtained, possibly due to another DNA donor. Finally, the jury did not ask to see the report during its deliberations, and the report was not the focus of the parties\u2019 arguments to the jury. We therefore conclude that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have reached the same verdict even if the report had not been admitted into evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Loy, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at pp. 69-70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">NONCONFRONTATION CLAUSE ISSUES<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AUE\">Bigelow, R J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-10\"> The statement of facts is taken in large part from our previous decision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barba </em>(Jan. 23, 2012, B185940) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> We state the facts concerning the DNA evidence in more detail in part 1.1. of our Discussion, <em>post.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> These reports were not part of the appellate record in either <em>Barba I </em>or <em>Barba II. </em>In <em>Barba III, </em>we ordered the record augmented to include these trial exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\"> In part II of <em>Bullcoming, </em>footnote 6 mentioned <em>Melendez-Diaz\u2019s </em>observation that business and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation because they are usually created in order to administer an entity\u2019s affairs, not to prove a fact at trial. <em>(Bullcoming, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p._, fn. 6 [131 S.Ct. at p. 2714, fn. 6].)

At a minimum, we consider it persuasive authority and a reliable indicator of how a majority of the court would rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b680-12\"> Barba contends that Justice Thomas would view the DNA reports as sufficiently formalized and solemn to be considered testimonial because, if they were falsified, a felony would have been committed under Penal Code section 134. We reject that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Penal Code section 134 states that it is a felony to prepare any false document or object with the intent that it be produced at trial for any fraudulent purpose. That provision would apply with equal force to documents that are not testimonial under the Confrontation Clause, such as the autopsy reports in <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Dungo. </em>That would not make them testimonial just because they had been falsified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> We question whether Geier\u2019s \u201ccontemporaneous recordation of observable events\u201d analysis is viable, given the holdings in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. </em>Underlying that analysis, however, is a principle that squares with the <em>Williams </em>plurality: examining the totality of the circumstances under which a DNA test report was generated. We rely on the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> Barba\u2019s supplemental brief on <em>Williams </em>and its progeny splits time between each of the <em>Williams </em>plurality\u2019s alternative grounds. We do not believe the first ground\u2014that the reports were not in evidence for their truth\u2014is applicable on the facts of this case. The dispute in <em>Williams </em>concerned the expert\u2019s testimony that Cellmark\u2019s DNA profile from the rape victim\u2019s vaginal swabs matched the DNA profile of Williams that the state police obtained in a separate incident. The focus of the argument was on the assumption in the prosecutor\u2019s question that the DNA tested by Cellmark in fact came from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at pp. __-__ [132 S.Ct. at pp. 2236-2237] (plur. opn. of Arito, J.).) As Justice Alito pointed out, Justice Kagan agreed in her dissent that there would be no problem asking the expert whether the two DNA profiles matched, without reference to the source of the DNA materials that were tested. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p.__[132 S.Ct. at p. 2237].) The expert did not testify about anything that was done at Cellmark\u2019s lab and did not vouch for the quality of Cellmark\u2019s work. <em>(Id. </em>at p.__[132 S.Ct. at p. 2235].) Instead, the expert was simply making a permissible assumption upon which to base her opinion. <em>(Id. </em>at p.__[132 S.Ct. at p. 2236].) In this case, however, Reynolds did essentially vouch for the accuracy and reliability of Cellmark\u2019s DNA testing. Accordingly, we choose not to apply Justice Alito\u2019s analysis that evidence from the DNA reports was not admitted for its truth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b689-17\"> As for the other three Cellmark reports, because they concluded that the samples did not contain Barba\u2019s DNA, their admission was also harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 712.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>FLEER, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"A-d\">I concur in the judgment because <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 569 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 286 P.3d 469] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dungo </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 608 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 286 P.3d 442] require finding the admission of Dr. Reynolds\u2019s testimony did not violate the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 24, 2013, S210914.
