H. Bull Steamship Co. brought suit below against the defendant Union seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for the defendant\u2019s alleged breach of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties. Bull then moved for a preliminary injunction restraining the Union from continuing the peaceful strike then in progress, which constituted the alleged breach of contract. The trial court heard the motion on affidavits and briefs and entered an injunction <em>pendente lite </em>of substantial scope against continuance of the strike.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Its opinion is reported in D.C.E.D.N.Y., 155 F.Supp. 739. This appeal from the order of injunction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">The basic facts are not in dispute. Bull is an operator of ships engaged in interstate commerce. The Union represents unlicensed personnel aboard Bull\u2019s ships. The parties entered into a collective bargaining agreement effective October 15, 1956, which runs until September 30, 1958. The agreement provides in part that \u201c[t]here shall be no strikes, lockouts, or stoppages of work\u201d while its provisions are in effect. On June 17, 1957, the Union sought to renegotiate certain wages. These negotiations were unsuccessful and on August 19, 1957, the Union called a strike which still continued when the trial court issued its order. The parties disagree as to the scope of the no-strike clause and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a strike over wages constitutes a breach, of the agreement. We do not decide this issue because we hold that in any event the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act of March 23,1932, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104, deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to issue injunctions which prohibit peaceful strikes in cases \u201cinvolving or growing out of any labor dispute.\u201d No one controverts that this is a peaceful strike. Section 13(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018labor dispute\u2019 includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This case involves an impasse in renegotiation of wages. The Union maintains that the no-strike clause has no application to a strike for this purpose. Bull contends otherwise. But the basic controversy concerns wages \u2014 terms or conditions of employment \u2014 and thus, under \u00a7 13(c), this is a labor dispute. Nothing in the Act makes its provisions inapplicable where, after a labor dispute arises, one party takes action which constitutes a breach of a contract between them. It is immaterial that the strike might be a breach of the Union\u2019s duty under the collective bargaining agreement or that the controversy itself might be determined by reference to it. W. L. Mead, Inc. v. International Broth. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, 1 Cir., 217 F.2d 6; In re Third Avenue Transit Corp., 2 Cir., 192 F.2d 971; Alcoa S. S. Co. v. McMahon, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 81 F.Supp. 541, affirmed 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 567, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 821, 70 S.Ct. 65, 94 L.Ed. 498. Hence under \u00a7 4 of the Act, if still applicable, the trial court would lack jurisdiction to issue its preliminary injunction in the present labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">So much appears to be common ground between the parties and with the court. The real issue is whether or not there has been a repeal by implication of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The court found that \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act of June 23, 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, as interpreted in Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972, authorized it to issue the injunction. The question thus presented is whether or not this later statute repeals <em>the </em>Norris-LaGuardia Act to the extent that federal courts will now have jurisdiction to enjoin a peaceful strike which constitutes a breach of a no-strike clause in a collective bargaining agreement. As Bull itself states, \u201c[t]his Court\u2019s problem is to reconcile these two laws, in the light of the circumstances of this case and of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of June 3, 1957 in Textile Workers Union [of America] v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448 [77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972].\u201d Section 301(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">\u201cSuits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce * * * may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Alabama, supra, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, does clearly hold that this section is more than procedural and gives substantive rights grounded in a body of federal law which in a proper case may be enforced by equitable relief. There the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the employer included both an arbitration clause and a no-strike clause. After grievance procedures had been exhausted to no avail, the union demanded that the employer arbitrate differences concerning work loads and work assignments. , The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>employer refused, and the union brought an action under this statute in the federal district court to compel the employer to arbitrate. The district court concluded that it had jurisdiction and ordered the employer to comply with the arbitration provision. The Court of Appeals reversed this determination and the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court held that \u00a7 301 \u201cauthorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of these collective bargaining agreements and includes within that federal law specific performance of promises to arbitrate grievances under collective bargaining agreements.\u201d 353 U.S. 448, 451, 77 S.Ct. 912, 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">But this case does not say that \u00a7 301 authorizes federal courts to issue injunctions when that remedy is clearly prohibited by the Norris-La Guardia Act. The Court does hold, after an analysis of legislative history, to reach the conclusion just quoted, that the issuance of an order compelling arbitration was not prohibited by the Norris-La Guardia Act. The Court reasoned that refusal to arbitrate is not protected conduct under \u00a7 4, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104, and is not the kind of conduct which had given rise to abuse of the power to enjoin. Indeed the Court found that \u00a7 8, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 108, indicates a congressional policy favoring the settlement of labor disputes by arbitration. The Court next dealt with \u00a7 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. This section, in addition to \u00a7 4, deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to issue injunctions in cases involving labor disputes unless the court makes specific findings of fact and follows prescribed procedural requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Citing Judge Magruder in Local 205, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) v. General Elec. Co., 1 Cir., 233 F.2d 85, 92, affirmed General Elec. Co. v. Local 205, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (U.E.), 353 U.S. 547, 77 S.Ct. 921, 1 L.Ed.2d 1028, the Court found these procedures \u201cinapposite\u201d and concluded that: \u201cThe congressional policy in favor of the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate grievance disputes being clear, there is no reason to submit them to the requirements of \u00a7 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\u201d 353 U.S. 448, 458, 77 S.Ct. 912, 919.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u2022 In the case at bar the Union\u2019s conduct comes squarely within \u00a7 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. This is a lawful and peaceful strike which Congress said a federal court may not enjoin. The Supreme Court in Lincoln Mills was concerned with a refusal to arbitrate \u2014 conduct not protected by \u00a7 4 and at odds with congressional policy. It did not involve a strike \u2014 the issue here. The ultimate question in Lincoln Mills was whether or not Congress by \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act authorized the federal courts to compel arbitration. The question here is whether or not Congress by that same provision intended to repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act <em>pro tanto. </em>This is not the question which was before the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Lincoln Mills both this Circuit and the First Circuit had agreed that \u00a7 301 did not impliedly repeal the NorrisLaGuardia Act. Alcoa S. S. Co. v. McMahon, supra, 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 567, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 821, 70 S.Ct. 65, 94 L.Ed. 498; W. L. Mead, Inc. v. International Broth. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, supra, 1 Cir., 217 F.2d 6; Local 205, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) v. General Elec. Co., supra, 1 Cir., 233 F.2d 85, affirmed General Elec. Co. v. Local 205, United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (U.E.), 353 U.S. 547, 77 S.Ct. 921. Two reasons for this conclusion were stressed. First, Congress in enacting \u00a7 301 did not expressly withdraw the restrictions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and such withdrawal cannot be implied, particularly since in other sections of the same Act, viz., \u00a7\u00a7 101(h), 208(b), and 302(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(h), 178(b), and 186(e), Congress expressly lifted the bar of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to vest certain injunction powers in the courts when the National Labor Relations Board initiated the court proceedings. Thus, see Alcoa S. S. Co. v. McMahon, supra, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 81 F.Supp. 541, 543, affirmed 2 Cir., 173 F.2d 567, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 821, 70 S.Ct. 65; and see also McCarroll v. Los Angeles County District Council of Carpenters, Cal.1957, 315 P.2d 322. Second, it is an accepted canon of construction that repeals by implication are not favored, especially where the previous statute (the NorrisLaGuardia Act) is not stale or forgotten, but is a \u201csignificant and tremendously important piece of legislation which the Congress evidently had specifically in mind when it came to enact the Labor Management Relations Act in 1947.\u201d W. L. Mead, Inc, v. International Broth. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, supra, 1 Cir., 217 F.2d 6, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Bull maintains that these cases are distinguishable because neither in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>volved a no-strike clause in a collective bargaining agreement. But this does not follow. The presence of the clause might make it easier to find a breach by a strike, but it can have no effect on the problem of statutory construction. The cases cited above involved strikes which allegedly breached collective bargaining agreements, and the recitals of legislative history therein contained are relevant to our problem here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Bull contends that these authorities are in error. It maintains that the legislative history of \u00a7 301, especially as quoted in Lincoln Mills, requires the conclusion that Congress intended to repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act to the extent that federal courts do have jurisdiction to enjoin violations of agreements not to strike. In that case, 353 U.S. 448, 452-456, 77 S.Ct. 912, 915-917, Justice Douglas quotes passages from Senate and House Reports indicating that Congress intended to make collective bargaining agreements enforceable on unions as well as employers. Bull finds other congressional statements to the same effect. These statements, however, shed little light on how these agreements are to be enforced; and each is consistent with an interpretation that Congress intended merely to provide employers with a monetary recovery for a union\u2019s breach of a no-strike agreement and to impose certain sanctions against employees such as loss of status. Even though the Court found that an agreement to arbitrate is the <em>quid pro quo </em>for an agreement not to strike, this does not mean that because the former is specifically enforceable the latter is also. The Court found statements of congressional policy favoring the specific performance of arbitration agreements. Here we have a significant statute opposed to enjoining peaceful strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Bull argues that both Houses agreed initially to allow federal courts to enjoin breaches of collective bargaining agreements. The House did it by including in its version of \u00a7 301 the following passage;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201c(e) In actions and proceedings involving violations of agreements between an employer and a labor organization or other representative of employees, the provisions of the Act of March 23, 1932, entitled \u2018An Act to amend the Judicial Code and to define and limit the jurisdiction of courts sitting in equity, and for other purposes,\u2019 shall not have any application in respect of either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Senate did it by making violations of collective bargaining agreements unfair labor practices under \u00a7 8(b) (5), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (5), and empowering the National Labor Relations Board to seek injunctions to restrain unfair labor practices free from the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Both provisions were eliminated in conference. Bull holds it unrealistic to believe that the conference deleted something on which both Houses previously had agreed. It contends that the difference in method was resolved by leaving the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements to the courts. It points to the following passage in the House Conference Report to support this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cThe Senate amendment contained a provision which does not appear in section 8 of existing law. This provision would have made it an unfair labor practice to violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or an agreement to submit a labor dispute to arbitration. The conference agreement omits this provision of the Senate amendment. Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 510',. 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 41-42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Bull asserts that the phrase \u201cusual processes of the law\u201d comprehends the-injunctive relief which both Houses had separately approved, and thereby indicates that Congress intended to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>jurisdiction to enjoin breaches of collective bargaining contracts, including strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We do not find this analysis persuasive. First, the phrase \u201cusual processes of the law\u201d seems to refer to processes in force when the Act was passed. At the time the Taft-Hartley Act was passed federal courts had no power to enjoin peaceful strikes. Second, conference committees may and sometimes do change statutory provisos agreed upon earlier by both Houses. An example is cited in Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 452, 77 S.Ct. 912, 915, where the Court points out that both Houses initially provided that failure to abide by an agreement to arbitrate would be an unfair labor practice. This was dropped by the conference. Finally, the House Conference Report does not indicate why the conference dropped the House provision making the Norris-LaGuardia Act inapplicable to suits brought under \u00a7 301. The Report makes it clear that the provision was dropped, however, for it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ack-dedup-0\">\u201cSection 302(e) of the House bill [the House\u2019s original form of \u00a7 301] made the Norris-LaGuardia Act inapplicable in actions and proceedings involving violations of agreements between an employer and a labor organization. Only part of this provision is included in the conference agreement.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 66.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Report then goes on to say that the provision remains only in \u00a7 301(e), which relates to the determination of the question of agency. If the House provision had stayed in the bill, the trial court undoubtedly would have had jurisdiction to enjoin the strike. But it was deleted without explanation, thus supporting the conclusion that Congress intended the Norris-LaGuardia Act to be applicable to suits brought under \u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The mandate of \u00a7 4 of the Norris-La-Guardia Act has been an expression of national policy for many years. If this policy is to be changed it should be changed by Congress, and not by judicial legislation or inventiveness. It. is our conclusion that Congress did not repeal \u00a7 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act by the enactment of \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act. Under these circumstances the injunction order must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Order reversed; action remanded for proceedings by the district court consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\">. The main provisions of tlic injunction are contained in the following paragraphs :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">\u201cOrdered that, effective on October 1, 1957, at 5 P.M., Eastern Daylight Savings Time, defendant, Seafarers\u2019 International Union of North America, Atlantic and Gulf District, AEL-OIO, its officers, agents, members, servants, employees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or participation with them, who shall or may receive actual notice of this Order, be and the same hereby are enjoined and restrained, during the pendency of this action, from picketing, striking, or inciting. causing, inducing, or, in any manner, directly or indirectly, supporting any work stoppage aboard any of the vessels owned or operated by plaintiff, A.

Judge Magruder had concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"awv-dedup-0\">\u201cBasically, it is the language and background of the Norris-LaGuardia Act itself which point to the conclusion that the restrictions of \u00a7 7 do not have to be met as a prerequisite to jurisdiction to grant an order compelling arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azt-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Section 7 requires certain preliminary allegations and findings: a threat of unlawful acts.leading to substantial injury to property, greater injury to complainant in denying relief than to defendants in granting it, and the inability of the public officials charged with protection of property to furnish adequate protection. Procedural requirements include notice to said public officials and an undertaking for reimbursement by complainant and a surety. These provisions were obviously aimed to limit injunctions to cases involving violent or destructive acts. See also \u00a7 9. The enumerated requisites, which draw a logical line in relation to union conduct in strikes and picketing (and perhaps to some employer activities), are not at all compatible with the situation where one party merely demands that the other be compelled to arbitrate a grievance in accordance with a contract provision for arbitration, in which latter situation the required findings seldom, if ever, could be made either affirmatively or negatively. They just do not sensibly apply. We do not believe Congress intended \u00a7 7 in any case to be a snare and a delusion, holding out the possibility of jurisdiction but demanding for its exercise sworn allegations of inapposite facts.\u201d 283 F.2d 85, 92.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b382-10\">.
