Baird, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 234 F.2d 691, the District Court twice allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint, as they had the previous complaints, for failure to comply with Rule 8(a), F.R.Civ.P., [28 U.S.C.A.] which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u201d, and Rule 8(e) (1), which requires that \u201cEach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d The District Court dismissed the complaint, with prejudice, and the plaintiffs appeal. We find no error. We cannot discover what claim the complaint is intended to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
