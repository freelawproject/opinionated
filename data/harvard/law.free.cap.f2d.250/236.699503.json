We hold that in the setting of this case the cross-examination was proper and accordingly we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Sing Kee appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered on March 5, 1957, after a jury, presided over by Judge Richard H. Levet in the Southern District of New York during a ten day trial, found him guilty on four counts. Count 1 charged that the defendant, from 1949 until indictment in May 1956, conspired with certain named and unnamed persons to violate the Immigration Laws of the United States, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1425 and 1542, and 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1324. The other three counts charged that Sing Kee on three separate occasions, in 1951 and 1952, wilfully and knowingly made false statements in applications for passports with intent to induce and secure the issuance of passports for the use of others by stating, when he knew it to be untrue, that the applicants were the sons of named persons, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1542 and 3238. A fifth count, which also charged a false statement in a passport application, was dismissed at the close of the government\u2019s case. The defendant was sentenced to 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>/2 years and fined $1,500 on each count, the prison sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">The government\u2019s proof to sustain the conviction was abundant and convincing. In summary, the evidence disclosed that Sing Kee, while operating the China Overseas Travel Service at 11 Mott Street in New York\u2019s Chinatown, was also engaged in preparing and processing passport applications for Chinese attempting to gain entry into this country by posing as sons of Chinese-American citizens. The Chinese immigration quota of 100 each year, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1151, virtually limited immigration from China to those who were derivative citizens by virtue of the American citizenship of one of their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">The scheme was, in general, as follows: Chinese-American citizens or alleged citizens, married in China while on visits to that country or before original entry into the United States, would make fictitious reports to the immigration authorities of sons born to them in China or would fail to report the deaths of sons who had resided in China. Immigration records would accordingly list a citizen son not actually in existence. The \u201cslot\u201d thus created would be sold by the \u201cparent\u201d for prices usually ranging from $1,000 to $1,800 to a Chinese in the United States who desired to bring over a youth comparable in age to the fictitious son. Sing Kee would prepare or would have prepared the necessary passport applications and supporting affidavits and would produce coaching books called \u201chalgoons,\u201d from which the applicant, in Hong Kong, could obtain the necessary basic facts concerning the family of which he claimed to be a son. This information was necessary to substantiate the claim of derivative citizenship and thus enable the applicant to come to the United States as a citizen. Sing Kee usually received for his services from $400 to $600, part of which he paid to attorneys and others. In six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>separate eases there was evidence that Sing Kee was well aware that the \u201csons\u201d were not sons. In one case it was testified that Sing Kee himself arranged to buy a slot from a father.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Several persons were involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in the transactions giving rise to the prosecution. A physician and a serologist, Doctors Liu and Sussman, determined the compata-bility of the blood of the alleged sons with that of their supposed parents so as to weed out the incompatibles. A brother of the defendant, Albert Kee, a friend, Wilbur Chung, and a notary public, Louis Treglia, all performed services incidental to the conspiracy. In addition, one attorney prepared affidavits, usually for $25, and another followed the course of these matters through the State Department for fees of from $25 to $75, and both attorneys transmitted the affidavits and passport applications to the appropriate authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In those cases where the State Department refused to issue passports to the spurious sons, Sing Kee referred the \u201cparents\u201d to Samuel Waterman, an attorney who had offices at 111 Broadway in lower Manhattan. Waterman filed suits in the federal courts under \u00a7 503, Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1171, on behalf of the \u201cparents\u201d for declaratory judgments that their \u201csons\u201d were citizens. Between mid-1951 and December 24, 1952, the date after which such suits could no longer be brought by reason of the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \u00a7 407, 66 Stat. 281, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note and 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503, 66 Stat. 273, Waterman filed between 50 and 75 such cases referred to him by Sing Kee. Among these were suits in which Horn Wing Gim, Moy Mun Sing and Chin Kung Chee were plaintiffs. Horn Wing Gim and Moy Mun Sing testified that they had sold \u201cslots\u201d and thereafter had made arrangements with Sing Kee in such wise that the jury could well conclude that Sing Kee knew that the passport applications which he caused to be filed in Hong Kong and the civil complaints were fraudulent and false. In the case of Chin Kung Chee the jury could well conclude that Sing Kee knew the complaint to be spurious. On cross-examination all three \u201cfathers\u201d were asked whether they had met and talked with their attorney Waterman. Each of them testified that they had not talked with Waterman but that they had gone to his office, had signed papers, and had dealt with persons other than Waterman.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">\n<em>The Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Sing Kee testified on his own behalf and conceded that he had assisted in bringing in many sons and attempted' to bring in others. He denied knowledge of the fraudulent nature of any of the claims and that he had prepared any halgoons. He claimed that he had received only small sums for expenses, although he admitted that he had netted' $23,000 in 1951 and 1952 after expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Apart from character witnesses, Waterman was the only other defense witness. He testified that the information upon which he had brought the suits involving derivative citizenship claims of Chinese was given him by the fathers, that he had no knowledge of any fraudulent claim and that he had no reason to believe that Sing Kee had any such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">Waterman swore that he had met and talked with Horn Wing Gim, Moy Mun Sing and Chin Kung Chee prior to filing complaints on their behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this respect his testimony conflicted with theirs as they had denied meeting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Waterman testified on cross-examination that the fees he received through Sing Kee were deposited in his checking account in the Trust Company of North America at 115 Broadway and that he kept records of these fees on his check stubs and in the individual case files. The government was then permitted to bring out, over defense objection, that in his testimony before the grand jury Waterman had claimed his Fifth Amendment privilege not to answer questions regarding his fees and records on the ground that the answers might tend to incriminate him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We hold that in the setting of this case, and considering especially the entire examination of Waterman and the weight and significance of his testimony, the relevance of Waterman\u2019s grand jury claim of privilege outweighed the danger that the jury would draw from it any impermissible inference regarding Sing Kee\u2019s guilt of the charges for which he was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">Waterman testified to a relatively minor facet of the ca.se, namely, whether he had or had not talked with the \u201cfathers\u201d before filing suit for them. If on this point the jury disbelieved the three \u201cfathers\u201d that, of course, would cast suspicion on their credibility as to the more important testimony concerning Sing Kee\u2019s guilty knowledge that the \u201csons\u201d were spurious. Waterman\u2019s testimony did not go to the heart of the case; it merely contradicted three witnesses on a minor matter which at best could only raise a question as to their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">Defendant asks us to reverse the convictions on the authority of Grunewald v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931. We do not agree that Gr\u00fcnewald requires reversal under the circumstances of this case. Gr\u00fcnewald requires an <em>ad hoc </em>determination by the trial judge, wherein he must balance two competing considerations in the light of all the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of the case \u2014 the extent to which the prior claim of privilege affects the credibility of the witness and the possible impermissible impact on the jury occasioned by a showing of the prior plea. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion by .permitting the cross-examination of Waterman.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As in Gr\u00fcnewald, the answers given by Waterman on cross-examination at trial were not necessarily inconsistent with the claim of the privilege before the grand jury. Although by themselves his answers to the specific questions did not tend to connect him- with Sing Kee, neither were they exculpatory. Indeed, exculpatory testimony is not necessarily inconsistent with a prior plea of the Fifth Amendment. See United States v. Tomaiolo, 2 Cir., 249 F.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Here, however, there was an inconsistency between Waterman\u2019s answers before the grand jury and the inference raised by his testimony at trial regarding his conduct before the grand jury. Defense counsel questioned Wateiman on direct examination about his appearance before the grand jury, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cQ. By the way, Mr. Waterman, were you a witness before the Grand Jury? A. I was, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cQ. And did you give the Grand Jury the same testimony that you are giving us here, substantially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">A. Well, if I was asked the same questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">\u201cQ. Was the testimony true that you gave to the Grand Jury? A. As far as I know, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">\u201cQ. What I mean is, was it true, as far as you knew? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">\u201cQ. And you had your files with you ? A. I think I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">The answers given by the witness were factually accurate, but they were capable of a much broader interpretation. The defendant would have had the jury believe that Waterman had been a cooperative and candid- .witness before the grand jury, thereby bolstering his credibility. Having brought the conduct of the witness before the grand jury into issue, the defendant cannot now complain that the government was permitted to' develop all that happened so as to rebut an inference which was contrary to fact. The rule enunciated in Gr\u00fcnewald was intended to implement the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination; it was not intended to permit a defendant to draw out part of the facts from a witness while foreclosing the government on cross-examination from developing all the facts so that the partial account is not misleading. Cf. Walder v. United States, 1954, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">But to hold that the plea of the Fifth Amendment was inconsistent with the inference raised by the witness\u2019 testimony on direct examination and hence was material in impeaching his credibility is but half the answer. We must go on to consider the possible impermissible impact on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">Here the crucial question is whether the jury would be likely to equate Waterman\u2019s refusal to answer these few questions, before the grand jury with the defendant\u2019s guilt. If the danger that the jury\u2019s knowledge of the prior plea might have been improperly carried over so as to affect its belief in the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt outweighed the effect on credibility, then evidence of the prior plea should have been excluded. See Travis v. United States, 10 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">We do not believe that, in the circumstances of the case, the dangers of an impermissible impact on the jury were such as to override the considerations justifying admission. Unlike Gr\u00fcnewald, the witness in this case was not a defendant. Since Waterman did not file the civil actions until the passport applications had been administratively denied, his contact with the defendant as to each transaction occurred subsequent to the filing of the fraudulent application. Because his involve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ment in Sing Kee\u2019s activities was merely peripheral, Waterman\u2019s testimony was directed to and conflicted with prosecution testimony only regarding his procedure in filing civil actions. The danger that the jury would believe Sing Kee to be guilty because of his association with Waterman, who had pleaded the Fifth Amendment, was minimal. As it was, the trial judge immediately instructed the jury that the raising of this issue was \u201cnot in any way to reflect upon the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was not the kind of intimate relationship between Waterman and Sing Kee which might cause the jury to consider the actions of one the actions of the other. See United States v. Tomaiolo, supra, where the witness who pleaded the Fifth Amendment was the defendant\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The thrust of the questions which Waterman had previously refused to answer was even more remote from the heart of the case than Waterman\u2019s contradictions of the testimony of the three prosecution witnesses. Unlike United States v. Tomaiolo, supra, the questions were not so intimately related to the details of the crime that a jury, coupling the answers at trial with the prior plea, would be likely improperly to infer facts directly bearing on defendant\u2019s participation in the crimes charged. Even if the jury had equated Waterman\u2019s prior plea with his guilt of a criminal act, it does not follow that it would go on to infer that the criminal acts involved Sing Kee. Much evidence was introduced to establish what Sing Kee was paid \u2022 and the moneys he disbursed in handling passport matters and most of this was not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The questions which Waterman refused to answer related to his handling of his personal funds after receipt from the defendant, an inquiry without direct bearing on Sing Kee\u2019s knowledge of the spurious nature of the claims, and Waterman had freely testified to his relationship with Sing Kee. The possible reasons for Waterman refusing to divulge facts regarding his handling of his personal finances were so varied<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that, in our opinion, there was not a substantial likelihood, under all the circumstances here attendant, that the jury would indulge in speculations which would result in their equating the witness\u2019 refusal to testify with the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Sing Kee complains of two other matters as constituting error, both of which we fmd without merit. On his cross-examination he was questioned from tax returns submitted by him for the years 1951 and 1952, the returns being used to refresh his recollection. At that time appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the use of the returns on the ground that they could be used only in an income tax case. This objection was properly overruled. Lewy v. United States, 7 Cir., 1928, 29 F.2d 462, 62 A.L.R. 388, certiorari denied 279 U.S. 850, 49 S.Ct. 346, 73 L.Ed. 993; United States v. Rollnick, 2 Cir., 1937, 91 F.2d 911, 918. It is now urged that the government failed to show that the returns had been obtained in accordance with 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6103 (a) and 26 CFR 601.702 (1956), 26 CFR 458.204 (1939). The government was never asked to produce such authorization at trial, but the government asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>that it was prepared to do so if the point had been raised. When the trial judge correctly overrules a specific objection, it cannot be argued on appeal that the evidence, or, as here, the use of returns to refresh recollection, was improper for a different reason. Norwood v. Great American Indemnity Co., 3 Cir., 1944, 146 F.2d 797. Such an afterthought deserves no attention, especially where it is apparent that the government could have satisfied the court as to the ground now belatedly urged.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Appellant also charges that there was a variance between the indictment and proof, since the evidence disclosed six separate conspiracies rather than one. Even if we assume that such a variance exists, it is not fatal to the conviction as it did not affect the substantial rights of the accused. Berger v. United States, 1935, 295 U.S. 78, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314. This is not a situation where a defendant involved in one conspiracy has been convicted in a mass trial encompassing numerous other conspiracies involving matters and persons entirely unknown to him; nor are there any questions relating to the admission of statements by alleged co-conspirators as in Kotteakos v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557. Here Sing Kee was the only defendant; he was the key figure in all that transpired. Since the principal government witnesses are named in the conspiracy count and since four of the transactions served as bases for the other counts, it is evident that the defense was not taken by surprise by the evidence at trial. Nor is there any danger of another prosecution for the same offense. See Berger v. United States, supra. Thus there is no merit to Sing Kee\u2019s claim of error on the ground that the proof showed numerous conspiracies rather than one. Monroe v. United States, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 234 F.2d 49; Quirk v. United States, 8 Cir., 1947, 161 F.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. In his testimony before the grand jury Waterman was not sure whether he had discussed their cases with Horn Wing Gim, Moy Mun Sing and Chin Kung Chee. At the trial he testified that he had refreshed his recollection after his grand jury appearance and he remembered going over the details with them before drawing up the complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">.

The defendant requested no further charge to the jury on this point and none was given. Under these circumstances it was not required that tiie judge instruct the jury again in the charge, but it seems to us that sucli a charge would have been desirable to make sure that the jury clearly understood the limited purpose of the fact that a witness had previously pleaded the Fifth Amendment to certain questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">.
