H. Bull Steamship Co. brought suit below against the defendant unions seeking injunctive relief and damages for alleged breaches of collective bargaining agreements between plaintiff and each defendant. Bull alleged that the court had jurisdiction of the action as a case arising under \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and by reason of the diversity of citizenship of the parties. At the outset of the action Bull0 moved for an injunction <em>pendente lite </em>restraining the unions from continuing peaceful strikes then in progress and requiring them to furnish plaintiff with qualified licensed officers. These strikes and defendants\u2019 failure to provide personnel constitute the alleged breaches of contract. The defendants moved to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction. The trial court heard the motions on affidavits and briefs, and determined that Bull\u2019s allegations of jurisdiction raised a substantial federal question. It denied defendants\u2019 motions and issued an extensive injunction <em>pendente lite.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Its opinion is reported in D.C.E.D.N.Y., 156 F.Supp. 190. Both unions appeal from the orders and contend that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>had no jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The facts are largely undisputed. Bull, a Delaware corporation, is an operator of ships engaged in interstate and foreign commerce. National Marine Engineers\u2019 Beneficial Association, AFL-CIO (MEBA), an unincorporated association, represents licensed engineering officers aboard Bull\u2019s ships. International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, AFL-CIO (MM&amp;P), a New York membership corporation, represents licensed deck officers, other than masters, aboard these ships. Bull and MEBA entered into a collective bargaining agreement on June 18, 1955, which will expire on June 15, 1958. Bull and MM&amp;P entered into a similar agreement on July 1, 1955, which runs until September 30, 1958. Both agreements provide that \u201c[t]here shall be no strikes, lockouts, or stoppages of work during the period of this agreement.\u201d Both agreements also provide for wage reviews after the first anniversary dates of the agreements. After the first anniversary dates each defendant notified Bull that it wished to renegotiate wages. Negotiations took place, but were unsuccessful; and on August 19, 1957, both unions called peaceful strikes to enforce their demands. The peaceful strikes continued until the trial court issued its order. The parties disagree whether or not these strikes constitute breaches of the contracts, the controversy mainly concerning whether or not the no-strike clauses are applicable to the wage-reopening clauses. Except to the limited extent discussed below, we find it unnecessary to ascertain whether or not the strikes actually constituted breaches of the contracts, since, even if they did, the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Our recent decision in A. H. Bull Steamship Co. v. Seafarers\u2019 International Union of North America, 2 Cir., 250 F.2d 326 (practically a companion case to this one) is in nearly all respects dis-positive of this case. For, as we explain below, here also the issuance of an injunction is forbidden by the Norris-La-Guardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. Before reaching that point, however, we must examine the trial court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Bull alleged in its complaint that the trial court had jurisdiction of the action as a case arising under \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and by reason of the diversity of citizenship of the parties. We first address ourselves to these allegations as they concern MEBA. MEBA is an unincorporated association, and all of its members must be citizens of states other than Delaware for diversity of citizenship to exist between it and Bull. Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 2 Cir., 61 F.2d 115, affirmed 289 U.S. 103, 53 S.Ct. 549, 77 L.Ed. 1062; Hettenbaugh v. Airline Pilots Ass\u2019n International, 5 Cir., 189 F.2d 319. But the trial court did not premise its jurisdiction to issue the injunction on diversity grounds, for it found evidence that members of MEBA reside in the State of Delaware. Rather, it held that Bull\u2019s complaint presented a substantial question of federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, which it could not decide until assuming jurisdiction over the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The substantial question involves an interpretation of \u00a7 301(a). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201cSuits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce * * * may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">MEBA contends that its collective bargaining contract with Bull is not a contract \u201cbetween an employer and a labor organization representing employees,\u201d and thus \u00a7 301 does not give the district court jurisdiction to entertain the action. The Union maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>that all its members employed by Bull are \u201csupervisors\u201d and not \u201cemployees\u201d as defined in the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, it contends that it is not a \u201clabor organization\u201d as defined in the Act, because it does not represent statutory \u201cemployees.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If MEBA\u2019s factual allegations are correct, \u00a7 301 by its own terms is inapplicable to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The substantial question thus resolves itself into one of fact: Are the members of MEBA covered by the collective bargaining contract with Bull \u201csupervisors\u201d within the definitions of the Act? If they are \u201csupervisors,\u201d then MEBA is not a \u201clabor organization representing employees\u201d for the purposes of this action. This result follows even if some members of MEBA outside of this bargaining unit are \u201cemployees.\u201d Section 2(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (5), defines a \u201clabor organization\u201d as \u201cany organization * * * in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose * * * of dealing with employers concerning * * * conditions of work.\u201d In order to. effectuate Congress\u2019 avowed intention to remove supervisors from the protections of the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this definition must be interpreted to mean an organization of \u201cemployees\u201d covered by the collective bargaining agreement in question and which exists for the purpose of dealing with <em>their </em>employer. Otherwise individuals excluded by the Act could join unions which represent some \u201cemployees\u201d and gain the protections of the Act. Thus if MEBA were classified as a \u201clabor organization\u201d for purposes of this action simply because some of its members who are not within this bargaining unit are statutory \u201cemployees,\u201d then supervisors could gain the protections of the Act by joining either vertically integrated unions or unions which, in some parts of the country, represent nonsupervisory personnel. This result was not intended by Congress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The trial court had extensive evidence before it on this question of fact. This evidence included affidavits of MEBA officials testifying that MEBA\u2019s members are supervisors and Bull\u2019s allegations in the state court proceeding that \u201c[T]he classifications of persons represented by the MM&amp;P and MEBA being supervisory personnel, the said picketing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>is not the result of a labor dispute as that term is defined in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended.\u201d In addition, as discussed below, the trial court held the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq., inapplicable to this case because it was a dispute between an employer and supervisors (not \u201cemployees\u201d). It is difficult for us to see how MEBA\u2019s members can be \u201csupervisors\u201d for purposes of the Norris-La-Guardia Act, and \u201cemployees\u201d for purposes of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The trial court nevertheless decided to defer its factual determination of the jurisdictional issue until another time. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims that in various prior proceedings the defendant MEBA made admissions that it was a \u2018labor organization,\u2019 while, on the other hand, the said defendant challenges those statements or their effect and alleges that the individuals are \u2018supervisors,\u2019 within the meaning of the Act. As to the present application, it is not necessary to adjudicate these issues, other than to find, as this Court does find that the plaintiff presents a substantial Federal question and that this Court can decide the matter only after it has assumed jurisdiction over the controversy. The complaint herein alleges the violation of a single right, the right to have its agreement performed and a single claim for relief. Under these circumstances, the Court assumes jurisdiction of the action. Strachman v. Palmer, 1 Cir., 177 F.2d 427, 12 A.L.R.2d 687; Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148; and Brown v. Haldale Estates, Inc., D.C., 151 F.Supp. 118.\u201d D.C.E.D.N.Y., 156 F.Supp. 190, 192.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148, and Strachman v. Palmer, 1 Cir., 177 F.2d 427, 12 A.L.R. 2d 687, involve the doctrine of \u201cpendent jurisdiction.\u201d Those cases hold that, where a federal court in disposing of a federal ground for relief hears evidence concerning the merits of a similar non-federal ground not otherwise subject to its jurisdiction, the court may dispose of the non-federal grounds. The doctrine finds its justification in avoiding wasteful relitigation of essentially the same issues, thereby serving the convenience of both the parties and the courts. But there is no such saving where, as here, there has been no trial on the merits and the doctrine is resorted to as a means of drawing wide areas of state law into federal cognizance for the issuance of labor injunctions on affidavits, contrary to federal principles. Although Bull argues for just such an extension of federal jurisdiction, it must be said that the trial court (beyond citing the two cases as above) never goes so far and nowhere indicates that it issued the preliminary injunction on some separate state ground supporting the relief. It only goes so far as to hold that where a breach of contract exists it may enjoin the breach <em>pendente lite </em>and defer deciding questions of its jurisdiction until trial. But even, this we hold to be stepping outside its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\"> Undoubtedly, in a proper non-labor case, a federal court may issue a preliminary injunction pending its determination of a substantial question of federal jurisdiction of the action. If this were not so a court would be powerless to maintain the <em>status quo </em>in a proper case due solely to defendant\u2019s attack on its jurisdiction. But substantial probability that the court will find a basis for federal jurisdiction, like the probability of a plaintiff\u2019s final success on the merits, is a crucial element necessary to justify the issuance of an injunction <em>pendente </em>lite.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here (postponing for a moment any consideration of the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act) it appears quite likely that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>court below has no jurisdiction under \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, for the supervisory status of the MEBA employees of Bull is well established in the pleadings, affidavits, and briefs below. And where the probability of jurisdiction is doubtful, the only justification for issuing the preliminary injunction is that Bull will suffer irreparable harm from a maintenance of the <em>status quo </em>during the period necessary to determine the jurisdictional question which far outweighs the possible harm to MEBA and the expressed public policy forbidding federal courts to issue labor injunctions. This possibility is not shown here. In fact Bull\u2019s delay in seeking this relief controverts the probability of irreparable harm during the few days it might take the trial court to resolve the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The foregoing discussion applies in the case of MM&amp;P to the extent that the trial court rested the injunction against it on the probability of jurisdiction under \u00a7 301. Bull now strives to sustain the injunction on state grounds. But since we hold that the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibited the issuance of this injunction we shall not here comment on the propriety of applying state substan-five rules to this controversy if jurisdiction is rested on the diverse citizenship of Bull and MM&amp;P.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The Norris-LaGuardia Act \u00a7 4, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104, prohibits the district court from issuing the injunction herein, for this is a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute as defined in \u00a7 13 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And Congress, in \u00a7 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, did not impliedly repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act to the extent that federal courts may now enjoin breaches of no-strike clauses in collective bargaining contracts. See our full discussion of this issue in A. H. Bull Steamship Co. v. Seafarers\u2019 International Union of North America, 2 Cir., 250 F.2d 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\"> Bull argues, and the court below held, that \u00a7 14(a) of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(a), makes the Norris-LaGuardia Act inapplicable to cases involving employers and their supervisory employees. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">\u201cNothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>but no employer subject to this sub-chapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Section 14(a) makes no explicit reference to the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The clause \u201cno employer subject to this sub-chapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining\u201d contained in \u00a7 14(a) obviously does not relate to the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which prohibits federal injunctions in labor dispute cases, whether the dispute is between employers and employees, employers and employers, or employees and employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a). The legislative history of \u00a7 14 (a) makes it clear that Congress intended the quoted clause to describe statutes which require employers to bargain collectively or be guilty of an unfair labor practice or its state law equivalent. The whole thrust of the supervisor provisions in the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 was to remove supervisors from the operation of the National Labor Relations Act and return them \u201cto the basis which they enjoyed before the passage of the Wagner Act.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And no mention is made in the statute, the reports, or the congressional debate indicating that the Norris-La-Guardia Act was henceforth to be inapplicable to peaceful strikes by supervisory personnel. Moreover, contrary to Bull\u2019s contentions, denying the injunction on the basis of the Norris-La-Guardia Act does not compel Bull to bargain collectively with its supervisors in contradiction of the purpose of \u00a7 14 (a). Bull can refuse to bargain, discharge the supervisors, and be guilty of no unfair labor practice or conduct proscribed by any other law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Order reversed; action remanded for proceedings by the district court consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">.
