The case was heard by the District Judge without a jury and the evidence was amply sufficient to sustain the conviction. The only question of any substance presented by the appeal is whether the trial judge properly received in evidence testimony as to a conversation between the accused and an informer, which was heard by a police officer listening in on an extension telephone with the knowledge of the informer. Under the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Rathbun v. United States, 78 S.Ct. 161, it is clear that the evidence was properly admitted. Other questions raised in the brief of appellant are so manifestly lacking in merit as not to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
