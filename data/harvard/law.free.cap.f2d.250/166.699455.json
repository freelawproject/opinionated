(referred to as \u201cthe Foundation\u201d) brought this action against Donald R. Moysey, individually and as District Director, Internal Revenue Service, seeking a \u201cjudgment declaratory of its rights under said Constitution [the Constitution of the United States] pursuant to United States Code, Title 28, Section 2201,\u201d i.e., the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act. More specifically the Foundation prays for a decree that the Director has wrongfully and unlawfully deprived the Foundation of its property \u201cby his exclusion of plaintiff\u2019s name from the list of organizations entitled * * * to the privilege of tax exemption.\u201d The government moved to dismiss the complaint (1) for failure to state a claim and (2) for lack of jurisdiction \u201cbecause the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment with respect to Federal taxes as prohibited by Title 28, United States Code, Section 2201.\u201d The district court granted the motion to dismiss. The Foundation appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The Foundation was organized on December 19, 1944 under the New York Membership Corporations Law primarily to assist individuals or organizations working for the relief \u201cof the people of Poland, China and other countries affected by War.\u201d On November 4, 1947 the Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that the Foundation was \u201cexempt from Federal income tax under the provisions of section 101(6) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101(6)] * * * as it is shown that you are organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d The Deputy Commissioner also advised the Foundation that it would \u201cnot be required to file income tax returns unless you change the character of your organization, the purposes for which you were organized, or your method of operation.\u201d Any such change was to be reported so that its effect on the exempt status might be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">On August 6, 1952 the Foundation, through its attorneys, notified the New York Collector\u2019s office that on May 19, 1952 it had filed a \u201cCertificate of Change of Purposes\u201d adding a purpose, in substance, to distribute to individuals, schools and libraries, books, pamphlets and other literature relating to historical matters, current events, civics, foreign policies and similar subjects and asked for confirmation that this additional purpose did not affect its tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">On November 10, 1952 the Assistant Commissioner advised the Foundation that its exempt status was terminated because \u201cthere has been a material change in your form of organization\u201d but offered to \u201cgive further consideration to your status for Federal income tax purposes after you have actively operated for a year under the amendment of your charter\u201d and outlined the form of statement required for a reconsideration of the Foundation\u2019s compliance with Section 101(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Subsequently, application having been made by the Foundation, the Acting Assistant Commissioner ruled that an analysis of the information submitted disclosed that the activities of the Foundation since May 19, 1952 \u201care not exclusively charitable or educational within the intendment of section 501(c) (3) of the Code of 1954\u201d and that \u201cyou are not exempt from Federal income tax under that section of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>After some further correspondence in which counsel for the Foundation indicated that no judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s rulings was permissible and that \u201c[t]he statutory remedy consists in the long and dilatory processes of assessment, conferences, appeals to the Tax Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals, and eventually through writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The Foundation is asking this Court to declare that it should have a tax-exempt status both now and in the future. In effect such a decree would operate as a mandamus against the Commissioner to compel him to reverse his position based upon the activities of the Foundation already held not to come within the exemption of Section 101(6). It is clear that the district court was without general original jurisdiction to issue an order compelling a public official to act with respect to his official duties. Wilson v. Wilson, 4 Cir., 1944, 141 F.2d 599; Youngblood v. United States, 6 Cir., 1944, 141 F.2d 912; Marshall v. Crotty, 1 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> Quite apart from the question of whether there is an \u201cactual controversy\u201d and the express exception in the Declaratory Judgment Act removing from the courts the power to declare rights \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes,\u201d the court cannot presume to speak for the Commissioner or take over his duty to pass upon the tax status of organizations applying for exemption. His duty is to decide whether the particular activities submitted to him justify exemption. He cannot be foreclosed by declaratory judgment from reviewing the purposes and activities of applicants for exempt status when and as they are presented to him for decision. The Foundation\u2019s own case illustrates the situation. In 1947 the facts warranted exemption; in 1952 a changed purpose brought termination. Its history and activities in 1954 did not produce any change of ruling but the Foundation may still avail itself of the right to show any change of activities and again seek exemption. A declaratory judgment upon the facts here set forth would serve no purpose. Nor is it the function of the courts to decide hypothetical future cases not yet in being. No judgment herein could be held to pre-ad-judicate the issue of the Foundation\u2019s status for the future, thus stripping the Internal Revenue Service of its power to pass upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">No tax has been assessed against the Foundation or even threatened. Thus there is no actual controversy between the Foundation and the District Director. The complaint mentions a donor who had to pay a gift tax on a donation. Had the donor chosen to contest the tax, the law afforded him procedural methods to litigate the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Regardless of the many forms of relief sought and the lengthy recital of assumed violations of constitutional rights the Foundation\u2019s action is \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes.\u201d In this field the courts have no jurisdiction to enter declaratory judgments. Taylor v. Allan, 10 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 485; Noland v. Westover, 9 Cir., 1949, 172 F.2d 614, certiorari denied 337 U.S. 938, 69 S.Ct. 1515, 93 L.Ed. 1744; Wilson v. Wilson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The so-called exemption list, exclusion from which the Foundation claims amounts to an unlawful deprivation of property, is merely a record of those entitled to an exempt status. The items of injunctive relief sought as to the list and in other respects are as the court below correctly stated \u201cmerely details in execution of the declaratory judgment sought and equally outside the scope of this court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d The eases cited by the Foundation as creating a doctrine of exceptional circumstances all involve radically different fact situations not applicable or persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The Foundation has been deprived of no constitutional rights despite its elaborate arguments to the contrary. If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tax is assessed both the Foundation and prospective donors are afforded appropriate procedural remedies to test the exempt nature of the organization upon the facts as they then may exist. See Bendheim v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 26. The Foundation by Procrustean methods is endeavoring to make .its disagreement with the Commissioner fit into a remedy wholly inappropriate .to the situation. This it cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
