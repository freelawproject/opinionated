Hogan &amp; Sons to recover from the vessel owner injuries sustained by him when he fell from a ladder while ascending from No. 2 hatch where he had been working.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff has appealed, and the defendant has taken a protective appeal against T. Hogan &amp; Sons, the third party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The sole question presented is whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence which appellant\u2019s counsel claims violated a pretrial stipulation between plaintiff and defendant. This stipulation was to the effect that Hogan\u2019s employees used grease in the hold where plaintiff was working before his accident. Prior to the second trial the plaintiff limited his claim to unseaworthiness because of grease, also referred to as saddle soap, on the rungs of the ladder leading from No. 2 hold to the main deck. The pretrial order established the issues between plaintiff and defendant to be: (1) Was there grease on the ladder rungs? (2) If so, what was the source of it? (3) Did plaintiff fall because of grease or as the result of his own carelessness? Several of plaintiff\u2019s fellow-workers testified that there was no grease on the ladder and that no saddle soap was used in the hold. This is the evidence appellant says was wrongly admitted. Judge Weinfeld correctly ruled that the stipulation did not cover grease on the ladder but only the use of grease in the hold. Denial of the use of saddle soap in the hold was first brought out by appellant himself on the cross examination of defendant\u2019s witness Ellis Tucker. As to this the court ruled that the testimony could not be used against United but only against Hogan, since Hogan was not a party to the stipulation; and Mr. Rassner expressed satisfaction with the ruling. There is no merit in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A9q\">.
