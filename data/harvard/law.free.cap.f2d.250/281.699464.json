Fulton was convicted in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas on two indictments for unlawfully breaking into and entering the United States Post Offices at Abilene and at Putnam, Texas and with stealing money of the United States from these post offices. On the Abilene indictment he was sentenced to five years imprisonment on each of two counts, the sentence on the second count \u201cto run consecutively with\u201d the sentence on the first count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the Putnam indictment he was sentenced to five years imprisonment \u201cto run consecutively with\u201d the sentence imposed under the conviction on the Abilene indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">This appeal raises the question: Do the words <em>\u201crun consecutively with\u201d </em>in the Putnam judgment clearly require the prisoner to serve a second term after serving the sentence imposed in the Abilene judgment? Fulton argues that the words <em>\u201cconsecutively\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cwith\u201d </em>may be clear enough when standing alone or when used separately in other combinations of words, but that they defeat each other when they are placed side by side. He contends that in juxtaposition \u201cconsecutively\u201d and \u201cwith\u201d mean, if anything, \u201cconcurrently with\u201d. He moved for clarification of the sentence in the Putnam case and now appeals from denial of that motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Precisely the same question came up in Hiatt v. Ellis, 5 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 119. This Court distinguished United States ex rel. Chasteen v. Denemark, 7 Cir., 1943, 138 F.2d 289, relied on by appellant, and held that <em>\u201cconsecutively with\u201d </em>was unambiguous. In Hiatt v. Ellis, supra, Judge Hutcheson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\">\u201cThe word \u2018consecutive\u2019 used in the sentence, according to its primary dictionary definition, denotes \u2018following in a train, succeeding one another in a regular order\u2019. The word \u2018with\u2019 which follows it in the sentence denotes primarily \u2018a relation of contact or association\u2019. The idea put forward by the petitioner and adopted by the court, that the use of \u2018with\u2019 instead of \u2018to\u2019 makes the order ambiguous and renders it ineffective, will not do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-19\">\u201cIt would be difficult to choose two words better able than the words employed here to put in brief compass the idea of cumulative service, the service of one sentence following in the train of, succeeding, the other sentence referred to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-20\">\u201cConsecutive with\u201d may be infelicitous. It may offend purists in the art of using prepositions idiomatically. But it is not a riddle. It is not illogical. It is not uncertain. It is not ungrammatical. American-English has wide play in the joints, and a predilection for a particular preposition to express a relationship may go against usage if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the choice of preposition results in meaningful language. Either \u201cto\u201d or \u201cwith\u201d would show that there is a relation between the two sentences of imprisonment. What that relation is, is embodied in the meaning of \u201cconsecutive\u201d. \u201cConsecutive\u201d sentences can mean only a close and uninterrupted sequence of sentences. The distinguished district judge\u2019s language is clear and definite and technically correct. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A3N\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\">. April 20, I960 the term on the second count was reduced to three years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\">. If this case were a suit on a contract turning on the meaning of \u201cconsecutively with\u201d, we would be inclined to dismiss the appeal as box-dering on the frivolous. But we have considered this appeal very carefully, because Fulton faces further yeax-s of impx-isonnxent if the appeal is dismissed. The original judgments were rendered October S, 1946. Defendant served the sentences imposed in these cases, less time fox- good behaviox-, but is confined undex- another court\u2019s sentence for another offense. He is faced with a detainer warrant placed by the United States Board of Paroles for vio- - lation of his conditional release, compelling him to serve the time off for good behavior earned on the sentences in the Abilene and Putnam cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
