At that time payments ceased because Talbert reported expected earnings of over $1,200 a year \u2014 the statutory maximum. Talbert, in a series of letters, contended that under the Act these earnings were exempt and should not be considered in determining excess earnings. This contention was rejected by the Social Security Administration. On June 2, 1955, the Chief of the New York Area Office of the Board of Old Age and Survivors Insurance wrote Talbert rejecting his request for reconsideration and informed him that he might request a hearing within three months of the date of the letter. Over nine months later Talbert filed a request for a hearing which was denied for untimeliness under a regulation of the Social Security Administration which required that such a request be filed \u201cwithin 3 months after the date of mailing notice of the reconsidered determination, except where the time is extended,\u201d 20 CFR \u00a7 403.709(b) (2). Later, Talbert\u2019s request for an extension of time was denied for failure to show good cause. On July 27, 1956, Tal-bert brought this action to require a hearing or in the alternative to direct the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to pay plaintiff. On August 1, 1956, Congress passed an amendment to \u00a7 205 (b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b), which in effect extended Talbert\u2019s time to file a request for a hearing until February 1, 1957. On October 25, 1956, the government made a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted without opinion, and Talbert appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The simple answer to Talbert\u2019s contention is that he has so far failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as contemplated and required by the Social Security Act \u00a7 205(b), (g), and (h), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b), (g), and (h). Any question concerning whether or not he was properly given time to apply for an administrative hearing is now foreclosed by the change in statute which afforded him opportunity to apply, not expiring until after the decision below. Indeed the information disclosed in his reply brief of his timely application which only awaits a determination of this action shows that this avenue is still open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
