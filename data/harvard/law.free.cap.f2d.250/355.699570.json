United States, 6 Cir., 148 F.2d 325, intent was crucial. Proof of false entries in 109 prior incidents in which purchasers were listed by fictitious names was relevant to establish intent, motive, design, purpose and practice as the effect and purpose of the two acts (failure to make entries or making false entries) is the same \u2014 to create an incorrect and unreliable record for the Government\u2019s use. Such evidence is admissible for that purpose. Lindsey v. United States, 5 Cir., 227 F.2d 113, 117; Ehrlich v. United States, 5 Cir., 238 F.2d 481, 484, and its use does not make it a trial and conviction for offenses not charged. In view of this, we need not determine whether, as claimed, this evidence came in out of turn as an unauthorized anticipation by the Government of a plea of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">To prove that in the 109 incidents of sales in 23 cities and towns, the entries falsely listed a fictitious purchaser, the agent testified that in his investigation in each city he checked with the police department, the sheriff\u2019s office, public utilties, chamber of commerce, telephone and business directories and talked to local residents, but he was unable to find or locate any one of them, or learn from any source that such person was known to exist. This was proof of a negative fact \u2014 the nonexistence of the purchasers, and the evidence was not inadmissible hearsay, Nichols v. United States, 5 Cir., 48 F.2d 46 (and see, citing this case, Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., \u00a7 664, note 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">The contention that a judgment of acquittal was due because \u00a7 5621 prescribes that \u201cEvery * * * wholesale liquor dealer who refuses or neglects to keep the records required under sections * * * 5114(a) in the form prescribed * * * or to make <em>entries therein </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>* * so that there must be a case of an omission of <em>entries </em>(and not merely a single entry covering a single sale) on the confessed theory that \u201cevery dog is entitled to his first bite\u201d is a patent abuse of literalism, United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345, 1350, and warrants no further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">If entrapment was in the case, and the doubt is great since the inducement (if any) was for the <em>sale </em>of the wine, not the clerical failure to make a subsequent entry, it was certainly not there as a matter of law. Conduct and statements of the appellant show both his conscious knowledge of illegal sales, and the stealth by which he sought to protect himself, his \u201crunners\u201d and his customers from detection or arrest. It was for the jury, on adequate instructions nowhere complained of, to determine whether an innocent person was led into crime by a Government agent. Their answer was plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
