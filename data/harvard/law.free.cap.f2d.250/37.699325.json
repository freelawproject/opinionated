Appellant pleaded guilty to, an indictment charging bank robbery and that in perpetrating the robbery he put in. jeopardy the lives of named persons \u201cby the use of a dangerous weapon\u201d. He was-sentenced to a term of twenty-five years, imprisonment and to pay a fine of $10,-000. He complains of this sentence on the ground that the \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon was not more specifically described in the indictment. The point is without merit for reasons adequately stated in the opinion of the District Judge. United States v. McGann, 150 F.Supp. 463. The crime was charged in the language of the statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d)); and it is well settled that this is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
