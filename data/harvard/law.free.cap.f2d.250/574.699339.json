The factual situation should be fully developed through the usual trial procedure in the District Court, instead of summary judgment proceedings. Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co., 334 U.S. 249, 256-257, 68 S.Ct. 1031, 92 L.Ed. 1347; Stevens v. Howard D. Johnson Co., 4 Cir., 181 F.2d 390, 394; Estepp v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., 6 Cir., 192 F.2d 889; Hoy v. Progress Pattern Co., 6 Cir., 217 F.2d 701, 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
