The Code section reads as f ollows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-12\">\u201cAny person required under this chapter to collect, account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this chapter, who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, and any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Appellant urged many alleged errors at the trial which would require a vacation of the judgment of conviction, with a remand for a new trial. The government, in its brief, did not undertake to controvert some of these points and, in effect, conceded that appellant was entitled to a new trial. Accordingly, these points were not discussed by counsel at the oral argument; and in view of the government\u2019s concession we shall not discuss such alleged errors in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Appellant also urged that the district judge was in error in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal \u201con the ground that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction for the offence charged in the indictment.\u201d Since, in appellant\u2019s view, he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal at the trial, he urges us, in vacating the judgment of conviction, to send the case back to the district court with a direction to do what he should have done at the trial, namely, to enter a judgment of acquittal, thereby terminating the prosecution finally in the accused\u2019s favor. Such point the government vigorously contested, and the argument before us revolved entirely about this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">Of course, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(b), the government had to show something more than that the taxpayer was deficient in payment of taxes lawfully due; it had to satisfy the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the taxpayer\u2019s understatements of his income were deliberately made in a \u201cwillful\u201d attempt to evade taxes due. In order to narrow the factual issues, and to assist the accused in the preparation of his defense, defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars, in which the government was asked to state \u201cthe specific item or items with respect to which the defendant\u2019s returns were false and fraudulent as alleged in the Indictment.\u201d To that inquiry the government\u2019s reply was: \u201cOn each return the defendant claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>exemptions for dependents, to which exemptions he was not entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">At the trial the government made no effort to prove that the taxpayer had claimed exemptions to which he was not entitled. Instead, the government concentrated on introducing evidence tending to show that the taxpayer had willfully failed to report taxable income in the form of dividends and capital gains which he had knowingly derived from a running account he had with the brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. It does not appear that counsel for defendant ever claimed surprise at this shifting of the government\u2019s position, and the Kidder, Peabody account was dealt with at length both in the arguments of counsel and in the charge to the jury. If it were reversible error for the trial judge not to have required the government to confine its proof to the willful evasions asserted in its answer to the bill of particulars, of course the most that appellant could hope to obtain on that score would be a reversal for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">In vacating the judgment of \u2022 conviction, there are two reasons why we have decided not to direct the entry of a judgment of acquittal:</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">(1) We think that there was sufficient evidence of willfulness, as charged in the indictment, in the failure of appellant to report as income any of the dividends or capital gains derived from the Kidder, Peabody account. The jury must have disbelieved appellant\u2019s explanation that he, who posed as a \u201ctax consultant\u201d, thought that none of this was reportable income until he \u201creceived\u201d it by actually withdrawing it from the Kidder, Peabody account, especially in view of the fact that when he did draw three checks on the account, in the total amount of $5,000.00, he did not report any of that either, or make any effort to ascertain how much of the $5,000.00 might represent income and how much might be a possible return of capital. We need not rehearse other reinforcing circumstances appearing in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">(2) Even if we thought that the motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted, it is clearly not mandatory on us as an appellate court, though it is within our power, to direct the district court to enter a judgment of acquittal. See Bryan v. United States, 1950, 338 U.S. 552, 70 S.Ct. 317, 94 L.Ed. 335. See also, Yates v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 298, 327 et seq., 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356. Sometimes it may be thought that the government could easily supply missing elements of proof at a second trial, and that a direction for a new trial \u201cmay be just under the circumstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. We think that it is so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">A judgment will be entered vacating the judgment of the District Court, and remanding the case to that Court with direction for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
