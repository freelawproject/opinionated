Appellant was arraigned in August of 1953 in the District Court under three indictments: one charged housebreaking and larceny; the other two charged, each in two counts, forgery and uttering. Appellant was asked to plead and responded \u201cguilty.\u201d Shortly thereafter the arraigning judge in the District Court appointed counsel and stated: \u201cIf you find the pleas inconsistent with the facts, will you report the matter to the Court.\u201d Some thirty minutes later counsel reported to the judge that he had discussed the cases with appellant and his co-defendant and had concluded: \u201cI am of the opinion that the pleas of guilty should stand.\u201d Three weeks later, early on the day the appellant was to be sentenced (before a different judge), he notified his court-appointed counsel that he did not wish to plead guilty. Counsel reported this to the sentencing judge, not in open court but at the bench, and this colloquy followed :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-21\">\u201cThe Court: If you find any facts that indicate he isn\u2019t guilty, file a formal motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cMr. Schubert: Your Honor, I have been all over this thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201cThe Court: Let him tell you. These people can\u2019t come in here and plead guilty and after having long records and knowing exactly what they are doing, and then ask to set them aside just because they don\u2019t want to be sentenced at the last minute, and take a chance on trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201cI get your position. Judge Kirkland asked you to do it. If you find, or he is able to produce any tangible evidence, file a motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cMr. Schubert: I have something, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cThe Court: What have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201cMr. Schubert: He has told me that in 1945 his skull was fractured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, we can check into that, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">\u201cMr. Schubert: That he has suffered with severe headaches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">\u201cThe Court: You can still do it. You have got two months after I sentence for me to set it aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-12\">\u201cMr. Schubert: I will request an examination for him down at the jail. At that time, if there is such evidence, if there should be a trial in the case, I don\u2019t feel I am in a position\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-13\">\u201cThe Court: It hasn\u2019t been set aside yet. I will sentence him. Let him start on his time, and if you find any tangible evidence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">\u201cMr. Schubert: I will certainly be glad to be diligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-15\">\u201cThe Court: I appreciate your position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">The court then sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment, which he is still serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">About three years later appellant filed <em>;pro se </em>a motion for relief under Section 2255, alleging principally that he was insane at the time the alleged crimes were committed and that he had not received the effective assistance of counsel. The motion was denied without hearing and we allowed this appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">When the District Court denied the motion to vacate, it certified, in a manner similar to that approved in Adams v. United States, 1955, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 357, 222 F.2d 45, 48:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-20\">\u201cUpon consideration of defendant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence, it appearing to the Court that the files and records of the case conclusively show that defendant is entitled to no relief, it is by the Court this 18th day of February, 1957,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avq-dedup-1\">\u201cOrdered that said motion to vacate sentence be and hereby is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-21\">But, when the District Court so certified, essential parts of \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case\u201d now before us \u2014 namely, the transcripts of the plea and the proceedings in connection with the imposition of sentence \u2014 were not before the District Court. Those transcripts were not prepared and filed in the District Court until they were ordered by this court to assist it in making appropriate disposition of appellant\u2019s application to this court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis from the denial of relief under Section 2255. (See per curiam order dated May 17, 1957, Misc. No. 780.) Thus, the District Court did not have before it the materials that should, in every case, be included in \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Without examination of all of the materials prescribed by Section 2255 there could be no conclusive showing that appellant was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-22\">I. Cases and motions under Section 2255 have frequently presented to us the procedural difficulties here encountered. All too often the record reaching this court has failed to include essential materials. It is quite evident that Congress, when it spoke of \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case,\u201d contemplated a larger record than has heretofore been used by the District Court of this District, at least in many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>instances. The basic legislation is the Court Reporters Act, 58 Stat. 5 (1944), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753 (1952). That Act followed extended effort by the bench and bar to obtain a regular system of court reporters. The long-felt need for a verbatim record of all court proceedings, particularly in criminal cases, was highlighted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Miller v. United States, 1942, 317 U.S. 192, 63 S.Ct. 187, 87 L.Ed. 179.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And Congress sought to satisfy that need by passing the Court Reporters Act of 1944. Paragraph 3 of subsection (b) of that Act provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">* * jje [the court reporter] shall also transcribe and certify all pleas and proceedings in connection with the imposition of sentence in criminal cases and such other parts of the record of proceedings as may be required by rule or order of court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A reading of the various drafts of that Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the hearings conducted by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the House<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Senate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reports, of the conference report,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the congressional debates,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>and of the structure and wording of the statute itself,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> shows that the quoted portion of the Act requires the following as a minimum: The court reporter, without charge and as a routine matter, must \u201ctranscribe and certify\u201d (i.e., type up from his original shorthand notes and file with the Clerk of the District Court) in <em>every </em>criminal case \u2014 whether or not in forma pauperis, appealed or not appealed \u2014 the proceedings on the defendant\u2019s pleas and what transpired at sentencing. This transcription is to be performed as soon after the reported proceedings as is practicable. It is the duty of the District Court to see that henceforth the court reporters comply with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753 (1952), in accordance with the unequivocal congressional intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">We do not require that the court reporters must now supply such transcripts to make up for any failure in the past to comply with the Act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> except as the District Court may order in particular instances. But we do direct the attention of the District Court to the statutory provision here construed. The District Court should feel no reluctance, even as to a closed criminal case, if the need arises in considering a motion under Section 2255 or otherwise, to order the court reporter to transcribe, certify and furnish to the court the transcript of \u201call pleas and proceedings\u201d at sentencing, and \u201csuch other parts of the record of proceedings as may be required\u201d in any such case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number> II. Since we now have before us the transcripts of the plea and of the sentencing, and since serious error appears clearly in those transcripts, we will pass on the questions presented. On this record, no useful purpose would be served by remand to hold a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">(1) The trial court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea of guilty. Leave to withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing should be freely allowed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we said in Mc-Jordan v. Huff, 1943, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 171, 172, 133 F.2d 408, 409; \u201c * * * it goes without saying that a plea of guilty at that time [arraignment] can be and often is changed, on proper motion, <em>as a matter of course.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) An accused moving to withdraw his plea <em>after </em>sentence is faced with the formidable barrier of having to show that his conviction was manifestly unjust. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d), 18 U.S.C. In this case, the sentencing judge erroneously placed this burden on appellant even prior to sentence when he stated to counsel at the bench:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cIf you find any <em>facts that indicate he isn\u2019t guilty, </em>file a formal motion.\u201d Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In the instant case there were two additional factors which made granting the requested withdrawal the only proper course. First, the guilty plea was entered at a time-when the accused lacked any assistance of counsel. More than fifteen years ago we announced our disapproval of the practice of allowing uncounselled prisoners to plead to an indictment or information. In Evans v. Rives, 1942, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 242, at page 250, 126 F.2d 633, at page 641, we said that the contention of the prosecution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u201cin the instant case that the petitioner\u2019s conviction was valid amounts in effect to an assertion that the constitutional guarantee that in criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense does not apply at the arraignment, where the accused is required to stand at the bar, to hear the charge, and to enter a plea. But an accused is no less an accused at that stage of the proceedings than at any other, and, as we have pointed out above, no less in need at that stage than at any other of the assistance of counsel. The constitutional guarantee makes no distinction between the arraignment and other stages of criminal proceedings in respect of the application of the guarantee. * * * The duty upon a court of according an accused such rights is positive and affirmative and must not be ignored.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">The accused \u201crequires the guiding hand of counsel <em>at every step </em>in the proceedings against him.\u201d Powell v. State of Alabama, 1932, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158 (emphasis added); see also Johnson v. Zerbst, 1938, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Moreover, in this case, before sentence was imposed appointed counsel indicated \u2014at least in a general fashion \u2014 that there might be a question of the accused\u2019s mental capacity. Counsel, in offering to have the accused examined at the jail, told the sentencing judge at the bench that the accused had told counsel that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>in 1945 his skull had been fractured and that he suffered severe headaches. It does not appear that the accused was ever examined in accordance with this offer. Counsel\u2019s statement, standing alone, may not have been sufficient to require ordering a mental examination pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 (1952). See Lloyd v. United States, 1957, 101 U.S.App.D.C.-, 247 F.2d 522. But in view of the uncounselled plea of guilty by the accused, <em>pro se, </em>at arraignment, depriving him of the opportunity to make a properly advised decision whether to plead guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity, or simply not guilty, the judge should have permitted the change of plea at the time of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(2) Further, it was error for the District Court to refuse even to <em>entertain, </em>at sentencing, counsel\u2019s oral motion for leave to withdraw the plea. The District Court indicated that counsel was required to file \u201ca formal motion,\u201d presumably one in writing. Under Fed.R. Crim.P. 47 counsel could properly make such an oral motion at the sentencing hearing. See Perry v. United States, 1952, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 195 F.2d 37. But even if a written motion were thought advisable \u2014 to inform the Government and the court more particularly of the grounds for such a motion\u2014 sentencing should have been postponed. See United States v. Panebianco, supra, note 11. The sentencing court should have allowed the motion to be made, in one way or the other, prior to imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Taking all factors into account, if a direct appeal had been taken from the judgment of conviction, reversal under these circumstances would be required. Bergen v. United States, supra, note 11; Evans v. Rives, supra; Wood v. United States, supra. The question now before us is whether the errors \u2014 in their totality \u2014 are sufficiently serious to require correction under Section 2255. As appears above, appellant was allowed to plead guilty without the assistance of counsel. And when counsel was subsequently appointed, he was directed by the arraignment judge to be something less than an advocate. In addition, before sentencing appellant, the court put upon him the burden of showing innocence or insanity as grounds for withdrawal of the guilty plea. Again, when the court refused leave to withdraw the plea, the court misled counsel by stating to him at the bench that \u201cYou have got two months after I sentence for me to set it aside.\u201d The only \u201ctwo months\u201d motion provided for in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a motion under Rule 35 for reduction of sentence. Such a motion is essentially a plea for leniency and presupposes a valid conviction. Cook v. United States, 1 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 567, 570, certiorari denied 1949, 336 U.S. 926, 69 S.Ct. 647, 93 L.Ed. 1088. It is wholly inadequate to test the propriety of allowing a guilty plea to stand. Taking all of these circumstances together we think appellant is entitled to have the judgment of conviction vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The order of the District Court denying relief under Section 2255 must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate the judgment of conviction and to hold a new trial, if the Government is prepared to proceed with one, and if pursuant to a showing under Section 4244 of Title 18 examination is had and appellant is found to be mentally competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">.

The Act was originally Section 5a of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 9a (Supp. IV, 1940 ed.). In tho 1948 code revision, the Act became 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 753, with stylistic, conforming and paragraphing changes only. The language of Section 753(b) has remained unchanged since enactment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b451-20\">. See notes 2-8, supra.

It appears that the court reporters in the District Court for the District of Columbia, in contrast to those in most other districts, have not in the past been in proper compliance with the Act.
