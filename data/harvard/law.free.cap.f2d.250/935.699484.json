With the testimony still fresh in mind, the District Judge has stated his impressions of the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before him. His judgment of the witnesses, given before the passage of time had dimmed the memory of what can never be adequately preserved by a stenographic record, is thus entitled to great weight. In any event, the testimony and the exhibits overwhelmingly support the findings of the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
