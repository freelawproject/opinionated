Its sole assignment of error is that the trial court erred in charging the jury that defendant\u2019s negligence could be based on acts other than those referred to by plaintiff or his witnesses and in refusing the defendant\u2019s requests to charge to the same intent. During the course of the trial Machinist Rankin, one of defendant\u2019s witnesses, testified to acts from which the jury could have concluded that defendant was negligent and that such negligence caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries. This evidence had not been put forward by plaintiff, but was apt and relevant to the issues before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-21\">The defendant has hit upon a singularly weak and unsound contention on which to found its hope for reversal. Here the complaint is wisely broad, and plaintiff is entitled to the jury\u2019s view based on all the evidence in the case, not merely plaintiff\u2019s own testimony. Defendant\u2019s requests to charge are erroneous and misleading, for they would exclude consideration of Rankin\u2019s direct and vital testimony. The court\u2019s charge covering this point is restrained and even necessary; it is not fairly represented by the single sentence defendant wrests out of context to emphasize. The verdict is generous, but not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-22\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
