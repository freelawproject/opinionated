See N. L. R. B. v. Edin-burg Citrus Ass\u2019n, 5 Cir., 1945, 147 F.2d 353; Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 357; N. L. R. B. v. Milwaukee Elec. Tool Corp., 7 Cir., 1956, 237 F.2d 75. It insists further that under the circumstances disclosed by the record, including the past history of its employee relations, the offer of economic benefits and poll of employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>did not constitute an unfair labor practice. , See N. L. R. B. v. Protein Blenders, 8 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 749; N. L. R. B. v. Roberts Brothers, 9 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"> As is so frequently true in this type of ease, the evidence upon the question of motivation was conflicting, and the record considered as a whole is reasonably susceptible to the inference that the petitioner\u2019s conduct was not intended or effective to discourage union activities, as well as to the contrary inference that it was. When that is the case the choice the Board has made is not to be set aside by us, even though we might have chosen the contrary inference. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order must be enforced, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
