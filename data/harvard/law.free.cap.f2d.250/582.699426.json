Applegate, Asst. U. S. Atty., Cincinnati, Ohio, Hugh K.

We cannot say that the findings and conclusions of the trial judge were clearly erroneous, even though he placed considerable reliance upon the inferences drawn from the physical evidence which were contrary to much of the testimonial evidence favorable to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The court was not in error, as the trier of the facts, in concluding that the Ohio \u201cassured clear distance ahead\u201d statute was inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. Section 4511.21 Ohio Rev.Code, Erdman v. Mestrovich, 1951, 155 O\u2019hio St. 85, 97 N.E.2d 674, 31 A.L.R.2d 1417. Moreover, the court\u2019s rulings upon the admissibility of evidence were well within allowable discretion and free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The trial judge filed a six page memorandum decision, setting out his basic findings and conclusions in considerable detail, and no separate findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed. The memorandum decision, while not containing specific findings on every subsidiary evidentiary issue, amply complied with the requirements of Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
