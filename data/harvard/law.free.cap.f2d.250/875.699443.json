See In re General Stores Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>129 F.Supp. 801, affirmed General Stores Corp. v. Shlensky, 2 Cir., 222 F.2d 234, affirmed 350 U.S. 462, 76 S.Ct. 516, 100 L.Ed. 550. The first order denies the petition of appellant Ruskin, a secured creditor, to vacate a stay entered on May 1, 1956, restraining him from foreclosing the lien on debtor\u2019s primary assets \u2014 stock in two subsidiary corporations \u2014 held by the secured creditors as collateral for their debt. But the petitioner\u2019s attempt to end the reorganization by foreclosing the lien is premature. Until the district court has had an opportunity to evaluate these assets it can be in no position to judge the propriety of any contemplated plan of reorganization. Therefore the petition properly was denied without prejudice to its renewal before the district court if circumstances justify. In re General Stores Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 150 F.Supp. 868. See also In re General Stores Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 147 F.Supp. 350, for an earlier similar attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">The second order requires that Ruskin give notice to the trustee, and in certain instances the court, of proposed actions of the subsidiaries regarding new leases, store closings, store sales, capital expenditures of more than $2,500, and unusual transactions not in the ordinary course of business. Ruskin manages the subsidiaries under a collateral agreement executed in connection with the events occurring when the debt- or incurred the secured creditors\u2019 debt. The district court had the power to issue this order, even though the subsidiaries are solvent. Bankruptcy Act \u00a7\u00a7 2a(15), 257, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11(a) (15), 657. See Continental-Illinois Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., 294 U.S. 648, 55 S.Ct. 595, 79 L.Ed. 1110; In re Franklin Garden Apartments, Inc., 2 Cir., 124 F.2d 451; In re Portland Elec. Power Co., D.C.Or., 97 F.Supp. 899; Id., 9 Cir., 162 F.2d 618, 624, certiorari denied Watson v. Portland Electric Power Co., 332 U.S. 837, 68 S.Ct. 217, 222 218, 92 L.Ed. 410. 'The court simply took qualified possession of the stock pledged in order to preserve debtor\u2019s possible equity in it. All the order requires is notice of a proposed transaction. This procedure serves to keep the court informed and provides a means for frustrating a transaction which might ruin the chances of any reorganization. We accept and adopt Judge Levet\u2019s persuasive opinions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
