This suit was commenced for unfair competition in the trade and for trade-mark infringement because, as plaintiff alleges, the name \u201cSnap-On Drawers\u201d and firm name \u201cSnap-On Drawer Co.\u201d are colorable imitations of plaintiff\u2019s trademark and corporate name contraction \u201cSnap-On.\u201d Relying on common law rights, plaintiff asked for and received, injunctive relief against infringement by, and unfair competition in, defendant\u2019s use of plaintiff\u2019s trade-name and -mark. The scope of that restraint, arrived at after the district court heard and received extensive evidence, is as follows. Defendant is restrained from:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-24\">(a) Using the word \u201cSnap-On\u201d or any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or color-able imitation thereof, as a brand name or trade-mark for cabinets, and specifically for drawer units;</p>\n<p id=\"b207-25\">(b) Using the word \u201cSnap-On\u201d or any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or color-able imitation thereof, in any firm or corporate name or business style, to-wit: \u201cSnap-On,\u201d \u201cSnap-On Drawer Co.,\u201d or \u201cSnap-On Drawer Company,\u201d in connection with the production, sale or distribution of cabinets or boxes for any purpose;</p>\n<p id=\"b207-26\">(c) Engaging in the sale or distribution of any drawers or cabinets bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the trade-mark \u201cSnap-On\u201d or any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation thereof; and</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">(d) Doing any act or thing calculated to induce the belief that the defendant or its merchandise is in any way connected with the plaintiff or plaintiff\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">As one of the chief grounds for reversal and remandment of the final judgment, entered below, defendant stresses Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 1938, 305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 113, 83 L.Ed. 73. Such heavy reliance is, however, misplaced. Inapplicability of that opinion to the facts now before us is quickly shown in these two significant aspects mentioned by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is when explaining the Kellogg factual background: (1) \u201cSince during the life of the patents \u2018Shredded Wheat\u2019 was the general designation of the patented product, there passed to the public upon the expiration of the patent, not only the right to make the article as it was made during the patent period, but also the right to apply thereto the name by which it had become known * * * [citing and quoting]\u201d and, (2) \u201c* * * [T]o establish a trade name in the term \u2018Shredded Wheat\u2019 the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It must show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. This it has not done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The current appeal involves points diametrically opposed to the two enumerated in Kellogg, supra. Item 1 is offset by finding of fact numbered 7, entered in the district court [150 F.Supp. 794] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3o\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s applications to the United States Patent Office for registration of its trade-mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 under Section 2(f) of the Trade Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(f), for hand tools, automobile service tools, etc.; metal tool boxes, tool trays, tool chests and table high supports therefor; gauge blocks and strips, measuring calipers and micrometers, etc.; have proceeded to the point of publication- and oppositions Numbered 29567, 30428, and 29565, by Snap-On Drawer Company; no final decision having yet been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">From the evidence in the record before us we are satisfied that the findings of fact made by the district judge corresponding to point 2 in Kellogg, as well as the others he made, are not clearly erroneous, Fed.Rules Civil Procedure, Rule 52, 28 U.S.C., and we refuse to set them aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">This is a comparatively simple instance of where a manufacturer, the plaintiff at bar, engaging in a national and international business, has continuously produced roughly 4000 different tools and tool containers or cabinets, since 1920. All of these items are sold under plaintiff\u2019s trade-name and-mark, and since the evidence supports the findings of fact, certain of them are reprinted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">\u201cUnder its trade-mark \u2018Snap-On/ plaintiff has sold individual drawer units since 1933, and plaintiff presently has in its line an individual drawer unit as well as multiple drawer units intended for vertical stacking for build-up into various combinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">\u201cIn the year 1920 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor adopted and used, and plaintiff now uses, on its various tools and cabinets the trade-mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 presently in the forms as shown in plaintiff\u2019s exhibits 1-D, 3-D, 5-D and 35-D. Since 1920, said use of the trade mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 has been continuous and without interruption throughout the United States and in many foreign countries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">\u201cThe plaintiff, Snap-On Tools Corporation, is known in the trade and generally referred to by the com traction \u2018Snap-On\u2019 which is also its principal trade-mark impressed in various styles on its products, catalogs, and brochures. About 85% of its tools presently bear the trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 and the remainder are identified with the trade marks, \u2018Blue Point,\u2019 \u2018Supreme,\u2019 and \u2018Vacuum Grip.\u2019 All these products are sold as \u2018Snap-On Tools,\u2019 and all the cabinets have thereon the name \u2018Snap-On\u2019 or \u2018Snap-On Tools.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cThe annual volume of business done by plaintiff under its trademark and -name \u2018Snap-On\u2019 as described above, in 1949-1950 amounted to $15,370,820, and presently amounts to more than $22 million each year. The sales volume from 1940 to 1950, inclusive, amounted to $143,699,035.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201cPlaintiff spends, and has for many years spent, large sums of money in advertising its tools and cabinets sold under its trade-name or -mark \u2018Snap-On,\u2019 or both, and has established a reputation for dependability for its products by a liberal policy of tool replacement which plaintiff pursues as an effective measure of maintaining the good will of its customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 means, and has meant for many years prior to defendant\u2019s use, to the trade and public, when applied to tools and cabinets, the products of the plaintiff. The trade-name \u2018Snap-On Tools Corporation\u2019 and its contraction \u2018Snap-On\u2019 means and has meant the plaintiff to the trade and public for many years prior to defendant\u2019s use on the accused drawer units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201cAs a result of plaintiff\u2019s large and extensive and long continued sales of tools and cabinets sold under its trade-mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 and because of the long continued and extensive advertising of plaintiff\u2019s products featuring the trade-mark and -name \u2018Snap-On,\u2019 said trademark and -name have become well known and impressed upon the mind of the trade and public as identifying plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s products as well as indicating origin with plaintiff, and have become distinctive of plaintiff and its products and have acquired a secondary meaning indicating plaintiff and its products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\u201cPlaintiff has built up and now has a valuable good will in its trademark and -name \u2018Snap-On.\u2019 In 1949-1950, plaintiff\u2019s good will in and to the trade-mark and -name \u2018Snap-On\u2019 was valued at a sum in excess of $2,800,000. upon recognized accounting methods of determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">\u201cAfter the adoption and use by plaintiff of its trade-mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 for tools and cabinets, and after said trade-mark had acquired a distinctiveness with the trade and public as indicating plaintiff\u2019s tools and cabinets, the defendant began the solicitation of sales of cabinets and, specifically, drawer units bearing the name \u2018Snap-On Drawer\u2019 on the handles and the trade-name \u2018Snap-On Drawer Co., Morrow, Ohio\u2019 impressed on the body thereof, as shown in plaintiff\u2019s exhibits 4-D, 4-D-l, and 21-D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">\u201cAfter the adoption and use by plaintiff of its trade-mark and -name \u2018Snap-On\u2019 for tools and cabinets and after said trade-mark and -name had acquired a distinctiveness with the trade and public as indicating plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s products in connection with tools and cabinets, the defendant began soliciting orders for the accused drawers produced by the Snap-On Drawer Company of Morrow, Ohio, and began the distribution in eleven states of brochures of said Snap-On Drawer Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">\u201cThe defendant through the Snap-On Drawer Company as its source of supply, and in the capacity of factory sales agent for said Company, adopted and began the use of the name \u2018Snap-On Drawer\u2019 and the trade-name \u2018Snap-On Drawer Co., Morrow, Ohio,\u2019 on the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>drawers with full knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s prior and extensive use of its trade-mark and -name, and with full knowledge that the trade and public associate the trade-mark \u2018Snap-On\u2019 when applied to or used in connection with tools and cabinets with plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s use of \u2018Snap-On\u2019 as the dominant part of the trademark, trade-name and business styles, to-wit: \u2018Snap-On Drawer,\u2019 \u2018Snap-On Drawer Co.,\u2019 and \u2018Snap-On Drawer Company,\u2019 is likely to cause confusion or mistake, and to deceive purchasers as to the Source or origin of the accused drawers in that the trade and public are likely to attribute these goods to source or origin with plaintiff or with a concern connected with plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s use of \u2018Snap-On\u2019 is without the consent of plaintiff, and against its express will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201cPlaintiff has requested the defendant to discontinue use of \u2018Snap-On,\u2019 but defendant has refused and continued to use \u2018Snap-On.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201cAll drawers which have been sold by defendant, or for which defendant solicited orders, which bear the words \u2018Snap-On Drawer,\u2019 also bear in clearly legible type the words: \u2018Snap-On Drawer Co., Morrow, Ohio\u2019; however, the latter words and the word \u2018Drawer\u2019 in \u2018Snap-On Drawer,\u2019 are in smaller, less distinct and noticeable type than the word \u2018Snap-On.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201cNo evidence was introduced which proved that plaintiff had actually suffered any pecuniary damage because of defendant\u2019s solicitation of orders for drawers having thereon the word \u2018Snap-On\u2019 as a trade-mark and \u2018Snap-On Drawer Co.,\u2019 as a trade-name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">We think there is abundant evidence adequately supporting the findings disclosed in this record that Snap-On means the plaintiff corporation in the market place where the contested items are brought for sale. \u201cSnap-On\u201d now stands for the plaintiff and its products, this we think is what is encompassed by the phrase \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d Jewel Tea Co., Inc. v. Kraus, 7 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 278, 283. The name of the plaintiff manufacturer has become the sign of a physical thing, e. g. the product. The relation between the sign and object has been categorized by advertising and other investments of time, effort and capital, consequently defendant\u2019s contentions posited on generic names or terms are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">Defendant\u2019s detailed argument on the adequacy of jurisdictional grounds only requires reference to the total opinion in Seagram-Distillers Corporation v. New Cut Rate Liquors, Inc., 7 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 453, where this court described the so-called \u201cClass B\u201d cases. In any event the district court found the value of plaintiff\u2019s trademark to be in excess of $2,000,000 and, we think, correctly rejected defendant\u2019s jurisdictional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">After briefing and oral arguments were heard, counsel for each party addressed letters to members of the panel which had the case under advisement. These communications rehashing certain cited authorities were unwarranted and unauthorized. We have disregarded both such letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">The judgment appealed is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
