In suit are the following claims of the following patents: Keeney and Ferm, No. 1,918,-968, Claims 2, 5, 10, 11 and 16 to 26, inclusive; Steckel, No. 1,977,214, Claims 2. to 5, inclusive, 11 to 13, inclusive, 18 and 22; Montgomery, No. 2,072,122,, Claims 6, 10 and 15 to 20, inclusive;. Montgomery, No. 2,087,065, Claims 1 to 5, inclusive; Montgomery, No. 2,214,107, Claims 4 and 6 to 10, inclusive; Montgomery, No. 2,072,121,. Claims 2 and 3. After an extended trial the district court held all the claims invalid for lack of invention. 1956, 145 F.Supp. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-22\">Certain of the claims of three of the patents had been held invalid by this, court in Cold Metal Products Co. v. Newport Steel Corp., 1955, 226 F.2d 19, and' as to these claims the district court relied upon that decision finding that the' evidence in the present case which was hot before the court in the Newport Steel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ease did not justify a determination contrary to the latter decision. As to the-remaining claims in suit, the district court made an independent determination that they were lacking in invention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of this disposition of the controversy the district court did not consider the issue of infringement (although theappellee conceded that certain of the-claims, if valid, were infringed), nor the appellee\u2019s contention that one of the patents had been fraudulently procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">A careful review of the record convinces us that the district court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions, thoroughly and clearly expressed in Judge Levin\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>written opinion, are </em>free from error. That being so, it would be supererogatory for this court to essay an extended opinion, which could be little more that a paraphrase of what the district judge has written and of what has already been said by us in Cold Metal Products Co. v. Newport Steel Corp., supra. See also, Cold Metal Products Co. v. Crucible Steel Company of America, 3 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed upon Judge Levin\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-15\">.
