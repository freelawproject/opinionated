Judgment and sentence were thereafter entered as to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">There are no legal grounds for either appeal. The questions urged before this Court related to the facts and the credibility of the witnesses. Certain improbabilities in the evidence are also urged upon us. But all these matters were foreclosed by the verdict of the jury. The trial judge entered the judgment and sentenced appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Vfe should commend counsel for appellants, who was appointed by the trial court but who, at his own expense, appeared before this Court and presented an able argument for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
