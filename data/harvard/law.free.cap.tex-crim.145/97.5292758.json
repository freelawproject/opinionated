Therefore nothing is presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">Appellant has filed a brief in which he argues quite at length that the trial court committed fundamental error in this: That the court, in his charge, failed to define an unlawful homicide and failed to explain what would constitute an unlawful homicide, etc. We are unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention. The court, in his charge, defined murder as the same is defined by statute. This was sufficient. There is no merit in his contention as to fundamental error appearing in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
