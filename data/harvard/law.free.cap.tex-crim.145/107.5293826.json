A number of exceptions were taken to the court\u2019s charge but we are unable to understand the appropriateness of them in the absence of a statement of facts. Whether or not there was anything requiring an affirmative charge on the right of appellant to shoot the deceased in defense of his wife and whether or not the court properly charged the law of self defense would depend on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">Not having the statement of facts before us, we are unable to say that the court committed error. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
