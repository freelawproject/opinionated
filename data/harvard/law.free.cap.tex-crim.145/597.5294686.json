It seems that he was, therefore, at the time of the filing of this motion a fugitive. Again, it is further shown that no subpoena was issued in this cause, requesting the presence of Curbo. Under the circumstances we do not think any error was shown in the court\u2019s overruling such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
