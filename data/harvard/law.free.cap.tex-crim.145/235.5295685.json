It is necessary that the result of the local option election be pleaded and proven, as well as- the publication of the order of the commissioners court of such county entering its order, prohibiting the sale of such intoxicating liquors in such county. Nowhere in the record is it shown that after the entry of the order of the commissioners court, the same was published in a newspaper as is required by law. See Akin v. State, 14 Tex. App. 142. In the absence of such order in the record, it is not therein shown and proven that it was unlawful to sell intoxicating liquor in Wood County. See Carl Craig v. State, our No. 22,317, this day decided and not yet reported. (Page 185 of this volume).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">This judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
