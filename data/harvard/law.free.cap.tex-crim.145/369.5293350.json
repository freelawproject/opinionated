We are inclined to agree with her. The acts charged as constituting her a vagrant are: (1) That she was a person without employment and had no visible means of support; and (2) that she was then a common prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The proof shows that she roomed at 505 Monterrey Street in the City of San Antonio; that she worked at a beer joint on Buena Vista Street; that she had never been seen soliciting men; that she had never been caught in bed with a man; and the witness could not say that he had ever seen her in a room with a man within the last few months.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">This is in substance all the testimony in support of the allegations in the complaint and information. We are at a loss to understand upon what theory the trial court convicted her or declined.to grant her a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Having reached the conclusion that the evidence is wholly insufficient to sustain the conviction, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
