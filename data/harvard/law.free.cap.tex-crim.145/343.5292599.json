Statements made in appellant\u2019s brief cannot be considered on questions of fact. We note, however, from the one bill of exception approved by the court that it was admitted by the State that the defendant purchased the whisky in a wet area and that he was transporting same in a dry area \u201cto his home for his own consumption.\u201d It is not a violation of law to transport intoxicating liquor into a dry area from a wet area for personal use.
