This article provides that upon conviction of the offense denounced by said section of said article the defendant shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25.00 and not more than $500.00, and, in addition thereto, there may be imposed a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding six months. It appears to us that the judgment assessing appellant\u2019s punishment at confinement in the county jail for a period of three months without the imposition of a fine was unauthorized. There may be a fine imposed without imprisonment, but there can not be an imprisonment without first assessing a fine. A fine is a necessary part of the punishment, without which the additional punishment can not legally be imposed. In \"support of what we have said we refer to the following authorities: Sager v. State, 11 Tex. Cr. App. 110; Johnson v. State, 18 Tex. Cr. App. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>For the error noticed, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
