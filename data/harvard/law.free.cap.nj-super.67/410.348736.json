J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Acq\">In a negligence action, tried before a court and jury in the Superior Court, Law Division, plaintiff seeks to reverse a judgment of dismissal entered on defendant\u2019s motion at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case <em>(R. R. </em>4:42-2(6)). Plaintiff sought the recovery of damages for personal injuries resulting from a fall from a ladder while working for Max Cohen Plumbing Company (hereinafter called Cohen), in the performance of a contract which Cohen had entered into with defendant to install a \u201c[n]ew four-inch galvanized water pipe to be run from the bottom of water tower to the pipe of the [factory] building\u201d on defendant\u2019s property. The record reveals that a wooden water tank, 20 feet in depth, was erected on an iron structure 60 feet above the ground. A coemployee of plaintiff testified that a \u201cfeed pipe,\u201d which came \u201cout of the tank,\u201d was rotted and the contractor \u201chad to replace it with new pipe,\u201d and that the pipe went \u201cthrough the bottom of the tank\u201d and it was necessary to \u201cgo into the tank to unscrew it\u201d; it was \u201cpart of the job\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>During the course of the work Cohen\u2019s foreman directed plaintiff to \u201csee what kind of connection was in the tank.\u201d In compliance therewith plaintiff climbed an iron ladder from the ground to the \u201ctop of the water tower,\u201d removed a \u201ctrap door\u201d cover from an opening on the tank roof, and climbed down a stationary wooden ladder, attached to the inside of the tank wall, leading to the bottom of the tank. Plaintiff testified that the ladder \u201cappeared all right\u201d but was \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cslimy\u201d or \u201csoggy.\u201d On reaching the bottom of the tank he located \u201ca flange around the pipe holding the pipe from the outside of the tower to the inside.\u201d With the aid of lighted matches he completed his inspection and then commenced his ascent of the ladder. When he was \u201cthree or four rungs from the top * * * one of the rungs collapsed underneath\u201d his left foot, precipitating him to the tank floor with such force that he was rendered temporarily unconscious and sustained the injuries for which he sought compensation as aforesaid. Plaintiff further testified that, before he was lifted from the tank by a rescue squad, \u201cI felt a piece of the ladder the part that I felt was rotted like a piece of wood you see on the beach. It was all rotted.\u201d There was testimony from the coemployee that the ladder was \u201cbroken in several pieces\u201d and the wood \u201crotted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Attempting to support the trial court\u2019s action and the reasoning on which it was based, defendant cites <em>Broecker v. Armstrong Cork Co., </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>3 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1942); <em>Gibilterra, v. Rosemawr Homes, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>166 (1955); <em>Mergel v. Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co., </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>372 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); certification denied 22 <em>N. J. </em>453 (1956). The asserted justification for the dismissal is unsupported by the factual situation revealed by the testimony presented on plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The aforesaid cases on which defendant relies in support of the trial court\u2019s action are authority for the proposition that, where the landowner does not attempt to direct the method in which the work is done, he is under no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>protect an employee of an independent contractor from the very hazard the contractor was called upon to correct. The principle has no application to the case at bar because, when plaintiff rested his case, it appeared from the evidence that Cohen had not been hired to do any work upon the ladder and that the ladder was merely a means of access to the pipe upon which Cohen and his employees were to work. <em>Cf. Bergquist v. Penterman, </em>46 <em>N. J. Super. </em>74, 83 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957); certification denied <em>25 N. J. </em>55 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Defendant clearly owed the duty to Cohen\u2019s employees, including plaintiff, as its invitees on its property, to use ordinary care to render reasonably safe the area to which defendant might reasonably expect Cohen\u2019s employees would go. <em>Gudnestad v. Seaboard Coal Dock Co., </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>210, 219 (1954). The basic question was whether defendant reasonably should have expected Cohen\u2019s employees to use or enter the inside of the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Assaying the trial court\u2019s action, wo apply the well-settled rule that on a motion for involuntary dismissal the trial court \u201cmust accept as true all the evidence that supports the position of the party against whom the motion is made, and it must give him the benefit of all the inferences in his favor that may logically and legitimately be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>O'Donnell v. Asplundh Tree Expert Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>319, 328 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">So tested, the evidence established <em>prima facie </em>that the use of the ladder was to gain access to the work and not part of it and that the jury would have been justified in finding that defendant knew or should have known that plaintiff would enter the tank. If it resolved those questions in plaintiff\u2019s favor, it could then under appropriate instruction from the court consider and resolve the remaining question, likewise within its province, <em>viz: </em>whether the defendant was negligent in the performance of its aforesaid duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The judgment in favor of defendant is reversed and a new trial granted. Costs are to abide the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
