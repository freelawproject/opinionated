The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law for a period of two years, followed by a two-year probationary period with conditions, based on findings that he committed several disciplinary violations. On review, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 2} On November 13, 2006, relator, Columbus Bar Association, filed a seven-count amended complaint charging respondent with several violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Respondent stipulated to the violations of the Disciplinary Rules in each count. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in April 2007. Based on the stipulations and other evidence, the panel made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Stipulated Facts</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 3} In 1999, respondent drafted a will for Marjorie Holland that named her brother, John Holland, the primary heir of the estate. The deed to the house in which Marjorie lived was in her and John\u2019s names as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Marjorie died in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent, who was the executor of Marjorie\u2019s estate, filed the estate inventory but failed to properly research the real estate title and did not realize that the property was not an estate asset, because it had passed to John upon Marjorie\u2019s death. Believing the real estate to be an estate asset, respondent sold the property in August 2001 to the listing real estate agent for $115,000 less a six percent commission. The property had an appraised value of $168,000, and the real estate agent resold the property two years later for $216,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">{\u00b6 5} In addition, respondent failed to list as an estate asset a $23,922 mortgage that John had executed on the property in 1991. Respondent signed a release of the mortgage without determining whether John had ever repaid the money he owed from the 1991 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent subsequently paid 50 percent of the real estate proceeds to Marjorie\u2019s estate and 50 percent to John. Yet respondent failed to pay Marjorie\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>funeral expenses on time, causing late fees of $1,211 to be added to the bill. Respondent also paid the funeral bill from his personal account rather than the estate account.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 7} John Holland lived in a nursing home before and after the death of his sister, Marjorie. In June 2001, John signed a power of attorney giving respondent authority to manage his financial affairs, including payment of bills relating to his comfort and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 8} In October 2002, respondent opened an account for John and deposited $52,268, John\u2019s 50 percent share of the real estate sale described in Count I, and $29,962 from Marjorie\u2019s estate. However, on numerous occasions, respondent failed to pay for medical and pharmaceutical services provided to John, causing certain service providers to threaten to terminate services. Respondent also failed to pay John\u2019s nursing home expenses on time and did not timely respond to the nursing home\u2019s attempts to contact him. John revoked the power of attorney in January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 9} In 1998 or 1999, respondent assumed responsibility for probating the estate of Margaret Dickerson, which included National City Bank common stock and an interest in the National City Bank Dividend Reinvestment Program. Respondent failed to list stock dividends from the dividend-reinvestment program in the account and did not distribute them at the closing of the estate. In fact, the dividend-reinvestment program remained open for four years after the estate was closed. In addition, after Dickerson\u2019s death, respondent took possession of 11 pension checks written to Dickerson but neglected to deposit them or ask to have them reissued.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\n<em>Count TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent left the law firm of Christensen, Christensen <em>&amp; </em>DeVillers in December 2003. Respondent continued to represent clients but failed to disclose that he no longer carried malpractice insurance and failed to have the clients sign the notice required by DR 1-104(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">\n<em>Count V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">{\u00b6 11} In 2004, the Franklin County Probate Court appointed Douglas Wrightsel as a master commissioner to review five estate matters then being handled by respondent. Wrightsel\u2019s report concluded that there was delay, neglect, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>missing paperwork. Respondent was able to complete the work on these estates with Wrightsel\u2019s direction and help.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\n<em>Count VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent did not maintain a trust account or a separate business account. Instead, respondent used his personal account for business and non-business purposes, including the payment of client court costs. Respondent also did not keep an accounting of client funds deposited into his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 13} While working with Christensen, Christensen &amp; DeVillers, respondent deposited $10,500 into the firm\u2019s trust account on April 3, 2003, without recording which client the deposit related to. In May 2003, respondent made two withdrawals totaling $10,500, also without notation. When asked by firm members for details of the disbursements, respondent indicated that they were made to David Dorward and Baycliff Village Home Owners Association. In reality, one check for $7,748.18 was made payable to Provident Bank and the other check for $2,751.82 was made payable to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>Count VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 14} Sometime around April 2004, respondent defended Steven and Donald Slivka in a lawsuit to collect on a loan. Respondent entered an appearance and filed a motion for leave to file an answer. This motion stated that respondent had requested and received an extension of time to file an answer. However, when he received a motion for default judgment, respondent discovered that the extension had not been journalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 15} The case was scheduled for trial in July 2004. After several continuances, the judge entered an order in January 2005 indicating that the case had been settled, based upon respondent\u2019s representations to opposing counsel that respondent had the settlement money in his trust account. However, respondent\u2019s clients had not authorized any settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">{\u00b6 16} As a result, the case was put back on the docket. A pretrial conference was scheduled for August 2005. Respondent had by then moved but had failed to provide the court with his new address.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">{\u00b6 17} In October 2005, respondent sent a proposed settlement agreement to opposing counsel, although according to Steven Slivka, respondent did not have authority to settle the lawsuit. Nevertheless, the case was ultimately dismissed in December 2005 based upon representations of counsel that the parties had resolved their dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">{\u00b6 18} In January or February 2006, respondent informed Steven Slivka that the Slivkas would likely have to pay some money. Respondent said he would contact them later about the amount they needed to pay. However, respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>never contacted the brothers. In June 2006, Steven Slivka\u2019s wages were garnished. The sheriff also executed on the Slivkas\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Stipulated Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent admitted, and the board found, that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (forbidding engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 1-104(A) (requiring disclosure to clients that a lawyer does not carry professional-liability insurance), 6-101(A)(l) (forbidding handling a legal matter that a lawyer is not competent to handle without associating with a lawyer who is competent to handle it), 6-101(A)(3) (forbidding neglect of an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(l) (forbidding intentionally failing to seek a client\u2019s lawful objectives), 7-101(A)(2) (forbidding intentionally failing to carry out an employment contract), 7-101 (A)(3) (forbidding intentionally prejudicing or damaging a client during the professional relationship), and 9-102(A), (B), and (E) (requiring preservation of the identity of funds and property of clients).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 20} In recommending a sanction, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 21} As aggravating factors, the board found that respondent had engaged in a pattern of misconduct and that there were multiple offenses. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). In addition, respondent refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his misconduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(g). The board also noted the vulnerability of and resulting harm to the victims of respondent\u2019s misconduct and respondent\u2019s failure to make restitution. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h) and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 22} In mitigation, the board noted the absence of a prior disciplinary record, respondent\u2019s cooperation in the disciplinary investigation, and his character and reputation. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">{\u00b6 23} Respondent testified that he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child. Respondent explained that his disorder was not an excuse for his actions but that it did make it very difficult to stay focused and to address matters in a timely fashion. Respondent further testified that after an Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program intervention to determine the cause of his problems, he was diagnosed with adult attention deficit disorder and general anxiety disorder and was under the care of a psychiatrist for a year.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b154-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Barbara J. Petrella, Bruce A. Campbell, and A. Alysha Clous; and Roetzel Andress, L.P.A., and Judith D. Levine, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AWN\">Bricker &amp; Eckler, L.L.P., and Alvin E. Mathews Jr., for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">{\u00b6 24} Because respondent did not provide expert testimony on his condition, the board was unable to find that his attention deficit disorder caused or contributed to any of the charged misconduct. The board did, however, recognize that respondent was diligent in accepting treatment and removing himself from the traditional law-firm environment by accepting employment as a financial analyst and in-house counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">{\u00b6 25} The panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for two years and, if respondent is reinstated, that he serve a two-year monitored probation under Gov.Bar R. V(9). The panel also recommended that respondent reimburse the Client Security Fund for any amounts paid to respondent\u2019s clients. It also recommended as a condition of reinstatement that respondent present a written statement from a physician indicating that he is fit to practice law despite his prior diagnosis. The board adopted the panel\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent does not challenge the board\u2019s findings of misconduct or the recommended sanction. We have reviewed the board\u2019s record and its report, and we agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), 1-104(A), 6-101(A)(1), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), 7-101(A)(3), and 9-102(A), (B), and (E). We also agree that the board\u2019s recommended sanction is appropriate. Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for two years, to be followed by a two-year period of monitored probation under the terms of Gov.Bar R. V(9) upon reinstatement. Prior to reinstatement, respondent must present a written statement from a physician indicating that he is fit to practice law. We also order that respondent reimburse the Client Security Fund for the amounts paid to respondent\u2019s clients for any claims made in connection with the above misconduct. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
