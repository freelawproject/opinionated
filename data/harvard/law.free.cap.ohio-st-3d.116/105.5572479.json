For the reasons that follow, we reverse that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, A. Schulman, Inc., produces plastic resins and compounds, which it then sells to manufacturers of consumer, industrial, automotive, and packaging products. The company is headquartered in Akron, Ohio, with manufacturing facilities and distribution centers located in Ohio and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">{\u00b6 3} After A. Schulman paid personal property taxes for tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001, the company asked the Tax Commissioner to reduce the taxable value of some of its tangible personal property. According to A. Schulman, some of its manufacturing equipment should be designated as \u201cdies,\u201d which are not taxable items of personal property in Ohio. The Tax Commissioner prepared a written decision in which he concluded that some of the property designated by A. Schulman as dies did not in fact \u201csatisfy the definition of * * * a die,\u201d and therefore \u201cshould remain taxable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">{\u00b6 4} A. Schulman appealed to the BTA, which held a hearing on the matter in October 2004. A. Schulman presented the testimony of two witnesses: its facility manager from the company\u2019s Akron manufacturing plant and its corporate tax manager. In its September 2006 decision, the BTA agreed with A. Schulman that the property at issue \u201cmeets the requirements and definition of a \u2018die,\u2019 \u201d and the BTA therefore reversed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">{\u00b6 5} The Tax Commissioner has filed this appeal as of right from the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 6} In reviewing a decision of the BTA, this court considers whether the decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783. This court \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 7} As for the burden of proof, it rests on the taxpayer \u201cto show the manner and extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Stds. Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 30. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings \u201care presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10. Any claimed exemption from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed,\u201d and the taxpayer must affirmatively establish a right to the exemption. <em>Campus Bus Serv. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 8. See also R.C. 5715.271 (\u201cthe burden of proof shall be placed on the property owner to show that the property is entitled to exemption\u201d). \u201cIn all doubtful cases exemption is denied.\u201d <em>Youngstown Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Evatt </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 268, 273, 28 O.O. 163, 55 N.E.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 8} Under R.C. 5709.01(B)(1), personal property located and used in business in Ohio is subject to taxation, but R.C. 5701.03(A) excludes from the definition of personal property any \u201cdies * * * that are held for use and not for sale in the ordinary course of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 9} The court has variously described dies as (1) devices that \u201c \u2018through applied force, impose their shape\u2019 \u201d on an object under production, <em>Timken Co. v. Bindley </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 85, 87, 17 OBR 208, 477 N.E.2d 1121, quoting the BTA, (2) \u201cpiece[s] of equipment or tooling that [are] capable of forming or creating a part, either by pressure or molding techniques,\u201d <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Kosydar </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St.2d 138, 139, 66 O.O.2d 304, 310 N.E.2d 154, (3) devices that \u201cform the desired metal, rubber or plastic part when pressure is applied by mechanical or hydraulic presses,\u201d id., (4) parts with \u201cspecially designed surfaces\u201d in a machine whose \u201csole purpose and use is to imprint or impress specially designed irregularities * * * upon material placed in the machine,\u201d <em>Am. Book Co. v. Porterfield </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 49, 53, 47 O.O.2d 164, 247 N.E.2d 290, and (5) special devices \u201cwhich by their nature are capable of only special uses\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>impressing, shaping, or forming something, <em>Colonial Foundry Co. v. Peck </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 296, 301, 49 O.O. 132, 109 N.E.2d 11. Similarly, the BTA has defined a die as \u201ca metallic appliance which, by means of pressure used in connection therewith, serves to give a desired shape or form to some softer material.\u201d <em>Cambridge Glass Co. v. Evatt </em>(1940), 19 O.O. 162, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 10} William Ratliff, who serves as the facility manager for A. Schulman\u2019s Akron manufacturing plant, testified at the BTA hearing that the company heats resin and other materials inside \u201cbarrel and screw\u201d devices so that the mixture melts and turns into taffy-like molten plastic. As the heat is applied, according to Ratliff, the screw inside the barrel \u201cconvey[s] the material to the die\u201d at the end of the barrel, and then the molten plastic \u201cgoes through the die,\u201d which shapes the plastic into small pellets as the material exits the barrels. Ratliff noted that \u201cyou may have different shapes [for the pellets], depending on the type of die that it goes through,\u201d but \u201c[t]he screw and barrel would stay the same\u201d as different dies are swapped in and out to meet the needs of A. Schulman\u2019s customers, who use the pellets as raw materials for a variety of plastic products.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 11} In his written decision in 2004, the Tax Commissioner agreed with A. Schulman that the dies themselves are exempt from Ohio\u2019s personal property tax. He concluded, however, that \u201c[t]he barrel and screw simply push the product through the die,\u201d and therefore those items \u201cdo not satisfy the definition of * * * a die and should remain taxable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 12} Based on William Ratliffs testimony described above, the BTA reached the opposite conclusion with respect to the barrel-and-screw devices, finding that \u201cthe subject equipment meets the requirements and definition of a \u2018die.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 13} The BTA\u2019s decision is not supported by the record. Ratliff drew a distinction in his testimony between the barrel-and-screw devices on the one hand and the dies at the end of each barrel on the other, noting that \u201c[t]he screw and barrel would stay the same\u201d even as different dies might be placed at the end of the barrel to produce plastic pellets of different sizes. The barrel-and-screw devices themselves do not \u201cimpose their shape\u201d on an object under production. <em>Timken Co. v. Lindley, </em>17 Ohio St.3d at 87, 17 OBR 208, 477 N.E.2d 1121 (applying <em>Am. </em>Book\u2019s definition of \u201cdie\u201d). As Ratliff explained, the plastic pellets produced by A. Schulman take their shape not from the barrels themselves but rather from the dies at the end of each barrel. The record demonstrates that it is the dies at the end of the barrels that \u201cform the desired metal, rubber or plastic part when pressure is applied by mechanical or hydraulic presses.\u201d <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Kosydar, </em>37 Ohio St.2d at 139, 66 O.O.2d 304, 310 N.E.2d 154. The barrel-and-screw devices provide the pressure that moves the molten plastic material to and through the dies, but those devices are not themselves \u201cdies.\u201d And there is no testimony in the record to show that the barrel-and-screw devices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>have \u201cspecially designed surfaces\u201d as dies do. See <em>Am. Book Co. v. Porterfield, </em>18 Ohio St.2d at 53, 47 O.O.2d 164, 247 N.E.2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">{\u00b6 14} This court has confined the definition of \u201cdie\u201d to <em>\u201cthose parts </em>\u201d of a machine that have \u201cspecially designed surfaces\u201d for \u201cimprint[ing] or impressing] special designs * ...... upon material placed in such machine.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., paragraph one of the syllabus. The dies in A. Schulman\u2019s machines have specially designed surfaces to create pellets of varying sizes, but the barrel-and-screw devices through which the molten plastic passes do not have any such specially designed surfaces. The barrel-and-screw devices are akin to the \u201cmachine\u201d described in <em>Am. Book, </em>but they are not themselves the parts of that machine that are entitled to the tax exemption that Ohio accords to dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 15} To be sure, this court did treat some \u201cflasks, cast iron shapes, weights, and clamps\u201d as dies in the earlier case of <em>Colonial Foundry Co. v. Peck, </em>158 Ohio St. at 298, 49 O.O. 132, 109 N.E.2d 11. But the flasks at issue in that case were each specially made according to customers\u2019 needs, and molten metal was poured into them to make special-order castings. Id. at 297, 49 O.O. 132, 109 N.E.2d 11. The castings were formed by the \u201cforcible retention\u201d of heated steel in the shape of patterns inside the flasks, and \u201creuse of any of the flasks [was] unusual for the reason that most of the company\u2019s orders [were] for castings made according to special requirements.\u201d Id. at 297 and 299, 49 O.O. 132, 109 N.E.2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 16} The barrel-and-screw devices in this case are different. As William Ratliff testified, \u201c[t]he screw and barrel would stay the same\u201d even as different dies are swapped in and out at the end of the barrel to suit different customers\u2019 needs. He explained that \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have to change the barrel and screw\u201d when a new die was added to replace a damaged die or to vary the plastic pellet size requested by a particular customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 17} In response, A. Schulman argues first that R.C. 5701.03(A) should be construed in favor of taxpayers rather than the Tax Commissioner, because it is a definition of a subject of taxation, i.e., \u201cpersonal property,\u201d rather than an exemption. But this court has repeatedly noted that that statutory provision creates a tax <em>exemption </em>for dies, as well as other objects not at issue here. See, e.g., <em>Natl. Distillers &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 214, 217, 643 N.E.2d 101 (\u201cR.C. 5701.03 exempts drawings from the personal property tax\u201d); <em>Timken Co. v. Bindley, </em>17 Ohio St.3d at 86, 17 OBR 208, 477 N.E.2d 1121 (\u201cThe function of a particular device, rather than its form, is paramount in determining its exemption under R.C. 5701.03 as a * * * die\u201d); <em>Am. Book, </em>18 Ohio St.2d at 54, 47 O.O.2d 164, 247 N.E.2d 290 (holding certain printing plates to be \u201cexempt from taxation\u201d under R.C. 5701.03 because they were dies). As a tax-exemption provision, R.C. 5701.03(A) \u201cmust be strictly construed,\u201d <em>Campus Bus Serv. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 8, and the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>proof rests with A. Schulman \u201cto show that the property is entitled to exemption.\u201d R.C. 5715.271. A. Schulman has not met that burden.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b225-12\">Leonard A. Carlson; and Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Raymond D. Anderson, and Kevin M. Czerwonka, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ACA\">Marc Dann, Attorney General, and Barton A. Hubbard, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 18} The company also presses for what it calls a \u201cflexible\u201d definition of the term \u201cdie,\u201d but as explained above, the barrel-and-screw devices do not have the kind of specially designed surface required of dies, and they do not impose their shape on the molten plastic pellets that A. Schulman produces. The Tax Commissioner has already properly characterized as dies the pieces at the end of the barrel-and-screw assemblies, but only by sidestepping decades of precedent could the court characterize as dies the barrel-and-screw devices themselves. The BTA failed to accord the Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings the presumption of correctness that those findings deserved, and there is no reliable and probative evidence in the record to support the BTA\u2019s contrary conclusion designating the barrel-and-screw devices as dies.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b6 19} The Tax Commissioner also contends that no evidence in the record before the BTA demonstrates the cost of the barrel-and-screw devices for which A. Schulman sought a tax exemption. Absent that cost information \u2014 the Tax Commissioner argues \u2014 A. Schulman has not met its burden of proving the dollar value of the property that the company believes should be exempt from taxation. Because A. Schulman is not entitled to a tax exemption in any amount for the barrel-and-screw devices, we need not address this additional argument by the Tax Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">{\u00b6 20} We reverse the BTA\u2019s decision granting an R.C. 5701.03(A) exemption to A. Schulman\u2019s barrel-and-screw devices. Those devices are distinct from the dies that are exempt, and they do not themselves satisfy the definition of \u201cdies\u201d as the court has long defined that term. The BTA\u2019s decision designating the barrel-and-screw devices as dies and granting a tax exemption for them was unreasonable and unlawful given the absence of reliable and probative evidence refuting the Tax Commissioner\u2019s contrary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Decision reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-11\">Mover, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
