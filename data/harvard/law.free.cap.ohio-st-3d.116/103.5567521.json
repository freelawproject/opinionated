Here, that procedure was not followed, and the court never obtained jurisdiction over the case. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in my dissent in <em>Hughes, </em>I concur in the decision to remand with instructions to dismiss this appeal and add that this ought to have been the result in <em>Hughes </em>as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
