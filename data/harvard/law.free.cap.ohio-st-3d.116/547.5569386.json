We hold that the statute does not authorize suspension of the permit under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, WCI, Inc. (\u201cWCI\u201d), operates an adult nightclub in West Carrollton, Ohio. On February 6 and February 13, 2003, detectives from the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office were conducting undercover drug buys at the nightclub and made two separate purchases of cocaine from Brooke Orshoski, a dancer who was working at the club. WCI fired Orshoski that same month. Orshoski was subsequently indicted, and she was convicted of felony drug trafficking on October 20, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 3} On January 21, 2004, the Ohio Liquor Control Commission issued violation notices to WCI informing it that it was in violation of Ohio liquor laws, in part because of Orshoski\u2019s felony conviction. The commission subsequently issued a notice of hearing regarding Orshoski\u2019s violation. The hearing was held on May 19, 2004. At the hearing, WCI\u2019s manager testified that he terminated Orshoski before she was even indicted for the crime because he suspected that she was using or dealing drugs on the premises. Nevertheless, the commission suspended WCI\u2019s liquor permit for 30 days pursuant to R.C. 4301.25(A)(1), due to the commission\u2019s interpretation that it is irrelevant for purposes of the statute whether or not the permit holder still employed the employee at the time of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 4} WCI appealed that order to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and obtained a stay of the suspension. The trial court affirmed the commission\u2019s order with respect to the suspension related to Orshoski\u2019s conviction. On appeal, the Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions that it order the commission to dismiss its case. We accepted the commission\u2019s discretionary appeal to determine whether a former employee\u2019s conviction could be used to suspend a permit holder\u2019s liquor license pursuant to R.C. 4301.25(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 5} The issue presented is whether the commission was authorized under R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) to suspend WCI\u2019s liquor permit. R.C. 4301.25(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe liquor control commission may suspend or revoke any permit * * * for the following causes:</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(1) Conviction of * * * the holder\u2019s agent or employee * * * for a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In this case, WCI fired Orshoski well before she was convicted in October 2003. WCI contends that because Orshoski was not an employee <em>at the time of her conviction, </em>as contrasted with the time of the unlawful act underlying the conviction, the commission lacked authority under the statute to suspend WCI\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 9} We agree with WCI and the opinion of the court of appeals in this case, which relies on <em>Waterloo, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-1288, 2003-Ohio-3333, 2003 WL 21468904, and <em>Shotz Bar &amp; Grill, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 02AP-1141, 2003-Ohio-2659, 2003 WL 21196842 (Bowman, J., concurring). These opinions are grounded in the recognition that R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) is unambiguous and that under the plain meaning of the statute, the conviction must occur during the employee\u2019s employment with the permit holder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Waterloo </em>at \u00b6 10; <em>Shotz Bar &amp; Grill </em>at \u00b6 51 and 53. By its plain terms, the statute does not address a conviction of a former employee of a permit holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 10} The commission ignores the plain meaning of the statute and would have us hold that the statute means something other than what it says. The commission\u2019s position is predicated primarily on its belief that if the statute did require the convicted felon to be employed by the permit holder at the time of conviction, then permit holders would be able to allow their employees to engage in illegal activities but avoid license suspension by simply terminating the employees before they are convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 11} This interpretation is wrong for two reasons. First, when a statute is unambiguous, we should not attempt to determine what the legislature intended, but should instead merely apply the law as written. <em>Provident Bank v. Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 101, 105-106, 65 O.O.2d 296, 304 N.E.2d 378. And second, the commission\u2019s fear that permit holders could avoid penalties by firing employees before they are convicted is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 12} Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B) prohibits a wide range of misconduct. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[N]o permit holder, his agent, or employee shall knowingly or willfully allow in and upon his licensed premises any persons to:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) Engage in any disorderly activities;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) Appear in a state of nudity;</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) Engage in sexual activity as * * * defined in Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(4) Commit public indecency, as * * * defined in Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(5) Allow in, upon or about the licensed permit premises, or engage in or facilitate in, the possession, use, manufacture, transfer, or sale of any dangerous drug, controlled substance, narcotic, harmful intoxicant, counterfeit controlled substance, drug, drug paraphernalia, or drug abuse instrument as * * * defined in Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(6) Solicit for value, or possess, buy, sell, use, alter or transfer, or allow to be solicited, possessed, bought, sold, used, altered, or transferred for value USDA food stamp coupons, electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, WIC program benefit vouchers, or other electronically transmitted benefits, in a manner not specifically authorized by the Food Stamp Act of 1977, or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(7) Obtain or exert control over property or services of another, with purpose to deprive the owner thereof, without the consent of the owner or person authorized to consent, or by deception, fraud or threat. Nor shall any permit holder, his agent, or employee, use the licensed permit premises to receive, retain, or dispose of property of another, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe such property has been obtained through the commission of a theft offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">{\u00b6 21} Pursuant to this section, the triggering event for sanctions is not the employee\u2019s conviction but the permit holder\u2019s awareness of the employee\u2019s illegal conduct. Thus, the commission can punish a permit holder for its employee\u2019s behavior, regardless of whether the employee works for the permit holder when he or she is convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">{\u00b6 22} There must be a reason, therefore, why the commission may sanction a permit holder for both a conviction of an employee (R.C. 4301.25(A)(1)) and the actions of an employee that underlie the conviction (Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52). We maintain that Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52 is designed to prevent exactly what the commission in this case fears would result from the interpretation of R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) espoused in <em>Waterloo </em>and <em>Shotz Bar &amp; Grill: </em>It prevents a permit holder from allowing criminal conduct by its employees and then avoiding sanctions by firing the employees after they get caught but before they are convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">{\u00b6 23} By their terms, the statute and the Administrative Code section take into account that a permit holder has no control over whether a former employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>is convicted of illicit conduct in the permit holder\u2019s establishment but does have control over the continued employment of its employees. By sanctioning only those permit holders who fail to take remedial measures to ensure that the liquor establishment is not used for illicit behavior (by firing employees when it discovers that they are engaged in such behavior), R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) and Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52 provide protection to innocent permit holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 24} Although it is well settled that a liquor permit does not create a property right subject to traditional due process, <em>State ex rel. Zugravu v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 23, 27, 3 O.O. 74, 196 N.E. 664, it would be unfair not to recognize that this particular permit holder terminated its employee upon learning of her criminal conduct \u2014 likely in an effort to protect its own interest as well as its patrons. If we were to adopt the commission\u2019s position, however, we would be placing the future of an establishment\u2019s liquor permit in the hands of the employee and the employee\u2019s defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b625} As explained above, the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) is faithful to the text and to the regulatory scheme as a whole. Moreover, unlike the commission\u2019s interpretation, it does not require inserting words into the statute, which courts are forbidden to do. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 50, 524 N.E.2d 441, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, we hold that the commission does not have authority under R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) to suspend or revoke a permit holder\u2019s liquor permit when a former employee of the permit holder is convicted of a felony for an act committed while employed by the permit holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b667-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b667-10\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-12\">. This is the current version of R.C. 4301.25(A), which differs slightly from the version that was in effect at the time of the conviction in this case. See Am.Sub.H.B. No. 402,147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3310, 3325. The differences between the two versions are not substantive with respect to this case and do not alter our analysis herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\">.

It is a basic presumption in statutory construction that the General Assembly is not presumed to do a vain or useless thing and that when language is inserted in a statute it is inserted to accomplish some definite purpose. <em>State ex rel. Cleveland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Elec. Illum. Co. v. Euclid </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 476, 479, 8 O.O.2d 480, 159 N.E.2d 756. See also R.C. 1.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 29} As the commission argued before this court, reading the statute to require that the conviction and employment must be concurrent will allow a permit holder to easily evade its responsibility to maintain a permit premises free of illegal employee activity. A permit holder who knows of, or should know of, felonious employee conduct will now be able to allow the conduct to continue until the employee is caught. Then, the permit holder can insulate itself from any consequences simply by firing the employee before he or she is convicted. Thus, the majority\u2019s reading of the statute, in effect, divests the commission of its authority to proceed under R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) and renders the statute essentially meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 30} The majority contends that the Ohio Administrative Code prevents this type of mischief by permit holders. According to the majority, the commission has authority under Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B) to suspend a permit even if the permit holder fires the offending employee prior to his or her conviction, because the \u201ctriggering event for sanctions\u201d under that provision is the permit holder\u2019s awareness of the conduct, not the conviction. Majority Opinion at \u00b6 21. However, the list of prohibited conduct contained in Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B) is limited, and there are numerous felonies not covered by the administrative provision. There are many situations in which the commission could, in fact, be stripped of its ability to act. And although the commission could have elected to proceed in this case under the administrative regulation, it was not required to do so, because the conviction allowed it to proceed under R.C. 4301.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 31} The General Assembly\u2019s decision to include a conviction requirement in R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) was not without purpose. By requiring a conviction before the commission may take action against a permit holder, the statute protects the permit holder from losing its license without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an employee or former employee actually committed the felonious act. Additionally, the statute states that the commission <em>\u201cmay </em>suspend or revoke\u201d the permit. (Emphasis added.) Thus, if the commission determines that the permit holder did not know or have reason to know of its employee\u2019s illegal conduct, the commission is not required to suspend or revoke the holder\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 32} I believe that the General Assembly gave statutory authorization for the commission to act against permit holders under circumstances similar to those in this case to further the public-policy goal of <em>preventing </em>felonious activity in liquor establishments. Clearly the statute places a burden on the permit holder, who would be in the best position to prevent such activity. It imperils the holder\u2019s potential to sell liquor if the holder fails to take adequate preventive measures against felonious conduct by its employees and agents. In this case, the cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sales that led to Orshoski\u2019s felony conviction occurred inside the establishment and while Orshoski was working. Thus, the resulting conviction falls squarely within the scope of R.C. 4301.25(A)(1). Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, there is nothing in the language of R.C. 4301.25(A)(1) requiring the conviction to be contemporaneous with employment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b669-5\">Buckley King, L.P.A., Chris O.
