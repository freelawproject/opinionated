Washington </em>(2004), 541 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, and <em>State v. Stahl, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834. After careful review, we have concluded\u2019 that the statements made to the deputy sheriff were testimonial because the circumstances objectively indicate that no ongoing emergency existed and that the primary purpose of the police interrogation was to establish past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 3} Brian and Barbara Siler married in 1988 and had one child, Nathan, born in July 1998. In June 2001, Brian discovered that Barbara had been having an affair with one of her co-workers. In the ensuing weeks, Barbara placed several 911 calls to sheriffs deputies due to arguments with Brian. No criminal charges arose from these calls, but Barbara frequently expressed her fear of Brian to friends and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 4} On July 30, 2001, after an incident in which Brian allegedly choked her, Barbara obtained a civil protection order that required Brian to surrender his house keys and garage door openers and to stay at least 300 feet away from her; it also established a schedule for him to visit Nathan, who continued to live with Barbara. As a result, Brian moved in with his brother and sister-in-law, who lived about five or six miles away. Barbara subsequently filed for divorce, and Brian told several people that he wanted to hurt her as much as she had hurt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 5} On September 20, 2001, Duane Keener, Barbara\u2019s father, received a phone call from Barbara\u2019s employer, the accounting firm of Whitcomb <em>&amp; </em>Hess, expressing concern that she had not reported to work that day. After unsuccessfully trying to reach her by phone, Keener drove to her house. Upon arrival, he looked through the garage window, noticed that the door to her van was open, and discovered that he could open the side door to the garage by pushing on it. He entered and continued into the house but did not see anyone. Growing worried, he went back outside and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 6} Deputy Ron Singleton and Captain Richert of the Ashland County Sheriffs Office responded to the 911 call and met him around 2:00 p.m. They went into the garage and found Barbara Siler\u2019s body hanging from a yellow cord tied to the track of the overhead garage door. The Ashland County Coroner, Dr. William Emery, later estimated that her death occurred eight to ten hours earlier, sometime between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 7} Singleton continued into the house by himself and discovered three-year-old Nathan asleep in one of the bedrooms. Upon waking him, he carried Nathan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>outside through the garage to his grandfather, shielding the child from any view of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">{\u00b6 8} Detective Larry Martin, a trained child interviewer, arrived shortly thereafter wearing plain clothes with a vest that concealed his badge and gun. While Nathan sat on his grandfather\u2019s lap, Martin lay next to them on the ground and began talking to Nathan. Nathan eventually began to ask for his mother and to go back into the house; according to Martin, Nathan also said that his mother was in the garage \u201csleeping standing.\u201d As a result of the questioning, Martin learned that Nathan\u2019s father, Brian, had been there the previous night, that he had scared Nathan by banging on the door, and that he had fought with Barbara in the garage. Nathan also told Martin that Brian had placed the yellow rope around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">{\u00b6 9} The state indicted Brian Siler in December 2001 on two counts of aggravated murder with death-penalty specifications, two counts of domestic violence, and single counts of endangering children, aggravated burglary, and violation of a protection order. He pleaded not guilty, and a trial commenced in May 2002. As part of its case-in-chief, the state called Deputy Singleton and Detective Martin to testify about Nathan\u2019s statements, and, over Siler\u2019s repeated objections, the trial court admitted the testimony as excited utterances pursuant to Evid.R. 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 10} On direct examination, Singleton testified that when he carried Nathan from the house, he asked Nathan, \u201cWas daddy here today?\u201d to which Nathan answered \u201cno,\u201d and he testified that Nathan told him to \u201c[fjind mommy,\u201d pointing to the garage. On cross-examination, Singleton stated that Nathan did not cry or resist at any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 11} Martin testified that he had been briefed upon his arrival at the scene and before he began speaking with Nathan. He stated that when interviewing a child, he would \u201cattempt to identify what information the child might have as to what had happened.\u201d He further testified that when he asked Nathan if anything had scared him the night before, Nathan responded, \u201cDaddy did\u201d by \u201c[kjnocking loudly,\u201d and jumped up and demonstrated by banging on the front door. Martin stated that he asked if anything else had scared Nathan and that Nathan answered, \u201cDaddy, mommy fighting\u201d in the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 12} Martin also testified that 30 to 45 minutes into his questioning, Nathan said that he was hungry and thirsty, and Martin arranged for him to have lunch with Terrie Cato, a nurse employed by the Ashland County Sheriffs Office and a friend of Barbara and Brian Siler.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 13} Martin further stated that when they returned from lunch, he again spoke with Nathan, this time in the presence of Jenny Taylor, a children\u2019s services investigator who had arrived at the scene. He asked \u201cif anyone was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>hurting mommy,\u201d to which Nathan responded, \u201cDaddy did.\u201d Using a teddy bear that had been brought to the scene, Martin asked Nathan to demonstrate how daddy had hurt mommy, but Nathan did not respond. Martin then placed Taylor in different holds, asking Nathan, \u201cWas this how daddy was hurting mommy?\u201d When he placed his arm around the investigator\u2019s shoulder from behind, Nathan told him to move his arms up. Martin demonstrated, and Nathan said, \u201cyes,\u201d and began crying; until this point in the interrogation, Martin stated, the child had not seemed nervous, upset, or in any distress. Nathan told Martin that \u201cthe yellow thing\u201d held mommy upright in the garage, and, when Martin asked who put the yellow thing on her, the child responded, \u201cDaddy.\u201d Martin did not question him further.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">{\u00b6 14} Among other witnesses, the state also called Dr. Andrea McCollom, a forensic pathologist, who testified that Barbara\u2019s body displayed injuries that were inconsistent with suicide; rather, in her opinion, Barbara had been hanged after she had died from injuries caused by cervical compression consistent with a choke hold applied from behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 15} At the conclusion of the guilt phase of the trial, the jury found Siler guilty of all counts and specifications and, after the penalty phase, unanimously recommended the death penalty. However, the court rejected the recommendation and instead imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 16} Siler then appealed to the Ashland County Court of Appeals and raised several assignments of error, including a Sixth Amendment challenge to the admission of Nathan\u2019s statements to Martin. The appellate court overruled that assignment of error, determined that Nathan\u2019s statements were admissible as excited utterances pursuant to Evid.R. 803(2), and affirmed the convictions. <em>State v. Siler, </em>Ashland App. No. 02-COA-028, 2003-Ohio-5749, 2003 WL 22429053. We denied review of his appeal. <em>State v. Siler, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1489, 2004-Ohio-1293, 805 N.E.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">{\u00b6 17} Siler then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of the court of appeals, and remanded the case with instructions to reconsider the Sixth Amendment issue in light of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. <em>Siler v. Ohio </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 1019, 125 S.Ct. 671, 160 L.Ed.2d 494. On remand, the appellate court reversed Siler\u2019s convictions and remanded for a new trial, holding that Nathan\u2019s statements to Detective Martin were testimonial and that their admission during trial violated Siler\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him, stating that \u201cthere is presently no cognizable dispute concerning whether the child was unavailable * * * and whether defense counsel was given a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.\u201d <em>State v. Siler, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 680, 2005-Ohio-6591, 843 N.E.2d 863, \u00b6 49. The appellate court explained, \u201cMartin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>questioning of Nathan, although resulting in allowable \u2018excited utterances\u2019 under the Ohio Rules of Evidence, was nonetheless a structured police interrogation as envisioned in <em>Crawford, </em>and therefore constituted testimonial evidence.\u201d Id. The court further held that the erroneous \u201cadmission of Nathan\u2019s statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">{\u00b6 18} The state appealed the decision that Nathan\u2019s statements to Martin were testimonial, contending that the appellate court misapplied <em>Crawford </em>and contravened our subsequent holding in <em>Stahl </em>when it concluded that Nathan\u2019s statements were testimonial because they resulted from police interrogation. The state urges that Nathan\u2019s statements should not be considered testimonial, asking us to apply the objective-witness test established in <em>Stahl </em>and to consider the statements from the perspective of a three-year-old declarant, who could not have understood that his statements would be available for use at a later trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">{\u00b6 19} Siler, on the other hand, asserts that the objective-witness test adopted in <em>Stahl </em>is inapposite because <em>Stahl </em>involved statements made to a nurse for medical purposes, not to law-enforcement officers for investigatory purposes. He contends that in <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, the court set forth a different test that applies to statements generated from police interrogation, and he argues that <em>Davis </em>stands for the proposition that when the primary purpose of the police interrogation is to determine what has occurred in the past, without regard to an ongoing emergency, then the statements generated are testimonial for purposes of Confrontation Clause analysis, regardless of the age of the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, we are called upon to set forth an appropriate test for courts to apply when faced with a Sixth Amendment challenge to statements made by a child declarant in response to police interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\"><em>Crawford, Davis, </em>and <em>Stahl</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the proper analysis for determining whether out-of-court statements violate the Confrontation Clause is not whether they are reliable but, rather, whether they are testimonial. 541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The court went on to state that the Confrontation Clause does not apply to nontestimonial hearsay but that \u201c[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Id. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">{\u00b6 22} Although the court expressly declined to set forth a comprehensive definition for the term \u201ctestimonial,\u201d it described three \u201cformulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements,\u201d one of which includes statements \u201c \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, quoting the brief of amicus curiae National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The court further stated, \u201cWhatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; <em>and to police interrogations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 23} Two years after its decision in <em>Crawford, </em>the court revisited the issue of testimonial statements in the consolidated cases of <em>Davis v. Washington </em>and <em>Hammon v. Indiana, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. <em>Davis </em>involved statements that a domestic-violence victim made to a 911 operator identifying her assailant and describing his whereabouts immediately after an assault, while <em>Hammon </em>involved statements made to police officers responding to a domestic-violence complaint after they had secured the scene. Id. at 817-821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 24} In considering whether the statements in these cases were testimonial, the court distinguished between police interrogations that concern an ongoing emergency and those that relate to past criminal conduct. Id., 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. Thus, it formulated what courts around the country have come to refer to as the primary-purpose test (see, e.g., <em>People v. Geier </em>(2007), 41 Cal.4th 555, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 580, 161 P.3d 104; <em>State v. Kirby </em>(2006), 280 Conn. 361, 908 A.2d 506): \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">{\u00b6 25} Applying that test, the court determined that \u201cthe circumstances of [the 911] interrogation [in Davis] objectively indicate its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d Id. at 828, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. Accordingly, those statements were nontestimonial. Id. In <em>Hammon, </em>however, the court stated, \u201cObjectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime.\u201d Id., 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. Therefore, the court held that those statements were testimonial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>State v. Stahl, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, we considered whether an adult rape victim had made testimonial statements to a nurse practitioner during a medical examination at a hospital DOVE unit specializing in health care for victims of rape and domestic violence. There, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>analysis of a statement made to a medical professional, we adopted the objective-witness test from <em>Crawford, </em>stating, \u201cFor Confrontation Clause purposes, a testimonial statement includes one made \u2018under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. We further held, \u201cIn determining whether a statement is testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes, courts should focus on the expectation of the declarant at the time of making the statement; the intent of a questioner is relevant only if it could affect a reasonable declarant\u2019s expectations.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Stahl, </em>we expressly acknowledged <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>but distinguished them, stating, \u201cThey involve statements made to law-enforcement officers, while the statement at issue here covers one made to a medical professional at a medical facility for the <em>primary </em>purpose of receiving proper medical treatment and not investigating past events related to criminal prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) 111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, \u00b6 25. Applying the objective-witness test, instead, we concluded that the statements made by the rape victim to the nurse were nontestimonial because she \u201ccould have reasonably believed that although the examination conducted at the DOVE unit would result in scientific evidence being extracted for prosecution purposes, the statement would be used primarily for health-care purposes.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Primary-Purpose Test</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 28} Although the state and amicus curiae, the American Prosecutors Research Institute (\u201cAPRI\u201d), invite us to apply the objective-witness test, as we did in <em>Stahl, </em>we decline to do so because the primary-purpose test enunciated in <em>Davis </em>is the more appropriate analysis. Contrary to the assertions of the state and APRI, <em>Stahl </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case based on the identity of the interrogator and the purpose of the questioning. The distinction is as significant here as it was in <em>Stahl, </em>where we specifically concluded that the objective-witness test applied, rather than the primary-purpose test in <em>Davis, </em>because of the <em>lack </em>of a law-enforcement interrogator. 111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, \u00b6 25. Moreover, the court in <em>Davis </em>acknowledged that its \u201cholding is not an \u2018exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements\u2014 or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation,\u2019 <em>supra, </em>[547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224], but rather a resolution of the cases before us <em>and those like them.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 29} Since <em>Davis, </em>courts have consistently applied the primary-purpose test to statements that a child declarant made to police or those determined to be police agents, and we are aware of no courts that continue to apply the objective-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>witness test in such cases. See, e.g., <em>People v. Cage </em>(2007), 40 Cal.4th 965, 56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205 (15-year-old\u2019s statements to police); <em>People v. Sharp </em>(Colo.App.2006), 155 P.3d 577 (five-year-old\u2019s statements to forensic interviewer during visit arranged by police); <em>Hernandez v. State </em>(Fla.App.2007), 946 So.2d 1270 (statements made by child of unknown age to \u201cChild Protection Team\u201d nurse); <em>People v. Stechly </em>(2007), 225 Ill.2d 246, 312 Ill.Dec. 268, 870 N.E.2d 333 (five-year-old\u2019s statements to child-sex-abuse personnel); <em>State v. Henderson </em>(Kan.2007), 160 P.3d 776 (three-year-old\u2019s statements to police and child-protective-services worker); <em>State v. Justus </em>(Mo.2006), 205 S.W.3d 872 (three-year-old\u2019s statements to child-abuse investigators); <em>State v. Buda </em>(2006), 389 N.J.Super. 241, 912 A.2d 735 (three-year-old\u2019s statements to youth-services worker); <em>State v. Blue, </em>2006 N.D. 134, 717 N.W.2d 558 (four-year-old\u2019s statements to forensic interviewer with police observing); <em>In re S.R., </em>2007 Pa.Super. 79, 920 A.2d 1262 (four-year-old\u2019s statements to forensic interview specialist); <em>State v. Hooper </em>(Aug. 11, 2006), Payette App. No. 31025, 2006 WL 2328233 (Idaho) (six-year-old\u2019s statements to sexual trauma personnel during visit arranged and observed by police).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 30} Thus, we conclude that to determine whether a child declarant\u2019s statement made in the course of police interrogation is testimonial or nontestimonial, courts should apply the primary-purpose test: \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 31} Having determined that the primary-purpose test applies in this instance, we next consider the argument of the state and APRI that a child\u2019s statements to police are nontestimonial when the child, because of his or her age and limited understanding of court or trial, could not reasonably expect that those statements may be used in a later criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 32} We recognize, as did the court of appeals in this case, that \u201cyounger children have lesser reflective capabilities,\u201d <em>Siler, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 680, 2005-Ohio-6591, 843 N.E.2d 863, at \u00b6 9, citing <em>State v. Wagner </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 261, 30 OBR 458, 508 N.E.2d 164; we further acknowledge the authorities submitted by APRI indicating that children lack an understanding of court proceedings and testimony. See, e.g., R. Friedman, The Conundrum of Children, Confrontation, and Hearsay (2002), 65 Law &amp; Contemp.Prob. 243, 251-252.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The court\u2019s analysis in <em>Davis, </em>however, does not focus on the expectations of the declarant in order to determine whether statements are testimonial; rather, the test set forth in <em>Davis </em>centers on the statements and the objective circumstances indicating the primary purpose of the interrogation. 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. In this way, the argument by the state and APRI that we should focus on the cognitive limitations of a child who made the statements to police is inconsistent with the primary-purpose test.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">{\u00b6 34} The state and APRI cite numerous cases in support of their position that statements made by child declarants are nontestimonial because of their lack of understanding. Those cases are inapposite, however, because they do not concern statements that a child made to law-enforcement officers or to individuals held to be agents of law enforcement. See <em>People v. Vigil </em>(Colo.2006), 127 P.3d 916 (seven-year-old\u2019s statements to doctor, father, and father\u2019s friend); <em>Commonwealth v. DeOliveira </em>(2006), 447 Mass. 56, 849 N.E.2d 218 (six-year-old\u2019s statements to doctor); <em>State v.

Coulter </em>(2005), 62 M.J. 520 (two-year-old\u2019s statements to mother).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 35} Only one case cited by the state and APRI concludes that a child\u2019s statements made during a <em>police </em>interrogation were nontestimonial: <em>Lagunas v. State </em>(Tex.App.2005), 187 S.W.3d 503. There, police responding to a 911 call found an injured woman who had been abducted from her home but who had managed to escape her captor. She told the police that her two children, ages two and four, were still at home, and an officer was dispatched to check on their safety. Upon arrival, the officer entered the house, found the children in bed, and asked the four-year-old if everything was okay. As the <em>Lagunas </em>court recounted, \u201c[The child] responded that it wasn\u2019t and added, \u2018Her mommy was dead.\u2019 At this point, [the officer] asked [her] what happened to her mother. She responded, \u2018A bad man had killed her and took her away\u2019 and grew more upset. * * * He did not question [her] further.\u201d <em>Lagunas, </em>187 S.W.3d at 520. The Texas court of appeals concluded that the child\u2019s statements were nontestimonial after applying the objective-witness test, in which it considered the age of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>{\u00b6 36} The court\u2019s analysis and decision predated the establishment of the primary-purpose test in <em>Davis. </em>Moreover, although the court in <em>Lagunas </em>considered the child\u2019s age in its analysis, it specifically stated, \u201cWe need not decide now whether, as a general rule, statements by children are inherently non-testimonial or whether [the child\u2019s] age alone renders her statements non-testimonial.\u201d 187 S.W.3d at 519. Furthermore, the court\u2019s analysis paralleled the analysis in <em>Davis </em>by focusing on the purpose of the interrogation; as the <em>Lagunas </em>court explained, the officer\u2019s questioning of the child \u201cwas closer in nature to a preliminary question in which [the officer] sought to clarify [the child\u2019s] spontaneous statement that her mother was dead. There was not time to formulate careful, structured questioning. Instead, [the officer\u2019s] questions were consistent with the behavior of a reasonable adult seeking (in some ways successfully, in some ways not) to calm a frightened child in the middle of the night. Significantly, after calming [the child], [the officer] asked her no further questions regarding the circumstances of her mother\u2019s disappearance.\u201d Id. at 520. Thus, <em>Lagunas </em>supports the conclusion not only that the primary-purpose test is appropriate in cases involving police interrogation of a child but also that the declarant\u2019s age is not dispositive when determining whether statements to police are testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 37} We similarly distinguish <em>State v. Bobadilla </em>(Minn.2006), 709 N.W.2d 243, which APRI primarily relies upon for the proposition that a child\u2019s limited cognitive ability renders his statements nontestimonial. There, a three-year-old sex-abuse victim made statements to a child-protection worker during a risk-assessment interview while a police detective observed. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the child\u2019s statements were nontestimonial because \u201cthe interview of [the child] was initiated by a child-protection worker in response to a report of sexual abuse for the overriding purpose of assessing whether abuse occurred, and whether steps were therefore needed to protect the health and welfare of the child\u201d and because \u201cneither [the child] nor the child-protection worker were acting, to a substantial degree, in order to produce a statement for trial, and therefore [the child\u2019s] statements in the assessment interview were not testimonial.\u201d <em>Bobadilla, </em>709 N.W.2d at 255-256.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 38} Although the court acknowledged the child\u2019s limited cognitive abilities, this was not, as APRI claims, the focal point of its analysis; rather, the purpose of the interview constituted the dispositive issue: \u201cIf part of the purpose of this interview was to produce a statement for use at a future trial, such a purpose was at best incidental to the main purpose: assessing and responding to imminent risks to [the child\u2019s] health and welfare.\u201d Id. at 255. Moreover, as with <em>Lagunas, </em>the court decided <em>Bobadilla </em>without the benefit of the analysis that the United States Supreme Court set forth in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 39} We are aware of no case in which a court has concluded that a declarant\u2019s age rendered statements to police nontestimonial. Rather, courts have held that children\u2019s statements to police or police agents are testimonial in circumstances that indicate that no ongoing emergency existed and that the primary purpose of the interrogation was to establish past events potentially related to later criminal prosecution. See, e.g., <em>T.P. v. State </em>(Ala.Crim.App.2004), 911 So.2d 1117 (eight-year-old\u2019s statements to social worker and investigator as part of criminal investigation); <em>People v.

Henderson, </em>160 P.3d 776 (three-year-old\u2019s statements to police and child-protective-services worker); <em>State v.

Bordeaux </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 400 F.3d 548 (statements by child of unknown age to forensic interviewer).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 40} Significantly, several courts have expressly rejected the state\u2019s and APRI\u2019s argument that a child\u2019s statements are necessarily nontestimonial when the child would not be able to understand that the statements would be used in a later criminal proceeding. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>160 P.3d at 785, citing <em>State v. Justus, </em>205 S.W.3d 872 (\u201cA young victim\u2019s awareness, or lack thereof, that her statement would be used to prosecute, is not dispositive of whether her statement is testimonial\u201d); <em>State v. Snowden, </em>385 Md. at 89-90, 867 A.2d 314 (\u201cwe are unwilling to conclude that, as a matter of law, young children\u2019s statements cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>possess the same testimonial nature as those of other, more clearly competent declarants\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. DeOliveira, </em>447 Mass, at 66, 849 N.E.2d 218 (declining to adopt the same argument that APRI presents here); <em>People v. Vigil, </em>127 P.3d at 926, fn. 8 (\u201cif a child makes a statement to a government agent as part of a police interrogation, his statement is testimonial irrespective of the child\u2019s expectations regarding whether the statement will be available for use at a later trial\u201d); see, also, <em>State v. Hooper, </em>Payette App. No. 31025, 2006 WL 2328233, *17.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 41} Thus, we conclude that the age of a declarant is not determinative of whether a testimonial statement has been made during a police interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 42} Our conclusions in this case regarding a police interrogation of a child do not affect our decision in <em>Stahl, </em>which applied the objective-witness test to determine whether a declarant had made testimonial statements during an interview conducted by a nurse at a DOVE unit for purposes other than to investigate a past crime. In this regard, we agree with the Supreme Court of Illinois, in <em>People v. Stechly, </em>which recently concluded that the objective-witness test applied to statements that a five-year-old child made to her mother but that the primary-purpose test set forth in <em>Davis </em>applied to statements that she made during an interrogation conducted by an agent of the police. 225 Ill.2d at 299-302, 312 Ill.Dec. 268, 870 N.E.2d 333. See, also, <em>Vigil, </em>127 P.3d at 926, fn. 8 (applying the objective-witness test to a child\u2019s statements to a nonpolice questioner but stating that the child\u2019s statements to police during an investigation are testimonial regardless of child\u2019s expectations); and <em>State v. Mechling </em>(2006), 219 W.Va. 366, 633 S.E.2d 311 (the objective-witness test applies, generally, but statements generated from police interrogation require application of the analysis in <em>Davis)-, </em>but see <em>State v. Alvarez </em>(App.2006), 213 Ariz. 467, 143 P.3d 668; and <em>People v. Cage, </em>40 Cal.4th 965, 56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205 (holding that after <em>Davis, </em>the objective-witness test no longer applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Application of the Primary-Purpose Test in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 43} The record reveals that before Detective Martin arrived at the scene, Deputy Singleton had entered the home, awakened Nathan, and taken him outside. The Ashland County Sheriffs Office had secured the crime scene and had begun its investigation into Barbara\u2019s death. Martin testified that he had been biiefed before he began questioning Nathan, that Nathan did not appear nervous or upset, and that Nathan was sitting in his grandfather\u2019s lap during the questioning. Thus, this record does not reflect the existence of an ongoing emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 44} Martin identified the primary purpose of Nathan\u2019s questioning when he testified that he would \u201cattempt to identify what information the child might have as to what had happened.\u201d In addition, Nathan\u2019s statements concerned what had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>occurred the night before in relation to Martin\u2019s effort to establish past events possibly relevant to a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">{\u00b6 45} The interrogation before us parallels that in <em>Hammon, </em>where the court stated: \u201cIt is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct * * *. There was no emergency in progress; the interrogating officer testified that he had heard no arguments or crashing and saw no one throw or break anything * * *. When the officers first arrived, [the declarant] told them that things were fine, * * * and there was no immediate threat to her person.\u201d 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. The court further stated, \u201c[The declarant\u2019s] statements were neither a cry for help nor the provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation * * Id., 547 U.S. at 832, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 46} As the court stated with respect to the interrogation in <em>Hammon, </em>\u201cObjectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime * * Id., 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. We conclude that the same is true of this interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 47} In conformity with <em>Davis </em>and the weight of authority in other jurisdictions, we conclude that Nathan made testimonial statements to Detective Martin, and as a result we are constrained to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. We further agree with the statement by the court of appeals that, for purposes of remand, the Confrontation Clause \u201c \u2018does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siler, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 680, 2005-Ohio-6591, 843 N.E.2d 863, \u00b6 51, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, fn. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and McGrath, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b167-10\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b167-11\">Patrick M.

Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, and our examination of Ohio law regarding what statements are testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, I believe we should articulate clear guidance for judges who must make these decisions initially. In <em>State v. Stahl, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-5482, 855 N.E.2d 834, we declined to expand the definition of \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d to include statements made to a medical professional for purposes of receiving medical treatment or diagnosis. In <em>Stahl, </em>we adopted the \u201cobjective witness\u201d formulation set forth in <em>Crawford </em>to discover whether statements were made \u201c \u2018under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stahl </em>at \u00b6 36, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. We adopted the objective-witness test not because the declarant was an adult but because of the identity of the questioner \u2014 a medical professional, rather than a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 50} In analyzing whether statements are testimonial, the identity of the questioner is the first issue to resolve. Whenever the interrogators are members of law enforcement, the rule regarding any statements made by a declarant in response is governed by the primary-purpose test, as explained in <em>Davis v. Washington </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. If the primary purpose of the police questioning is to elicit statements that relate to an ongoing emergency, the statements are nontestimonial; if the primary purpose is to prove past events that relate to a potential criminal prosecution, they are testimonial. I agree with paragraph two of the syllabus, which makes it clear that age is irrelevant when a declarant is under police interrogation. In other words, the primary-purpose test is used if the police are questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 51} Assuming the questioner is not a member of law enforcement, as was the case in <em>Stahl, </em>the objective-witness standard (at least for an adult) applies: whether the statement was \u201cmade under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 52} The majority opinion frames the issue of the instant ease to set forth \u201can appropriate test for courts to apply when faced with a Sixth Amendment challenge to statements made by a child declarant <em>in response to police interrogation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, to the extent that the majority discusses consequences of statements made by children to interrogators who are not law enforcement, the opinion exceeds its self-imposed boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 53} In my view, it is still an open question whether children, by virtue of their reasoning abilities, should be subject to the objective-witness standard as expressed in <em>Stahl </em>when they are questioned by those other than police officers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>We should hesitate to express dicta on this issue when the ramifications on any-ruling regarding testimonial statements can be so great, particularly where the child is the victim as well as the witness, in, for example, sexual abuse cases. I therefore dissent as to the portion of the opinion that exceeds the issue of the police interrogation of children.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b169-7\">Ramona Francesconi Rogers, Ashland County Prosecuting Attorney, and Joyce Anderson, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZ-\">David H.
