Zurz have filed a motion for leave to intervene as respondents and a motion to dismiss. Amicus curiae Associated Builders <em>&amp; </em>Contractors, Inc., Central Ohio Chapter, has filed a motion for leave to file a memorandum opposing respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">{\u00b6 3} The motion for leave to intervene is granted. The motion of amicus curiae for leave to file a memorandum in opposition is also granted. On S.CtPrac.R. X(5) determination, the motions to dismiss are granted.

Rather, it involves a procedural issue concerning the legal effect of the Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) notice of voluntary dismissal filed by Vaughn Industries, L.L.C., on June 28, 2007, following a hearing in the common pleas court, which Vaughn filed before the court journalized an entry on the ruling it had announced in open court regarding Vaughn\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 5} Because a notice of dismissal does not require action by the court, <em>State ex rel. Hummel v. Sadler, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 84, 2002-Ohio-3605, 771 N.E.2d 853, the notice operated to remove the case from the jurisdiction of the trial court. As we stated in <em>Hummel, </em>\u201cwhen a trial court unconditionally dismisses a case <em>or a case has been voluntarily dismissed under Civ.R. 41(A)(1), </em>the trial court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed, and a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 22, citing <em>Page v. Riley </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 621, 710 N.E.2d 690. We held similarly in <em>State ex rel. Hunt v. Thompson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 182, 183, 586 N.E.2d 107, and stated that where a plaintiff files a notice of dismissal, \u201cthe court, consequently, loses jurisdiction over the case.\u201d See also <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 656 N.E.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 6} I recognize that Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) requires that a party file a notice of dismissal \u201cbefore the commencement of trial.\u201d In my view, however, trial has not commenced in this case. A hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction is not a \u201ctrial\u201d precluding voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cpreliminary injunction\u201d as \u201c[a] temporary injunction issued <em>before or during trial </em>to prevent an irreparable injury from occurring before the court has a chance to decide the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 800. Thus, an evidentiary hearing on a preliminary injunction is not a trial, but instead is an action to prevent injury <em>pending the outcome of </em>a trial. This view is in accord with R.C. 2505.02(A)(3), which includes preliminary injunctions within the definition of the term \u201cprovisional remedy.\u201d A provisional remedy, as the statute defines it, \u201cmeans a proceeding <em>ancillary </em>to an action, including, but not limited to, <em>a proceeding for a preliminary inunction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, by definition, preliminary injunctions are ancillary to an underlying action, and, logically, a hearing on such an injunction <em>is not the equivalent of a trial on the merits. </em>Thus, I dissent from the majority\u2019s dismissal of this action because Vaughn Industries, L.L.C., filed a notice of dismissal prior to the commencement of trial and thereby unambiguously divested the trial court of jurisdiction to act in this case. Accordingly, I would deny the motion to dismiss and grant an alternative writ in this matter.</p>\n<judges id=\"b699-7\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>Andrews &amp; Wyatt, L.L.C., David T.
