This cause is pending before the court as a discretionary appeal. It appears from the records of the court that Leticia V. Banez has not filed a memorandum in response and in support of her cross-appeal, due November 19, 2007, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">It is ordered by the court that the cross-appeal is dismissed sua sponte. The appeal of Ramon V. Banez remains pending.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
