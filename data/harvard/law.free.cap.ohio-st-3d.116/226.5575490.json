Norton of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0071563, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline has recommended that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for six months, all stayed on conditions, based on findings that he neglected two clients\u2019 cases, failed to advise the clients that he lacked malpractice insurance, and failed to cooperate in efforts to investigate alleged misconduct. On review, we agree that respondent violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and that a six-month stayed suspension is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Cleveland Bar Association, charged respondent with four counts of professional misconduct, later dismissing Count III of the complaint along with several allegations of impropriety contained within Counts I, II, and IV. A panel of the board heard the cause and, based on the parties\u2019 extensive stipulations and other evidence, made findings of misconduct and recommended a one-year license suspension, all stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct but modified the recommendation to the stayed six-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">(\u00b6 4} Neither party has objected to the board\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 The <em>Todd Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">{\u00b6 5} In early February 2005, Linda Todd, a nurse at a healthcare facility, slipped and fell in the facility\u2019s parking lot. While Todd was receiving workers\u2019 compensation, her employer discharged her for missing work. Todd agreed to have respondent file a retaliation claim on her behalf, and respondent advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Todd\u2019s former employer that she anticipated filing a claim for unlawful retaliation under R.C. 4123.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 6} Todd signed a retainer agreement in which respondent promised to investigate and file her claim on a contingent-fee basis. The agreement also provided for respondent\u2019s withdrawal if he determined \u201cat any time that prosecution is not feasible.\u201d Respondent had no professional-liability insurance while representing Todd but failed to so advise his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 7} Over the next few months, Todd sent respondent copies of her medical records and a written account detailing her accident. She also repeatedly called respondent to ask questions about her case. Respondent did not return a number of those calls, but in early May 2005, he emailed Todd and asked about the possibility of settling her case. Todd sent respondent information about her economic losses, and respondent promised to relay a settlement offer to her former employer. He never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 8} Over the next several weeks, Todd again had difficulty getting respondent to return her calls. In June 2005, Todd expressed in an email to respondent her dissatisfaction with his progress and her concern over an impending 180-day statute of limitations deadline. Respondent did not reply to the email, or file suit on Todd\u2019s behalf, or do any other work in the case for the rest of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 9} In February 2006, respondent called Todd\u2019s home, apparently because he heard that she had inquired about him from his former law firm, and told her husband that he was withdrawing from her case. On February 23, 2006, respondent sent Todd\u2019s case file to her with a letter advising that he could not continue representing her. He explained: \u201cI am not withdrawing from your case because it lacks merit, but because the dollar losses are too low to justify litigating this case on a contingent fee basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent suggested in his letter that Todd hire another attorney. He did not, however, describe her claim as one for retaliation under R.C. 4123.90. He instead referred to Todd\u2019s case as a wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, citing cases including <em>Coolidge v. Riverdale Local School Dist., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 141, 2003-Ohio-5357, 797 N.E.2d 61, syllabus (\u201cAn employee who is receiving temporary total disability compensation pursuant to R.C. 4123.56 may not be discharged solely on the basis of absenteeism or inability to work, when the absence or inability to work is directly related to an allowed condition\u201d) and advising that a four-year statute of limitations applied. Respondent then wished Todd \u201cgood luck,\u201d saying nothing about the statute of limitations in R.C. 4123.90, which had by that time elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent did not disclose his lack of malpractice insurance, failed to complete promised work, and then dropped Todd\u2019s case. Respondent has admitted, and we agree, that he thereby violated DR 1-104(A) (requiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>lawyer to advise clients if the lawyer does not carry sufficient malpractice insurance), 2-110(A)(2) (requiring a lawyer to take reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client before withdrawing from representation), 2-110(C)(5) (requiring a lawyer to obtain a client\u2019s free and knowing assent before withdrawing from representation when the lawyer is not otherwise justified in withdrawing under the rule), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(l) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to seek the lawful objectives of a client), and 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract for professional employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 The <em>Torres Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 12} In August 2004, Frances Torres retained respondent to represent her in a personal injury claim against an ice cream manufacturer after she choked on a foreign object while eating one of the manufacturer\u2019s products. Torres signed a retainer agreement in which respondent promised to investigate and file her claim on a contingent-fee basis. Torres also gave respondent the foreign object and the product packaging to help him prepare the case. Respondent had no professional-liability insurance while representing Torres and did not so advise his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent contacted the ice cream manufacturer in early September 2004 to advise of the Torres claim, and a claims representative asked for evidence of the incident and injury. Respondent provided this evidence but then took no action in the case until November 2005, when Torres threatened to file a grievance against him. Before then, Torres had tried repeatedly to contact respondent, but he had not returned many of her calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 14} Within a week after Torres\u2019s warning, respondent sent a settlement demand to the claims representative and, for approximately six months, tried to negotiate a settlement. Torres submitted her grievance to relator in December 2005 but, by March 2006, she had reconsidered and decided to keep respondent as her lawyer. Respondent ultimately obtained a settlement offer that Torres accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent did not disclose to Torres his lack of malpractice insurance or properly communicate with her about her case. He stipulated, and we agree, that he thereby violated DR 1-104(A) and 6-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\"><em>Count IV </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to Cooperate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">{\u00b6 16} In December 2005, relator sent two certified letters to respondent, requesting a written response to the Torres grievance and another grievance. Respondent received the letters but did not reply as requested. Relator sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>respondent two more letters in January 2006, this time requesting his responses by February 3, 2006. Respondent did not reply as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent did, however, appear in March 2006 in response to a subpoena for his deposition and answered questions about the two grievances. Since that time, respondent has cooperated appropriately with efforts to investigate allegations of his misconduct. Respondent admitted and we agree that his initial unresponsiveness violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring a lawyer to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 18} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 316, 320, 720 N.E.2d 525. Before making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). See id. See, also, <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, and <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Glatki </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 381, 726 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent may not have caused his clients financial loss \u2014 Todd\u2019s claim arguably remained actionable under <em>Coolidge, </em>she found another job at the same salary to mitigate her damages, and respondent successfully settled Torres\u2019s claim. He nevertheless injured his clients by shrugging off their legitimate expectations that he would diligently pursue their interests. He also failed the legal profession and the public by ignoring the inquiries of disciplinary authorities charged with monitoring the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 20} In his defense, respondent insisted that he did not deliberately ignore his clients. He explained that he had simply \u201cbitten off more than he could chew\u201d while trying to practice on his own for the first time. Respondent described his misconduct as careless mistakes and assured that he has since taken steps to improve the way he does business.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">{\u00b6 21} In recommending a one-year stayed suspension, the panel cited <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Micciulla, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 19, 2005-Ohio-3470, 830 N.E.2d 332, in which we imposed this sanction and probation on a lawyer who had committed six counts of misconduct. That lawyer neglected four clients\u2019 eases, failed to seek the clients\u2019 objectives, failed to carry out his professional employment contracts, and failed to disclose his lack of malpractice insurance. That lawyer also commingled and did not properly account for clients\u2019 funds in violation of DR 9-102(A)(2) and (B)(3), and he intentionally injured two clients\u2019 interests in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of DR 7-101(A)(3). The incidents of misconduct in <em>Micciulla </em>more than marginally surpass respondent\u2019s improprieties.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent has expressed remorse and faced up to his wrongdoing, a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). He has no prior disciplinary record, see BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), and has obtained malpractice insurance. Through the testimony of colleagues and clients, respondent has also established his good character and reputation apart from the underlying misconduct. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e). Finally, the aggravation evidence is fairly minimal \u2014 respondent acted in his own financial interest in dropping the Todd case, but he did not do anything dishonest. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 23} In support of its recommendation, the board also cited <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Watson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 298, 2005-Ohio-4983, 834 N.E.2d 809. In <em>Watson, </em>we suspended a lawyer\u2019s license for six months, but stayed the suspension, because he neglected a client\u2019s divorce case by failing to properly supervise a paralegal and then failing to disclose that he lacked malpractice insurance. Respondent\u2019s neglect and failure to disclose are comparable to the improprieties committed in <em>Watson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 24} Moreover, the board recommended as a condition of the six-month stay that respondent be required to pursue continuing legal education (\u201cCLE\u201d) in law-office and case-file management, apparently attributing most of respondent\u2019s problems to poor organizational skills in his practice. We agree with this assessment. In cases of lawyers with similar problems, we have stayed six-month suspensions on the same condition. See <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Sebree, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 50, 2002-Ohio-2987, 770 N.E.2d 1009; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Harp </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 385, 745 N.E.2d 1032; <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Wilson </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 243, 730 N.E.2d 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the suspension is stayed on the conditions that respondent complete six hours of CLE in law-office and case-file management and commit no further misconduct during the suspension period. If respondent fails to comply with the conditions of the stay, the stay shall be lifted, and respondent shall serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b346-10\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Harold Reader and Gregory J.
