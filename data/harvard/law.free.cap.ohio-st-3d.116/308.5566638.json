Because the appellant had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to raise his claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">{\u00b6 2} In 1999, the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court convicted appellant, Steven A. Golson, of two counts of aggravated robbery, one count of kidnapping, and firearm specifications for each count and sentenced him to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>aggregate prison term of 29 years. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Golson </em>(Mar. 9, 2001), Montgomery App. No. 17707, 2001 WL 227372. We did not accept Golson\u2019s further appeal for review. <em>State v. Golson, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 1463, 2003-Ohio-644, 783 N.E.2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2007, Golson filed a petition in the Warren County Court of Appeals for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellee, Lebanon Correctional Institution Warden Ernie Moore, to release him from prison. Golson claimed that the trial court had improperly enhanced his sentence, relying on <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470; <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403; and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, among other cases. Moore filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss Golson\u2019s petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court of appeals granted the motion and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 4} In his appeal as of right, Golson asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition. For the following reasons, Golson\u2019s assertion lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 5} First, \u201c \u2018[w]e have consistently held that sentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Sneed v. Anderson, 114 </em>Ohio St.3d 11, 2007-Ohio-2454, 866 N.E.2d 1084, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Majoros v. Collins </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 442, 443, 596 N.E.2d 1038. Golson \u201chas or had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law, e.g., appeal and postconviction relief, for review of any alleged sentencing error.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jaffal v. Calabrese, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 440, 2005-Ohio-2591, 828 N.E.2d 107, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 6} Second, in <em>Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, at \u00b6 104, we limited the application of our holding \u2014 that certain sentencing statutes were unconstitutional because they required judicial fact-finding before imposition of a more severe sentence \u2014 to cases pending on direct review. In those cases in which <em>Foster </em>applied, we ordered new sentencing hearings rather than release from prison. We also did not hold that extraordinary relief in habeas corpus is available to rectify sentencing errors. See also <em>Wells v. Bradshaw, </em>Richland App. No. 06CA35, 2006-Ohio-4636, 2006 WL 2578358, \u00b6 14-16 <em>(Foster </em>does not support habeas corpus claim). The decisions Golson relies on do not apply retroactively to cases that are already final on direct review. See generally <em>In re Dean </em>(C.A.11, 2004), 375 F.3d 1287, 1290; <em>Humphress v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 398 F.3d 855; <em>State v. Robinson, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-368, 2006-Ohio-6649, 2006 WL 3703977, \u00b6 9 <em>(\u201cBlakely </em>does not recognize a new federal or state right that applies retroactively\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 7} Finally, the fact that Golson has already unsuccessfully pursued a direct appeal of his sentence does not entitle him to the requested extraordinary relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Sneed, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 11, 2007-Ohio-2454, 866 N.E.2d 1084, at \u00b6 9, citing <em>Russell v. Mitchell </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 328, 703 N.E.2d 1249.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b426-8\">Steven A. Golson, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-u4\">Marc Dann, Attorney General, and Diane Mallory, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 8} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals properly dismissed Golson\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
