Jeffrey Roush, of Lima, Ohio, engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by posing as a licensed attorney, seeking employment with a law firm, and attempting to represent clients. The Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law found that respondent had practiced law in Ohio without a license and recommends that we enjoin his illegal acts and impose a civil penalty of $1,000. We agree that respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and that an injunction and civil penalty are warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">(\u00b6 2} A panel of the board considered this case on the parties\u2019 stipulations of facts and waiver of notice and hearing. See Gov.Bar R. VII(7)(H). The panel found, consistent with the parties\u2019 stipulation, that respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law but that the civil penalty authorized by Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) was inappropriate. The board accepted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but it recommended a $1,000 fine with the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">{\u00b6 3} Neither party objects to the board report.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Respondent Engaged in the Unauthorized Practice of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent graduated in 1999 from the University of Cincinnati College of Law but never passed the Ohio bar examination. He is thus not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio, nor has he been admitted to practice in any other jurisdiction. Respondent nevertheless held himself out as a licensed attorney to the law firm that later hired him, to prospective and current clients of that firm, and to lawyers and others outside the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent accepted employment with Vidmar &amp; Hardesty, Ltd., in December 2005 after lying to attorneys in the firm about his qualifications to practice in this state and in North Carolina. Along with other false information, respondent provided the firm fictitious attorney-registration numbers for Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and North Carolina and a fabricated report of his supposed malpractice insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">{\u00b6 6} While employed by Vidmar &amp; Hardesty, respondent solicited business from at least two prospective clients for the law firm and gave those clients legal advice. He counseled one prospective client regarding an advantageous corporate business structure. For another, he recommended estate-planning strategies.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent also participated in settlement negotiations on behalf of a different client in North Carolina, and he prepared a settlement and release agreement to resolve that case. Respondent prepared other contracts, including at least one that defined a joint business venture. A licensed attorney reviewed the contracts that respondent prepared, but respondent acted without direction or oversight in his consultations with clients and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 8} Upon discovering respondent\u2019s deception in February 2006, Vidmar &amp; Hardesty summarily discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 9} Section 2(B)(1)(g), Article IV, Ohio Constitution confers on this court original jurisdiction as to \u201c[ajdmission to the practice of law, the discipline of persons so admitted, and all other matters relating to the practice of law.\u201d Our jurisdiction thus extends to regulating the unauthorized practice of law. The unauthorized practice of law is \u201cthe rendering of legal services for another by any person not admitted to practice in Ohio under Rule I and not granted active status under Rule VI, or certified under Rule II, Rule IX, or Rule XI of the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar of Ohio.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 10} By holding himself out as a member of the Ohio bar to prospective clients and others without possessing a license to practice law in this state, respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 114, 2003-Ohio-2568, 789 N.E.2d 210; <em>Medina Cty. Bar Assn. v. Flickinger, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 498, 2002-Ohio-2483, 769 N.E.2d 822. See also R.C. 4705.07(A)(1) and (2) and 4705.99 (impersonating an attorney is a misdemeanor of the first degree). He engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by advising another person in corporate structuring strategies. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Verne, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 50, 2003-Ohio-2463, 788 N.E.2d 1064; <em>Miami Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wyandt &amp; Silvers, Inc., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 259, 2005-Ohio-6430, 838 N.E.2d 655. Respondent also engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by representing others\u2019 interests during settlement negotiations. <em>Akron Bar Assn, v. Bojonell </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 154, 724 N.E.2d 401; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Moore </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 583, 722 N.E.2d 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The Recommended Injunction and Civil Penalty Are Warranted</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 11} Having found that respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. We accept the board\u2019s recommendation to issue an injunction prohibiting these and all other acts constituting the practice of law. We also accept the board\u2019s recommendation, made in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement, for an injunction prohibiting respondent from ever again applying for admission to the Ohio bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 12} Last, we consider the board\u2019s recommendation for a $1,000 civil penalty. Under Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B), the board may recommend civil penalties in an amount up to $10,000 per offense based on the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(1) The degree of cooperation provided by the respondent in the investigation;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(2) The number of occasions that unauthorized practice of law was committed;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(3) The flagrancy of the violation;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(4) Harm to third parties arising from the offense; [and]</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(5) Any other relevant factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">{\u00b6 18} Under UPL Reg. 400(F), which supplements Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B)(5), the \u201cother relevant factors\u201d are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(1) Whether relator has sought imposition of a civil penalty and, if so, the amount sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(2) Whether the imposition of civil penalties would further the purposes ofGovBarR. VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(3) Aggravation. The following factors may be considered in favor of recommending a more severe penalty:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(a) Whether respondent has previously engaged in the unauthorized practice of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(b) Whether respondent has previously been ordered to cease engaging in the unauthorized practice of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(c) Whether the respondent had been informed prior to engaging in the unauthorized practice of law that the conduct at issue may constitute an act of the unauthorized practice of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(d) Whether respondent has benefited from the unauthorized practice of law and, if so, the extent of any such benefit;</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(e) Whether respondent\u2019s unauthorized practice of law included an appearance before a court or other tribunal;</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201c(f) Whether respondent\u2019s unauthorized practice of law included the preparation of a legal instrument for filing with a court or other governmental entity; and</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(g) Whether the respondent has held himself or herself out as being admitted to practice law in the State of Ohio, or whether respondent has allowed others to mistakenly believe that he or she was admitted to practice law in the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(4) Mitigation. The following factors may be considered in favor of recommending no penalty or a less severe penalty:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(a) Whether respondent has ceased engaging in the conduct under review;</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(b) Whether respondent has admitted or stipulated to the conduct under review;</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(c) Whether respondent has admitted or stipulated that the conduct under review constitutes the unauthorized practice of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(d) Whether respondent has agreed or stipulated to the imposition of an injunction against future unauthorized practice of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(e) Whether respondent\u2019s conduct resulted from a motive other than dishonesty or personal benefit;</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(f) Whether respondent has engaged in a timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify the consequences of the unauthorized practice of law; and</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(g) Whether respondent has had other penalties imposed for the conduct at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">{\u00b6 37} The board acknowledged the mitigating factors that respondent is no longer attempting to practice law, that he cooperated in the board proceedings, and that he has admitted his wrongdoing. The board, however, found respondent\u2019s pretense tantamount to fraud, complete with lies and fabrications to perpetuate the ruse. The board concluded that the flagrancy of respondent\u2019s conduct outweighed all mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">{\u00b6 38} Respondent is accountable for a $1,000 civil penalty and has agreed never to reapply for admission to the Ohio bar. Our order enjoining the filing of such an application will ensure that he does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">{\u00b6 39} Respondent is hereby enjoined from holding himself out as a licensed attorney, giving legal advice, and participating on behalf of others in settlement negotiations, and engaging in any other acts constituting the practice of law. Respondent is also enjoined from ever again applying for admission to the Ohio bar, including any application to take the bar examination. Respondent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>further ordered to pay, pursuant to Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B), a civil penalty of $1,000.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b438-9\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Lori J.
