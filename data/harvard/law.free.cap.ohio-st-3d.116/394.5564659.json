The issue before us is whether the terms \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d as used in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (\u201cTCPA\u201d), Section 227, Title 47, U.S.Code, and the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in the Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d), R.C. Chapter 1345, require that a defendant merely act in a manner that violates the acts or whether the defendant must also know that the conduct violates the laws. We hold that a defendant need know only that it acted or failed to act in a certain manner \u2014 i.e., the facts underlying the offense, not that it knew that the conduct itself violated a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On December 9, 2003, appellant Phillip Charvat received a prerecorded message on his home telephone number from appellees, Thomas N. Ryan, D.D.S., and Thomas N. Ryan, D.D.S., Inc. (collectively, \u201cRyan\u201d) advertising various dental services. Ryan\u2019s call was made using automated dialing equipment. After listening to the message, Charvat sent a letter to Ryan, demanding a copy of the office\u2019s \u201cdo not call\u201d policy. Ryan never sent a copy of the policy to Charvat.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 3} On January 20, 2004, Charvat filed a complaint in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court, setting forth claims for multiple violations of the TCPA and the CSPA. Charvat asked for the statutory damages allowed by the federal and state laws, the treble damages allowed by the TCPA, the attorney fees allowed by the CSPA, and a permanent injunction. The facts are undisputed: Ryan admits a single violation of the TCPA but also emphasizes that he acted in good faith in attempting to comply with the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 4} Ryan filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that Charvat\u2019s damages were limited to a single TCPA violation, and Charvat responded that the unauthorized call constituted four violations, since it violated four TCPA provisions. The trial court rejected Charvat\u2019s argument and found Ryan liable for two violations of the TCPA: one for leaving the message and a second for failing to send Charvat a \u201cdo not call\u201d policy. Charvat was awarded damages for a single violation of the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted summary judgment for Ryan on the remaining TCPA and CSPA claims. Specifically, the court declined to award treble damages under the TCPA, finding that Ryan did not act with the required culpable mental state. Quoting <em>Charvat v. Colorado Prime, Inc. </em>(Sept. 17, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 97APG09-1277, 1998 WL 634922, the court held that \u201c\u2018[a] defendant must affirmatively know it is violating a <em>regulation </em>when making the telephone call for purposes of the treble damages provision.\u2019 \u201d The court also determined that attorney fees were not appropriate under the CSPA because \u201c \u2018knowledge\u2019 means actual awareness that an act was a violation of the CSPA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, Charvat challenged the trial court\u2019s refusal to award treble damages or attorney fees. Regarding the federal law, the Tenth District Court of Appeals held that Charvat was entitled to statutory damages for the delivery of the message, in violation of Section 227(b)(1)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code, and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>failure to send the \u201cdo not call\u201d policy, in violation of Section 64.1200(d)(1), Title 47, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals held, however, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the violation that resulted from the call was not willful. The court held that Ryan did commit two separate violations in a single call by failing to identify his business and his telephone number. The court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court to weigh the \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cwillful\u201d status for the violations as well as for the failure to send the \u201cdo not call\u201d policy to Charvat. The court also affirmed the denial of attorney fees under the CSPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 8} Charvat applied for reconsideration and then filed a motion for certification that a conflict existed over the interpretation of \u201cknowingly\u201d under the TCPA. The Tenth District determined that its decision conflicted with the Sixth District\u2019s decision in <em>Reickenbach v. Financial Freedom Ctrs., Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1357, 2004-Ohio-6164, 2004 WL 2634624. Accordingly, the court of appeals certified the following issue: \u201cWhether a defendant \u2018knowingly\u2019 violates Section 227(b), Title 47, U.S.Code, or the regulations promulgated thereunder, for purposes of awarding treble damages under Section 227(b)(3), where the plaintiff demonstrates that the defendant had knowledge of the facts constituting the offense; or whether the plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew when it placed the offending call that the call constituted a violation of the TCPA or any regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 9} We determined that a conflict exists and also accepted two propositions of law from Charvat\u2019s discretionary appeal. The first proposition deals with the meaning of the terms \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d in the TCPA for the purpose of awarding treble damages, and the second concerns the meaning of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under the CSPA. We will discuss the federal and then the state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">II. Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">A. Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Section 227, Title 47, U.S.Code</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 10} The TCPA restricts the use of automated telephone equipment. See Section 227(b), Title 47, U.S.Code. Enacted in 1991 in response to \u201cthe burgeoning use of telephone solicitations to market goods and services in the United States, and the concomitant frustration of the American public,\u201d <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Servs., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 18, the TCPA was intended to stop prerecorded voice messages from being sent to private residential telephones. Section 2, Pub. L.No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394, 2394-2395. Section 227(b)(1)(B), Title 47, U.S.Code, states that it is unlawful for any person to \u201cinitiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>express consent of the called party.\u201d The TCPA also provides in Section 227(b)(3)(B) for a private right of action \u201cto recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 11} Anyone who receives a prerecorded telemarketing call at home, without first consenting to the call, may sue and recover damages. A residential customer may also sue for treble damages under Section 227(b)(3)(C), which provides for a private right of action: \u201cIf the court finds that the defendant <em>willfully or knowingly </em>violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 12} The question for us is what mental state is required for an award of treble damages under this subsection of the TCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">1. Definition of \u201cKnowingly\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 13} Charvat urges us to interpret the term \u201cknowingly\u201d to mean that the appellees knew that they initiated a telemarketing call using a prerecorded message system, not that they knew they were violating the TCPA. In support of his argument, he relies on the case cited in the certification order, <em>Reichenbach v. Financial Freedom Ctrs., Inc., </em>2004-Ohio-6164, 2004 WL 2634624, in which the Sixth District Court of Appeals held that \u201c \u2018the term \u201cknowingly\u201d merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 37, quoting <em>Bryan v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 184, 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 14} On the other hand, Ryan contends that use of the words \u201cwillfully\u201d or \u201cknowingly\u201d in Section 227(b)(3) requires that the defendant have a culpable mental state. His position follows the Tenth District\u2019s, which held that for a violation to be \u201cknowing,\u201d the caller \u201cmust affirmatively know it is violating a <em>regulation </em>when making the telephone call.\u201d <em>Charvat v. Colorado Prime, Inc., </em>(Sept. 17, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 97APG09-1277, 1998 WL 634922, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">(\u00b6 15} \u201cKnowingly\u201d is undefined in the TCPA, but courts have often defined the term in criminal cases. In <em>Bryan v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 184, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197, the United States Supreme Court explained that \u201c \u2018knowingly\u2019 does not necessarily have any reference to a culpable state of mind or to knowledge of the law. As Justice Jackson correctly observed, \u2018the knowledge requisite to knowing violation of a statute is factual knowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law.\u2019 <em>[Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States </em>(1952), 342 U.S. 337, 345, 72 S.Ct. 329, 96 L.Ed. 367.] * * * Thus, unless the text of the statute dictates a different result, the term \u2018knowingly\u2019 merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Id. at 193, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 141 L.Ed.2d 197. See also <em>United States v. Meade </em>(C.A.1, 1999), 175 F.3d 215, 226, fn. 5 (\u201cknowing,\u201d as used in a criminal statute, \u201cnormally signifies that the government needs to prove only that the defendant knew of the facts comprising the offense, and nothing more\u201d); <em>United States v. Cohen </em>(C.A.2, 2001), 260 F.3d 68, 76 (it matters only that defendant knowingly committed the deeds forbidden by statute, not that he intended to violate the statute); and <em>United States v. Barbosa </em>(C.A.3, 2001), 271 F.3d 438, 458 (interpretation of \u201cknowingly\u201d other than as with knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense would be tantamount to compelling the government to disprove a defense of ignorance of the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">{\u00b6 16} It is true that in <em>Lambert v. California </em>(1957), 355 U.S. 225, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228, which addressed a registration ordinance for felons that carried criminal penalties, the United States Supreme Court carved out an exception to the \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse\u201d maxim, stating that \u201c[njotice is required in a myriad of situations where a penalty * * * might be suffered for a mere failure to act.\u201d Id. at 228, 78 S.Ct. 240, 2 L.Ed.2d 228. But that exception addressed a situation in which a person failed to take action and not one in which a person did take action. Aso, in certain cases involving violations of tax laws, courts have concluded that the jury must find that the defendant was aware of the specific provision of the tax code the defendant was charged with violating where \u201chighly technical statutes presented the danger of ensnaring individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct.\u201d <em>Bryan v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 184, 194, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1947, 141 L.Ed.2d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 17} The TCPA is neither a criminal nor a highly technical statute, and thus ignorance of the law is no defense. Athough the evidence established that Ryan did not intend to violate any law, proof of such intent is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 18} For an award of treble damages under the TCPA, the term \u201cknowingly\u201d requires that liability be imposed even without appellees\u2019 knowledge that the conduct violated the statute. To establish a \u201cknowing\u201d violation of the TCPA for an award of treble damages, a plaintiff must prove only that the defendant knew of the facts that constituted the offense. Such knowledge of the \u201cfacts that constitute the offense\u201d does not mean that the individual must know that certain conduct actually violates a law because it \u201cconstitutes\u201d an offense. We hold that to establish a <em>knoiving </em>violation of the TCPA for an award of treble damages, a plaintiff must prove only that the defendant knew that it acted or failed to act in a manner that violated the statute, not that the defendant knew that the conduct itself constituted a violation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">2. Definition of \u201cWillful\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 19} The federal telephone solicitation statute also does not define the companion term \u201cwillfully\u201d in the \u201cwillfully or knowingly\u201d standard set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Section 227(b)(3)(C). Charvat points out that Section 312, Title 47, U.S.Code, defines \u201cwillful.\u201d There, \u201cwillful\u201d is defined as the \u201cconscious and deliberate commission or omission of such act, irrespective of any intent to violate any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation of the Commission authorized by this chapter or by a treaty ratified by the United States.\u201d Section 312(f)(1), Title 47, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 20} Although this definition section is part of the Communications Act of 1934, Section 151 et seq., Title 47, U.S.Code, it is not part of the TCPA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, in the recent case of <em>In re Dynasty Mtge., L.L.C. </em>(2007), 22 F.C.C.R. 9453, the Federal Communications Commission examined the TCPA and determined that a willful violation means that the \u201cviolator knew that he was doing the act in question * * * [and that the] violator need not know that his action or inaction constitutes a violation; ignorance of the law is not a defense or mitigating circumstance.\u201d Id. at 9470, fn. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Servs., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, we commented that the TCPA is the \u201cskeleton of a system designed to rein in the proliferation of telemarketing calls. Much of the detail was left to the FCC.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24. Congress delegated the implementation of the TCPA to the FCC. Accordingly, we defer to the FCC\u2019s definition of \u201cwillful.\u201d We hold that to establish a willful violation of the TCPA for an award of treble damages, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant consciously and deliberately committed or omitted an act that violated the statute, irrespective of any intent to violate the law. In principle then, the two standards of \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d within the TCPA do not differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 22} Because Congress chose to employ a low threshold to assess treble damages, by requiring a caller\u2019s actions to be \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cwillful,\u201d it is important to highlight the language in the second part of the provision for treble damages: <em>\u201c[T]he court may, in its discretion, </em>increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount\u201d of the greater of $500 or the actual money loss. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, a two-part test is presented for the trial court to employ when ascertaining whether treble damages are appropriate in a particular case. First, the court must decide whether a violation was \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cwillful.\u201d Then the court may, but need not, award treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">B. Definition of \u201cKnowingly\u201d in Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">{\u00b6 24} In his claim for a violation of the state statute, Charvat challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney fees under the CSPA. Similar to a treble damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>award under the TCPA, attorney fees are not mandated under the CSPA. R.C. 1345.09 sets out the remedies available to a consumer for a violation of the CSPA: \u201cThe court <em>may </em>award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee limited to the work reasonably performed, if either of the following apply: (1) The consumer complaining of the act or practice that violated this chapter has brought or maintained an action that is groundless, and the consumer filed or maintained the action in bad faith; (2) The supplier has <em>knowingly </em>committed an act or practice that violates this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 1345.09(F). Charvat asks us, in his discretionary appeal, to define \u201cknowingly\u201d as it is used in R.C. 1345.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 25} We addressed the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d in <em>Einhorn v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 27, 548 N.E.2d 933. There, we stated that a defendant \u201cdoes not have to know that his conduct violates the law for the court to grant attorney fees\u201d pursuant to R.C. 1345.09(F). Id. at 30, 548 N.E.2d 933. \u201c[A] trial court may award a consumer reasonable attorney fees when the supplier in a consumer transaction intentionally committed an act or practice which is deceptive, unfair or unconscionable.\u201d Id. Both Charvat and Ryan agree that this is the proper definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d in the CSPA; neither party is challenging the discretionary authority of a trial court to grant attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 26} Charvat argues that because appellees \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cpurposely\u201d called appellant with a prerecorded message, the trial court erred in refusing to award appellant attorney fees. Appellees argue that even if they violated the CSPA knowingly, or, in the term employed in <em>Einhom, </em>\u201cintentionally,\u201d the matter of attorney fees is still committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, which did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 27} The court of appeals followed the <em>Einhom </em>analysis in addressing the issue of attorney fees, and we agree. Although both parties acknowledge that under the CSPA a plaintiff need prove only that the defendant intended to commit the act of violation and not that the conduct was intended to violate the act, we reiterate that the \u201cknowing\u201d commission of an act that violates R.C. Chapter 1345 does not mandate imposition of attorney fees. The trial court has the discretion to determine whether attorney fees are warranted under the facts of each case. Therefore, we reaffirm <em>Einhom </em>and hold that to establish a knowing violation of R.C. 1345.09, for an award of attorney fees, a plaintiff need prove only that the defendant acted in a manner that violated the CSPA and need not prove that the defendant knew that the conduct violated the law. <em>Einhom, </em>48 Ohio St.3d at 30, 548 N.E.2d 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">{\u00b6 28} We hold that to establish a knowing or willful violation under the TCPA for the award of treble damages, or under the CSPA for an award of attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fees, a plaintiff need not prove that the defendant knew that conduct violated the law but only that the defendant knew the underlying facts of the conduct. A trial judge has discretion to determine whether to award treble damages under the TCPA or attorney fees under the CSPA. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Appeals on the denial of attorney fees under the CSPA. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on the award of treble damages under the TCPA and remand this case to the trial court for application of the appropriate standard of law and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b518-7\">Ferron &amp; Associates, L.P.A., John W.
