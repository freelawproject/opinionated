We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 2} Because this cause was dismissed by the trial court pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we accept the material allegations of the complaint as true. The complaint alleges as follows: Decedent, William Vitantonio, was a minority shareholder in Vitantonio, Inc., and a majority shareholder in Wickliffe Floral, Inc. Appellees are the two corporations just named and shareholders Louis Vitantonio and Gloria Vitantonio.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following William\u2019s death, appellees presented a claim against his estate. The executor of the estate, appellant Gary Baxter, rejected the claim on August 17, 2001. Thereafter, appellees commenced a timely action against the estate pursuant to R.C. 2117.12 on October 12, 2001. On June 26, 2003, appellees voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice. On June 17, 2004, within one year of the date of the dismissal, appellees refiled the complaint pursuant to the saving statute R.C. 2305.19. Finding that the saving statute was inapplicable to claims against an estate, the trial court granted appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint as time-barred. The court of appeals reversed, holding that by extending the reasoning of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Allen v. McBride, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-7112, 821 N.E.2d 1001, the saving statute was applicable. The issue is now before this court pursuant to our acceptance of Baxter\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 3} The narrow issue presented in this case is whether the saving statute R.C. 2305.19 applies to actions filed against an estate under R.C. 2117.12. R.C. 2117.12 requires that an action for a rejected claim such as appellees\u2019 be filed within two months after the executor\u2019s rejection or be forever barred. The initial complaint against the decedent\u2019s estate in this case was filed within the two-month period following appellant\u2019s rejection of the claim, so it was not time-barred. However, appellees later dismissed their action without prejudice after the two-month period had expired. Thus, the action could be refiled only if it fell within the operation of the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 4} The relevant portion of the saving statute provides: \u201cIn any action that is commenced or attempted to be commenced, * * * if the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits, the plaintiff * * * may commence a new action within one year after the date of * * * the plaintiffs failure otherwise than upon the merits * * *.\u201d R.C. 2305.19(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1) constitutes a failure otherwise than upon the merits within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>savings statute, R.C. 2305.19.\u201d <em>Frysinger v. Leech </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 38, 512 N.E.2d 337, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant contends that the unique statutory language contained in R.C. 2117.12, that the action is to be- filed within two months or be \u201cforever barred,\u201d indicates a public policy that favors treating actions against decedents\u2019 estates differently from other civil suits. Appellant contends that the language should be construed to prohibit application of the saving statute. While the language may be unusual, its inclusion in the statute does not preclude application of the saving statute. Clearly, R.C. 2117.12 required the action on the rejected claim against the estate to be filed within two months of the executor\u2019s rejection of the claim. Because the action in this case was filed within the requisite two-month period, the language \u201cforever barred\u201d is inapplicable to this case. Rather, the focus of our inquiry must be on the text of the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court, in finding that the. saving statute was inapplicable to claims under R.C. 2117.12, relied on decisions from two other appellate districts that held that the saving statute did not apply to will-contest actions. See <em>Barnes v. Anderson </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 142, 17 OBR 242, 478 N.E.2d 248, and <em>Cross v. Conley </em>(July 12, 2000), Highland App. No. 99CA5, 2000 WL 1010771. Just a few weeks after the trial court rendered its decision, however, this court . decided <em>Allen v. McBride, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-7112, 821 N.E.2d 1001. In <em>Allen, </em>this court held that the saving, statute applied to will-contest actions, id. at \u00b6 16, and thus, the authorities upon which the trial court based its decision in this case are no longer good law. When this case was then considered by the court of appeals, that court applied the <em>Allen </em>rationale, held that it was similarly applicable to claims under R.C. 2117.12, and reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. The court of appeals was correct in its conclusion that the rationale in <em>Allen </em>is instructive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Allen, </em>this court noted that \u201cR.C. 2305.19 is a broad statute of general application\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is nothing within that statute that could even remotely be read to proscribe its application to will-contest actions.\u201d Id., 105 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-7112, 821 N.E.2d 1001, \u00b6 27. The same can be said with respect to the statute at issue here because the saving statute does not reflect any limitation on its applicability-to R.C. 2117.12. Therefore, once a claim against an estate is timely filed pursuant to R.C. 2117.12, normal principles of statutory construction require that the saving statute applies. Accord, <em>Allen </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 8} The dissent in <em>Allen </em>opined that the General Assembly would act to specifically exclude will-contest actions from the saving statute. Id., 105 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-7112, 821 N.E.2d 1001, \u00b6 44 (O\u2019Donnell, J., dissenting). Indeed, the legislature did so act, and R.C. 2107.76 now explicitly states that R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>2305.19 does not apply to actions under R.C. 2107.71. See R.C. 2107.76(B); 2006 Sub.HJB. No. 144. Appellant urges this court to conclude that because the General Assembly so responded, the rationale of <em>Allen </em>has been undermined and should not be relied upon in considering whether the saving statute applies to claims against a decedent\u2019s estate. More specifically, appellant argues that the legislature\u2019s response is further evidence of a public policy in favor of the speedy resolution of estate matters, and, thus, the court should not hold that the saving statute applies here. However, the General Assembly\u2019s response to <em>Allen </em>did not go beyond amending R.C. 2107.76, and there is no uncodified law to suggest a legislative intent for broader application.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 9} As this court stated in <em>Allen, </em>R.C. 2305.19 is a \u201cbroad statute of general application,\u201d and as we stated in <em>Allen </em>with regard to will-contest actions, \u201c[tjhere is nothing within that statute that could even remotely be read to proscribe its application\u201d to claims brought under R.C. 2117.12. Id. at \u00b6 27. Thus, we conclude that the saving statute R.C. 2305.19 applies to actions filed against a decedent\u2019s estate under R.C. 2117.12. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b314-9\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\">.

In my view, the majority narrowly focuses on the application of the saving statute and misses the broad impact of today\u2019s decision on the administration of decedents\u2019 estates in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">{\u00b6 11} This court has long recognized that the purpose of the statutory time limits for the presentment of claims against an estate to the executor is to foster the expeditious and efficient administration of the estate. See, e.g., <em>Fortelka v. Meifert </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 476, 479, 27 O.O.2d 439, 200 N.E.2d 318, citing <em>Cheeseman v. Kyle </em>(1864), 15 Ohio St. 15; <em>Gerhold v. Papathanasion </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 342, 4 O.O. 425, 199 N.E. 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">{\u00b6 12} Numerous provisions of the probate code reflect the legislative desire for the swift administration of claims filed against an estate. R.C. 2117.06 requires a claimant to present a claim against an estate within six months after the decedent\u2019s death. R.C. 2117.07 provides that an executor may further accelerate the bar against claims. Pursuant to R.C. 2117.06(D), when a claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>presents a claim against an estate, the executor has 30 days to either accept or reject it. And R.C. 2117.12 requires a claimant whose claim is rejected to \u201ccommence an action on the claim * * * within two months after the rejection</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b315-12\">Monroe, Zueco <em>&amp; </em>Weilbacher and George C. Zueco; and Richard D. DiCicco, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Am4\">Karberg, Kurant <em>&amp; </em>Wachter Co., L.P.A., Mark I. Wachter, and Jack Kurant, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">* * * or be forever barred from maintaining an action on the claim * * * that was rejected.\u201d Moreover, after this court ruled that the saving statute applied to will-contest actions in <em>Allen v. McBride, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-7112, 821 N.E.2d 1001, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2107.76, adding division (B) to provide that the saving statute does not apply to R.C. 2107.71 actions to contest the validity of a will. 2006 Sub.H.B. No. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 13} The majority\u2019s decision in this case does not further the legislature\u2019s goal of expedient administration of estates, nor does it foster the finality of administration. As I noted in my dissent in <em>Allen, </em>the majority\u2019s holding \u201ccould result in litigation to recover estate assets that had been distributed by administrators, executors, or probate courts or could lead to long delays in the ability to transfer real estate or bank accounts due to potential liability or future claims, * * * all contrary to the legislative intent * * <em>Allen </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">{\u00b6 14} The central matter presented here is one of statutory interpretation. Our role is to interpret these statutes to discern legislative intent and to give meaning to the words used by the General Assembly. The exceedingly short statute of limitations period for the presentment of a claim against an estate, the short time the statute gives an executor to act upon such a claim, and the \u201cforever barred\u201d language contained in R.C. 2117.12 demonstrate the legislature\u2019s intent that these matters be resolved with finality in a relatively short period of time. Thus, applying the one-year saving statute in the context of this legislative scheme is incongruent because it delays the administration of estates. As a consequence of today\u2019s decision by the majority, the legislature will likely amend these code sections and negate the effects of this hypertechnieal reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">{\u00b6 15} For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s determination that the saving statute R.C. 2305.19 applies to R.C. 2117.12 claims against a decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
