The intruder then murdered Sheeler by stabbing her in the neck and chest. The intruder stole money from the apartment and fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 2} The murder went unsolved for almost four years. In 2004, DNA testing identified defendant-appellant, Roland T. Davis, as the murderer of Sheeler. Subsequently, Davis was convicted of the aggravated murder of Sheeler and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">{\u00b6 3} Davis now appeals, raising an array of challenges to his convictions and sentence. We determine that none of his propositions of law has merit and affirm Davis\u2019s convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and have compared Davis\u2019s sentence of death to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm Davis\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">\n<em>State\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 4} Sheeler was a widow who lived alone in a basement apartment at the Plaza Garden Apartments. Sheeler frequently used Yellow Cab taxis for transportation to the grocery store, the bank, and other locations in Newark.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">{\u00b6 5} Davis worked intermittently as a driver for Yellow Cab from 1995 until April 20, 2000. Sheeler often asked for Davis as her taxi driver because he helped Sheeler carry her groceries into her apartment. Yellow Cab records show that Davis provided Sheeler with taxi service on many occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">{\u00b6 6} Davis and Sharon Wright lived together off and on from 1994 until July or August 2000. Wright was a driver with Yellow Cab for about a year. During their relationship, Wright said that Davis \u201ccarried a few bucks in his pocket, but most of the time he was broke.\u201d Davis was unemployed from June 2 to at least July 10, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Davis lived with Terri Geer from late October or early November 1999 until mid-May 2000. Geer said that Davis \u201cnever had a lot of money\u201d during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 8} On the evening of July 10, 2000, Sheeler was at her apartment. Between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., Sheeler and her close friend, Elladean Hicks, talked on the telephone. Hicks stated that nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary, and there was no indication that anyone else was at Sheeler\u2019s apartment or that she was expecting anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 9} Melissa Frost was Sheeler\u2019s next-door neighbor. At approximately 12:30 a.m. on July 11, 2000, Frost noticed that a light was still on in Sheeler\u2019s apartment. Frost also heard loud noise coming from the television in Sheeler\u2019s apartment, which stopped sometime after 12:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 10} Frost did not see Sheeler for the next two days. Frost noticed that Sheeler\u2019s front door was not ajar, an unusual circumstance because Sheeler had the habit of keeping the door slightly open during the day. On July 12, Frost noticed two newspapers outside Sheeler\u2019s front door. Frost\u2019s husband then knocked on Sheeler\u2019s front door and called her name. He turned the doorknob and noticed it was unlocked. The Frosts then contacted the apartment manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 11} Kenneth Patterson, the co-owner of Plaza Garden Apartments, entered Sheeler\u2019s apartment to check on her well-being. The living room, dining room, and kitchen looked normal. Patterson looked inside Sheeler\u2019s bedroom and saw blood on the bed and a foot sticking out from underneath bedding on the floor. The police were then called.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 12} Around 1:30 p.m. on July 12, 2000, Newark police officers arrived at Sheeler\u2019s apartment. Officers found Sheeler\u2019s body on the floor next to her bed. Her body was covered by a mattress pad, mattress cover, fitted sheet, and comforter. Sheeler\u2019s face had been battered, and her neck and chest area had numerous sharp-instrument wounds. Her dentures were found underneath the bed. Sheeler\u2019s housecoat was open and bunched up under the middle of her back. Her panties were torn and cut in the crotch area and rolled up underneath her breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 13} Detective Timothy Elliget, a Newark police criminalist, found blood spatter that formed a misting pattern above the dresser on the bedroom wall. This blood spatter showed that Sheeler was standing when she was hit in the mouth or throat area. Bloodstain patterns on the bedding indicated that Sheeler had been face down on the bed for a period of time. Elliget also found a bloodstain pattern on the fitted sheet, which was consistent with a blood-covered hand \u201cgrabbing the item and pulling [it] off.\u201d Another bloodstain formed a butterfly pattern on the mattress pad, which was consistent with the wiping of an object such as a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Sheeler\u2019s bedroom had been ransacked. Dresser drawers were on top of the mattress, a cedar chest had been opened, and items were scattered around the room. The spare bedroom had also been ransacked, with drawers opened and property strewn about.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 15} Several purses were found in both bedrooms but none of them contained a wallet, identification, pictures, or keys. Police did find $500 in an envelope on the floor of the spare bedroom, two metal boxes containing $2,300 in the closet of the spare bedroom, and $210 in silver certificates elsewhere in the same closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 16} Police found no evidence of forced entry. No knife or other possible murder weapon was found in the apartment. Investigators found 14 usable fingerprints and three usable palm prints. The fingerprints were later entered into the automated fingerprint identification system (\u201cAFIS\u201d), but no matches resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 17} Police found a bloodstain on a small kitchen towel next to the kitchen sink. It \u201ctested presumptive for blood\u201d and was forwarded for DNA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 18} On July 13, 2000, Dr. Patrick Fardal, then the chief forensic pathologist for Franklin County, conducted the autopsy on Sheeler. Sheeler suffered blunt-force injuries to her face and 11 sharp wounds to her chin, neck, and upper chest area. Dr. Fardal found that a stab wound in Sheeler\u2019s chest and a stab wound in her neck that injured the left jugular vein were fatal wounds. Sheeler probably would have lived no more than \u201c10 to 20 minutes after sustaining these wounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 19} In 2000, Ramen Tejwani, a criminalist with the Columbus police crime lab, tested evidence from Sheeler\u2019s apartment. DNA analysis of the bloodstain on the kitchen towel did not match the DNA from Sheeler or other persons tested at that time. Additionally, presumptive testing of an oral swab taken from Sheeler showed the presence of semen. However, no useful DNA was extracted from the swab.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 20} In 2001, Tejwani retested the DNA on the towel\u2019s bloodstain using the short tandem repeat (\u201cSTR\u201d) method. This analysis showed that the DNA was from a male contributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">{\u00b6 21} Nevertheless, the investigation moved into a cold-case status because there were few leads. On March 1, 2004, Davis became a suspect in the murder after Newark police obtained information from an out-of-state law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">{\u00b6 22} After investigation of Davis began, police learned that he had purchased a Mercury Grand Marquis on July 10, 2000. He had paid $300 in cash for the car and had agreed to make regular payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">{\u00b6 23} Geer stated that after she had not seen Davis for a week or more, Davis showed up at her house on July 11, 2000, driving the Grand Marquis. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>same day, Davis bought Geer\u2019s son a drum set with $1,253.98 in cash. Davis also offered to purchase Geer \u201canything [she] wanted that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 24} Wright had no contact with Davis on July 10 or July 11, 2000. However, on July 12, 2000, Davis drove the Grand Marquis to Wright\u2019s home. Davis said that he had obtained the money to pay for the car by \u201crunning drugs from Florida to Ohio.\u201d On July 13, Davis took Wright\u2019s daughter to a Columbus mall and bought her a $100 pair of tennis shoes and a car stereo, and he took her to dinner. On July 16 or 17, Davis and Wright drove to Florida and returned to Ohio about a week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 25} After Davis became a suspect, police obtained a DNA sample from him and sent it to the Columbus police crime lab. Analysis showed that Davis\u2019s DNA matched the DNA from the bloodstain on the kitchen towel. According to Tejwani, the approximate frequency of this DNA type in the population is one in 547.000. 000 for Caucasians, one in 332,400,000,000 for African-Americans, one in 1.939.000. 000 for southeastern Hispanics, and one in 2,816,000,000 for southwestern Hispanics. Davis is Caucasian.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 26} Following receipt of the DNA results, Newark detectives Stephen Vanoy and Melanie Mummey interviewed Davis in Florida, where he was living. After Davis waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he was shown a photograph of Sheeler. He said that she looked familiar, but he did not remember her name. Davis denied seeing Sheeler\u2019s photograph on reward posters following her death. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know she got killed, [until] you just told me.\u201d Davis also did not remember ever going into Sheeler\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 27} Vanoy told Davis that his DNA was found in Sheeler\u2019s apartment. When asked for an explanation, Davis said there was no reason his semen or blood could be in her apartment. However, Davis said that he might have pricked his finger or left a hair in Sheeler\u2019s apartment when carrying her groceries.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b628} As the interview progressed, Davis said, \u201cI\u2019m putting a face with a person * * Davis had just said that he had provided taxi service to Sheeler and \u201cliked her a whole lot.\u201d Davis also said that Sheeler had shown him around her apartment. As a result, he might have touched a doorknob. However, he denied entering the kitchen and touching any of her towels \u201cor anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">{\u00b6 29} Davis told police that he obtained the money to buy the drum set and the Grand Marquis by taking \u201ca load of Cocaine [to] * * * Elkhart, Indiana.\u201d Davis said he delivered $40,000 worth of cocaine and made $10,000. However, he refused to divulge the name of his supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Before the interview ended, Davis described his trips to Sheeler\u2019s apartment when he provided her taxi service. Davis said he would knock on her door, wait inside her apartment as she was getting ready, lock the door when they left, and escort her to his taxi by holding her arm. However, Davis said that he had not been in Sheeler\u2019s apartment since he quit driving a cab. Davis denied killing Sheeler and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it at all!!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 31} Later, Vanoy reinterviewed Davis. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Davis continued to deny any involvement in Sheeler\u2019s murder. However, Davis admitted lying about knowing Sheeler, saying, \u201c[Y]ou guys were trying to pin a murder on me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 32} In late 2004, Susan Fowls, a former employee of Annie\u2019s Place restaurant in Newark, saw a photograph of Davis in a newspaper article about his arrest. Fowls remembered that during the late spring or early summer of 2003, Davis had entered the restaurant and had asked about Sheeler\u2019s murder after noticing a reward poster that displayed Sheeler\u2019s photograph inside the restaurant. According to Fowls, Davis repeatedly asked her, \u201cDid they have any leads[?] Do they know who did it[?] Do the police have any suspects[?]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 33} Terianne Paxson, the restaurant\u2019s owner, also talked to Davis about Sheeler\u2019s murder. Davis thought that Sheeler used to be his neighbor, and he could not believe that someone would murder her. He asked Paxson if she knew whether Sheeler had been sexually assaulted. After Davis left the restaurant, Paxson wrote down his license number, but she did not notify police until after his photograph appeared in the newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 34} During September 2004, DNA analysis using Y-chromosome testing was conducted on the bloodstained fitted sheet from Sheeler\u2019s bedroom. According to Meghan Clement, the technical director for forensic identity testing at Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc. (\u201cLabCorp\u201d), three bloodstains matched Davis\u2019s DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 35} Further DNA analysis using autosomal STR testing was conducted on two of the bloodstains from the fitted sheet. Clement testified, \u201cThe profiles that were obtained from both samples were consistent with a mixture. * * * In looking at the profiles, we could not exclude Mr. Davis as a contributor to either of those particular mixtures. And for specifically [one location], * * * the male was the major contributor * * * and those [major characteristics in the DNA mixture] indeed matched Mr. Davis.\u201d The statistical frequency of that DNA\u2019s presence is one in 97.1 quadrillion in the Caucasian population, one in 2.62 sextillion in the African-American population, and one in 1.23 quintillion in the Hispanic population.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 36} During October 2004, Richard Hummel and Davis were in the orientation module at the Licking County jail. Hummel testified that one day, he told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Davis, \u201c[C]heer up, they can\u2019t eat you, man.\u201d Davis responded, \u201cOh no, I did it.\u201d Davis then explained that he got to know the victim when he was driving a cab and helped her carry groceries and performed other jobs for her. Davis said he \u201cstabbed her five, seven times or so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\n<em>Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 37} The defense presented the stipulated testimony of Dr. C. Jeff Lee, the Deputy Coroner for Licking County. Dr. Lee performed the autopsy on Randy L. Davis, the defendant\u2019s brother, who had died in an automobile accident on November 26, 2002. Dr. Lee stated that a sample of Randy\u2019s blood had been collected and preserved and was available at the coroner\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 38} The defense presented no other trial-phase evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">\n<em>Case History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 39} The grand jury indicted Davis on one count of aggravated murder. Count 1 charged Davis with the aggravated murder of Sheeler while committing kidnapping, aggravated robbery, or aggravated burglary. Count 1 contained four death-penalty specifications: murder for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); and murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 40} Davis was charged with four additional counts: Count 2 charged Davis with murder, Count 3 charged kidnapping, Count 4 charged aggravated robbery, and Count 5 charged aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">{\u00b6 41} Davis pleaded not guilty to all charges. The jury found him guilty of all charges, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">\n<em>Pretrial and Trial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">{\u00b6 42} <em>Jury selection. </em>In proposition of law I, Davis asserts that he was denied a fair and impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">{\u00b6 43} 1. Denial of careful and searching voir dire. First, Davis argues that he was denied a careful and searching voir dire about pretrial publicity. Davis also claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to fully question jurors about pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe manner in which voir dire is to be conducted lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 418, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>613 N.E.2d 212. A trial court has \u201c \u2018great latitude in deciding what questions should be asked on voir dire.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 386, 659 N.E.2d 292, quoting <em>Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 415, 424, 111 S.Ct. 1899, 114 L.Ed.2d 493. Absent a clear abuse of discretion, prejudicial error cannot be assigned to the examination of the venire. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">{\u00b6 45} The record shows that the voir dire on pretrial publicity was comprehensive. The trial court asked the prospective jurors whether any of them knew about the case through firsthand information or media coverage. The trial court then asked prospective jurors who had indicated some familiarity with the case whether they could lay aside what they had heard and decide the case solely upon the evidence presented at trial. Counsel were then given the opportunity to fully question the prospective jurors about their exposure to pretrial publicity. Following thorough questioning, the trial court excused members of the venire who had formed fixed opinions due to pretrial publicity or were otherwise unsuitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 46} Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim also lacks merit. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 47} Trial counsel questioned the prospective jurors about pretrial publicity after the trial court and the prosecutor had finished examining them about the same matter. Trial counsel\u2019s questioning about pretrial publicity was brief. However, trial counsel were not deficient, because counsel \u201cneed not repeat questions about topics already covered by group voir dire, opposing counsel, or the judge.\u201d <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 13, 572 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 48} Second, Davis contends that he was entitled to a change of venue because of pervasive pretrial publicity. However, trial counsel waived this issue by failing to request a change of venue. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 336, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 49} Davis also claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to request a change of venue. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a change of venue is not tantamount to ineffective assistance of counsel. As previously discussed, the voir dire about pretrial publicity was adequate. Thus, counsel could have reasonably decided not to request a change of venue. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 156. Moreover, a change of venue is not automatically granted when there is pretrial publicity. Any decision to change venue rests largely within the discretion of the trial judge. See <em>State v. White </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 25, 693 N.E.2d 772. Accordingly, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>{\u00b6 50} We also reject Davis\u2019s assertion that his counsel were ineffective by failing to develop the record about the level of pretrial publicity in his case. The trial court was well aware of the extent of pretrial publicity because many prospective jurors acknowledged that they had heard something about the case. Thus, Davis has failed to show how trial counsel\u2019s failure to submit newspaper clippings and other media stories was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 51} Third, Davis argues that the trial court and counsel failed to adequately question prospective jurors to develop challenges for cause or exercise peremptory challenges. However, Davis fails to explain the additional information that should have been obtained. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 52} Finally, Davis complains that the trial court required counsel to conduct voir dire after regular court hours. Before concluding voir dire, the trial court informed counsel, \u201cI\u2019m inclined to finish this group. * * * We have two more sets of six. Generally get those done tonight and come back in the morning and start.\u201d The court completed voir dire and recessed at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 53} Davis argues that the voir dire examination conducted late in the day became increasingly incoherent because counsel were tired. The prosecutor remarked, \u201cI\u2019m getting punchy. * * * It\u2019s 25 \u2019til six.\u201d Davis also points out that his trial counsel\u2019s voir dire of the last group of jurors comprised only three and one-half pages of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cThe scope of voir dire is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and varies depending on the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>State v. Bedford </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913. The trial court\u2019s action ensured the orderly flow of the case and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Moreover, Davis suffered no prejudice, because none of the prospective jurors questioned after hours actually served on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">{\u00b6 55} 2. Standard for excusing jurors. Davis argues that the trial court erred in applying the standard set forth in <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841, instead of the standard in R.C. 2945.25(C), in excusing prospective jurors who expressed reservations about capital punishment. However, <em>Witt </em>enunciates the correct standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause based on his or her opposition to the death penalty. See <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, Davis\u2019s claim that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object lacks merit, because the <em>Witt </em>standard was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">{\u00b6 56} 3. Examination of death-penalty-opposed jurors. Davis contends that trial counsel failed to fully question and rehabilitate prospective jurors who said they opposed the death penalty and that counsel failed to object to the state\u2019s challenge of these jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>{\u00b6 57} Davis cites five veniremen whom counsel should have rehabilitated: Spearman, Smith, Barsky, Hanson, and Harden. During voir dire, all of these jurors stated they were opposed to the death penalty and could not sign a death verdict. Trial counsel did not object to the challenge of Spearman but did object to the challenge of the other four jurors. The trial court excused all five jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">{\u00b6 58} Trial counsel attempted to rehabilitate each of the jurors before they were excused. We reject Davis\u2019s claim that counsel should have asked these jurors more questions, because counsel were in the best position to determine whether the jurors could be rehabilitated. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 410-411, 739 N.E.2d 300. Moreover, trial counsel were not ineffective by failing to object to the exclusion of Spearman, because she clearly stated her unwillingness to sign a death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 59} 4. Failure to voir dire regarding mitigating evidence. First, Davis argues that the trial court refused to permit counsel to fully examine prospective jurors about mitigating evidence. Consequently, the selected jurors would be likely to \u201cautomatically vote for the death penalty and * * * would not consider mitigating evidence.\u201d This claim lacks merit because trial counsel were given extensive leeway to examine prospective jurors regarding their willingness to consider mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 60} Second, Davis argues that jurors Marston and Cronin were not fully questioned about whether they could fairly consider mitigating evidence and impose a life sentence. Davis also claims that counsel\u2019s inadequate voir dire resulted in the failure to develop a successful challenge for cause against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cThe conduct of voir dire by defense counsel does not have to take a particular form, nor do specific questions have to be asked.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 247, 586 N.E.2d 1042. \u201c[CJounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 62} During voir dire, juror Marston stated his belief that all people convicted of intentionally killing another person should face the death penalty. Trial counsel tested juror Marston\u2019s willingness to consider mitigating evidence by asking him whether the same crime committed by two separate people with different backgrounds had mitigating features. Juror Marston replied, \u201c[Sjame crime, same penalty.\u201d During further questioning, juror Marston expressed his willingness to follow the law, evaluate mitigating factors, and consider all four sentencing options. Trial counsel challenged juror Marston for cause, but the trial court denied the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 63} Trial counsel were not deficient in questioning juror Marston. Counsel asked probing questions about fairly considering mitigating evidence and all lesser sentencing options. Moreover, counsel had no basis to challenge juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Marston for cause, because Marston expressed his willingness to consider the mitigating evidence and all four sentencing options. See <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492; <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 64} We also reject Davis\u2019s claim that counsel failed to fully question juror Cronin and challenge her for cause. During voir dire, juror Cronin expressed the view that identical crimes deserve identical punishment, regardless of the social backgrounds of the perpetrators. However, trial counsel questioned juror Cronin about her willingness to consider various mitigating evidence. Juror Cronin stated that she would consider the mitigating evidence and all potential sentencing options. Thus, counsel had no basis to challenge juror Cronin for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 65} Finally, Davis claims that the court and trial counsel failed to question the jurors about whether they could consider mitigating evidence and impose a life sentence even though the victim was an elderly woman murdered in her own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 66} Davis invokes <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 60-62, in making this argument. <em>Jackson </em>held that a \u201ctrial court abused its discretion by refusing <em>defense counsel\u2019s requests </em>to advise prospective jurors that one of the murdered victims was a three-year-old child and by refusing to allow voir dire on that fact.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 62. However, Jackson does not apply to this case, because trial counsel never sought to question the jurors about their views on imposing the death penalty when the victim was an elderly woman. Counsel\u2019s decision to forgo this line of questioning constituted a legitimate tactical decision. See <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 521, 684 N.E.2d 47. Indeed, counsel could have decided not to question the jurors about the victim\u2019s elderly status to avoid focusing the jury\u2019s attention on this issue at the very beginning of its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 67} We also hold that the trial court was not required to sua sponte question the jurors about the victim\u2019s elderly status because counsel failed to do so. See <em>Turner v. Murray </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 28, 37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27, fn. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 68} 5. Misleading statements. Davis contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making misleading statements during voir dire. However, the defense failed to object to these statements and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 484, 653 N.E.2d 304. In the alternative, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">{\u00b6 69} First, Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly told the jurors that they could determine what evidence was mitigating. The prosecutor informed the prospective jurors that it was their duty to determine the assessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s statements correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>summarized the law on mitigation. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 352, 744 N.E.2d 1163. Thus, no plain error was committed, and counsel were not ineffective by failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">(\u00b6 70} Second, Davis claims that the prosecutor\u2019s voir dire was misleading because he asked questions about mitigating factors that did not apply to this case. During small-group voir dire, the prosecutor posed a hypothetical question about two men committing a murder at a convenience store. The hypothetical contrasted a young defendant from a disadvantaged background with an older defendant from a good family and with many opportunities. The hypothetical tested the willingness of the prospective jurors to consider mitigating evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s questions were not misleading because the jurors knew they were being asked hypothetical questions. See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 300, 2006-Ohio-1, 839 N.E.2d 362, \u00b6 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 71} Davis also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the hypothetical was prejudicial because the prosecutor later used the hypothetical during final argument. During penalty-phase arguments, the prosecutor mentioned the hypothetical situation as a means of explaining that the jury should give little weight to Davis\u2019s background. However, this argument was not improper. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 72} Third, Davis claims that the prosecutor misled the prospective jurors by informing them that any sentencing verdict would have to be unanimous. The prosecutor\u2019s comments accurately stated the law. See <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 30, 752 N.E.2d 859. Thus, no plain error was committed, and trial counsel were not deficient by failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 73} 6. Failure to excuse jurors. Davis also complains that he was denied a fair and impartial jury because many of the jurors knew too much about the crime, the victim, or Davis and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 74} Davis fails to mention any specific juror who should have been excused. However, prospective jurors who indicated some familiarity with the crime, the victim, or the witnesses were identified. Following thorough questioning, the trial court excused members of the venire who had formed a fixed opinion about the case or indicated an association with the victim or the witnesses that made them unsuitable to serve on the jury. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 75} 7. Commitment to sign death verdict. Davis argues that the prosecutor and trial court improperly sought commitments from the prospective jurors to sign a death verdict. However, the defense failed to object to such questions and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 484, 653 N.E.2d 304. Alternatively, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to such remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>{\u00b6 76} During voir dire, the prosecutor asked some prospective jurors whether they would be able to sign a death verdict if the accused were to be convicted as charged and if the aggravating circumstances were found to outweigh the mitigating factors. Such questioning was proper because the relevant inquiry during voir dire in a capital case is whether the juror\u2019s beliefs would prevent or substantially impair his or her performance of duties as a juror in accordance with the instructions and the oath. <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841. \u201cClearly, a juror who is incapable of signing a death verdict demonstrates substantial impairment in his ability to fulfill his duties.\u201d <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 77} Davis also claims error because the prospective jurors were not asked whether they would be able to sign a life verdict. \u201cThere is no requirement for a trial court to \u2018life qualify\u2019 any prospective juror, absent a request by defense counsel, in a capital murder case.\u201d <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 705 N.E.2d 329, syllabus. No plain error occurred, because the defense made no such request. Moreover, Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim lacks merit because he has failed to show that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to the state\u2019s questions or by failing to request that the jurors be life qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 78} 8. Failure to question juror about an outside influence. Davis argues that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court and counsel failed to question juror Wallace after learning that she had been fired from her job for serving on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 79} Following voir dire, juror Wallace told the bailiff that she had received some pressure from her employer to get off the jury. The trial court informed counsel that Wallace, a cook at Applebee\u2019s, was told to wear white-supremacist clothing or lie about certain answers to avoid jury duty. Wallace told her employer that she was not going to lie or do anything wrong. She also called the corporate office to report her boss. The prosecutor asked whether the pressure would affect Wallace\u2019s behavior on the jury. The trial court said, \u201cNo. In fact, she indicated just the opposite. She felt that she couldn\u2019t do those things. She told us she\u2019s not a liar, she\u2019s not going to take any steps like that. * * * [Y]ou saw her yesterday, all the jurors * * * [take] their obligation seriously and I felt were honest * * Both counsel stated that further voir dire of Wallace was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 80} On the next day, the trial court informed counsel that juror Wallace reported that she had been fired after telling her boss that she had been selected as a juror. Juror Wallace said she had \u201ctalked to the boss\u2019 boss who told her all the right things; you\u2019re on the payroll; * * * you\u2019re going to get paid; do your duty, and after you\u2019re done, come talk to me and we\u2019ll take care of it then.\u201d Trial counsel said, \u201cI was kind of led to believe that she\u2019s okay with all of this.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>trial court said, \u201cThat\u2019s the impression I certainly received, too. In fact, I think the owner\u2019s position has been just what you would hope it would be, and he seems to be supportive of her * * *. [T]hey seem to have that under control and she seems to be in a fine state of mind, too.\u201d Both counsel declined to conduct any further voir dire of juror Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">{\u00b6 81} In cases involving outside influences on jurors, trial courts are granted broad discretion in dealing with the contact and determining whether to declare a mistrial or to replace an affected juror. <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 191. A trial court is permitted to rely on a juror\u2019s testimony in determining that juror\u2019s impartiality. <em>State v. Herring </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 259, 762 N.E.2d 940. Juror Wallace assured the court that her job situation would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Counsel were obviously convinced that juror Wallace could remain a fair and impartial juror. Thus, the trial court and counsel could allow juror Wallace to remain on the jury without conducting further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 82} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 83} <em>Tape recordings and transcript. </em>In proposition of law II, Davis argues that the admission of his tape-recorded statements without identification or authentication violated his right to a fair trial. Davis further argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to the lack of authentication or identification of the tape recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 84} The tape recordings of Detective Vanoy\u2019s first interview of Davis were not played during the trial. Without defense objection, the tape recordings of the interview and a transcript of the tape were admitted into evidence. The tape recordings and the transcript were supplied to the jury during deliberations at both phases of the trial. The trial court instructed the jury during both phases:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c[Y]ou will receive as an exhibit two tape recordings identified as being a portion of the statement the Defendant gave to Newark police officers. The portion on these tapes are those sections of the Defendant\u2019s statement that the parties have <em>jointly agreed to admit </em>into evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 86} Davis\u2019s failure to object to the tape recordings waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Dmmmond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 187 (failure to object to 911 tape waived claims of lack of authenticity). He also agreed to admit the tapes without objecting to their authenticity. Thus, Davis invited any error and may not \u201ctake advantage of an error which he himself invited or induced.\u201d <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">{\u00b6 87} We reject Davis\u2019s claim on the basis of plain error and invited error. The parties\u2019 agreement to admit the tape recordings into evidence eliminated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>need to authenticate the tapes before they were introduced into evidence, as Evid.R. 901(B)(5) requires. See also <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 396, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (\u201cSending properly admitted evidence into jury deliberations rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 88} We also reject Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. In his statement, Davis adamantly denied any responsibility for Sheeler\u2019s death. By introducing the tapes, counsel had the benefit of presenting Davis\u2019s proclamations of innocence to the jury, without the risk of having Davis take the stand. See <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 34. Thus, trial counsel made a tactical decision by agreeing to introduce Davis\u2019s tape-recorded statement. We overrule proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 89} In proposition of law III, Davis argues that the failure to play the tape recordings in open court violated his right to be present at all stages of his criminal trial and violated his right to a public trial. He also claims that the admission of the transcript of the tape recording violated the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule. In the alternative, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 90} 1. Right to be present. An accused has a fundamental right to be present at all stages of his criminal trial. Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 43(A). An accused\u2019s absence, however, does not necessarily result in prejudicial or constitutional error. \u201c[T]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts </em>(1934), 291 U.S. 97, 107-108, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674, overruled on other grounds, <em>Duncan v. Louisiana </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 145, 154, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, and <em>Malloy v. Hogan </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 1, 2, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653, fn. 1. See <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 91} Davis waived this claim by failing to object to the admission of the tapes without playing them in open court. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 122. Moreover, Davis\u2019s right to be present was not violated. He was present in court when the tape recording and transcript were offered and admitted into evidence. He could review the verbatim transcript of the tapes when the tapes were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 92} Davis claims that waiver does not apply because he did not personally waive his right to be present on the record, and the trial court did not find that such waiver was knowingly and intelligently made. However, we hold that the trial court was not required to conduct a colloquy on the record to establish a knowing waiver of Davis\u2019s right to be present. <em>United States v. Riddle </em>(C.A.6, 2001), 249 F.3d 529, 534. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>{\u00b6 93} 2. Right to a public trial. Davis claims that his right to a public trial was violated because the tape recording of his interview was not played in open court. However, the trial court never closed the courtroom during the trial. Vanoy testified about his interview of Davis, and the tape recording and transcript of that interview were introduced in open court. Moreover, Davis\u2019s failure to object constitutes a waiver of his right to have the tapes played in open court. See <em>Levine v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 610, 619, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989; <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 59. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 94} 3. Use of the transcript. Davis argues that the admission of the transcript violated the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule, Evid.R. 1002. He claims that the best evidence of the content of the tape was the tape itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 95} Davis\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the transcript waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Kehoe </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 591, 605, 729 N.E.2d 431. Moreover, Davis agreed to admit the transcript, without objecting that it was not the best evidence. Davis may not take advantage of \u201cinvited error\u201d by now claiming that the transcript violated Evid.R. 1002. <em>Hal Ariz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 96} We reject this claim on the basis of plain error and invited error. This claim also lacks merit. The transcript was provided to the jury as a listening aid. See <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 159, 694 N.E.2d 932. Davis\u2019s claim that the jury may have relied solely on the transcript during deliberations is purely speculative. The trial court carefully instructed the jury during both phases:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cIn addition to these tapes, you will receive a transcript of these tapes. However, the transcript is not evidence, only the tapes are. The transcript is intended only as an aid. In the event you feel there is any discrepancy between what is actually said on the tape and what the transcript says, you must rely upon the tapes themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 98} Further, the defense never challenged the accuracy of the transcript at trial. \u201cWhere there are no \u2018material differences\u2019 between a tape admitted into evidence and a transcript given to the jury as a listening aid, there is no prejudicial error.\u201d <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 445, 588 N.E.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">{\u00b6 99} We also reject Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim because of counsel\u2019s tactical decision to permit the introduction of the tapes and the transcript. Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 100} <em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In proposition of law IV, Davis argues that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome autopsy and crime-scene photographs during both phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 101} In capital cases, nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267; <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 102} 1. Crime-scene photographs. Davis complains about five gruesome crime-scene photographs that the defense objected to at trial. Davis claims that the photographs were cumulative and introduced to inflame the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 103} State\u2019s exhibit 4-X shows Sheeler\u2019s body as she was found on the bedroom floor after the sheets and bedspread were removed from her body. State\u2019s exhibit 4-X was relevant in showing the position of Sheeler\u2019s body at the crime scene. See <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 104} State\u2019s exhibit 4-V shows that Sheeler\u2019s panties had been removed. This photo supported the state\u2019s theory that Davis kidnapped Sheeler for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">{\u00b6 105} State\u2019s exhibit 4-Y is a photograph of Sheeler\u2019s upper chest area showing numerous sharp instrument wounds on her neck and chest area. This photograph also shows a blood trail leading from the victim\u2019s head and running down her chest. State\u2019s exhibit 4-Y supported Detective Elliget\u2019s testimony that the blood trail showed that Sheeler was standing when she was attacked and then later ended up on her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 106} State\u2019s exhibit 4-N shows bloodstained bedding covering the victim\u2019s foot and hand. State\u2019s exhibit 4-0 is a distant shot taken across the bedroom showing some bloodstained bedding. State\u2019s exhibits 4-N and 4-0 are not gruesome photographs but show that Sheeler\u2019s bedroom had been ransacked after she was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">{\u00b6 107} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these few selected photographs. State\u2019s exhibits 4-V, 4-X, and 4-Y, although gruesome, were probative of Davis\u2019s intent and the manner and circumstances of Sheeler\u2019s death. See <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">{\u00b6 108} 2. Autopsy photographs. Davis argues that the trial court erred in admitting 12 autopsy photographs that the defense objected to at trial. State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>exhibit 7-B depicts Sheeler\u2019s body prior to the autopsy and shows extensive wounds to her head and face. State\u2019s exhibits 7-E and 7-F are photographs showing that Sheeler received blunt-force injuries to her face and a sharp-injury wound to the left side of her neck. These photographs illustrated Dr. Fardal\u2019s testimony and provided an overall perspective of the victim\u2019s wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 109} State\u2019s exhibit 7-C depicts marbling and skin slippage on Sheeler\u2019s face. This photograph supported Dr. Fardal\u2019s conclusion that Sheeler was killed two to three days before the autopsy was conducted. State\u2019s exhibit 7-D shows Sheeler\u2019s bruised lips, bruised and lacerated tongue, and toothlessness. This photograph supported Dr. Fardal\u2019s testimony that Sheeler could have lost her dentures as a result of her attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 110} State\u2019s exhibits 7-G and 7-J focus on different sharp-injury wounds on Sheeler\u2019s neck. Dr. Fardal testified that these wounds are consistent with a knife being held underneath Sheeler\u2019s chin. State\u2019s exhibits 7-H and 7-1 depict different sharp-injury wounds to Sheeler\u2019s upper trunk. Each photograph has a ruler showing the length of the separate injuries. These exhibits supported Dr. Fardal\u2019s conclusion that a single-edged knife caused these wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 111} State\u2019s exhibit 7-L shows a hemorrhage in the temporalis muscle and an injury in the frontal scalp area caused by two points of impact. State\u2019s exhibit 7-M shows a hemorrhage to the back part of her head caused by a separate impact. Using these photographs, Dr. Fardal testified that Sheeler did not suffer a fatal brain injury but may have received a concussion resulting in a loss of consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 112} Finally, state\u2019s exhibit 7-K depicts the victim\u2019s trachea and esophagus and shows that blood was aspirated into her trachea. This photograph supported Elliget\u2019s testimony that blood spatter on the bedroom wall shows that Sheeler was standing when hit in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 113} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the autopsy photographs. The autopsy photographs were limited in number, noncumulative, and had substantial probative value. Each of these photographs supported Dr. Fardal\u2019s testimony and demonstrated Davis\u2019s intent to murder Sheeler. See <em>Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">{\u00b6 114} 3. Gruesome photographs during the penalty phase. During the penalty phase, no autopsy photographs were admitted into evidence. The trial court admitted, over defense objection, state\u2019s exhibits 4-V, 4-X, and 4-Y. However, a trial court may properly allow repetition of much or all that occurred in the guilt phase, pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting these photographs. The trial court also committed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>plain error in admitting, without objection, two nongruesome photographs, state\u2019s exhibits 4-N and 4-0.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">{\u00b6 115} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 116} <em>Detective Vanoy\u2019s testimony. </em>In proposition of law V, Davis claims that Newark police detective Vanoy improperly testified about the investigation and his interviews of Davis. However, except where noted, Davis failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. Additionally, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Vanoy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 117} First, Davis argues that Vanoy improperly testified that Davis became a suspect in Sheeler\u2019s murder after the police received a tip. Vanoy testified that on March 1, 2004, he received information from an out-of-state law enforcement agency that made Davis a suspect in Sheeler\u2019s murder. This testimony was offered to explain Vanoy\u2019s actions in opening the investigation. It was not hearsay, as it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 15 O.O.3d 234, 400 N.E.2d 401. Vanoy\u2019s reasons for opening the investigation were relevant and helped provide the foundation for his subsequent testimony. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 118} Second, Davis argues that Vanoy improperly testified about Davis\u2019s reaction during the interview when he was shown Sheeler\u2019s photograph and Sheeler\u2019s name was mentioned. Vanoy described Davis\u2019s response after he was shown Sheeler\u2019s photograph for the first time: \u201cYeah, she kind of looks kind of familiar. Not really sure. She may have requested me before. Just was very non-committal, very wishy washy about it.\u201d Vanoy also described Davis\u2019s reaction when he told Davis that the photograph was Elizabeth Sheeler: \u201c[H]e was kind of playing around with the name a little bit as if he didn\u2019t even know who\u2014 he wasn\u2019t putting the face with the name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 119} Evid.R. 701, which governs opinion testimony by lay witnesses, provides: \u201cIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 120} Vanoy\u2019s testimony satisfied both requirements of Evid.R. 701. Vanoy observed Davis\u2019s demeanor, and Davis\u2019s reaction was relevant in showing his evasiveness. See <em>State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 125 (detective\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s reaction to the news of his wife\u2019s murder admissible as lay opinion); <em>State v. Stojetz, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 463, 705 N.E.2d 329 (testimony that witness appeared \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cnot able to think\u201d admissible as lay opinion). Thus, Vanoy\u2019s testimony did not result in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>(\u00b6 121} Third, Davis argues that Vanoy improperly expressed his opinion that Davis had lied during his first and second interview. Vanoy returned to Newark after completing his first interview of Davis. Vanoy stated: \u201c[W]e basically round tabled the investigation with the prosecutor\u2019s office, our crime scene personnel. You know, <em>we had someone who was being very deceptive to us. </em>We had this person\u2019s DNA on her kitchen towel.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 122} A police officer\u2019s opinion that an accused is being untruthful is inadmissible. See <em>State v. Potter, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81037, 2003-Ohio-1338, 2003 WL 1355230, \u00b6 39 (officer\u2019s testimony that defendant\u2019s version of events was untruthful was improper); <em>State v. Miller </em>(Jan. 26, 2001), Montgomery App. No. 18102, 2001 WL 62793, *5; see also <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 129, 545 N.E.2d 1220 (an expert may not express opinion of a child declarant\u2019s veracity).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 123} Vanoy\u2019s testimony that Davis \u201cwas being very deceptive\u201d to them expressed his opinion that Davis was being untruthful and was erroneously admitted. Nevertheless, Vanoy\u2019s isolated comment did not result in plain error. There was overwhelming evidence of Davis\u2019s guilt. His DNA was found in bloodstains at the murder scene. This evidence was corroborated by testimony that Davis had had frequent contact with Sheeler as a taxi driver and that he went on a buying spree near the time of her murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 124} Davis also claims that Vanoy improperly expressed his opinion that Davis had lied during his second interview by testifying:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 125} \u201cMr. Davis continued to deny being involved in [Sheeler\u2019s] murder. However, one thing that stood out that was substantially different from what he had told us in Florida was <em>he admitted that he had lied </em>to Detective Mummy about knowing Mrs. Sheeler. And I asked him why had he lied to us about that, and he said, because you guys were trying to pin the murder on me.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 126} We reject this claim because Vanoy was not expressing his opinion that Davis lied. Rather, Vanoy simply testified that Davis admitted lying to investigators during his first interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 127} Fourth, Davis argues that Vanoy\u2019s ongoing commentary and interpretation of Davis\u2019s reactions during the interview denied him the right to confrontation in violation of <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars \u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Id. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. <em>Crawford </em>does not apply to Vanoy\u2019s testimony about Davis\u2019s statements because Davis is the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>{\u00b6 128} Fifth, Davis contends that Vanoy should not have testified about his first interview of Davis because the tape and transcript of the interview were available, and the tape provided the best evidence of his statements. However, the \u201cbest evidence\u201d rule did not prohibit Vanoy\u2019s testimony about the interview, even though the tape and transcript of the interview were also available. See <em>State v. Turvey </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 724, 735, 618 N.E.2d 214; <em>State v. James </em>(1974), 41 Ohio App.2d 248, 249, 70 O.O.2d 456, 325 N.E.2d 267. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 129} Sixth, Davis claims that Vanoy\u2019s testimony that Davis refused to give a tape-recorded statement after the second interview was an improper comment on his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Vanoy testified that Davis was interviewed for a second time after police decided to arrest him, but this interview was not tape-recorded. During cross-examination, Vanoy explained why the second interview was not recorded: \u201cIt was just a decision not to record that interview. We wanted to go back and get a taped statement from Mr. Davis and we tried, but he was unwilling to give us a taped statement.\u201d On redirect, Vanoy repeated, \u201c[W]e tried to do a recorded statement after the fact [but] Mr. Davis would not give us one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 130} A prosecutor may not use a defendant\u2019s postarrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence against him at trial. <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 284, 295, 106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623. However, Vanoy\u2019s testimony that Davis refused to provide a recorded statement was not a comment on Davis\u2019s right to remain silent. Davis had already freely and voluntarily discussed the crime with Vanoy on two occasions. Thus, his refusal to give a recorded statement after providing an unrecorded statement was not an exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. See <em>San Martin v. Florida </em>(Fla.1997), 705 So.2d 1337, 1346 (an accused\u2019s refusal to give a recorded statement after voluntarily providing an unrecorded statement is not an exercise of his or her right to remain silent). Hence, this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 131} Seventh, Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent by asking Vanoy whether Davis provided information about Sheeler and his brother, Randy Davis. During cross-examination, trial counsel asked Vanoy whether he had questioned Davis about any potential relationship between Randy and Sheeler. On redirect, the prosecutor asked Vanoy whether Davis had made any connection between Sheeler and Randy during the two interviews. This questioning clarified Vanoy\u2019s testimony and did not constitute a comment on Davis\u2019s right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 132} Finally, we reject Davis\u2019s argument that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Vanoy\u2019s testimony. Arguably, counsel were deficient by failing to object to Vanoy\u2019s improper testimony that Davis \u201cwas being very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>deceptive\u201d to them. However, Davis has failed to establish prejudice in view of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 133} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 134} <em>Detective Elliget\u2019s testimony. </em>In proposition of law VI, Davis argues that Elliget improperly testified before the scientific reliability of his expert testimony was established, that Elliget was neither qualified nor tendered as an expert witness, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct in questioning Elliget. However, Davis failed to object to Elliget\u2019s testimony and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. Davis also stipulated to Elliget\u2019s qualifications. Thus, Davis invited any error that he now complains of regarding Elliget\u2019s qualifications. <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus. Alternatively, Davis argues that his counsel\u2019s stipulation and failure to object constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 135} 1. Scientific reliability. In addition to the requirement of relevancy, expert testimony must meet the criteria of Evid.R. 702, which provides that a witness may testify as an expert if:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 136} \u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 137} \u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 138} \u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">{\u00b6 139} Davis invokes <em>Daubert v. Merell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, in arguing that Elliget should not have been permitted to testify about fingerprint, blood-spatter, and bloodstain evidence until the trial court had conducted a hearing on the scientific reliability of such evidence. In <em>Daubert, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that under Fed.R.Evid. 702, the trial judge has a special obligation to ensure that scientific testimony is not only relevant but reliable. Id. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">{\u00b6 140} Without a defense objection, the trial court was not obligated to conduct a hearing on the relevance and reliability of Elliget\u2019s testimony about fingerprint evidence. Indeed, \u201cthe reliability of fingerprint evidence is well established.\u201d <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">{\u00b6 141} Absent a defense objection, the trial court was also not obligated to conduct a hearing on the relevance and reliability of blood-spatter testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>See <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 452, 678 N.E.2d 891 (blood-spatter analysis is a proper subject for expert testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 142} Finally, in the absence of a defense objection, the trial court did not err by not conducting a hearing on the relevance and reliability of the use of an alternate light source to detect unseen bloodstains. Elliget testified that he had applied Leucomalachite to various surfaces in the apartment and had then used an alternate light source to presumptively indicate the presence of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 143} We have not previously ruled on the reliability of this presumptive testing. However, other jurisdictions have held that Luminol, another chemical used to detect bloodstains using an alternate light source, is sufficiently reliable for what it purports to do: presumptively indicate the presence of blood. <em>Dodd v. State, </em>2004 OK CR 31, 100 P.3d 1017, \u00b6 62; <em>State v. Canaan </em>(1998), 265 Kan. 835, 964 P.2d 681, paragraph 11 of the syllabus (use of Luminol universally accepted as a presumptive test for blood); <em>People v. Cumbee </em>(2006), 366 Ill. App.3d 476, 493, 303 Ill.Dec. 747, 851 N.E.2d 934 (Luminol testing admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 144} During his testimony, Elliget described the methodology for using an alternative light source to presumptively detect the bloodstains found in the sink area. The state found it unnecessary to introduce other potential testimony establishing the reliability of using an alternate light source because the defense did not object to its reliability. Acceptance of the reliability of such evidence in other jurisdictions supports the conclusion that the trial court committed no plain error by admitting Elliget\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 145} Finally, we reject Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claims. Counsel\u2019s failure to object falls within legitimate trial strategy. Fingerprint testimony was helpful to the defense because none of Davis\u2019s fingerprints were found in Sheeler\u2019s apartment. Counsel could also reasonably conclude that an objection to the reliability of fingerprint, blood-spatter, and presumptive bloodstain testing would be unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">{\u00b6 146} 2. Expert qualifications. Davis argues that no foundation was established to show that Elliget had the background and training to testify as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 147} During preliminary questioning, defense counsel interrupted Elliget as he was testifying about his expert qualifications: \u201cI\u2019m more than happy to stipulate to Detective Elliget\u2019s qualifications. He and I have spoken on numerous different occasions and we would agree and stipulate that he is an expert in criminology and crime scene investigation, collection of evidence * * * [a]nd preservation.\u201d Stipulations made by the defendant, or by defendant\u2019s counsel in his presence, during a criminal trial are binding. <em>State v. Turner, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 331. 2005-Ohio-1938. 826 N.E.2d 266. \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>{\u00b6 148} We reject this claim on the basis of invited error and plain error. This claim also lacks merit. Evid.R. 702(B) provides that a witness may qualify as an expert by reason of his or her specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. Neither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status upon a witness. The individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function. <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 149} In addition to the stipulation, Elliget mentioned some of his qualifications as an expert on fingerprints, blood spatter, and trace evidence. Elliget has been a criminalist with the Newark Police Department since 1994 and was a crime-scene analyst for the Mesa, Arizona Police Department from 1982 to 1992. Elliget is trained in the collection of fingerprints and the processing of fingerprints using different types of chemical and powder compounds, he received training from the FBI in the classification and identification of fingerprints, and he has testified as an expert in other cases about fingerprint evidence. Thus, Elliget\u2019s experience and training qualified him to testify as an expert about the processing of fingerprints at Sheeler\u2019s apartment. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 285-286, 754 N.E.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 150} Additionally, Elliget\u2019s background and experience qualified him to expertly testify about bloodstains and blood spatter. Elliget received training in bloodstain-pattern analysis at the Northwestern Police Training Academy in Chicago, he has been an instructor in bloodstain patterns, and he has testified in numerous cases on blood spatter and the collection of bloodstains. See <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 362, 662 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 151} Elliget was also qualified to testify as an expert about trace evidence found inside Sheeler\u2019s apartment. Elliget received training about trace evidence through the McCrone Institute of Microscopy, he has been an instructor in the collection of trace evidence, and he has testified about trace evidence in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">(\u00b6 152} We also reject Davis\u2019s claim that his counsel were ineffective by stipulating to Elliget\u2019s qualifications. Elliget provided some of his qualifications for the jury\u2019s consideration. By stipulating to Elliget\u2019s qualifications, trial counsel avoided inviting the prosecutor to ask additional questions about Elliget\u2019s background and experience that might have bolstered his qualifications even more in the eyes of the jury. Thus, counsel made a legitimate tactical decision. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 451, 2006-Ohio-1502, 844 N.E.2d 806, \u00b681.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 153} 3. Failure to tender as an expert witness. Davis claims that Elliget should not have testified as an expert because the state never formally tendered Elliget as an expert witness. Elliget was qualified to testify as an expert about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>fingerprints, blood spatter, and trace evidence. Given his qualifications, the failure to tender Elliget as an expert was of no consequence and did not result in plain error. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 154} 4. Other testimony and remarks. First, Davis claims that the prosecutor misbehaved by eliciting from Elliget that the fingerprints, blood samples, and other evidence recovered from Sheeler\u2019s apartment were available for defense testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 155} During redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Elliget about defense access to forensic evidence in the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 156} \u201cQ: Detective Elliget, * * * the items you collected from * * * Mrs. Sheeler\u2019s premises, the hairs, the fingerprints, suspected blood, the things that are confirmed blood. Those are all physically in your possession or here in the courtroom, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 157} \u201cA: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 158} \u201cQ: * * * [S]ince the day this case was charged, they\u2019ve been available for \u2014 if the Defense had wanted to do any kind of testing, would you have turned that over to them?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 159} \u201cA: Absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">{\u00b6 160} Davis argues that Elliget\u2019s testimony implied that his expert opinion was accurate because the defense did not present any expert opinion. However, Davis misconstrues Elliget\u2019s testimony. Elliget simply informed the jury that the forensic evidence recovered from the victim\u2019s apartment was available for testing by both the prosecution and the defense. Thus, Elliget\u2019s testimony does not convey the meaning that Davis ascribes to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">{\u00b6 161} Second, Davis argues that Elliget improperly vouched for the credibility of the Columbus Police Department (\u201cColumbus P.D.\u201d) crime lab. Elliget testified that he forwarded a swabbing from the kitchen sink area and the dish towel to the lab for DNA analysis. Elliget stated that he has dealt with the Columbus lab for a number of years and sent the samples there first, rather than to the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, because the \u201cColumbus P.D., they\u2019re a fee for service, where the state is none. * * * The problem * * * is that the state takes forever to get the processing done because they have such a large influx of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">{\u00b6 162} Elliget was not vouching for the credibility of the lab. His testimony was simply background information. He explained that the evidence was sent to the Columbus crime lab to obtain fast test results and avoid further delay in the police investigation. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>{\u00b6 163} Finally, Davis claims that the prosecutor misbehaved by thanking Elliget in front of the jury. Near the conclusion of Elliget\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor stated: \u201cDetective Elliget, I appreciate your time and effort both today and previously. Thank you very much.\u201d Davis offers no explanation how these remarks were prejudicial. The prosecutor was simply being courteous to the witness. Hence, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 164} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 165} <em>Admissibility of DNA report. </em>In proposition of law VII, Davis argues that the trial court erred by failing to admit defense exhibit L, the DNA lab report, into evidence. In the alternative, Davis argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to fully object to exclusion of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 166} Meghan Clement, the Technical Director for Forensic Identity Training at LabCorp, testified that Y-chromosome testing identified Davis\u2019s DNA on the bloodstained fitted sheet in Sheeler\u2019s bedroom. Clement also testified that autosomal STR testing identified Davis\u2019s DNA profile as a contributor to a mixture on two of the bloodstains.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 167} During cross-examination, trial counsel used defense exhibit L in questioning Clement about the DNA results. Defense exhibit L included two charts showing the results of DNA testing. Trial counsel\u2019s questions focused on the chart showing the results of autosomal DNA testing. This chart compared the alleles found at the 13 loci showing that Davis\u2019s and Sheeler\u2019s DNA matched the DNA found on two of the bloodstains. Trial counsel elicited Clement\u2019s explanation for scientific data, footnotes, and other information included on the chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 168} Trial counsel offered defense exhibit L into evidence. Counsel argued that this exhibit was \u201cfoundational evidence for [Clement] to get to her conclusions and, therefore, the report should be admissible.\u201d The trial court did not admit defense exhibit L.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 169} Trial counsel used Clement\u2019s chart as a demonstrative exhibit during final argument. Trial counsel argued that the comparison of Davis\u2019s DNA profile with the DNA profile of the bloodstains suggested that Davis\u2019s deceased brother, Randy, might be the source of the DNA attributed to Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 170} During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note stating: \u201cCan we have the DNA statistics of 4.6, 4.7 of Ms. Clement? It was one of the three charts used in Defense\u2019s closing statements.\u201d Trial counsel stated that the jury should not be given the chart, because it was not admitted at trial. However, trial counsel asked the trial court to reconsider its ruling and admit defense exhibit L. The trial court refused, stating: \u201c[T]he DNA charts prepared by witnesses such as the ones here * * * they\u2019re hearsay, not admissible as business records or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>anything else.\u201d The trial court informed counsel that he would tell the jurors, \u201c[Y]ou must rely on your collective memories for the testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 171} Davis argues that defense exhibit L should have been admitted because it was a business record under Evid.R. 803(6) and therefore an exception to the hearsay rule. \u201cTo qualify for admission under Rule 803(6), a business record must manifest four essential elements: (i) the record must be one regularly recorded in a regularly conducted activity; (ii) it must have been entered by a person with knowledge of the act, event or condition; (iii) it must have been recorded at or near the time of the transaction; and (iv) a foundation must be laid by the \u2018custodian\u2019 of the record or by some \u2018other qualified witness.\u2019 \u201d Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence Treatise (2007) 600, Section 803.73. Even after these elements are established, however, a business record may be excluded from evidence if \u201cthe source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d Evid.R. 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 172} \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d See <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Even relevant evidence may be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A) if its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 173} Trial counsel did not offer defense exhibit L into evidence as a business record and did not lay the necessary foundation for doing so. Defense exhibit L indicates that Clement independently reviewed the DNA results. However, Clement offered no testimony showing that defense exhibit L was \u201cgenerated by a systematic entry kept in the ordinary course of business.\u201d <em>State v. Lane </em>(1995), 108 Ohio App.3d 477, 488, 671 N.E.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 174} Even assuming the trial court erred, any error was harmless. Clement\u2019s testimony was compelling and credible evidence from which the jury could conclude that Davis\u2019s DNA was found on the bloodstained sheet. Clement\u2019s testimony, though based in part on the report, was admissible expert opinion. The information and charts on defense exhibit L were merely cumulative of her testimony. Moreover, the jury saw the chart showing the autosomal DNA results during trial counsel\u2019s final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 175} We also reject Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. The defense made no proffer. Thus, it is speculative whether further questioning of Clement would have established the necessary foundation for admitting defense exhibit L as a business record.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">{\u00b6 176} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>{\u00b6 177} <em>Instructions. </em>In proposition of law VIII, Davis argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because of erroneous jury instructions. However, except where noted, trial counsel failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 13-14, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332. Additionally, Davis argues that counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 178} First, Davis argues that the trial court erred by failing to give an instruction prohibiting the jury from stacking inferences, i.e., drawing one inference from another. The trial court refused to give this proposed instruction, but did instruct the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 179} \u201cCircumstantial evidence is the proof of facts or circumstances by direct evidence from which you may reasonably infer other related or connected facts which naturally and logically follow according to the common experience of mankind.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 180} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 181} \u201cTo infer or to make an inference is to reach a reasonable conclusion or deduction of fact which you may, but are not required to, make from other facts which you find have been established by direct evidence. Whether an inference is made rests entirely with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 182} In <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 561, 687 N.E.2d 685, we held that an instruction on stacking inferences was unnecessary when the trial court had given an instruction on inferences similar to the one given in this case. Thus, the trial court did not err by failing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">{\u00b6 183} Second, Davis argues that the following instructions on Count 1 deprived him of a unanimous verdict:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">{\u00b6 184} \u201cWhile committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit means that the death must occur as part of acts leading up to, or occurring during or immediately after the commission of kidnapping, <em>or </em>aggravated robbery, <em>or </em>aggravated burglary, and that the death was directly associated with the commission * * * of kidnapping, <em>or </em>aggravated robbery, <em>or </em>aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">{\u00b6 185} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">{\u00b6 186} \u201cBefore you can find the Defendant guilty of aggravated murder as alleged in Count 1 of the indictment, the State must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant committed or attempted to commit kidnapping, aggravated robbery <em>or </em>aggravated burglary.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">{\u00b6 187} Davis argues that the instruction deprived him of his right to a unanimous jury verdict because some of the jurors may have convicted him of aggravated murder based on the underlying offense of kidnapping and others on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the basis of aggravated robbery or aggravated burglary. However, the trial court\u2019s instructions did not result in error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 188} Jurors need not agree on a single means for committing an offense. The United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201c\u2018[D]ifferent jurors may be persuaded by different pieces of evidence, even when they agree upon the bottom line. Plainly there is no general requirement that the jury reach agreement on the preliminary factual issues which underlie the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schad v. Arizona </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 624, 631-632, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555, quoting <em>McKoy v. North Carolina </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 433, 449, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (Blackmun, J., concurring); see <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 226-228 (applying <em>Schad </em>rationale in rejecting unanimity claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 189} Davis invokes <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556, in arguing that the Sixth Amendment requires any finding of fact that makes a defendant eligible for the death penalty to be unanimously made by a jury. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not permit a defendant to be \u201cexposefd] * * * to a penalty <em>exceeding </em>the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., 530 U.S. at 483, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. In <em>Ring, </em>a capital case, the Supreme Court held that a trial judge may not make findings of fact on an aggravating circumstance necessary to impose the death penalty, as these findings are within the province of the jury. Id., 536 U.S. at 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556. Davis\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Ring </em>is misplaced because the jury\u2019s verdict, and not the judge\u2019s findings, made Davis eligible for the death penalty. Thus, this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 190} Third, Davis claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions erroneously defined reasonable doubt. However, these instructions conformed to R.C. 2901.05(D), whose constitutionality we have repeatedly affirmed. <em>State v. Hancock, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, \u00b6 76; <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 293-294, 731 N.E.2d 159. No plain error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 191} Fourth, Davis contends that the trial court\u2019s instructions on \u201cpurpose\u201d improperly made Davis responsible for any foreseeable result that flowed from his unlawful acts, relieved the state of its burden of proof on the mens rea element of aggravated murder, and created a mandatory, rebuttable presumption of the mens rea element from the mere use of a deadly weapon. The giving of this instruction was not error. The instruction does not contain the foreseeability language claimed by Davis. Cf. <em>State v. Burchfield </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 261, 263, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>611 N.E.2d 819; <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 346, 703 N.E.2d 1251. As to his remaining claims attacking the \u201cpurpose\u201d instruction, we have previously rejected these claims. See <em>State v. Taylor, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 27, 2002-Ohio-7017, 781 N.E.2d 72, \u00b6 71-75; <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 80-81, 641 N.E.2d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 192} Finally, we overrule Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claims. The jury was properly instructed on the elements of the offense under Count 1, reasonable doubt, and purpose. Thus, counsel were not deficient by failing to object to these instructions. See <em>Campbell, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 49, 630 N.E.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 193} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 194} <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>In proposition of law IX, Davis challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the kidnapping specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and the underlying kidnapping charge, R.C. 2905.01(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 195} In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 196} Count 3 charged Davis with kidnapping by removing or restraining Sheeler \u201cwith purpose to engage in sexual activity.\u201d Davis argues that the state introduced insufficient evidence that he had this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 197} \u201cR.C. 2905.01(A)(4) requires only that the restraint or removal occur for the purpose of non-consensual sexual <em>activity' </em>\u2014 not <em>that sexual activity actually take place.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 262, 552 N.E.2d 191. The state proved Davis\u2019s purpose to engage in sexual activity. Sheeler\u2019s body was found lying on the bedroom floor with her legs spread. Her panties were torn and cut in the crotch area and rolled up underneath her breasts. Moreover, presumptive testing of an oral swab obtained during the autopsy showed the presence of semen. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 198} We further determine that sufficient evidence of movement or restraint was presented to support the kidnapping charge and specification. For a kidnapping conviction to be upheld, \u201cthere must be significant restraint or movement, not just that incident to the killing itself.\u201d <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 605 N.E.2d 70. See also <em>State v. Elmore, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">{\u00b6 199} The evidence suggests that Sheeler allowed Davis to enter her apartment because she knew him, and that at some point, she was moved against her will from the front of the apartment to the bedroom, where she was eventually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>killed. Additionally, the way Sheeler\u2019s panties were both torn and cut by a sharp instrument and then rolled up underneath her breasts indicates that she was significantly restrained for some period of time as Davis forcibly assaulted her. Finally, the state presented evidence establishing that certain injuries on Sheeler\u2019s neck were consistent with a knife being held against her throat under her chin. As the trial court noted in its sentencing opinion, these wounds showed \u201c[ejvidence of restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 200} The victim\u2019s movement from the living room to the bedroom and her subsequent restraint distinguishes this situation from <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 93, in which we found no evidence that the victim was moved to or from the bedroom where she was killed, and also found no evidence of significant restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 201} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\n<em>Penalty-Phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 202} <em>Merger. </em>In proposition of law X, Davis contends that the kidnapping specification should have been merged with the aggravated-robbery specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">{\u00b6 203} Before the penalty phase, trial counsel requested merger of Specification 1 (escaping detection) and Specification 2 (kidnapping) with Specification 3 (aggravated robbery) and Specification 4 (aggravated burglary). The trial court merged the escaping-detection specification with the three other specifications. The trial court declined to merge the kidnapping offense because the \u201ckidnapping charge contained a separate animus or intent than that of the aggravated robbery or aggravated burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">{\u00b6 204} This court has held that a kidnapping is implicit within every aggravated robbery. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 198, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, fn. 29. Hence, the kidnapping and aggravated-robbery specifications must merge unless a separate animus exists as to each specification. <em>State v. Fears </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 343-344, 715 N.E.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">{\u00b6 205} Davis invokes <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, in arguing that there was no separate animus for the kidnapping and aggravated-robbery specifications. <em>Logan </em>established guidelines to determine whether kidnapping and another offense are committed with a separate animus to permit separate punishment under R.C. 2941.25(B). Id. at syllabus. The test to determine whether the kidnapping was committed with a separate animus is whether the \u201crestraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a separate underlying crime\u201d or whether instead, it has a \u201csignificance independent of the other offense.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">{\u00b6 206} Davis was charged with and convicted of kidnapping Sheeler for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. The facts indicate that Davis had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>animus to sexually assault or rape Sheeler that was separate from his animus to commit aggravated robbery, a theft-related offense. Thus, we reject Davis\u2019s argument that <em>Logan </em>requires merger of the kidnapping and aggravated-robbery specifications. Accordingly, proposition X lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 207} <em>Penalty-phase instructions. </em>In proposition of law XI, Davis argues that errors in the penalty-phase jury instructions violated his rights and require a new penalty hearing. However, except where noted, trial counsel failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d at 13-14, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332. Alternatively, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">(\u00b6 208} First, Davis contends that the trial court erred by admitting trial-phase evidence during the penalty phase and then advising the jury that \u201conly that evidence admitted in the trial phase that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances and to any of the mitigating factors is to be considered by you.\u201d To the extent that the jury may have interpreted the instructions as allowing them to determine relevancy, the trial court erred. \u201cIt is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866. However, much of the trial-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstances, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the mitigating factors. Thus, the trial court\u2019s misstatement did not result in plain error. See <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 209} Davis\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim also lacks merit. Davis was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object, because overwhelming evidence was properly admitted during the penalty phase that supported the jury\u2019s sentencing recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">{\u00b6 210} Second, Davis contends that the trial court\u2019s instructions were constitutionally defective by failing to allocate and define the burden of proof as to the mitigating factors. The trial court instructed the jury, \u201cThe Defendant does not have any burden of proof.\u201d The jury was then instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">{\u00b6 211} \u2018You <em>must consider all of the mitigating factors </em>presented to you. Mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character and background of the Defendant, and any other factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death. This means that you are not limited to the specific mitigating factors that have been described for you. You should consider any other mitigating factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">{\u00b6 212} These instructions did not constitute plain error. In fact, they provided the defense with more favorable instructions on mitigating evidence than required. See <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 171, 15 OBR 311, 473 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>N.E.2d 264 (defendant has the burden of establishing mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence). Counsel were also not ineffective by failing to object to these instructions, because the trial court instructed the jury that the \u201c[defendant does not have any burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 213} Third, Davis claims that the instructions on reasonable doubt are constitutionally defective. However, this claim has no merit. See <em>State v. Goff </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 132, 694 N.E.2d 916. We also reject Davis\u2019s claim that the burden of proof in capital cases must be proof beyond all doubt. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph eight of the syllabus. Moreover, trial counsel were not ineffective, because \u201cit was reasonable not to object.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 53, 630 N.E.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 214} Fourth, Davis argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct on residual doubt. We overrule this claim. See <em>State v. McGuire, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus. Moreover, trial counsel were not ineffective by failing to request such instructions, because no evidence supported a finding of residual doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 215} Fifth, Davis contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on the true meaning of parole eligibility. The trial court instructed the jury that if the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors, then the jurors must decide which of the life sentences should be imposed:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 216} \u201c1) Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole until the Defendant has served <em>25 full years </em>in prison;</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">{\u00b6217} \u201c2) Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole until the Defendant has served <em>SO fall years </em>in prison;</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">{\u00b6 218} \u201c3) Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">{\u00b6 219} These instructions adequately conveyed to the jurors when Davis would be eligible for parole if they chose one of the life-sentence options. See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 102-103; <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 559, 651 N.E.2d 965. Thus, there was no plain error. Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim also lacks merit because counsel could reasonably conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions adequately explained the actual length of time Davis must serve in prison before becoming parole eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">{\u00b6 220} Finally, Davis argues that the trial court erred by not instructing on mercy. However, the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to give such instructions. <em>State v. Lorraine, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 417, 613 N.E.2d 212. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claims also lacks merit because the defense was not entitled to such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">{\u00b6 221} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>Victim-Impact Evidence and Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 222} In proposition of law XIV, Davis argues that victim-impact evidence and argument were improperly presented during both phases of the trial. However, except where noted, trial counsel failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. In addition, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 223} First, Davis argues that the prosecutor exploited the emotional atmosphere of the case by repeatedly displaying a photograph of Sheeler taken before her death to the jury. The prosecutor showed Sheeler\u2019s photograph to the jurors during his opening statement and showed it to several witnesses who identified her.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 224} Under Evid.R. 403 and 611(A), the admission of photographs is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Biros, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 444, 678 N.E.2d 891. The prosecutor showed Sheeler\u2019s photograph to the jurors to acquaint them with the victim in the case. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 89 (displaying victim\u2019s photo on a big-screen television was not plain error). Moreover, the witnesses were properly shown Sheeler\u2019s photograph so they could identify her. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the method in presenting this evidence prejudiced Davis by inflaming the jury\u2019s passions. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 225} Second, Davis argues that the prosecution repeatedly mentioned during trial that the victim was 86 years old. During opening statement, the prosecutor mentioned Sheeler\u2019s age when showing her photograph to the jury, and when explaining why neighbors were concerned when they had not seen Sheeler for a couple of days. The prosecutor\u2019s comments about Sheeler\u2019s age related to the facts in the case and were clearly admissible. See <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 440, 650 N.E.2d 878. Thus, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 226} During trial-phase closing argument, the prosecutor mentioned Sheeler\u2019s age in pointing out that Davis did not become a suspect merely because of public pressure to solve the murder of an 86-year-old woman. The prosecutor also noted Sheeler\u2019s age in explaining that Davis needed to use little force in knocking her out. There was no plain error because the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the victim\u2019s age explained aspects of the state\u2019s case. See <em>State v. Smith </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 107, 684 N.E.2d 668 (\u201cproving the facts of a murder necessarily involves disclosure of details as to the victims and their lives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">{\u00b6227} During the penalty-phase closing argument, the prosecutor noted Sheeler\u2019s age in arguing that there was nothing mitigating in the nature and circumstances of the offense. This was a valid argument. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 179. Over defense objection, the prosecutor also discussed Sheeler\u2019s age in arguing that there was no connection between Davis\u2019s abusive childhood and his murder of an 86-year-old woman 30 years later. The prosecutor did not need to mention the victim\u2019s age in making this argument. However, Davis suffered no prejudice from the mention of Sheeler\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 228} We also reject Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim because he fails to demonstrate how counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted deficient performance or resulted in prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 229} Based on the foregoing, we hold that proposition XIV lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 230} In proposition of law XII, Davis argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during both phases of the trial. However, except where noted, trial counsel failed to object and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 231} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of the analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">{\u00b6 232} 1. Vouching. Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly vouched for several of the state\u2019s witnesses. An attorney may not express a personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646. Vouching occurs when the prosecutor implies knowledge of facts outside the record or places his or her personal credibility in issue. See <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">{\u00b6 233} First, Davis claims that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of Tarianne Paxson and Susan Fowls. During closing argument, defense counsel questioned the truthfulness of Paxson\u2019s and Fowls\u2019s testimony. During rebuttal, the prosecutor argued: \u201cThese folks are not the type of people that would come in here and identify somebody in this kind of case unless they were absolutely, positively certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>{\u00b6 234} Trial counsel objected to this argument as vouching, and the trial court sustained the objection. Without further objection, the prosecutor argued: \u201cDo these people appear to you to be people that would come in here and identify the person as a murderer unless they were certain? You answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 235} In rephrasing his comments, the prosecutor did not express an opinion about the witnesses\u2019 credibility because he asked the jurors to decide for themselves whether these witnesses were being truthful. <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 95. No improper vouching occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 236} Second, Davis contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of expert testimony. During trial-phase closing argument, defense counsel attacked the DNA evidence: \u201cThere are holes. It\u2019s not the infallible science that everybody wants you to believe, and by everybody, I mean Detective Vanoy; I mean Detective Elliget; Meghan Clement; Dr. Tejwani; and Mr. Oswalt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 237} During rebuttal, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 238} \u201cAnd I could spend a lot of time going through trying to explain to you folks the explanations you\u2019ve got from the DNA experts * * *; And as long as DNA has been around and as many cases these folks have done \u2014 that is, * * * Detective Elliget, Dr. Tejwani, Meghan Clement, and their degrees and stuff, they know these things more than we can hope to know, if we hope to know it at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">{\u00b6 239} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">{\u00b6 240} \u201cThe likelihood of Randy Davis [the defendant\u2019s deceased brother] being a suspect is \u2014 or being involved in this on this evidence is zero, unless you believe the combined total experience of two DNA experts of about \u2014 if I added correctly, 37 years, don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">{\u00b6 241} No improper vouching occurred because the prosecutor did not express any personal belief about the experts\u2019 credibility. Rather, the prosecutor was simply responding to defense attacks by commenting on the experts\u2019 collective experience. See <em>State v. Watson, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 10, 572 N.E.2d 97 (commenting on years of experience of two detectives not improper vouching); <em>State v. Tolliver, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-811, 2004-Ohio-1603, 2004 WL 625683, \u00b6 105-106 (commenting on bloodstain expert\u2019s experience not improper vouching). No error, plain or otherwise, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">{\u00b6 242} Third, Davis claims that during the trial-phase closing argument, the prosecutor improperly vouched for inmate Richard Hummel by stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">{\u00b6 243} \u201cI have heard people say that * * * Richard Hummel is what he is, and that is true. He is what he is. He is not somebody that\u2019s willingly coming in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>to testify * * * against somebody else charged. * * * [Tjhere\u2019s something different in kind between ratting somebody out because they told you about a drug deal or a bar fight or any number of other crimes and killing an old woman in her own home. Is that so hard to believe that the likes of Richard Hummel, regardless of his blemishes, actually does have a sense of decency about him. That he would * * * testify truthfully to facts that he could not possibly have known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 244} No vouching occurred. The state was simply arguing that Hummel was likely telling the truth because he was testifying against another inmate about his murder of an elderly woman rather than about some lesser offense. The prosecutor could refer to matters within the realm of the jurors\u2019 common knowledge and understanding in arguing that Hummel was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 245} Finally, Davis contends that the prosecutor vouched for Sharon Wright\u2019s testimony when the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 246} \u2018You don\u2019t have somebody you feel as a grandfather or grandmother figure to you die every day, at least I don\u2019t. So, the death of Mrs. Sheeler would have been memorable to Sharon Wright. This woman who sent her cards, sent her birthday and Christmas cards, didn\u2019t happen every day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 247} The prosecutor\u2019s comment about Wright\u2019s close relationship with Sheeler was made in the context of explaining why Wright would remember the date of Sheeler\u2019s death. However, the prosecutor neither implied knowledge of facts outside the record nor placed his personal credibility in issue by making such argument. <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 666, 693 N.E.2d 246. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 248} 2. Defense access to lab results. Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on the absence of a defense DNA expert witness. To the extent that counsel failed to object, Davis argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance. These claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">{\u00b6 249} During direct examination, Ramen Tejwani testified that she had provided the defense with all the notes and results from the DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">{\u00b6 250} During redirect examination, Meghan Clement was asked by the prosecution whether she had provided \u201cdocumentation regarding [her] laboratory, about [her] processes and [her] specific testing in this case for access to a defense expert.\u201d Trial counsel objected and requested a mistrial, which the trial court overruled. Clement then testified that all material related to this case was provided to the defense through the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">{\u00b6 251} Testimony that the DNA material and test results were provided to the defense for independent evaluation helped establish the credibility of the state\u2019s experts. Moreover, to the extent the testimony highlighted the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>defense expert, no error was committed. The prosecutor may comment upon the failure of the defense to offer evidence in support of its case. <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 452, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 193, 616 N.E.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 252} We also reject Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim because trial counsel did object to Clement\u2019s testimony. Moreover, counsel were not deficient by failing to object to Tejwani\u2019s testimony, because her testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 253} 3. Victim-witness testimony. Davis recasts his objections to victim-witness testimony into claims of prosecutorial misconduct. First, Davis claims that the prosecutor misbehaved by repeatedly mentioning that Sheeler was 86 years old, asking lay witnesses to identify her photograph, and displaying her photograph to the jury. As explained in response to proposition XIV, the prosecutor\u2019s comments and the presentation of Sheeler\u2019s photograph constituted neither plain nor prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 254} Davis also argues that the prosecutor improperly elicited the following testimony from Sharon Wright: \u201c[A]t Christmas time or our birthdays, [Sheeler] would give us a card. It would have like five dollars, give me one and also give Roily [Davis] one.\u201d Davis also asserts that Wright improperly testified that Sheeler \u201creminded [her] of everybody\u2019s grandma. She was just a [sic] sweet and lovable and kind as she could possibly be * * Finally, Davis claims that the prosecutor misbehaved by mentioning during trial-phase closing argument that Sheeler had been a \u201cgrandmother figure\u201d to Wright. In the alternative, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Wright\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 255} Wright\u2019s testimony was relevant in showing that Davis knew Sheeler quite well and that Davis might have taken advantage of Sheeler\u2019s kind nature in gaining entry to Sheeler\u2019s apartment. The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Wright viewed Sheeler as a grandmother was proper because it explained why Wright remembered the date of Sheeler\u2019s death. Neither Wright\u2019s testimony nor the prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted plain error. Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claims also lack merit because Wright\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s argument were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 256} 4. Commenting on Davis\u2019s silence. Davis claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on his right to remain silent and attempted to shift the burden of proof from the state to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 257} First, Davis asserts that the prosecutor used the indictment to improperly challenge him to defend himself against the charges. During opening statement, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>{\u00b6 258} \u201c[B]efore you can kind of begin that process of understanding of where the case is going * * *, you have to have at least a sense of what it is the Defendant is accused of doing. And just the fact that he\u2019s been accused of it, that he\u2019s been indicted, is not evidence. It is simply a document that gives the Defendant notice of what he\u2019s expected to defend against, what he\u2019s accused of. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">{\u00b6 259} The prosecutor\u2019s comments mentioned nothing about Davis\u2019s right to remain silent, nor did they shift the burden of proof. Moreover, the prosecutor was entitled to read the indictment to the jury during his opening statement. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 127. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 260} Second, Davis asserts that during opening statements, the prosecutor improperly stated that \u201cnobody can vouch for his whereabouts the night of the 10th or the morning of the 11th.\u201d This remark was made in summarizing the expected testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses. The prosecutor\u2019s statement did not imply that the burden of proof should shift to the defense, nor was this a comment on Davis\u2019s right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 261} Davis also claims that during closing arguments, the prosecutor improperly argued, \u201c[W]e have two ex-girlfriends that say I have no idea where he was the night of the 10th or the early morning of the 11th. Haven\u2019t got a clue. Nobody \u2014 nobody places \u2014 gives this guy an alibi, gives this guy any explanation for his whereabouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 262} The prosecutor\u2019s argument was made in the context of Wright\u2019s and Geer\u2019s testimony and of Davis\u2019s failure to give Vanoy an explanation of his whereabouts in his taped statement that was provided to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6263} During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, Sharon Wright testified about her contact with Roland Davis on the dates when the murder occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 264} \u201cQ [Prosecutor]: Okay. * * * July 11th, did you have any contact with Mr. Davis?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">{\u00b6 265} \u201cA [Wright]: No sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">{\u00b6 266} \u201cQ: July 10th, did you have any contact?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">{\u00b6 267} \u201cA: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">{\u00b6 268} \u201cQ: Did he stay at your apartment either one of those days?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">{\u00b6 269} \u201cA: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">{\u00b6 270} \u201cQ: Did you know where he was?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">{\u00b6 271} \u201cA: No, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">{\u00b6 272} Terri Geer testified during the state\u2019s case-in-chief that Davis had shown up at her house on July 11 and had brought her son a set of drums that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Davis had purchased. She was then asked about her contact with Davis before that:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 273} \u201cQ [Prosecutor]: Using the day the drums showed up at your house as kind of a focal point, if you would, when is the last time you would have had contact with Mr. Davis if you recall?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 274} \u201cA [Geer]: Maybe a week or more before that.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 275} \u201cQ: Okay. So, you cannot account for his whereabouts in the early morning hours of the same day the drum set appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">0 276} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 277} \u201cQ: You cannot account for his whereabouts the night before or any of the activities of the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">0278} \u201cA: No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">0 279} As recounted above in our discussion of proposition of law II, Davis\u2019s taped interview with Vanoy was an important part of defense counsel\u2019s strategy in presenting Davis\u2019s case to the jury. During closing argument, defense counsel stated that Davis did not have to testify, because \u201cnot only do you have a three and a half, roughly, hour recorded statement from him, but you\u2019ve got a 112 page transcript that writes down * * * the interview.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">0 280} During his interview with Vanoy, Davis denied having any contact with Sheeler after February 19, 2000, when he was still working with Yellow Cab. Davis also discussed where he was living in Newark when he purchased the Grand Marquis on July 10, 2000:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">0 281} \u201cSV [Stephen Vanoy]: Ok. Who were you living with * * * the day that you bought that car, July 10th, * * * that night, [Sheeler] died.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">0 282} \u201cRD [Roland Davis]: Uh huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">0 283} \u201cSV: Who were you living with when you bought that car?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">0 284} \u201cRD: I think me and Terry [sic, Terri Geer] just broke up and I went back into Sharon\u2019s house, I\u2019m thinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">0285}\u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">0 286} \u201cSV: Ok, so * * * who were you living with when you bought that car <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">0 287} \u201cRD: (Pause) * * * [E]ither my brother or Sharon, one of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">0 288} \u201cSV: Ok, Dana?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-20\">0 289} \u201cRD: Yea. Yea.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">0 290} \u201cSV: Alright, on Maple?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">0 291} \u201cRD: Yea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>{\u00b6 292} The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, when taken in the context of all the above testimony, shows that he was arguing that there was no explanation for Davis\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the murder:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 293} \u201cWe have to know \u2014 we have to have some indication one way or another where he was that night. Well, we have two answers to that. Two pieces of information that goes to that. On the one hand we have two ex-girlfriends that say I have no idea where he was the night of the 10th or the early morning of the 11th. Haven\u2019t got a clue. Nobody \u2014 nobody places \u2014 -gives this guy an alibi, gives this guy any explanation of his whereabouts. We know he\u2019s in town on the 10th because he bought a car that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 294} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 295} \u201cNobody places him anyplace else. DNA places him smack dab where the perpetrator was, both in the bedroom and cleaning up in the kitchen later. Dumb luck. No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 296} Here, the prosecutor\u2019s argument did not impinge on Davis\u2019s right to remain silent or imply that the burden of proof should shift to him. Cf. <em>State v. Collins </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 524, 527-528, 733 N.E.2d 1118. Nevertheless, the prosecutor\u2019s mention of \u201calibi\u201d during his argument was inartful.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the prosecutor\u2019s use of that term did not result in plain error, considering the DNA evidence and other testimony establishing Davis\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">{\u00b6 297} Third, Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony from Vanoy that Davis refused to give a tape-recorded statement after his second interview. Additionally, Davis argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted ineffective assistance. As explained in proposition V, testimony that Davis refused to provide a recorded statement was not a comment on his right to remain silent. There is also no merit in Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claim because counsel\u2019s decision not to object reflected \u201can objective standard of reasonableness\u201d under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 298} Finally, Davis asserts that the prosecutor improperly commented on Davis\u2019s silence by mentioning Davis\u2019s refusal to give a tape-recorded interview and stating that only guilty people lie. During his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">{\u00b6 299} \u201cMr. Sanderson [the defense counsel] talks about the interview at the police department and * * * it wasn\u2019t recorded, and it\u2019s not because he didn\u2019t say anything important, unlike the words Mr. Sanderson was using, Detective Vanoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>said he didn\u2019t say anything different. * * * Had it been different, I\u2019d have recorded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">{\u00b6 300} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 301} \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any different. The only difference was the Defendant finally admits the obvious. I lied to you down in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 302} \u201cNow, he didn\u2019t just start lying when he\u2019s confronted with the possibility that he\u2019s going to be accused of a murder. He lies from the jump and only guilty people do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 303} The prosecutor did not improperly comment on Davis\u2019s right to remain silent. Rather, the prosecutor was responding to defense claims that investigators did not record Davis\u2019s second interview because \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t confess. They assumed they had their man.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Davis had lied was based on Vanoy\u2019s testimony that Davis \u201cadmitted that he had lied to Detective Mummy about knowing Mrs. Sheeler\u201d during his first interview. The prosecutor\u2019s argument that \u201conly guilty people\u201d lie was a comment on Davis\u2019s consciousness of guilt and not his silence. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 304} 5. Denigrating defense counsel. Davis argues that during trial-phase closing arguments, the prosecutor denigrated defense counsel. It is improper to denigrate defense counsel in the jury\u2019s presence. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 305} During closing argument, trial counsel challenged expert testimony that the odds were in the quadrillions that another person shared the same DNA profile as Davis. Counsel argued that the odds were really one in 6.5 billion because that is how many people live in the world. During rebuttal, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 306} \u201cAnd Mr. Sanderson wants to talk about * * * there\u2019s only six and a half billion people in the world, why isn\u2019t there only six and a half billion DNA strands. * * * [According to his argument, nobody else could be born tomorrow, because we wouldn\u2019t have enough DNA to go around. Maybe some day in a distant future, long after I\u2019m gone, we\u2019ll populate other worlds and there will be 97 quadrillion humans, and maybe then * * * we might have a second person in this world that will have the same DNA pattern. Maybe. * * * There\u2019s two people that could have done this, * * * Roland Davis and that loose primate we just quite haven\u2019t found yet that\u2019s running around Newark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">{\u00b6 307} The prosecutor could properly respond to defense argument attacking DNA statistics. However, the prosecutor\u2019s sarcastic remarks about the \u201cloose primate\u201d running around Newark improperly denigrated trial counsel in front of the jury. The state argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not objectionable, because Clement testified that there is \u201csome cross-reactivity with higher pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>mates\u201d in DNA testing. Nevertheless, in the context in which they were stated, the prosecutor\u2019s comments disparaged the defense counsel. See <em>LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 308} The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not result in plain error. The prosecutor\u2019s denigrating comments did not pervade the closing argument, let alone the entire trial. Moreover, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that the result of the trial would have been different absent these improper comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 309} 6. Arguing for justice. Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly argued for justice for the victim. Davis also argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to such argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 310} Davis claims that during guilt-phase closing arguments, the prosecutor improperly urged: \u201c[L]et\u2019s make this case about Elizabeth Sheeler getting justice * * Davis also challenges the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal comment, \u201cElizabeth Sheeler is asking you on this evidence to convict her murderer and so am I.\u201d Finally, Davis argues that during his penalty-phase closing argument, the prosecutor improperly argued, \u201c[JJustice is a two-way street. * * * [H]e has had his side of the highway. Give Elizabeth Sheeler hers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 311} \u201cThere is nothing inherently erroneous in calling for justice * * <em>State v. Evans, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 240, 586 N.E.2d 1042. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were within the creative latitude afforded both parties in closing arguments. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 85-86 (argument that victim \u201cnever given justice\u201d like the defendant was proper); <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 145 (argument that \u201cin death, [the victim] asks for justice in her absence\u201d considered proper). Thus, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 312} Davis\u2019s ineffectiveness claims also lack merit because trial counsel had no basis for objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 313} 7. Penalty-phase misconduct. Davis claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct a number of times during the penalty phase. Furthermore, Davis argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object resulted in ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 314} First, Davis argues that during his opening statement, the prosecutor misbehaved by informing the, jurors that they would consider only three specifications during the penalty phase even though the jury had found Davis guilty of four specifications. Davis claims that such an explanation should have come from the court rather than the prosecutor. We overrule this claim because at the start of the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury that there were three aggravating circumstances to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>{\u00b6 315} Second, Davis argues that the prosecutor\u2019s improper cross-examination of mitigating witnesses and his penalty-phase argument improperly suggested that much of his mitigating evidence should not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 316} Davis asserts that the prosecutor improperly asked about his failure to pay child support. Dana Davis, the defendant\u2019s brother, described Davis\u2019s lengthy work record and mentioned that Davis has five children. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked, \u201c[I]n light of this experience about him having to go out and work, do you know why he got so far behind in child support for two of these kids?\u201d In a follow-up question, the prosecutor asked, \u201cBut in 1989, he\u2019s behind in child support to in excess of $31,000 for just two kids, correct?\u201d Dana replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 317} The cross-examination about Davis\u2019s failure to pay child support in 1989 was irrelevant and tended to portray Davis in a negative light. Nevertheless, such testimony did not constitute outcome-determinative plain error. See <em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 95; <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 161, 749 N.E.2d 226 (erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s failure to pay child support deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 318} Next, Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly asked Dana about a lawsuit filed against Davis. During direct examination, Dana testified that Davis used to work at Callander Cleaners and that \u201c[h]is boss would always * * * try to get [Dana] to talk [Davis] into coming back.\u201d However, Dana said, the defendant had quit working there because his employer did not keep his promises. During cross-examination, Dana was asked about Davis\u2019s failure to repay a $4,000 loan from Callander Cleaners. The prosecutor then asked: \u201c[I]sn\u2019t it a fact Callander Cleaners had to sue him to get that money * * *?\u201d Dana said, \u201cI heard nothing about that.\u201d The prosecutor committed no misconduct in asking these questions because the defense had opened the door to this line of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 319} Davis also asserts that the prosecutor improperly asked Dana \u201cabout buying $1,200 worth of drums for his ex-girlfriend\u2019s son as a way to get back\u201d into Geer\u2019s favor. This subject had little relevance. However, no plain error occurred because such testimony had been properly presented earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 320} Further, Davis complains that the prosecutor misbehaved by improperly asking Dolly Sidle, a friend of the Davis family, about the strength of character of Sharon Davis, the defendant\u2019s older sister. During direct, Sidle testified that Sharon told her that she had \u201cseen her mother go through beatings and so forth and she was not doing it herself.\u201d During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Sidle, \u201cSo, despite [Sharon\u2019s] upbringing, she had the strength of character to say it\u2019s not going to happen around here, correct?\u201d Sidle said, \u201cCorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>{\u00b6 321} The defense opened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Moreover, because Davis sought to mitigate his offenses by relying on his family background, the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was relevant in showing that Davis\u2019s sister, who had the same family background, had overcome their father\u2019s abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 322} Davis also claims that the prosecutor improperly asked Sidle about her husband\u2019s success in overcoming a drinking problem. Although such questioning had only marginal relevance, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 323} Davis also argues that the prosecutor misbehaved in cross-examining Susan McGuire, a childhood friend of Davis, about her abusive father. During direct examination, McGuire testified that she had had an abusive stepfather. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked, \u201c[T]hat didn\u2019t cause you to go out and kill anybody, did it?\u201d McGuire said no. The defense opened the door to this questioning, and no plain error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 324} Davis also argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during his penalty-phase argument by asserting that Davis\u2019s abusive upbringing was not mitigating. The prosecutor argued, \u201c[T]here is no logical connection between this man\u2019s upbringing as \u2014 as alleged mitigating factors and the circumstance that he found himself in * * * the year 2000. There is no connection and, therefore, there is no mitigation.\u201d But \u201c[pjrosecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 399, 659 N.E.2d 292. The prosecutor\u2019s argument was not improper and did not result in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 325} Third, Davis contends that the prosecutor misbehaved by arguing the absence of mitigating factors the defense never raised. Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly argued that the nature and circumstances of the offense were aggravating when the defense never requested the jury to consider them as mitigating. During his penalty-phase argument, the prosecutor asked, \u201cIs there anything mitigating about the nature and circumstance of the offense[?J\u201d The prosecutor then reviewed key facts in the case and stated, \u201cI defy any one of you to come up with anything mitigating in the circumstances and nature of this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 326} \u201cAlthough * * * prosecutors cannot argue that the nature and circumstances of the offense of an offense are aggravating circumstances, the facts and circumstances of the offense must be examined to determine whether they are mitigating. R.C. 2929.04(B). Thus, a prosecutor may legitimately refer to the nature and circumstances of the offense, both to refute any suggestion that they are mitigating and to explain why the specified aggravating circumstanee[s] outweigh mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 230, 238, 703 N.E.2d 286. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was not improper and did not result in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>{\u00b6 327} Next, Davis argues that prosecutor improperly argued that Davis did not suffer from a mental disorder, because mental illness was never raised as a mitigating factor. During his penalty-phase rebuttal argument, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 328} \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication that the Defendant is anything other than he was held back in school a couple times, but no medical diagnosis of some huge mental disorder that wasn\u2019t of his choosing, some organic this or that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 329} Davis opened the door to this argument when his counsel argued that his father\u2019s abuse left a scar on Davis\u2019s psyche. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s comments responded to defense argument that Davis\u2019s low IQ scores showed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have the capabilities, * * * intelligence * * * [or] resources to call upon to make the type of decision which would have gotten him the help that was not provided in these formative years.\u201d The prosecutor was entitled to respond to defense claims by pointing out the absence of evidence that Davis suffered from a serious mental disorder. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 330} Next, Davis argues that the prosecutor improperly argued that the statutory mitigating factor of youth did not apply because the defense did not raise this as a mitigating factor. During the penalty-phase argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 331} \u201cRemember the situation I think I gave all of you in the jury selection process * * * [and I] gave you a scenario of these two identical aggravated robberies. * * * And I asked you * * * if they\u2019re identical that there might be reasons to impose the death penalty in one case but not the other. * * * And then we talked about, well, what if this guy was 18 years old when he committed the offense and from the age of 10 all he ever knew was the life of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">(\u00b6 332} \u201cThis guy over here was 35 and had all the options in the world. I submit that this Defendant, Roland Davis, is more like this guy over here. Not because he didn\u2019t have some abusive childhood, witnessing his mother being assaulted, no, but because for 30 years he\u2019s been out of that. * * * For 30 years he\u2019s had an opportunity to work, to make something of himself. But in 2000 he nonetheless chose the course of action that you\u2019ve convicted him of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 333} The prosecutor was not arguing that the mitigating factor of youth did not apply. Rather, the prosecutor presented two hypothetical fact situations to rebut mitigation linking Davis\u2019s childhood abuse with the murder of Sheeler 30 years later. Prosecutors can be \u201ccolorful or creative\u201d in making final arguments. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 317, 528 N.E.2d 523. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">(\u00b6 334} Finally, Davis\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims lack merit. As previously explained, none of the alleged instances of penalty-phase prosecutorial miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>duct prejudicially affected Davis\u2019s substantive rights. Therefore, trial counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 335} 8. <em>Brady </em>issue. Davis contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to disclose impeaching information, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215; <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 336} Over the state\u2019s objection, the defense filed a pretrial motion, requesting the disclosure of all information that impeached or tended to impeach any of the state\u2019s witnesses. The trial court overruled this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 337} Davis contends that the prosecutor committed a <em>Brady </em>violation by failing to reveal that inmate. Hummel had violated his probation. However, Davis fails to provide any specifics about the probation violation or when it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 338} In <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, the Supreme Court held that \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d Favorable evidence under <em>Brady </em>encompasses both exculpatory and impeachment evidence, and evidence must be both favorable and material before disclosure is required. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 674, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481. Evidence is material within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>only if there exists a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 419, 433-434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490, quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481. \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>State v. Johnston </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898, paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 339} Davis has not supported his <em>Brady </em>claim with sufficient evidence. It is highly speculative whether the failure to disclose the alleged probation violation is \u201cmaterial\u201d because Davis has failed to provide any specifics about the violation. Moreover, Davis fails to show a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different if the information had been disclosed before trial. Information about a probation violation might have impeached Hummel\u2019s credibility. However, impeachment evidence would not have been significant in the outcome of the case because DNA evidence established Davis\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 340} Based on the foregoing, proposition XII lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">{\u00b6 341} In proposition of law XIII, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective on multiple occasions during both phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>{\u00b6 342} 1. Expert and Investigative Assistance. Davis contends that his counsel were ineffective for failing to request or demonstrate the need for expert or investigative assistance to fully investigate the case and present an effective penalty-phase defense. However, defense counsel did request funds for a private investigator, a mitigation specialist, a DNA expert, and a defense psychologist. The trial court granted each of these requests. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 343} 2. Shackles. Davis asserts that his counsel were ineffective by failing to request a hearing on the necessity of Davis\u2019s wearing shackles during the trial. However, nothing in the record indicates that Davis was tried in shackles or that any restraint used was visible to the jury. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 344} 3. Stipulating to Admissibility of DNA Evidence. Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by stipulating to evidence establishing the admissibility of DNA evidence. Before trial, the prosecution and defense stipulated to the chain of custody, the qualifications of the DNA experts, and the accreditation of the DNA testing labs, and that DNA testing was conducted under generally accepted means within the scientific community. The trial court admitted the stipulation and ten validation studies to support the DNA testing. The trial court then ruled that the DNA evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 345} Davis fails to specify any evidence that his counsel should have presented in lieu of the stipulation that would have undermined the chain of custody, the expert\u2019s qualifications, or the admissibility of the DNA test results. In <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 490, 497, 597 N.E.2d 107, we held that \u201cthe theory and procedures used in DNA typing are generally accepted within the scientific community.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[n]o pretrial evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine the reliability of the DNA evidence.\u201d Id. at 501, 597 N.E.2d 107. Thus, trial counsel\u2019s use of stipulations was a legitimate tactical decision that does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Nicholas </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 437, 613 N.E.2d 225 (\u201cthe failure to challenge the admissibility of [DNA] evidence cannot be considered ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 346} 4. Stipulations. Davis also complains that his counsel were ineffective by entering into ten joint stipulations. Davis claims that this number of stipulations suggested to the jury that the defense agreed with the state\u2019s theory of the case and that the verdict was a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 347} Trial counsel\u2019s decision to enter into these stipulations was a \u201ctactical decision\u201d that falls \u201c \u2018within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 148, 609 N.E.2d 1253, quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Nothing in the record suggests that any of the stipulated testimony would have been different had the witnesses been called to the stand. Trial counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>stipulations allowed the defense to portray an air of candor before the jury. They also prevented a stream of additional prosecution witnesses from testifying in court. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 348} 5. Failure to investigate and prepare for mitigation. Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective during the penalty phase by failing to fully investigate, prepare, and present mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 349} The presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy. <em>State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 530, 684 N.E.2d 47. \u201cMoreover, \u2018strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 189, quoting <em>Wiggins v. Smith </em>(2003), 539 U.S. 510, 521, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 350} First, Davis argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to thoroughly investigate his \u201cpsychosocial history\u201d and failing to present the testimony of a psychologist during mitigation. The defense hired Dr. Dennis Eshbaugh, a psychologist, several weeks before the penalty phase to assist in preparing mitigation. The record does not show why Dr. Eshbaugh was not called to testify or what testimony he would have provided. Thus, nothing in the record establishes that counsel were deficient by not calling Dr. Eshbaugh or that, if called, he would have provided relevant mitigating evidence. See <em>State v. Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 351} Second, Davis contends that his counsel were ineffective by failing to present a mitigation theme or strategy. Trial counsel\u2019s strategy was to convince the jury that Davis should receive a life sentence by showing that he was raised in an abusive home, suffered hearing problems while growing up that hindered his development, and had a low intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 352} In support of this strategy, trial counsel presented the testimony of Davis\u2019s mother, brother, aunt, and two lifelong family friends. The witnesses testified that Davis had an alcoholic father who frequently beat his mother and abused other family members. Davis\u2019s mother and brother testified about his ear problems, and his school records showed that he was a poor student with a low IQ. The defense theory, although unsuccessful, was coherent and fit into the testimony. Counsel made a strategic trial decision in presenting the defense mitigation theory and were not ineffective. See <em>State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 353} Third, Davis argues that his counsel were deficient by failing to present testimony about the significance of evidence that he was abandoned at a children\u2019s home and suffered from hearing problems when he was young.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>{\u00b6 354} \u201cThe decision to forgo the presentation of additional mitigating evidence does not itself constitute proof of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 536, 684 N.E.2d 47. \u201c \u2018Attorneys need not pursue every conceivable avenue; they are entitled to be selective.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765, quoting <em>United States v. Davenport </em>(C.A.7, 1993), 986 F.2d 1047, 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 355} Rose Weimer, the defendant\u2019s mother, testified that she left home for three months to escape her husband\u2019s abuse. Weimer returned home after learning that her husband had placed their children in a children\u2019s home. Weimer then \u201cgot all of them back.\u201d She also testified about Davis\u2019s hearing problems, which his father ignored. Thus, the jury heard testimony that Davis spent time at a children\u2019s home and suffered from hearing problems when he was young. It is highly speculative whether additional noncumulative testimony could have been provided about these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 356} Finally, Davis asserts that counsel were deficient by failing to stipulate to records without calling a witness to explain their significance to the jury. Counsel presented records during the penalty phase including: (1) Davis\u2019s medical records from Children\u2019s Hospital, (2) a statement that Davis had not been disciplined while in pretrial confinement, and (3) his education records. Counsel made a legitimate tactical choice in introducing Davis\u2019s records without highlighting specific information for the jury\u2019s consideration. These records were not voluminous, and the jury could readily review this information during their deliberations. See <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 357} 6. Other ineffectiveness claims. Davis raises other instances of alleged ineffectiveness, but none of these has merit. As discussed in other propositions, counsel were not ineffective during jury selection (proposition I), or by failing to object to the introduction of tapes without playing them in court (propositions II and III), or by stipulating to Elliget\u2019s qualifications (proposition VI), or by failing to more zealously object to the exclusion of Clement\u2019s report (proposition VII). Counsel were also not ineffective by failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct (proposition XII), to Vanoy\u2019s testimony (proposition V), or to the instructions (propositions VIII and XI).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 358} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\n<em>Sentencing Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">{\u00b6 359} In proposition of law XVI, Davis asserts that there are numerous flaws in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">{\u00b6 360} First, Davis argues that the trial court failed to explain <em>why </em>the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>doubt. This claim lacks merit because the opinion contains extensive discussion of the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors. Furthermore, our independent reassessment of the sentence will eliminate any deficiencies in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">{\u00b6 361} Second, Davis argues that the trial court improperly evaluated evidence of his abusive childhood and limited intellectual abilities. However, the \u201cassessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293. Moreover, the fact that mitigation evidence is admissible \u201cdoes not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. Here, the sentencing opinion fully reviewed testimony about Davis\u2019s abusive childhood and evidence about his limited intellectual abilities. The trial court could reasonably assign any or no weight to such evidence. See <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 103. Thus, no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 362} Finally, Davis asserts that the trial court ignored mitigating evidence of Davis\u2019s abandonment as a child, bullying by other children because he stuttered, his father\u2019s verbal abuse in calling him a \u201cretard,\u201d and his low IQ indicating borderline intellectual functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 363} \u201cWhile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of mitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643, citing <em>Parker v. Dugger </em>(1991), 498 U.S. 308, 314-315, 111 S.Ct. 731, 112 L.Ed.2d 812. The trial court discussed Davis\u2019s speech problems, including stuttering, his abandonment at the local children\u2019s home, and his limited intellectual ability as shown in his school records. The trial court also stated that it \u201chas considered all the mitigating factors raised at any stage of the trial that are relevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.\u201d Therefore, this claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 364} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\n<em>Noncapital Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 365} In proposition of law XVIII, Davis argues that trial court erred by sentencing him on his noncapital offenses to maximum and consecutive sentences in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">{\u00b6 366} Davis was sentenced to ten years\u2019 confinement for kidnapping (Count 3), ten years\u2019 confinement for aggravated robbery (Count 4), and ten years\u2019 confinement for aggravated burglary (Count 5). The trial court ordered \u201ceach count to run consecutive to the other and concurrent to Count 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>{\u00b6 367} The trial court made the following findings for imposing maximum and consecutive sentences:</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">{\u00b6 368} \u201cAs to Counts 3, 4 and 5, the Court finds the Defendant has committed the worst forms of the offenses and further poses the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes on the basis of the aggravating circumstances set out herein and the Defendant\u2019s prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 369} \u201cFurther, the Court finds consecutive prison terms are necessary to protect the public and punish the offender and are not disproportionate to those sentences received by others convicted of similar offenses, nor disproportionate to the sentences imposed on similar facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 370} \u201cThe Court further finds that the harm here is so great that a single term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the Defendant\u2019s conduct, and that the Defendant\u2019s criminal history, as set forth in the discovery record filed with the Court, shows that consecutive terms are necessary to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 371} \u201cThe Court also adopts those facts and circumstances with regard to the consecutive sentences and the maximum sentences that have been presented in this case as aggravating circumstances that are relevant to what it has previously indicated regarding consecutive sentences and the maximum sentences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 372} At the conclusion of the sexual-classification hearing, trial counsel stated, \u201c[W]e would place an objection on the record to imposition of consecutive sentences\u201d regarding Counts 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">{\u00b6 373} On June 24, 2004, more than one year before Davis\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. <em>Blakely </em>held that the Sixth Amendment prohibits a judge from imposing a sentence greater than that allowed by a jury verdict or by the defendant\u2019s admissions at a plea hearing. Id. at 305-306, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 374} On February 27, 2006, in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, we applied <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, to Ohio\u2019s noncapital sentencing statutes. <em>Foster </em>held that portions of R.C. 2929.14(C), which requires judicial findings of fact for maximum prison terms, and R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), which requires judicial findings for consecutive terms, are unconstitutional under <em>Blakely. Foster, </em>paragraphs one and three of the syllabus. <em>Foster </em>also held that these unconstitutional statutory provisions are severable and that judicial findings of fact are no longer required before the imposition of maximum sentences or consecutive prison terms. Id., paragraphs two and four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>{\u00b6 375} In the present case, the trial court\u2019s fact-finding in support of maximum and consecutive sentences violated <em>Foster </em>because a jury did not make findings on the seriousness of the offense justifying maximum or consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">{\u00b6 376} However, we reject Davis\u2019s challenge to the imposition of his <em>maximum </em>sentences based on our recent decision in <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306. In <em>Payne, </em>we held, \u201c[A] lack of an objection in the trial court forfeits the <em>Blakely </em>issue for purposes of appeal when the sentencing occurred after the announcement of Blakely.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id. at \u00b6 31. Thus, Davis\u2019s failure to object to the imposition of maximum sentences has forfeited his claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 377} Davis\u2019s challenge to the imposition of his <em>consecutive </em>sentences is also overruled. Davis objected to the imposition of consecutive sentences but failed to invoke <em>Blakely </em>or mention any constitutional grounds as the basis for his objection. Davis\u2019s failure to challenge his consecutive sentences as a constitutional violation provided the trial court with no basis to make a proper ruling. See <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277, syllabus (the failure to raise the constitutionality of a statute or its application at the trial court level, when the issue is apparent at the time of trial, constitutes a waiver of the issue). Thus, as in <em>Payne, </em>we hold that counsel\u2019s failure to \u201ctimely assert his rights under <em>Blakely </em>\u201d has forfeited this issue. <em>Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 378} A forfeited claim will still be considered under plain-error analysis. <em>Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 24. However, the test for plain error is stringent. A party claiming plain error must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) the error affected the outcome of the trial. See <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; Crim.R. 52(B). Moreover, the burden of demonstrating plain error is on the party asserting it. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jester </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 512 N.E.2d 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 379} No plain error occurred. Nothing in the record suggests that Davis\u2019s noncapital sentencing would have been more lenient if he had been sentenced in accordance with <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Foster. </em>Indeed, \u201c[s]ince <em>Foster, </em>trial courts no longer must navigate a series of criteria that dictate the sentence and ignore judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>at \u00b6 25. Accordingly, Davis has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the judicial fact-finding requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 380} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 381} We summarily reject Davis\u2019s challenges in proposition of law XV to the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty proportionality review based on our precedents. See <em>State v. </em>LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 382} We summarily reject Davis\u2019s various claims in proposition of law XVII challenging the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 383} We also reject Davis\u2019s claim that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international law and treaties to which the United States is a party. See <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">\n<em>Independent Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">{\u00b6 384} Having considered Davis\u2019s propositions of law, as required by R.C. 2929.05(A), we now independently review Davis\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis was properly convicted of the aggravated murder of Elizabeth Sheeler while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, and while committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">{\u00b6 385} Against these aggravating circumstances, we now weigh the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Davis called five mitigation witnesses. He also introduced his medical records from Children\u2019s Hospital, his academic records, and a statement that he had not been disciplined while in pretrial confinement. Davis did not present a sworn or unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">{\u00b6 386} Ruth Cummings, the defendant\u2019s aunt, testified that Tom Davis, the defendant\u2019s father, never supported his family and that the gas and electricity were shut off at their home because of unpaid bills. Tom did not work much and spent his money on \u201c[b]eer, cigarettes, things of that nature.\u201d Tom was very</p>\n<p id=\"AIO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>abusive to his family and would \u201cjust explode for no reason.\u201d Cummings witnessed Tom shove and hit the defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 387} Davis has four brothers and one sister. Cummings stated that the defendant\u2019s mother was \u201ca good caring mother who took care of all their physical needs and fed them and clothed them and took care of everything.\u201d Davis and his siblings spent a lot of time with his grandparents, who lived in Newark. Davis was a \u201cdevoted grandson * * * [and] cared about them greatly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 388} Dana Davis, one of the defendant\u2019s younger brothers, testified that their father was an alcoholic who beat their mother four or five days a week. Once, Tom came home really drunk and kicked through the door. Their mother grabbed a butcher knife in self-defense and ended up stabbing Tom when he came at her. Dana also remembers Tom whipping the defendant \u201cwith a belt all the way up the stairs and all the way down the stairs one night.\u201d When the beatings took place, Dana and his siblings were young, and there was nothing they could do. They would \u201cjust scream and holler and beg [their father] not to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 389} Davis has been married four times and has five children. Davis has worked for an ice cream company, a dry-cleaning company, a cab company, a flower factory, and an oil rig. He also \u201cran equipment\u201d for Dana\u2019s sea-wall and landscaping business.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 390} Dolly Sidle, a friend of the Davis family, spent a great deal of time at the defendant\u2019s home over the years. Sidle stated that the defendant\u2019s father was \u201cmean,\u201d and \u201cin today\u2019s society, they would have probably locked Thomas up a long time ago.\u201d She never saw Tom interacting with his children in a positive way by helping them with homework or tossing a football or baseball with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 391} Susan McGuire, a childhood friend of Davis, lived across the street from the Davis family. McGuire testified that Tom was \u201cnice to [the] neighbor kids, but he was always yelling and carrying on at his family, mostly his wife.\u201d Davis would sometimes hand tools to Tom when he was working on cars. Tom would \u201crant and rave\u201d and call Davis a \u201c[r]etard\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d if Davis gave him a wrong tool. On one occasion, Davis\u2019s sister came to McGuire\u2019s home to call the police because Tom had hit their mother. At other times, the Davis children would come to McGuire\u2019s home to make phone calls because Tom \u201cwas always ripping the phone out of the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 392} Rose Weimer, the defendant\u2019s mother, testified that her marriage to Tom was \u201cpure hell.\u201d Tom beat her \u201c[e]very chance he got.\u201d At one point, Rose left home for three months because Tom \u201cthreatened [her] so much.\u201d Rose later found out that Tom had placed the kids in the Children\u2019s Home. She later returned to Tom and brought their children home. However, Tom continued to threaten and beat Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>{\u00b6 393} Davis stutters when he gets excited or upset. Other children teased Davis in grade school because he stuttered. Davis also had a hearing problem when he was young. Davis had bad earaches, and Rose noticed an odor coming out of one of his ears. This problem persisted for three or four years, but Tom did not want to spend money on a doctor. Later, Davis was diagnosed with a perforated eardrum and had surgery to correct it. She said that Davis did not care much about school and quit after completing the ninth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 394} After 23 years of marriage, Rose left her husband and moved to Florida with Davis and two of her other children. Davis was 17 or 18 years old when they moved. He got a job, provided financial support for the family, and took care of the two younger children while Rose was at work. Davis helped his family for a long time in Florida. They would put their money together and buy food and pay the rent. About ten years ago, Davis moved back to the Newark area.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 395} Davis\u2019s medical records verify his history of childhood ear problems. Davis\u2019s academic records from the Newark city schools show that he was a poor student who received mostly C\u2019s and D\u2019s. He dropped out of school in the tenth grade. His test scores show an IQ range between 74 and 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 396} Licking County jail records show that Davis had no disciplinary infractions while he was in pretrial confinement between September 8, 2004, and July 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">{\u00b6 397} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating. On July 10 or July 11, 2000, Davis entered Sheeler\u2019s apartment and murdered Sheeler by stabbing her in the neck and chest. Davis stole money from the apartment and fled the scene. These facts establish a horrific crime without any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">{\u00b6 398} Davis\u2019s character offers nothing in mitigation. However, his history and background provides some mitigating value. Davis was raised by an abusive father who frequently beat his mother and berated him. Davis did poorly in school and dropped out of high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">{\u00b6 399} When he was 18 years old, Davis moved with his mother and two younger brothers to Florida. He provided needed financial support for the family and helped look after his brothers. Testimony shows that Davis has a long work record. He is also the father of five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">{\u00b6 400} The statutory mitigating features are generally inapplicable, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(4) (youth of the offender); and (B)(6) (accomplice only). Davis does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>not assert the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor (lack of significant criminal record), nor is there any evidence that the (B)(5) mitigating factor applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 401} We also conclude that Davis\u2019s intellectual deficiencies do not qualify as a mental disease or defect under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Davis\u2019s academic records show that Davis has an IQ between 74 and 84. However, the evidence at trial did not establish that he was mentally retarded. However, Davis\u2019s limited intellectual abilities are entitled to weight under the catchall provision of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 402} We recognize and give weight to other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). Such evidence includes the support that Davis shares with his family, and his long work history. Testimony that Davis was victimized by an abusive father is also entitled to weight as a mitigating \u201cother factor.\u201d Nevertheless, there was no evidence of any significant connection between Davis\u2019s childhood abuse and his murder of Sheeler. Finally, we give weight to Davis\u2019s lack of disciplinary infractions while in pretrial confinement. The evidence does not suggest any other (B)(7) mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 403} The trial court merged the escaping detection aggravating circumstance with the other three aggravating circumstances before the jury\u2019s death verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 404} We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Davis\u2019s murder of Sheeler during the course of a burglary, robbery, and kidnapping are grave circumstances. In contrast, Davis\u2019s mitigating evidence has little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 405} Finally, we hold that the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved for other robbery-murder and burglary-murder cases. See <em>State v. Elmore, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 168; <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 124; and <em>State v. Stallings, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 301, 731 N.E.2d 159. The death penalty is also proportionate to death sentences approved for other cases involving a kidnapping specification. <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 204; <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at <em>306, </em>754 N.E.2d 1150; and <em>State v.

In proposition of law IX, Davis challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the kidnapping specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and the underlying kidnapping charge, R.C. 2905.01(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 407} I would hold that the state failed to present sufficient evidence of the \u201csignificant restraint or movement, not just that incident to the killing itself\u2019 required to prove kidnapping. <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 605 N.E.2d 70. First, there is insufficient evidence of movement to support kidnapping. The evidence suggests that Davis gained entry into Sheeler\u2019s apartment because she knew him. Sheeler\u2019s body was found inside her bedroom. However, there is no evidence that Davis moved Sheeler to her bedroom before killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 408} Second, there appears to be insufficient evidence of restraint beyond that necessary to kill Sheeler. There is no evidence that Sheeler was tied up before she was killed. Admittedly, the victim\u2019s torn panties above her breasts and the presence of semen on the oral swabs suggest that Sheeler was orally raped or sexually assaulted. However, no evidence shows whether Sheeler was orally raped or sexually assaulted before she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 409} Based on the .foregoing, proposition IX has merit. Thus, I would reverse Davis\u2019s convictions on the kidnapping charge and the separate kidnapping specification because of insufficient evidence. Reversal of Davis\u2019s kidnapping specification does not require that his death sentence be vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Cupp, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
