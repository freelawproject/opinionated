The evidence is that such was not the case. As a person experienced by long use of cars entering upon the loop and stopping, he knew that the car was passing around the loop to reach its stopping place, but that it had not come to such a point; and he also knew that the conductor\u2019s call, \u201cAll off,\u201d meant that he should alight when the car stopped. Experience also should have taught him that a car passing around such a loop often decreases and accelerates its speed with resultant disturbance to the equilibrium of standing passengers, and he should have taken some precaution to maintain himself on the platform. There is no evidence whatever that he did use such care, and, although he was.thrown off, it does not appear that theie was any violent starting up of the car that produced it. Hence the negligence of the defendant, is not proven; nor is the plaintiff shown to have been free from contributory negligence. Ayers v. Rochester Ry. Co., 156 N. Y. 104; 50.N. E. 960; Dwyer v.
