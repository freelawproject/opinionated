That the plaintiff ordered and paid $75 for a copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes of the trial is not disputed. The right, however, to tax this disbursement depends upon the necessity for its incurrence. Munic. Ct. Act (Laws 1902, c. 580) \u00a7 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">It is-sought to justify the taxation by analogy to the cases in courts of record, where the ordering of a copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes was held proper and necessary for the purpose of preparing amendments to a proposed case on_appeal. Ridabock v. Met. El. R. Co., 8 App. Div. 309, 40 N. Y. Supp. 938; Pratt v. Clark, 124 App. Div. 248, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>108 N. Y. Supp. 734. But the practice on appeals from judgments of courts of record is different from that obtaining in cases of appeals taken from the judgments of the Municipal Courts. In the former, by rule 34, General Rules of Practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-5\">\u201cA case or exceptions shall not contain the evidence in hsec verba, or by question and answer, unless ordered by the judge or referee 'by or before whom the same shall be settled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The practice further calls for the proposal of a case by the appellant, to which the respondent may propose amendments, which must first be allowed or disallowed by the appellant, who is required to mark upon his proposed case and upon the stenographer\u2019s minutes the parts to which the proposed amendments are applicable, and the respondent is required to refer, at the end of each amendment proposed by him, to the proper page of such minutes. Such is not the practice on appeals from Municipal Courts. There a case on appeal is not made up as in the courts of record, but the clerk of the court below is required to make a return, which must contain all the proc\u00e9edings \"including the evidence\u201d (Munic. Ct. Act, \u00a7 317), and by the rule adopted by the Municipal Courts (rule 16) the return on appeal is required to contain, among other things, \u201cthe stenographer\u2019s minutes, which shall be transcribed by the stenographer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">While provision is made in the Municipal Court Act (section 318) for the settling of a case on appeal, it is not necessary for the respondent to order the stenographer\u2019s minutes for that purpose. When a transcript of the stenographer\u2019s minutes of testimony given on a trial becomes a necessary part of the record on appeal, the appellant is required to pay therefor ten cents for every hundred words, which is afterwards taxed by him as a disbursement on appeal if he prevails. Munic. Ct. Act, \u00a7 353. And by the rules of such courts heretofore referred to (rule 17) the stenographer\u2019s fees are to be deposited by the appellant with the clerk of the court below, who, when the stenographer shall-deliver his transcript to the clerk, who makes up the return as required by section 317 of the Municipal Court Act, shall thereupon deliver the money so deposited to the stenographer. It is clear, therefore, that an inspection of the stenographer\u2019s minutes may be made at the clerk\u2019s office by the respondent whenever necessary, and that any expenditure made by him for another copy cannot be held to be a necessary disbursement within section 344 of the Municipal Court Act, which provides for the taxation or allowance of 'disbursements necessarily incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">In Cohen v. Weill, 33 Misc. Rep. 764, 67 N. Y. Supp. 917, it was held error to allow plaintiff as part of his costs the expense incurred by him in obtaining a transcript of the stenographer\u2019s minutes, which was furnished to the court below, and with that conclusion we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">The judgment is modified, by deducting therefrom the sum of $75, included in the taxation of costs fdr a copy of the stenographer\u2019s minutes, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal to the appellant, to be set off against the plaintiff\u2019s judgment pursuant to section 324 of the Municipal Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">GARRETSON and BRACKMAR, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
