Donnelly v. City of New York, 166 N. Y. 315, 319, 59 N. E. 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-24\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Whether the railing erected by the owner was a reasonably safe protection, considering, the fact that children as well as adults <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>were likely to use the sidewalk, was primarily a question for the jury (Id.), for, unless the evidence is so plain that reasonable men might not reach adverse conclusions upon the subject, a question of fact is, presented for submission for the jury. Erickson v. Twenty-Third Street R. R. Co., 71 Hun, 108, 24 N. Y. Supp. 603. Upon the evidence as it stood when the complaint was dismissed, we think that reasonable men might well differ as to the sufficiency of the railing. It was therefore error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
