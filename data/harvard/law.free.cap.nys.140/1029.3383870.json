All the trials have terminated in plaintiff\u2019s favor. The first two were held by a judge without a jury, and judgments for the plaintiff were reversed in this court. 134 N. Y. Supp. 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> It is needless to discuss the <em>weight </em>to be accorded to the evidence by an appellate court after three successive trials, a point on which respondent lays some stress, since the third trial presents the same situation as the first two, namely, an <em>absence </em>of evidence on which may be predicated either material negligence of the defendant or freedom from contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Meinrenken, as Adm\u2019x, v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 103 App. Div. 319, 92 N. Y. Supp.' 1015; Adams v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 125 App. Div. 551, 109 N. Y. Supp. 1019. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s counsel does not indicate in his brief what the negligence may be upon which he thinks the recovery is based. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-15\">\u201cThe only plausible explanation of the accident is that the chauffeur or the automobile truck, relying upon the speed which the automobile had attained going downgrade, estimated that he could pass in front of the horse by turning slightly to the east, and he succeeded in drawing the front part of his automobile in front of the horse, but that the fear wheels of the automobile-slid, in-the tracks, a usual occurrence, thereby striking the horse\u2019s head', and then passing over his left foreleg.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-16\">I find in this statement nothing to indicate negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s chauffeur, but, on the contrary, only an intimation of plaintiff\u2019s belief that defendant erred in estimating that he could pass in front of plaintiff\u2019s' horses. But,1 even assuming that negligence may be predicated on such a state of facts, it is quite clear'that plaintiff\u2019s driver, who continued his courses uninterruptedly, was equally and pari passu at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>, As all possible evidence upon the issues involved in this case seems \u25a0to have been exhausted, and defendant duly moved for a verdict in his favor, the judgment will be reversed, and judgment absolute rendered for defendant, with costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">GERARD, J., concurs.
