China. The defendant was a resident of Manchester, England, and conducted a like business under the name of <em>\u201cA. </em>Provand &amp; Co.\u201d Shortly prior to the 27th day of April, 1882, the plaintiff was about to establish an office or agency in London for the purchase of cotton goods for sale in China and Japan, and on the day last mentioned the plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing, reciting these facts and setting forth that the object of the agreement was to enable the parties \u201cto do the business on mutually advantageous terms,\u201d and to enable the plaintiff \u201cto buy Manchester goods on best terms, with charges at actual cost,\u201d and to enable the defendant to consign goods to the plaintiff for sale in China and Japan on his account \u201cat a minimum expense, the charges at Shanghai being also actual.\u201d It was further expressly recited in the agreement that thereby the plaintiff would be enabled to save \u201ccommission and expenses in London,\u201d and the defendant would save \u201cthe expense of maintaining an establishment in the port of Shanghai.\u201d It was further provided that the defendant should close the house, or agency, which he had theretofore maintained in Shanghai, and would do no business in that territory in this line of goods, excepting through the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff was t\u00f3 do no business \u201cin Manchester piece goods,\u201d excepting with the defendant or with his consent. It was further provided that all purchases by the defendant for the plaintiff were to be \u201cafter mutual consultation and agreement as to quantity, quality, kind, and price.\u201d It was expressly provided in the agreement that all purchases made by the defendant, whether on his own account, or for the plaintiff, would be made on the \u201ccustomary Manchester terms,\u201d which were specified to be that payments for the goods would be made on \u201cregular pay days which occur within three to seven days from delivery\u201d of the goods at the defendant\u2019s warehouse \u201cto be made up and packed,\u201d and that the defendant would \u201cinvoice the goods at the price or prices paid, less the actual discount allowed by the seller and free of any commission.\u201d A schedule of packing charges was set forth in the agreement, which it was recited in the agreement were to be \u201cthe. agreed packing charges to be entered in the invoices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">According to the allegations pf the complaint, the parties entered upon the performance of the agreement and continued business thereunder until the 5th day of March, 1901,. when they made a new con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tract, the provisions of which in some respects differ from the first contract, and in which, among other things, it was expressly provided, as had been provided in substance in the original contract, that the' packing charges should include inspecting, ticketing, stamping, stitching, packing, warehouse rent, fire insurance, and all other items usually known' as \u201cpacking charges.\u201d The new contract provided that packing charges \u201cwill be entered in the invoices on the following basis, subject to readjustment from time to time, as may be necessary, according to cost of materials,\u201d following which was a schedule of such charges. It was further provided that the plaintiff should forward all goods, whether shipped on its own account or on the account of the defendant, and that \u201cfreight returns\u201d received should be divided between them in proportion to the business of each party. The agreement further provided that, when the goods were shipped and the invoices prepared, the defendant should draw on the plaintiff through an Eastern bank \u201cat two or three months after sight, as may be most advantageous,\u201d with invoices, bills of lading, and policy of insurance attached to the draft, and the plaintiff was to accept the draft on presentation, and when the goods arrived at Shanghai they were to be stored by the plaintiff \u201cat current rates.\u201d It was further provided tha\u00a3 the plaintiff should receive interest \u201cat the current rate\u201d on all moneys advanced by it, and should receive five-tenths of the net profit on goods sold for the account of the defendant \u201cas their commission for selling and doing the work at Shanghai,\u201d and that with respect to goods on which no profit was made the plaintiff was to receive no commission, and that with respect to goods purchased for the account of the plaintiff the defendant was to be paid three-tenths \u201cof the net profit for purchasing the goods and doing the work at Manchester, but, if no profit is made, then\u201d the defendant was not to be paid any commission for purchasing. It was further provided that, with respect to all goods shipped by the defendant on consignment for other firms, the commission charged by the plaintiff was <em>to </em>be equally divided with the defendant. It was recited in the agreement that advances would have to be made to the consignors on goods to be shipped to Shanghai for sale on account, and that there might be losses thereon and a deficit, and for that reason the defendant undertook to be responsible for the amount of such deficit, \u201cshould the consignor become insolvent and unable to make deficit good,\u201d and that the defendant would receive his consideration therefor \u201cfrom the consignors by commission or extra charges for packing.\u201d By the final paragraph of the agreement, it was provided that the books of either party should be open to the other for audit by an approved public accountant, \u201cshould either party require proof that charges for goods bought, or returns for goods sold, were made in accordance with the terms of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">On the 19th of April, <em>1907, </em>the parties executed a \u201csupplement\u201d to their agreement of March 5, 1901, and it was therein provided that after July 1, 1907, bills of lading and policies of insurance on goods bought and shipped for the account of the plaintiff should be forwarded to the plaintiff\u2019s London office, and that the plaintiff would thereupon pay for the goods in cash; and it was evidently, at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>time, contemplated that the business should be conducted on a commission basis, for the commissions to be charged by the defendant were limited by a maximum figure, and the invoices were to be made out \u201cat a round price per piece, which will include cost, freight, insurance, packing, cabling, and commission,\u201d and the packing charges were increased a specific amount after the 1st day of April, 1907. It appears that by a letter under date of October 4, 1907, the plaintiff represented to the defendant that the supplemental agreement had not proved to be satisfactory, and suggested certain changes, which the plaintiff alleges were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The plaintiff, by its complaint, characterizes the business relations between it and the defendant under these agreements as a \u201cjoint adventure or copartnership.\u201d The plaintiff alleges that, after commencing business under the first agreement, the business relations of the parties were continued under the successive agreements until the 15th day of January, 1908, when they were terminated. The plaintiff further alleges that the defendant represented to it that the actual cost of packing charges to be paid and disbursed by the defendant was as specified in the schedules in the agreements, and that the plaintiff relied upon such representations, and. in reliance thereon paid the packing charges to the defendant on the basis of the figures set forth in the agreements, but that shortly before the commencement of this action it discovered that the actual amounts paid by the defendant for packing charges were much less than the amounts charged in the statements rendered by the defendant to the plaintiff, according to which the plaintiff settled with the defendant, and were also much less than the prices set forth in the schedules in the agreements, and that, in order to deceive the, plaintiff with respect thereto, the defendant in the first instance advanced the full amount for packing charges as charged to the plaintiff, but thereafter secretly received rebates and allowanc\u00e9s and returns from the packers to an amount and extent which the plaintiff believes to exceed the sum of $25,000. It thus appears-that the plaintiff distinctly alleges two grievances: First, that the defendant misrepresented the fact that the figures specified in the schedules in the agreements represented the actual cost; and, second, that the statements from time to time rendered by the defendant to the plaintiff, and upon which the plaintiff .made advances and settlements, represented the actual cost of packing charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">A qtiestion arises, with respect to the first ground of complaint, as to whether plaintiff would not, be obliged to have the agreement reformed or rescinded before it would be entitled to relief; but I am of opinion that the parties contemplated that neither was to receive any profit out of the business transactions embraced within the contracts, excepting the specified proportion of the net profits. That stands out quite clearly in-the original agreement, which provided that all charges were to be at actual cost; and-it is made particularly clear by the agreement of March 5, 1901, wherein it is expressly provided that the packing charges as entered upon the invoices pursuant to that agreement would be \u201csubject to readjustment from time to time, as may be necessary, according to cost of materials,\u201d and that each is entitled to an inspection of the books kept by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>It is contended that the plaintiff was only interested in the profits on the goods which it shipped and sold for the account of the defendant as compensation for its services, and that the defendant was only interested in like manner in the profits on goods purchased by him for the plaintiff, which would not constitute the parties copartners, and would not entitle either to an accounting. Cassidy v. Hall, 97 N. Y. 159; Larzelere v. Taber, 119 App. Div. 81, 103 N. Y. Supp. 970; Marvin v. Brooks, 94 N. Y. 71; Conger v. Judson, 69 App. Div. 121, 74 N. Y. Supp. 504. That is not the proper construction of the contracts. There 'was a mutual obligation for the advancement of moneys and for the rendition of services, each party taking the risk of the respective ventures being profitable and having the right to participate in the <em>net profits </em>as such, if any were realized, and each being required to render to the other correct accounts of -moneys received and disbursed and to keep accounts thereof, to be open to-the inspection of the other party. It is not necessary that we should now decide whether the relationship thus constituted was that of copartners, joint adventurers, or agency of a fiduciary relation involving trust and confidence; for any one -of those relationships would entitle the plaintiff to an accounting with respect to secret profits thus obtained and retained. Hacket v. Stanley, 115 N. Y. 629, 22 N. E. 745; -Marston v. Gould, 69 N. Y. 225; Farr v. Morrill, 53 Hun, 31, 5 N. Y. Supp. 720; Marvin v. Brooks, supra; Spears v. Willia, 151 N-. Y. 443, 45 N. E. 849; Watts v. Adler, 130 N. Y. 648, 29 N. E. 131; Lord v. Hull, 178 N. Y. 14, 70 N. E. 69, 102 Am. St. Rep.484; Schantz v. Oakman, 163 N. Y. 148, 57 N. E. 288; Underhill v. Jones, 72 App. Div. 71, 76 N. Y. Supp. 266; and 2 Lindley on Partnership, star pp. 303-305, 495, 496. I am of opinion, therefore, that the demurrer, which was based upon the ground that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">It follows that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer overruled, with costs, with leave to defendant to withdraw the demurrer and plead over, on payment of costs of the appeal and of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">IN GRAHAM, P. J\u201e and McLAUGHLIN and CLARKE, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b109-10\">SCOTT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_E\">(dissenting). In my opinion the plaintiff cannot maintain an action for the alleged excess of packing charges collected, over the actual charges paid, until the several contracts between the parties have been reformed, and this plaintiff does not ask for. Each contract definitely fixed the rates of packing charges to be allowed, and these have not been exceeded. If false representations were made as to the actual cost, there might be ground for reformation; but so long as the contracts stand, and nothing more is charged than was specifically agreed upon, I can discern no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Furthermore, if plaintiff has any cause of action at all, it is, I think, one at law to recover damages, and not in equity, for an accounting. Although defendant\u2019s compensation for the services he rendered was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>to be measured by a percentage of the profits realized, that compensation was distinctly stated to be intended \u201cas a commission.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s services with regard to a sale of defendant\u2019s property was of the same nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">' On both grounds, therefore, I think that the judgment was right, and should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
