The plaintiff purposes to call 3 witnesses, who were upon the truck at the time of the accident, and certain unnamed officers or employ\u00e9s of the American Locomotive Company, who are to be called as expert witnesses as to the weight of the truck, its general equipment, and other facts referring to its construction and operation. These witnesses are all claimed to reside in the city of 'New York. It is apparent upon this statement of facts that the proper place for the trial of this action is Sullivan county. Plaintiff makes the contention that he will be unable to procure \u00e1 fair trial in said county, but the facts which he sets forth as warranting his inference to that effect are insufficient to justify the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to change the place of trial to Sullivan county granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
