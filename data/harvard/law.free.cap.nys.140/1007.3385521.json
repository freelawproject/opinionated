The defendant Stemm proved a counterclaim existing in his favor against the plaintiff for moneys loaned, amounting to $23.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-18\">The uncontradicted facts show that plaintiff entered into an arrangement with Stemm by which plaintiff and defendant Stemm were to turn all their earnings into the Shorthand Reporting Company, and they were to divide the net profits, 60 per cent, to Stemm and 40 per cent, to plaintiff. Plaintiff himself wrote to the National Fireproofing Company as representing the Shorthand Reporting Company. Before the plaintiff can recover, there must be an accounting \u2018had to determine what the net profits of the business were. Plaintiff\u2019s recovery here cannot be sustained on any theory. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>dismissed, and defendant Stemm should have' judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of $23.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, and judgment directed in favor of defendant Stemm for $23.30. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
