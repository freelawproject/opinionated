Defendant said he found an entry of an item seemingly relevant to the inquiry, but stated that it did not refresh his recollection. The entry was in the Arabic language, and counsel for the plaintiff requested the defendant to translate it; but the defendant refused. The court then directed the defendant to translate it; but, on advice of counsel, the defendant again refused. The court thereupon adjudged the defendant guilty of contempt. This appeal is taken from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">We think that the defendant was justified in refusing to answer, because the defendant was within his'rights. The question was in effect an effort at inspection and discovery of defendants\u2019 books, and not one incidental or proper to the examination \u00f3f a party before trial, under section 872 of the Code. Rosenbaum v. Rice, 36 Misc. Rep. 410, 73 N. Y. Supp. 714; Bloodgood v. Slayback, 62 App. Div. 315, 71 N..Y. Supp. 809. It has been held by practically the entire trend of judicial decisions that the books produced on such examination are only required to refresh the memory of the witness, so as to render this examination effective, but not for the purpose provided under sections 803-809 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Matter of Thompson, 95 App. Div. 542, 89 N. Y. Supp. 4; Boeck v. Smith, 85 App. Div. 575, 83 N. Y. Supp. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">The plaintiff in a proper case shown may have the right to inspection of the books; but such was not within the purview of the order under which this examination was taken, and plaintiff was without right, therefore, to secure it by indirection. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-14\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
