The respective amount of debentures to be redeemed in each year are shown in the table following; that is to say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">Here follows the same table indorsed on the debenture and the same provisions in regard to drawings heretofore quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">In article 15 the company covenanted with the trustee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-6\">\u201c2. During the continuance of this security -the company will pay all the principal moneys and interest becoming due in respect of the debentures respectively and will observe and perform the several conditions endorsed thereon respectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">All of the aforesaid 1,883 debentures came into the hands of various bona fide holders for value, and the defendant on July 1st of each of the years, beginning July 1,- 1903, to and including July 1, 1910, redeemed the number of said debentures set forth in the fifth condition indorsed on the debentures and specified in article 12 of the deed of trust, paying therefor to the holders of the several debentures drawn for redemption as provided the sum of $533.50 for each debenture so drawn. On July 1, 1911, there remained outstanding 402 debentures and the holders of a number of such debentures, including plaintiff\u2019s testator, demanded $533.50 for each of said outstanding debentures. The defendant insisted that it was not bound to pay in excess .of $485 for each of said debentures and .paid that amount with the understanding that, if it were determined that it was legally bound to pay the sum of $533.50 upon each of said debentures, it would do so. This controversy is submitted as to whether the defendant is called upon to pay the difference between $533.50 and $485, or $48.-50 for each debenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">The plaintiffs base their claim mainly upon the provisions in regard to the so-called sinking fund. Upon analysis it is clear there is no \u201csinking fund\u201d provided for. That descriptive term is misused. There was no sum of money placed in the treasury from time to time which should remain therein and by accumulation provide for the ultimate payment of the debentures. It was merely an annual amount which the company was prepared to pay by way of interest on its debentures and for the payment of a certain amount thereof to be drawn in the prescribed way. Having determined that it would pay $136,188 a year, the company then ascertained how many debentures could be redeemed each year, after the payment of the interest on all then outstanding with that amount, and having ascertained that quotient it provided that the number of the debentures to be drawn and redeemed should be 153, 161, 169, 179, 189, 199, 210, 221. These irregular numbers were determined upon solely as a matter of arithmetic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">Upon their face the debentures declared that at the end of the eight years for which they ran the company would pay upon presentation $485. That was the agreement; that was the promise. To that, and only that, the company was bound at the end of the eight years. For the purpose of stimulating the sale the company agreed to call in by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>lottery a certain specified numb\u00e9r of debentures each year and to pay the amount of $533.50 therefor, when so drawn, called and redeemed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">If the plaintiffs are right and $533.50 was to be paid for each debenture whether drawn by this lottery or when finally due, we can discover no reason, nor is any suggested, why the face of the debenture was not made for $533.50, instead of $485. It is clear that this hope of an earlier payment upon an increased amount was held out solely to make this an attractive proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">Interpreting these instruments, we hold that the proposal by the company was to pay to those whose debentures happened to be drawn before maturity an increased price. As between all these debentures there was to be equality. That is, each had an equal chance to be drawn. Each debenture drawn was to receive an equal amount, $533-50; and each debenture undrawn was to be paid an equal amount, to wit, $485, at the date of maturity. This construction gives effect to all of the terms of the debentures and the trust deed\u2014that contended for by the plaintiffs ignores several of the most important. The moneys used to pay the drawn debentures as well as the undrawn came equally from the current funds of the company. There was no sinking fund in any true sense, and, if there were, it entirely failed to make provision for the undrawn debentures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">It follows that judgment on the submission should be entered for the defendant, without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and McLAUGHEIN and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1114-9\">SCOTT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APre\">I dissent. Reading the debentures, the indorsement upon each, and- the deed of trust together as they should be read (Mc-Clelland v. Norfolk Southern R. R. Co., 110 N. Y. 469, 18 N. E. 237, 1 L. R. A. 299, 6 Am. St. Rep. 397; Batchelder v. Council Grove Water Co., 131 N. Y. 42, 29 N. E. 801), I am of the opinion that the defendant\u2019s obligation was to pay all of the debentures as they should be -redeemable at the price of $533.50. In each of the schedules contained in any of these documents the 402 debentures falling due in 1911 are included among those to be \u201credeemed,\u201d so that no distinction is made, so far as concerns the amount payable, between the indentures which are to be paid and those which are to be \u201credeemed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">That all were to be redeemed at the same figure seems to be assured by the provisions indorsed upon each that \u201cthe debentures of this series shall rank pari passu as a first charge upon the property of the company as within defined, and without any preference or priority over one another.\u201d Why the company should have issued its obligations apparently for $485 at the same time agreeing to pay them off at the rate of $533.50 is no more evident than it is why it should have referred to a sinking fund which was no sinking fund at all. It may have been to enable it to malee a more favorable showing as to its apparent liabilities than the fact warranted. But speculation on that subject is idle. The point is that it undertook to treat all of' its debenture holders alike. In my opinion the plaintiff is entitled to judgment</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
