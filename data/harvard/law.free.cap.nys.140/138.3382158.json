The defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New York. It does business in the city of New York, and it is capitalized for $1,000,000. Its preferred stock aggregates $500,000, and its common stock $500,000. The par value of each share is $10. Under the contracts entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff is designated as the purchaser, and agrees to purchase a certain number of shares of stock of the defendant, which is designated in the contract as the company. The company agrees to sell the shares of stock to the plaintiff upon certain, \u201cconditions and privileges\u201d which are set forth on the back of the contract. In these \u201cconditions and privileges\u201d the purchaser agrees to make payments of certain installments until an amount specified has been fully paid. The purchaser is also permitted \u201cto hasten the maturity of this contract\u201d by paying off monthly installments in consecutive order beginning with the last installment to fall due under the contract. The contract also provided that, \u201cafter two full years payments shall have been made, the company will, upon six months\u2019 written notice, return all payments made hereon with interest at the rate of four per cent, per annum.\u201d The plaintiff under the contract sued upon paid $350 to the defendant, which sum represented two full years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>payments under, the contract, and the plaintiff gave the six months\u2019 written notice required, and asked the return of the paym\u00e9nts made under the clause of the contract quoted above. The defendant now resists payment on the ground that the contract is an agreement \u201cto purchase its own stock,\u201d and claims that such an agreement is prohibited by section 664 of the Penal Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 40). This section of the Penal Law makes it a misdemeanor for a director \u00f3f a stock corporation to concur in a vote to apply the funds of a corporation, except surplus profits, to the purchase of shares of its own stock. Strictly speaking, I do not think that these contracts fall within this particular provision of the'Penal Law. Richards v. Wiener Co., 207 N. Y. 59, 100 N. E. 592. I do not think that the defendant agreed to commit the particular crime which its counsel claims it agreed to commit. The agreement to refund the money which the plaintiff paid was not an agreement to purchase shares of its own stock. The stock had, in fact, never been actually sold to the plaintiff. All that the plaintiff did was to pay money to the defendant on the assurance given by the contract that the defendant would, when the amount specified was fully paid, sell the stock to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, under the clause of the contract quoted above, had the right to demand the repayment of the amount advanced. We are satisfied that the defendant has established no defense to this action. It is also clear to us from the character of the contract and from the nature of the alleged defense that the business being carried on by the defendant should be investigated by those charged with responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
