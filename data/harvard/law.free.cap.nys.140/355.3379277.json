Plaintiff was present in person with his witnesses. His attorney, however, suffered an \u201cunforeseen delay\u201d and did not reach the courtroom until 10 minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Under these circumstances, I think the default should have been opened and the judgment of dismissal vacated, as is hereby directed, upon payment by plaintiff to defendant of the costs of the action to date, but with costs of this appeal to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
