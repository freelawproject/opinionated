Defendant\u2019s liability was conceded; the question involved in this appeal being the extent of the damage which plaintiff might recover. The amount included in the verdict, as directed, covers merely the cost of repairs. Evidence offered by the plaintiff to prove the \u201cusable value\u201d of the car during the time that it was being repaired, i. e., his reasonable expenditure to replace it by hiring another car during that period, was excluded, and plaintiff excepted. Both reason and authority are, I think, in favor of including this item in the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damage. See Wellman v. Miner, 19 Misc. Rep. 644, 44 N. Y. Supp. 417; Murphy v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 58 Misc. Rep. 237, 108 N. Y. Supp. 1021; Jessup v. Platt, 76 Misc. Rep. 466, 135 N. Y. Supp. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The cases which respondent cites as overruling Wellman v. Miner, if they may be so considered, expressly or impliedly recognize the right to a recovery for the renting of an article to replace one regarded as a mere luxury during the time of' repair, even though .they do not approve of the bare principle that the usable value of an article of luxury may be recovered. See Bondy v. N. Y. C. R. R., 56 Misc. Rep. 602, 107 N. Y. Supp. 31; Foley v. Forty-Second St. Ry. Co., 52 Misc. Rep. 183, 101 N. Y. Supp. 780; Murphy v. N. Y. C. Ry. Co., supra. The brief of respondent\u2019s counsel omits the language to which I refer, in its quotation from the opinion in the Bondy Case, and from its collection of excerpts from the opinion in the Foley Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
