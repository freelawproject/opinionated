Max Haimowitz was not served in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The plaintiff respondent claims that, as this Barney Elfin who drove the truck was not called, the judgment of the court below can be sustained on the theory that the court found that the Elfin who was in court, and who was identified by plaintiff and his witnesses as Barney Elfin, 'was really Barney Elfin, and the one who was a member of the firm of Elfin, Enoch &amp; Co., and that he was not Selig Elfin, and that the Barney Elfin referred to by the man who called himself Selig Elfin either did not exist or was not a member of the firm of Elfin, Enoch &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">I think that in view of this confusion, the interests of justice will be best served by ordering a new trial, where there can be a thorough inquiry as to the identity of Barney and Selig Elfin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
