Lockwood as tenant. The plaintiff proved the lease, and that the rent for April, 1912, was not paid. This proof entitled the plaintiff to a judgment against the defendant Kate M. Lockwood, but furnished no justification for the- entry of a judgment against her' husband, Richard H. Lockwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>It follows that as <em>to </em>the appellant Richard H.
