Many of the charges are \u201cbalance on bill,\u201d or \u201cbill,\u201d and one \"Bill to date this spring $149.93.\u201d Evidently the books as to many items are not the original entry of the actual transactions.\" Recovery was hadxupon a note, dated January 22, 1889, for $100, payable 60 days after date. The statute of limitations is a good defense to the note. The evidence of the payment of $7, which defendants claim was indorsed thereon, is not satisfactory, and it is not clear that the note has not otherwise been included in the accounts. If the $7 was paid, as claimed, it does not save the note. Hughes v. Eddy Valve Co., 147 App. Div. 356, 360, 131 N. Y. Supp. 744. The finding that $7 was paid upon the note is against the evidence; also the finding that there is anything due upon it. The fourth finding that there was an examination of the account May 9, 1903, and that there was found due the defendants $171.73 is unsatisfactory and against the evidence; this court finding that there was no such examination and statement of account. The fact that on May 15, 1906, defendants rendered to the plaintiff a bill for $230.66 and a note for that amount, which they requested him to sign, is convincing evidence that at that time the total indebtedness of the plaintiff did not exceed that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">The second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh findings of fact are disapproved of as against the evidence. The judgment should, therefore, be reversed on the law and the facts, the referee discharged, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
