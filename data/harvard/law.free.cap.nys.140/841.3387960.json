After numerous appearances on the calendar, the case was marked \u201cready\u201d on the day calendar of December 24, 1912. On December 31, 1912, an order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>show cause was granted returnable January 3, 1913, for an order permitting the defendant to serve an amended answer setting up the statute of limitations. The motion was granted upon payment of taxable costs without prejudice to the present position of the case on the calendar. We think after such delay the plaintiff should have been allowed the alternative of discontinuance without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be modified by providing that the motion be granted upon the terms stated, with leave to. the plaintiff to discontinue without costs, and as so modified affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
