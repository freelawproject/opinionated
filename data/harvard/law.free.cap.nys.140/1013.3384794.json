It continued, provided he did n\u00f3t relinquish that intention, until he had testified, or the necessity therefor had been obviated, and until such reasonable time thereafter as might be required for him to depart this state on his return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The fact that some one, either by design or superserviceable zeal, had him served with a subpoena to appear in the same cause, would not take from the voluntariness of his appearance, nor destroy the intention with which he came into the jurisdiction. Nor can it be presumed that his appearance was in compliance with the subpoena, rather than in accordance with his original intention. His mere averment of the service of the subpoena here and of his compliance therewith do not change the facts. It is this voluntary appearance, coupled with this intention, which gives a witness from beyond the jurisdiction the immunity from service by process, as is said, \u201cetmdo, morando, et redeundo.\u201d The distinction made here, it seems to me, is so fine that to give effect to it would destroy the salutary purpose which gave origin and confidence to this privilege of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">The learned trial justice -bases his decision on Dwelle v. Allen, 151 App. Div. 717, 136 N. Y. Supp. 216; but the resemblance of that case with the one \u00e1t bar disappears when one considers that Mr. Justice Dowling held in that case that the defendant was at the time he was served with process \u201cin the jurisdiction under compulsion\u201d; whereas in this case the appellant had come into the state voluntarily, and only for the purpose of testifying. The decisions in the numerous judicatures where this privilege has from time immemorial been recognized are not free from seeming contradictions, as mentioned or alluded to in the opinion by Mr. Justice Werner in Netograph Mfg. Co. v. Scrugham, 197 N. Y. 377, 90 N. E. 962, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 333, 134 Am. St. Rep. 886; but to contract unreasonably its sphere of operation would deprive this policy of immunity of ifs utility to promote the ends of \"justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
