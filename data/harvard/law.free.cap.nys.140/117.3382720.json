In order to establish its cause of action, the plaintiff must rely upon the evidence which can only be obtained from defendant, its officers, and books. Under these circumstances, if the defendant and its officers were within this jurisdiction, there would not be a moment\u2019s hesitation in permitting plaintiff to have an examination before trial, which'would necessarily be oral. I do not think that plaintiff should be deprived of the perfectly legitimate advantage of such an examination merely because defendant and its officers are in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The recent trend of decisions has been in favor of relaxing to some extent the former rule under which commissions to examine on oral questions were \"discountenanced. The disposition' of the courts at present is to permit such examinations where it appears that the elucidation of the truth, and consequently the ends of justice, will be facilitated thereby.
