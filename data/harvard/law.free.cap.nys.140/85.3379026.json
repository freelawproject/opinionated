There would, therefore, appear to be no ground for predicating any punishment of the defendant on his failure to produce that which was either nonexistent or, at least, not. available to him. See People v. McClellan, 191 N. Y. 341, 84 N. E. 68; Chartered Bank of India v. Fire Ins. Co., 145 App. Div. 307, 129 N. Y. Supp. 1067; Ammidown v. Century Rubber Co., 14 N. Y.
