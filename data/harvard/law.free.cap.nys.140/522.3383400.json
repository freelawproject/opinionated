Defendants did not execute this paper. Plaintiff\u2019s credit man testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-15\">\u201cI had already received this paper marked Exhibit A before I sent the letter marked Exhibit I.\" We received this guaranty of March 4th and then, \u25a0as we preferred to have the other, we simply sent that other on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">At the close of the case, both sides moved for, the direction, and the learned court thereupon directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> On familiar principles it seems to me to be clear that the minds of the parties have never met. Defendants\u2019 offer of a guaranty was not-accepted, but a counter proposition made, which in turn, was not accepted by defendants.. See Sidney - Glass Works v. Barnes, 86 Hun, 374, 33 N. Y. Supp. 508; Kamber v. Rosen (Sup.) 98 N. Y. Supp. 839; Nundy v. Matthews, 34 Hun, 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> I think, also, that the learned trial judge erred in not admitting into evidence the form of guaranty inclosed in plaintiff\u2019s letter, Exhibit I: First, because it was part of the letter itself, by reference; .and next, because its contents were necessary to enable a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tion of the significance of plaintiff\u2019s act in writing Exhibit I. Since, however, it was marked for identification, and was contained in the record, we have' considered the merits of the controversy as presented by that instrument in connection with the other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">This case presents a situation where judgment absolute should be given for defendants.-</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and judgment -directed for the defendants, with costs.- All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
