Defendant pleaded title under a deed and by adverse possession. The court charged to find for defendant if the land was included in such deed, or if she was entitled to its possession by adverse possession; otherwise to find for plaintiff., The submission of the case in this form was acquiesced in by both parties; defendant requesting instructions to the same effect. The jury rendered a general verdict \u201cfor plaintiff.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the verdict was sufficient, and supported a judgment that .plaintiff was the owner and entitled to the possession of the premises described in the complaint, and was entitled to have the fence removed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b516-11\">[Ed.

Supp. 1138.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-16\">The opinion of Tompkins, J., at .Special Term, was as follows: The complaint described the tract of land in dispute between the parties, and alleged the plaintiff\u2019s ownership of it, and the defendant\u2019s claim to it, and the erection upon it by the defendant of a fence by which it was inclosed with other lands concededly owned by the defendant, so that the issue between the parties was as to the ownership of the particular tract of land that was described in the complaint by metes and bounds, the defendant claiming that the tract in dispute .was included with other lands in a deed made by the plaintiff in 1871 to one Henry L. Pierson, the plaintiff contending that the deed from the plaintiff to the said Henry L. Pierson did not include the land in question. The defendant further claimed that, if it was not conveyed to Pierson, she and her' predecessors in title under the said Pierson deed, had acquired the land in question by adverse possession, so that two questions were distinctly submitted to the jury. The first was whether the tract described in the complaint was included in the Henry L. Pierson deed, and the second was whether, if such deed did not include the land in dispute, the defendant and her predecessors had acquired such disputed land by adverse possession; and the jury was clearly charged that, if the said Pier-son deed did include the land in dispute, their verdict would be for the defendant, and that, if said deed did not include the land in dispute, the nest question for them to \"consider and determine would be, had the defendant and her predecessors become entitled to the possession of the land by adverse possession, and that, if they had, the verdict would be for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ant, and that if the jury found that the land was not included in the Henry L. Pierson deed, and that the defendant and her predecessors had not acquired it by adverse possession, the verdict must be for the plaintiff. There was no request for the submission to the jury of any specific question, and the verdict rendered was a general one in favor of the plaintiff upon the two questions submitted. The defendant\u2019s counsel made no request in respect to the form of the verdict, and acquiesced in the submission of the case in the form in which it was submitted to the jury, and besides made several requests, one of which was in the following language: \u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s predecessors in title and the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title for a period of 20 years or more treated the lines up to the place where the defendant has now constructed its fence as the division lines between the abutting property, they must find a verdict for this defendant.\u201d To which the court replied: \u201cI so charge, if there is any evidence in the case to justify such finding.\u201d And again: \u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if the jury find that any of the defendant\u2019s predecessors in title acquired title to the premises in dispute by adverse possession, then they must find a verdict for the defendant\u201d And again: \u201cI ask your honor to charge that the plaintiff cannot recover the land involved in this action on weakness of the defendant\u2019s title. If the plaintiff has not shown by a preponderance of evidence that it is entitled to recover the land at issue, even though the defendant has not proven its title, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">It will be seen by reference to the record of the trial and the charge to the jury (which has been submitted by counsel with the other papers upon this motion) that the case was tried and submitted to the jury with the consent of counsel on both sides upon the theory that the only question for the jury to determine was the right of the defendant to the possession of the particular tract of land described in the complaint by virtue of the deed from the plaintiff to Henry L. Pierson, or by reason of adverse possession and with the acquiescence of all parties in the direction given by the court to the jury, to find and return a general verdict either in favor of the plaintiff or the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">The cases cited in the defendant\u2019s brief on this motion do not seem to apply. In the case of Shanley v. Murty, 134 App. Div. 845, 119 N. Y. Supp. 175, there was no general verdict rendered by the jury, and the complaint did not describe the land in dispute, and the Appellate Division, in its opinion, states that the court \u201cinadvertently failed to order a general verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">In the case of De Clemente v. Winstanley, 8 Mise. Rep. 45, 28 N. Y. Supp. 513, the form of the verdict of the jury was that the plaintiffs are \u201centitled to the possession of the strip of land described in the complaint.\u201d As a matter of fact, no \u201cstrip of land\u201d was described in the complaint. The only property referred to in the complaint was premises known.as No. 185 York street, being 25 by 100, which the plaintiffs alleged they were the owners of, and which was conceded to belong to them, and \u201cthe adjoining lot on the west side of the above-described premises, which the complaint alleged belonged to the defendants, and the general term of the City Court of Brooklyn, in its opinion, said: \u201cThis judgment, literally construed, would entitle plaintiffs to possession of their own lot and that of the defendants. If execution to enforce this judgment was issued to the sheriff, it would furnish him no clue to carry it out.\u201d In other words, the complaint in that action described the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the defendant\u2019s land adjacent thereto, and sought to have the line between the two properties established where the plaintiff claimed it should be, and the jury found that the plaintiffs were \u201centitled to the possession of the strip of land described in the complaint,\" not locating the disputed boundary line, and the court held the verdict was not in proper form because it in effect, declared that the plaintiff was entitled to the possession of his own land, as well as the land that concededly belonged to the defendant, both of which properties were described in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-9\">In the case at bar the complaint distinctly and specifically described the tract of land in dispute, and the issues between the parties were, first, whether that tract of land belonged to the defendant by reason of its having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>included with other lands in the Henry L. Pierson deed; and, second, if it was not included, whether the defendant had become the owner of it by adverse .possession. If upon either of these propositions the jury found in the defendant\u2019s favor, the jury were told that they must render a general verdict for the defendant, and, if upon both of these questions they found in favor of the plaintiff, they were directed to render a verdict accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">I think under all the circumstances that the verdict was proper, and that the motion should be denied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b518-6\">Argued before JENKS, P.

The \u201carticle\u201d referred to in said section is article 1, tit. 1, c. 14, of said Code, entitled \u201cAction to recover real property.\u201d' This was an action of such a character, and upon the trial thereof the jury rendered its verdict in the following form: \u201cWe find for the plaintiff.\u201d Thereupon the clerk entered judgment to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">\u201cThe plaintiff, Ramapo Manufacturing Company, is the owner, and was at the time of the commencement of this action and now is entitled to the immediate possession, of the premises described in the complaint in this action, and was at the time of the commencement of this action, and now is, entitled to have the iron fence and stone gateposts erected by the defendant Julia Pierson Mapes upon said, described lands and premises, which is an encroachment thereon and excludes the plaintiff from its lawful possession thereof, immediately removed therefrom. It is further adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, Ramapo Manufacturing Company,- be and it is hereby awarded immediate possession of the lands and premises described in the complaint herein, of which it is the owner in fee, and upon which said fence- and gateposts were wrongfully and unlawfully erected by the defendant herein, and which fence and gateposts the plaintiff herein is hereby authorized and entitled to remove as an encroachment thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">Then follows a description of certain premises, the easterly boundary line of which is stated to be the division line between lands of defendant and plaintiff. The location of said line may be determined, it is true, by the fact that it is stated to begin at an elm stump on the northerly bank of the Ramapo river, and to run north 59 degrees 40 minutes east, 594 feet to a stake. The judgment also provides that plaintiff shall recover its costs of defendant. Shortly after the entry of said judgment, defendant moved to strike out all of the provisions-thereof except those relating to costs, and for \u201csuch other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.\u201d From an order denying such motion, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"A87\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The question in this case is not whether the parties requested a special verdict, or whether the verdict as rendered is a general or a special one. If we assume that in form it is a general verdict, it is not such a general verdict as authorizes the entry of any judgment in an action \u25a0of ejectment. It is fatally defective for failure to specify the estate of the plaintiff in the land in controversy, or whether the plaintiff is entitled to the whole or only a part thereof. Meehan v. Dobson (Sup.) 131 N. Y. Supp. <em>37; </em>Shanley v. Murty, 134 App. Div. 845, 119 N. Y. Supp. 175. It seems to me that upon such a verdict there was no more power to enter a judgment than there would be if in an action for unliquidated damages, where by the provisions of the Code (Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1813) the jury were required to assess such damages, a jury had said, \u201cWe find a verdict for the plaintiff, and had omitted to assess the same.\u201d In such case a judgment could not be entered, even although there was no evidence to contradict that of plaintiff as to the extent thereof. Steele v. Hammond, 136 App. Div. 667, 121 N. Y. Supp. 589. The defendant lost no rights in th\u00e9 matter by failing to object to the form of the verdict when rendered. The parties sustained hostile relations to each other, and no duty devolved upon her to see to it that plaintiff\u2019s interests were protected by a proper verdict. In my opinion not even a judgment for costs could be entered upon such a verdict. While the specific relief asked for is to strike out only a portion of the judgment, under the prayer for other and further relief, the whole of said judgment might be stricken out, if \"the verdict does not authorize the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">It seems to me that such is the proper decision to be made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
