Her agent Doremus offered the mortgage'1 to the defendant -for $3,400, and it, was accepted' by' an instrument dated July 17, 1911. The plaintiff executed the.usual,estoppel,certificate on August 16, 1911, the day set for closing, which- was postponed ltd August 17, 1911, when the assignment dated August 1.6th \"was delivered and recorded. This action is to cancel the bond and mortgage as usurious, and for such other.and further relief as may be just. &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> There was a nonsuit. , This was .error. The. certificate protected the purchaser only to the amount of the money advanced ,0n the faith of it. Miller v. Zeimer, 111 N. Y. 441, 18 N,E.:716.; The offer of Doremus was not accepted on the faith of the certificate, .\"as it.\" was ;not in existence'until August 1</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But it is urged that such relief is not asked by the\"complaint nor raised on the trial. The prayer for relief includes it, and, when the complaint is summarily dismissed without findings, the plaintiff is not obliged to state in the record upon what grounds he deems himself entitled to relief. As th\u00e9 record is, the plaintiff is plainly entitled to a decision that the bond and mortgage are valid only .in the amount of $3,400 and interest. There is also evidence showing prima facie that defendant had notice that the plaintiff, and not her.,daughter, was the real owner of the securities. The plaintiff testified that .Mr. Caldwell, defendant\u2019s attorney, was informed by her. on August 16th, the day the estoppel certificate was executed and the day previous to the final closing, that she must have $4,000, and that he promised it to her. This indicated in some degree to the attorney that the plaintiff was the real party to the transaction, and this evideric'\u00e9 is strengthened by the fact that the $3,400 was applied to discharge liens to the extent of $3,174.85, which showed that the consideration was for the benefit of the mortgagor. Thomas on Mortgages (2d Ed.) \u00a7 639, p\u201e 425. Moreover\u201eMrs. Pillion testified that Mr.\"Caldwell said,to Mr. Purdy, who represented the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers, \u201cI understand this, is a family affair,\u201d and the latter replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The credibility and force of this evidence as it shall be admitted or denied is entirely for the trial court, but it was sufficient evidence of notice to defendant that it was purchasing securities that had no inception by delivery to the daughter for a bona fide consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
