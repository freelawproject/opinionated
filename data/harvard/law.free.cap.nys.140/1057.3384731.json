At that time Domenico Castelli, the plaintiff held a mortgage upon the property for $4,000, which was subordinate to four prior mortgages as follows: One held by the Standard Trust Company, for $57,000; one held by Arnstein and Levy, for $11,000; one held by Anna Neill, for $4,000; and one held by Luigi Minetti, for $2,000. The mortgages held by Neill and Luigi Minetti cut no figure in this controversy. The present owners of them were made parties to the action and appeared by attorneys, but made no claim for relief, and are not represented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-15\">In 1909 Arnstein and Levy, the holders of the second mortgage for $11,000, began an action of foreclosure. Plaintiff, on being served with the papers in that action, took them to his attorney, Antonio C. Astarito, who, in turn, called upon one Timonier, an attorney who had represented the owners of the property when plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was made. Astarito, acting for plaintiff, had a meeting with Timonier and the appellant Burns, at which it was agreed that plaintiff should contribute $2,500 towards a fund for the purchase of the property at the foreclosure sale, and that Burns should make the purchase for the benefit of the mortgagees holding mortgages subsequent to the one being foreclosed. This agreement was carried out.' The foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>sale was held on May 3, 1910, and Burns purchased the property for $15,000, of which $2,500 was contributed by plaintiff, and on May 25, 1910, the referee executed a deed of the property to Burns. On the same day Burns and plaintiff entered into a written agreement, of which a copy is attached to the complaint. This agreement was carelessly worded, but its meaning is sufficiently plain. It is made between plaintiff, designated as party of the first part, and Burns, designated as party of the second part. The confusion arises from the fact that in two places the words \u201cparty of the second part\u201d are used, when, as is perfectly apparent from the surrounding circumstances and the acts of the parties, \u201cparty of the first part\u201d was meant. In one instance it recites that the \u201cparty of the second part\u201d has agreed to contribute and has contributed $2,500 towards purchasing the property, whereas it was plaintiff, party of the first part, who made the contribution. In another instance it is provided that the party of the second part shall receive from the party of the first part a mortgage for the sum advanced. Again it is perfectly apparent that the parties should be transposed. It was the party of the first part (plaintiff) who contributed the $2,500, and it was the party of the second part (Burns) who bought the property in, so that it is entirely apparent that the intention was that the party of the second part (Burns), who bought the property, should give a mortgage to the party of the first part (plaintiff), who had advanced the money. As was said by the Vice Chancellor in Huyler\u2019s Executors v. Atwood, 26 N. J. Eq. 504, of a deed in which the same transposition of parties occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-5\">\u201cThe mistake is evident. The party o\u00a3 the second part was to pay purchase money. It is to be read according to the manifest intention of the parties, as there can be no doubt what that is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">So read, the meaning of the agreement under consideration is quite clear. After reciting the contribution by plaintiff of $2,500 towards the purchase of the property, and Burns\u2019 purchase thereof \u201cat the instance of and for the sole benefit of all the said subsequent mortgages,\u201d it was agreed that plaintiff should receive from Burns, \u201cor his immediate grantee,\u201d a mortgage to secure the amount of $2,500 advanced by plaintiff, with interest at 6 per centum, \u201cwhich mortgage shall be subsequent and subordinate only to the second mortgage to be given by the owner to secure the difference in the money required in acquiring said premises under said sale and expense in connection therewith, and that the expense of placing the said second mortgage shall be borne out of the property.\u201d It was further provided that Burns should execute a bond and mortgage for the sum of $4,000 and interest to cover the original advance by plaintiff upon the property, which mortgage was to be a fourth mortgage upon the property, subject to the Minetti and Neill mortgages, and also subject to the first and second mortgages, \u201cthe latter to cover the money advanced by party of the second part [Burns] on taking title and expenses in connection therewith and all expenses for recording and taxes on said mortgage and denying same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>\u25a0 Upon the execution of this agreement, Burns executed a deed of the property to one Agnes T. Madden, concededly a dummy, and she :\u00e1t once executed and delivered to Burns a bond and mortgage for $11,000, which he, on December 27, 1910, sold to the defendant Semenza for the sum of $10,000 in cash, which Burns received and kept, or gave to Timonier, under whose direction he appears to have been acting, and who is now dead. In August, 1911, Madden, at Burns\u2019 direction and for a nominal consideration, executed a deed of the property to one Victoria Michelin, who executed a lease to one Paterno.</p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">Up to a certain point in these proceedings Bums acted in strict conformity to his agreement with plaintiff. That agreement contemplated that he should convey the property to a third person, and through that third person execute a mortgage, which was to be a second mortgage, replacing the mortgage formerly held by Arnstein and Levy. Having done that, however, it was 'his duty to have executed and delivered to plaintiff a mortgage for $2,500 and <em>a </em>bond and mortgage for $4,000. The conveyance to Mrs. Michelin was in violation of that duty, but fortunately no irreparable harm was done thereby, because at the trial Mrs. Michelin tendered to said Burns a deed of the premises and an assignment of the lease to Paterno, which, as appears by a document appended to the case on appeal, said defendant has accepted. Upon these facts it-is not difficult to formulate a judgment- which will do equity' between the parties, and which will not be so elaborate and drastic as the one under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\"><bracketnum>[3,4]</bracketnum> Burns is now in a position to specifically perform his contract with plaintiff, and should be required to execute and deliver to plaintiff: (1) A mortgage for $2,500,- bearing interest at 6 per cent. (2) A bond and mortgage for $4,000, also bearing interest at 6 per cent. No time is specified in the agreement as to how long these mortgages are to run, and they should therefore be presently payable. (3) He.should pay interest on $6,500 from May 25, 1910, the date on which he received the referee\u2019s deed, to the date of the mortgages to be given by- him. He held the property from the receipt of the referee\u2019s deed as trustee for the plaintiff so far as plaintiff\u2019s advances 'Went, and should account for and pay either interest or mesne profits from that time. Although the property is apparently of a rentable 'character, there is no evidence as- to the mesne profits, and interest should'therefore be allowed. These two mortgages should be subordinate only to the $11,000 mortgage held by Semenza; the mortgages to Neill and Minetti being for some reason out of the case. If said Burns shall still be unable to make specific performance as above provided, or shall refuse to do so within 20 days, he should pay to plaintiff the sum of $6,500, with interest at 6 per cent, from May 25, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-13\">So far as concerns the appellant Semenza, we see no reason why the mortgage held by him should be annulled and a new one executed, as required by the order appealed from, or why he should be further restrained from proceeding with its foreclosure. The making of such a mortgage was expressly provided for in the agreement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>plaintiff \u00e1nd Burns, and Semenza appears to have purchased^ it in entire good faith. In so far as Semenza is concerned, the judgment should be reversed, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> So far as concerns costs, the necessity for this action arose from the failure of Burns to live up to his contract, and the plaintiff is entitled to costs against him at the Special Term and on appeal. Semenza, on the other hand, having apparently been blameless, is entitled to costs against plaintiff at Special Term and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Settle order on notice.
