The notice under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204) was excluded, and the case was submitted to the jury under the provisions of Labor Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 31) \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19, and under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-24\">The learned trial court charged the jury as a matter of law that the gin pole and stays forming the hoisting contrivance fell within the definition of section 18 of the Labor Law, and that the subway con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>struction was a structure. It was also charged that the Labor Law applied to the situation developed by the evidence, and left it to the jury to determine whether the defendant used reasonable care in furnishing its employ\u00e9s \u201cwith this contrivance, erected as it was, and with the guys in the condition in which they were,\u201d instructing them that if the defendant \u201cfailed in using reasonable care\u2014that is, negligence\u2014 and unless there is some other reason why the plaintiff should not recover, he is entitled to your verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is contended that the exception to that part of the charge submitting to the jury the question of defendant\u2019s liability under the Labor Law presents error requiring a reversal of the judgment. This contention is based upon the assumption that the provisions of section 18 of the Labor Law are limited to scaffolds, and has no application to \u201choists, stays, ladders or other mechanical contrivances\u201d not used in connection with scaffolds. I think that the instruction to the jury was correct. The language of the statute is clear and explicit, and means exactly what it says; that is, that a person employing or directing the performance of labor of any kind, in the erection, repairing, altering or painting of a house, building, or structure is negligent and responsible, if he furnishes, \"erects, or causes to be furnished or erected for the performance of such labor any appliance that comes within the prohibition, irrespective of whether it is used in connection with a scaffold, or upon a building or structure in which no scaffolds are used. Michael v. Standard Concrete Steel Co., 55 Misc. Rep. 255, 105 N. Y. Supp. 131; Cummings v. Kenny, 97 App. Div. 114, 89 N. Y. Supp. 579; McConnell v, Morse Iron Works, 102 App. Div. 324, 92 N. Y. Supp. 477; Walters v. Fuller Co., 74 App. Div. 388, 77 N. Y. Supp. 681. I think that the gin pole and stays in the case at bar constituted a derrick. In the case last cited a derrick was held to be a \u201choist and mechanical contrivance,\u201d and \u201csquarely within the provisions of the statute,\u201d although it was not in use as a part of a scaffold.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The evidence of the plaintiff tending to show the use of manilla rope, instead of a wire guy, was an improper construction of the appliance, was such as to require the submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">HIRSCHBERG and THOMAS, JJ., concur.
