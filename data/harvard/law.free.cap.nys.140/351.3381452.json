To recover upon a contract to pay money for services, there must be parties competent to contract, subject-matter, consideration, and. performance or its equivalent. A lack of either element is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">This complaint alleges the making of a written contract on July 17, 1912, between defendant as executor of the last will and testament of William A. Wheeloclc, deceased, and one Gertrude Horowitz, for an exchange of lands situated in the Borough of Manhattan, the deeds to be delivered on or before August 15th of the same year. This contract was conditional upon said Horowitz on or before August 5, 1912, \u201cprocuring a loan of $75,000 on the property of the party of the first part\u201d (defendant). Notice of the success or failure of said Horowitz to procure this loan was to be given defendant on or before the date named. By consent of the parties to the contract the time within which such loan was to be procured was extended to August 8th, and the amount thereof reduced to $60,000. Before August 8th the said loan was secured, and on that day notice was given. Prior to the law day fixed in the contract for exchange, and on August 12th, defendant repudiated the contract and so notified Horowitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The complaint further alleges that after the making of the contract of July 17th, at the request of Gertrude Horowitz and defendant, plaintiff, upon his own credit and responsibility, employed and procured the Title Insurance &amp; Trust Company to examine the title of the properties to be exchanged, in order to enable said Horo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>vvitz to obtain the loan provided for in said contract. But this allegation is coupled with the further allegation that the procurement of this loan by plaintiff was in consideration of the express promise of said Horowitz to pay him the sum of $3,000 therefor, which sum was subsequently reduced and fixed at $2,400. Although not separately stated as required by the Code of Civil Procedure (section 483), plaintiff has attempted to state two separate and distinct causes of action, one for commissions for effecting an exchange of the properties referred to, and the other for services in procuring a loan to Horowitz upon one of them. The failure to separately state these does not preclude thus considering them. Wiles v. Suydam, 64 N. Y. 173. As to each plaintiff has failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><bracketnum>[3-5]</bracketnum> So far as the cause of action arising out of the claim for compensation for effecting an exchange of properties is concerned, plaintiff\u2019s complaint is faulty, in that it fails to allege consideration for the contract sought to be enforced. Passing without discussion the very serious question whether the complaint alleges a contract between defendant and Horowitz which became effective by delivery, nowhere does it allege plaintiff\u2019s employment by defendant, and the rendition of services in reliance upon the strength thereof. It is true that the contract between defendant and Horowitz contains these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cThe sellers hereby agree that Alfred A. Hevla [meaning the plaintiff] brought about this sale and agreed to pay the broker\u2019s commission of. 1% to him, and ip. the event that the title shall close and the deeds be delivered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. But this is nothing more than an evidentiary fact by way of admission, not made to plaintiff, but to a third person, that plaintiff brought about the sale. Notman v. Galveston Steamship Co., 137 App. Div. 851, 122 N. Y. Supp. 598. But, even if plaintiff did bring about the sale, there must be an agreement, express or implied, to compensate him therefor. White v. Molloy, 9 App. Div. 101, 41 N. Y. Supp. 162. There is no allegation of an expfiess agreement. If plaintiff was regularly engaged in the business of real estate brokerage, conscious acceptance of his services in this capacity might raise an implied contract to pay therefor, but the same rule does not otherwise apply. Hurd v. Lee, 132 App. Div. 110, 116 N. Y. Supp. 445; Main v. Eagle, 1 E. D. Smith, 619; Fraser v. Born, 33 Misc. Rep. 591, 67 N. Y. Supp. 966. There is no allegation in the complaint as to the character , of plaintiff\u2019s business, and for anything therein disclosed plaintiff, without defendant\u2019s knowledge, and as a mere friendly act to one or both of the parties, or from some purpose of his own advantage, may have busied himself to bring about the execution of the contract. The promise to pay, contained in the clause above referred to, was not made to plaintiff, nor to any one obligated to plaintiff so that plaintiff might take advantage of such promise, and being executory in character, as all of the services in connection therewith, if any were rendered, were past services, such promise rests upon no consideration, and is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> So with regard to the cause of action which plaintiff attempts to state in connection with the loan transaction. Reading the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tions above referred to respecting defendant\u2019s request to plaintiff in connection with the other allegation of Horowitz\u2019s promise to pay him therefor, we conclude that whatever services were rendered were in reliance upon Horowitz\u2019s express promise to pay, \u00e1nd not upon any implied contract arising out- of defendant\u2019s request. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> But, if the said Horowitz is not solely liable therefor, then the complaint must be deemed to allege a joint employment by defendant and said Horowitz, and the demurrer upon the ground of defect of parties is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
