The plaintiff had a right to be in the public street. The automobile of defendant was at a stop, and the unexplained sudden backing of the automobile, without any warning, calls at least for some explanation on the part of the defendant. See Lundy v. Second Ave. R. R. Co., 1 Misc. Rep. 100, 20 N. Y. Supp. 691; Smith v. American Ice Co., 152 App. Div. 484, 137 N. Y. Supp. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
