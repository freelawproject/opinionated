The certificate of nomination was prepared in conformity to the rules of the Nassau county committee of said National Progressive party. The question presented upon this appeal relates to the method and procedure the members \u25a0of that party shall adopt in nominating their candidates for town, \u25a0offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The party was organized in June, 1912, and participated in the November election of that year; its candidates for state offices receiving more than 350,000 votes. It is a party, and not an independent organization (subd. 8, \u00a7 3, Election Law [Laws 1911, c. 891]), and the provisions of the Election Law applicable to the nomination of candidates by an independent organization do not apply to the procedure for the nomination for town offices. . The party has no enrolled members, and because of that fact no primaries have been held since its birth. It has no committees elected under the provisions of the Election Law. It has a state committee, however, and an organization in the various counties of the state, with committees duly constituted in its various branches, which are recognized by the state committee, and it has a town committee in the town of North Hempstead. The relators are the chairman of the state committee, the chairman of the \u25a0county committee in the county of Nassau, and the chairman of the town committee in the town of North Hempstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> But two methods of nomination are provided by the Election Law, one is by independent bodies, the other by_ parties. The latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>nominate under the provisions of section 45 of the Election Law; and subdivision 4 of that section is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-3\">\u201cAll other nominations and elections by a political party, both for party nominations and party positions, shall be made at the primary election herein provided for except that party nominations for town, ward and village offices and for the office of school director shall be made in the manner prescribed by rules to be adopted by the party committee of the county wherein such town, village or school district is located, and of the city committee wherein such ward is located.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The Nassau, county committee have adopted rules providing the procedure for selecting its candidates for town offices and the office of school director, which provides in substance for unofficial primaries-at which delegates are elected to conventions, which nominate party candidates in the towns. These rules furnish authority for making the nominations, unless it is to be held that the word \u201ccommittee,\u201d as used in said subdivision 4, must be a committee elected at a primary election. Such a construction would make it impossible for the National Progressive party to nominate candidates for town, ward, and village offices, a construction which the Legislature never intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It would render the statute unconstitutional (Matter of Hopper v. Britt, 203 N. Y. 144, 96 N. E. 371, 37 L. R. A. [N. S.] 825), a construction which it is the duty of the court to avoid, if it is possible to. so construe its provisions as to carry out the general purpose of the act and the intention of the Legislature. 36 Cyc. 1110;. People v. Long Island R. R. Co., 194 N. Y. 130, 87 N. E. 79; Knights Templars\u2019 Ind. Co. v. Jarman, 187 U. S. 1-97, 23 ;Sup. Ct. 108, 47 L. Ed. 139; Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Com., 211 U. S. 407, 29 Sup. Ct. 115, 53 L. Ed. 253; United States v. Jackson, 143 Fed. 783, 75 C. C. A. 41; U. S. v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 29 Sup. Ct. 527, 53 L. Ed. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I believe that subdivision 14 of section 3 of the Election Law applies only to parties which have participated in the party primaries, or have had an opportunity to do so, that it has no application to the facts presented by the record before us, and that the National Progressive party may lawfully nominate and choose its candidates for town offices and school director in the town of North Hempstead in the manner prescribed by its rules for Nassau county, and that it is the duty of the town clerk to receive and file the certificate of such nomination. It is likewise his duty to print an official ballot and in the party ticket of the National Progressive party the names of the candidates so nominated.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The order must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
