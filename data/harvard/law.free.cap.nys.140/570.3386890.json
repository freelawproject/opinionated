At the opening of the trial the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint- upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause' of action. The motion was granted, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As to the sale and delivery of the goods the complaint alleged \u201cthat between the 1st day of October, 1901, and 30th day of June, 1907, at the city of New York, the plaintiff furnished to Josephine W. Peck, then- the wife of the defendant, at the special instance and request of said Josephine W. Peck, necessaries for her use, to wit, gowns and wraps of the value of fifteen thousand sixty-three and 13/ioo ($15,-063.13) dollars;\u201d that the same had not been paid, nor any part thereof, except the sum of $8,504, leaving a balance due the plaintiff of $6,559.13, for which sum judgment was demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">After issue was joined plaintiff s\u00e9rved a bill of particulars, and it may be, as contended by\" the respondent, that all of the articles which were sold and delivered were not, strictly speaking, necessaries. However, that cannot be determined from the complaint, amplified as it is by the bill of particulars. The allegations of the complaint are such that evidence may be introduced for the purpose of enabling the jury to determine whether or not they were necessaries in the sense that they were articles of dress suitable to the wife\u2019s station in life and the husband\u2019s ability to pay\" therefor. Rosenfeld v. Peck, 149 App. Div. 663, 134 N. Y. Supp. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If evidence be introduced showing that they were necessaries, then defendant is liable to pay for them; (De Brauwere v. De Brauwere, 203 N: Y. 460, 96 N. E. 722, 38 L, R. A. [N. S.] 508), unless he can show' that the wife was supplied with articles of the same character as those purchased, or that he had given her sufficient money to pay cash for them, or notice if the purchases were made they were on her credit, and not his. Wanamaker v. Weaver, 176 N. Y. 75, 68 N. E. 135, 65 L. R. A. 529, 98 Am. St. Rep. 621. But this, as stated in the Wanamaker and Rosenfeld Cases, supra, is a matter of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">I am of the opinion the complaint states a cause of action, and for that reason the judgment appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
