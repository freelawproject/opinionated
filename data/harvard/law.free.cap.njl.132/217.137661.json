The subject-matter is a life insurance policy (converted) in the sum of $5,000, issued by the United States to plaintiff (a veteran of the first World War) on January 24th, 1928, under the <em>World War Veterans\u2019 Act of </em>1924. 43 <em>Stat. </em>607; 38 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 421, <em>ei seq. </em>Plaintiff and defendant were then married; and the latter was designated as beneficiary. The marriage was dissolved by a decree of divorce in the latter part of the year 1941; and shortly thereafter plaintiff appointed his mother as beneficiary of the policjr in the place and stead of defendant. This change of beneficiary was communicated to and recognized by the Veterans\u2019 Bureau, but it was not endorsed upon the policy, for the instrument was then in defendant\u2019s possession and she has ever since refused to surrender it. The policy reserved to plaintiff the right to effect a change of beneficiary \u201cat any time without the knowledge or consent of the named beneficiary.\u201d And it contained a provision that the \u201cproceeds\u201d thereof \u201cshall not be assignable, except that any person to whom this insurance shall be payable may assign his interest\u201d therein \u201cto any other beneficiary within the class permitted by.the World War Veterans\u2019 Act or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The District Court judge found that plaintiff had made a gift of the policy to defendant; and he therefore awarded judgment to defendant. In this, there was error in matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">At the time of the issuance of the policy, the statute made nonassignability, and exemption from the claims of creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and all taxation, attributes o\u00a3 the \u201cinsurance\u201d thereby granted. 43 <em>Stat., pp. </em>607, 613, \u00a7 22. This provision rendered nonassignable \u201cthe compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance payable\u201d thereunder. It was construed to bar assignments of such policies by the insured. <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>14 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>475. On August 12th, 1935, the clause was superseded by one providing that \u201cPayments of benefits due or to become due shall not be assignable, and such payments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary under any of the laws relating to veterans shall be exempt from taxation\u201d and \u201cthe claims of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\u201d 49 <em>Stat., pp. </em>607, 609, \u00a7 3: 38 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 454a. <em>Section </em>22, <em>supra, </em>was thereby expressly repealed; and the repealer was followed by the direction that \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment by any person, to whom converted insurance shall be payable under title III of the World War Veterans\u2019 Act, 1924, of his interest in such insurance to any other member of the permitted class of beneficiaries.\u201d This provision would seem to be ambiguous, for, while the statute originally prohibited payment of the proceeds of an insurance policy (term or converted) to a person not within certain specified classes related to the insured by blood or marriage, under an amendment adopted in 1928 this limitation of the beneficiaries to a definite class is now confined to \u201cyearly renewal term insurance.\u201d 43 <em>Stat. </em>624, \u00a7 300; 38 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 511. <em>Vide United States </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>39 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>225; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United, States, </em>56 <em>Id. </em>563; <em>Small </em>v. <em>United States, </em>110 <em>Id. </em>122. The report of the Committee on World War Veterans\u2019 Legislation of the House of Representatives reveals that the design of the amendment was to give the insured under converted insurance \u201cthe same right with regard to designating a beneficiary or changing a beneficiary as he would have under a commercial insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">But this does not mean that converted policies have all the characteristics of the ordinary life insurance policy. As noted, \u201cpayments of benefits,\u201d due or to become due, are non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>'assignable and beyond the reach of creditors and legal or equitable process, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary; and the statute further provides that, \u201cSubject to regulations, the insured shall at all times have the right to change the beneficiary or beneficiarios without the consent of such beneficiary or beneficiaries, but only within the classes herein provided.\u201d 38 <em>U. 8. G. A., </em>\u00a7 512. Of course, for the reasons already stated, the limitation to \u201cclasses herein provided\u201d has no significance as respects converted policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">These provisions forbid the assignment of the policy by the insured and, as well, the curtailment or surrender, contractual or otherwise, of his right to change the beneficiary. The policy of the statute in this regard is to afford a measure of economic security for servicemen and their dependents. Its general design is to provide \u201ca system for the relief\u201d of disabled veterans and the dependents of veterans who died as a result of disability suffered in military service. 38 <em>U. S. C. A., </em>\u00a7 422. Insurance is granted for the \u201cprotection\u201d of the insured veteran and his dependents. It issues \u201cagainst the death or total permanent disability\u201d of the insured. <em>Ibid., </em>\u00a7 511. There is provision for such \u201calternative benefits to the insured and the beneficiaries as may be found to be reasonable and practicable.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>\u00a7 512. The act has \u201cfar-reaching national plan and purposes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Patryas, </em>303 <em>U. S. </em>341; 58 <em>S. ct. </em>551; 82 <em>L. Ed. </em>883. Insurance is provided that would otherwise be unobtainable in numerous individual cases, and at a rate devoid of the profit element. It issues \u201cwithout regard to the health of the applicants\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Patryas, </em>supra); and thus there is accorded substantial recognition for service in the military and naval forces bjr means that will also conduce to the essential public interest. The benefits of the statute are secured against improvidence and diversion from their basic purpose of support and maintenance in time of urgent need. And the act is to be liberally construed in favor of its beneficiaries and the public policy thereby served.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The statutory reservation to the insured serviceman of the right, \u201cat all times,\u201d to change the beneficia^, considered in the light of the general legislative object, disabled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>insured from making the irrevocable gift of the insurance asserted by defendant. Allowance of this claim of an unalterable transfer of title to the instrument itself, by its delivery with a donative purpose, would nullify the absolute right of the insured, thus legislatively conferred, to change the beneficiary while the insurance policy subsisted \u2014 a power designed to advance the essential statutory policy. What defendant maintains is that here there was, in effect, an irrevocable designation of a beneficiary, for the consequence of the assignment, if valid, <em>ex necessitate </em>would be the termination of the reserved right \u201cat all times\u201d to change the beneficiary. An absolute assignment of an ordinary life insurance policy divests the insured of all right and title thereto, and vests his entire interest in the assignee. <em>Travelers\u2019 Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Grant,, </em>54 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>208; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>76 <em>Id. </em>104; <em>affirmed, </em>77 <em>Id. </em>565; <em>Prudential Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Deyerberg, </em>101 <em>Id. </em>90. An assignment of such a policy without the consent of the person named therein as beneficiary is ineffectual as to the latter\u2019s beneficial interest, if there was no reservation of the right to change the beneficiary, for in such circumstances the designated beneficiary has a vested and absolute right to the proceeds of the insurance. If the asserted unconditional gift of the policy in issue be sustained, the donee would have a vested right to the proceeds of the insurance, including benefits payable in the event of the total permanent disability of the insured; and thus the prime object of the statute would be subverted. Under the statute, the beneficiary cannot have a vested interest in unaccrued installments of insurance. The exercise of the insured\u2019s statutory authority to designate whomsoever he pleases as the beneficiary of the policy is effective as against those who would otherwise be entitled to benefits thereunder. It is not the subject of contractual qualification. Such was the interpretation of this provision of the statute before the amendment of 1935, <em>supra. Von Der Lippi-Lipski </em>v. <em>United States, </em>4 <em>Fed. Rep. (2d) </em>168; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Murphy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 <em>Fed. Supp. </em>583. And it has not been modified by that amendment. Evidently, the primary purpose of the amendment was to clarify the exemption clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>as regards the status of benefits after receipt by the beneficiary. <em>Vide United States Trust Co. </em>v. Helvering, 307 <em>U. S. </em>57; 59 <em>S. Ct. </em>692; 83 <em>L. Ed. </em>1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">It is urged that a \u201cgift\u201d of such a policy is not an \u201cassignment\u201d within the intendment of the statute. Obviously, it is. An \u201cassignment\u201d of a chose in action is a transfer to another of the property in action, in whole or in part. An assignment without consideration differs from a gift only in the method of proof. A gift is an assignment perfected by delivery, and, apart from the difference in manner of proof, an assignment without valuable consideration and a gift are alike. 6 <em>G. J. S. </em>1048. If an assignment supported by a consideration is within the ban of the statute, so also, <em>a </em>fortiori, is a gift of the policy <em>inter vivos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In this view, we have no occasion to consider whether a parol assignment of a life insurance policy is cognizable in equity only. And the question is not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We have considered respondent\u2019s motion directed to the sufficiency of the state of the case. While the policy of insurance should ordinarily be incorporated in the case on appeal, the decisive question here is purely one of law. involving the construction of the federal statute, and therefore one that is ' determinable without the presentation of the terms of the policy in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The judgment of the District Court is accordingly reversed, with costs; and, since the essential facts are not in dispute and the determinative question is one of law purely, the cause is remanded with direction to enter judgment final for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
