On depositions taken by both parties the court subsequently quashed the writ. It was developed by the depositions that the suit was brought under the act of Congress commonly cited as the \u201cFair Labor Standards Act of 1938,\u201d 29 <em>U. 8. C. A., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 201, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>et seq. </em>The act provided in section 207 (a) (3) that \u201cNo employer shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, employ any of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce \u2014 (3) for a workweek longer than forty hours after the expiration1 of the second year from such date,\u201d and in section 203 (b) that \u201c 'Commerce\u2019 means trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or from any State to any place outside thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We may'- assume that the Middlesex Pleas had jurisdiction to entertain appropriate suits under that statute. It remains, however, that the jurisdiction, and indeed the liability sued upon, depends upon the statute. There was no contract, express or implied, to pay the item in litigation. The statute creates a liability, and the suit is to enforce that statutory liability. But the statute, by its terms, applies only to employment in commerce among the states or from a state to a place outside thereof. That sort of commerce is a <em>sine qua non </em>of the employee\u2019s right to sue. There is nothing in the proofs by which such employment is shown or from which it may be inferred. I conclude that the writ of attachment was properly quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
