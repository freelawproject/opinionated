By the provisions of the ordinance in question the height and kind of structures on the property of prosecutors is so restricted as to render its use for industrial purposes useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">Prosecutor argues that the ordinance is illegal for constitutional and statutory reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">The ordinance was also attacked in the case of <em>Yara Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>at this term, 132 <em>N.
