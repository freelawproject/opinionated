Among a number of persons found in the place and taken into custody was Max Haber. Haber had but a short time previously been indicted by the Hudson County grand jury on two charges of gambling; and. on May 5th, 1944, when arraigned before Judge Roberson in the Quarter Sessions on those indictments, he entered a plea of guilty whereupon he was sentenced to serve a term in state prison of from one to three years and to pay a fine of $1,000. The prison sentence was suspended, and Haber was placed on probation until the fine and costs were paid. It was stated at the hearing and not denied that he was given a card by the probation officer which bore conditions of the probation. Among other things the card instructed him to \u201cIndulge in no unlawful or injurious habits of conduct. Avoid harmful associates and evil places. Lead a clean, honest and temperate life.\u201d He had paid $45 on account of the fine and costs. When arraigned early in the morning of June 10th before Judge Roberson, he was given a summary hearing for violation of his probation and was resentenced to state prison on the said indictments for a term of from one year to three years. At that arraignment he admitted to the court that he had been in the raided gambling place but said that he had gone there for the purpose of borrowing sufficient money to complete the payment of the fine which had previously b'een imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">It is argued in Haber\u2019s behalf that when Judge Roberson imposed the sentence on May 5th and then suspended the prison term, he had lost jurisdiction and that therefore he was without power to rekentence him. We think not. The suspension of the prison term clearfy was only during good behavior. He was on probation until the fine was paid. It was within the power of the judge to determine whether there had been a violation of probation. The proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>were summary under <em>R. S. 2 </em>:199 \u2014 4. It was not a trial but a summary hearing or a continuation of: the original arraignment at which the plea of guilt was entered. Hence there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s right of due process as is argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We conclude that the writ was improvidentlv issued, and it will therefore be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
