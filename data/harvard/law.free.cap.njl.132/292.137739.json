The complaint charged custody. Either possession or custody was an offense under the statute. It is enough that a complaint apprises the accused of the charge laid and of the statute which denounces his offense. After conviction, he appealed to the Essex County Court of Common Pleas and had a trial <em>de novo </em>as provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">It is provided in <em>B.

J. S. A. </em>2 :206 \u2014 11 found in <em>Cumulative Pocket Part </em>for 1944-45, <em>p. </em>11, third paragraph, providing as follows: \u201cAn appeal to the special sessions court under authority of this section shall not operate to bring up for review the proceedings before the magistrate from whose conviction the appeal is taken, but shall operate as an application for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the special sessions court, and as a waiver of all technical defects in the record, including any defect in, or the absence of, any process or charge laid in the complaint, and as a consent that the court shall enter judgment solely upon the basis of the testimony presented before such court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The statute having been followed, the prosecutor is precluded from raising the points now sought to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">There being no merit in the contention made before us, the judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
