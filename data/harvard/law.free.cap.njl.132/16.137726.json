Differences arose between them and on July 15th, 1943, they agreed, in writing, to submit to arbitration. The arbitrator was given power to arbitrate \u201cthe dispute and differences between the parties, to irrevocably decide the -indebtedness of Durante to Caparaso, and of Caparaso to Durante.\u201d An award was made by the arbitrator in favor of Durante and against Caparaso. Respondent thereupon gave notice of motion to confirm and appellant countered with a cross-motion to vacate the award. After a hearing, the Circuit Court judge signed an order reciting \u201cthat the award * * * is affirmed and that judgment be entered in favor of Egidio Durante and against Louis Caporaso for the sum of $2,307.50.\u201d No judgment appears in the state of case and the appeal might be dismissed on that ground. However, we have considered the matter as though properly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>this court, and conclude that appellant lias failed to establish that the award is tainted by any of the infirmities enumerated in <em>B. 8. 2 </em>:40-19. The order for entry of judgment will be considered as a judgment and affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
