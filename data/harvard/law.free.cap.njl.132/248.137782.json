J. L. </em>461, that \u201cuntil the accrual, the modification or repeal of the rule so providing does not constitute a reduction of the current salary\u201d and that \u201ca rule providing for increments is a mere declaration of legislative policy that is at all times subject to abrogation by the board in the public interest.\u201d But that decision does not, in our view, constitute a complete and precise answer to the questions above propounded, inasmuch as there appears to have been no direct modification, abrogation or repeal. The matter is of public importance. We think it proper, therefore, that an opportunity for court review should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">A writ of <em>certiorari </em>will be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
