As originally drawn, the state of demand set up a case of false imprisonment at the instance of defendant, namety, arrest without warrant, detention in a police station, finger printing, and final release without trial. The original allegation in the state of demand was that defendant did \u201crequest and order a police officer * * * to arrest the plaintiff.\u201d But when the case was moved for trial, without any previous notice, plaintiff moved to amend the state of demand to read that defendant \u201cdid * * * with malice request and order,\u201d &amp;e. This amendment is the gravamen of the appeal, and that it was material seems to be indicated by the fact that the damages awarded by the jury were $500, the maximum jurisdictional amount, after a charge by the judge specifically dealing with malice as an element of damages. Defendant\u2019s attorney objected to the amendment, on the ground that he had not had notice of any such claim and had not prepared for it, but was overruled, with the result just stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">We consider that it was erroneous to allow the amendment, the effect of which was to add to the plaintiff\u2019s claim the essential element of malicious prosecution. The gist of false imprisonment is mere unlawful detention without more, and conceivably with meritorious intent: and malice is not an element of the cause of action. 25 <em>O. J. </em>545. The old precedents for the respective causes of action are quite distinct, 2 <em>Chit. PI. </em>*600; <em>Id. </em>*857. There may, of course, be incidents in false imprisonment justifying punitive damages, such as excessive force in the arrest, &amp;c.; but the gist of false imprisonment, even with the best motives, is the unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>fulness of the arrest, however gentle or <em>bona fide </em>it may have been. Malice is not an essential element, 11 <em>R. G. L. </em>794; but the trial court in charging the jury dealt with the case as one for malicious prosecution, and instructed them, among other things, that it must appear \u201cthat the charge was made without reasonable cause,\u201d and \u201cthat the defendant in making it was actuated by malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The error in introducing the element of express malice for the first time at the trial requires a reversal of the judgment, and a remand for a new trial. Such will be the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
