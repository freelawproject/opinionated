The applicant does not seriously dispute the major facts, and he does not question the reasonableness of the anticipated costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The resolution is rested upon <em>R. 8. </em>40:2-31. It recites that an emergency has arisen with respect to the aforesaid work by reason of the lack of sufficient funds; that the emergency arises because of the reorganization of the work of the foreclosure and liquidation of the tax liens and the consequent acceleration of the proceedings; that the extent of the acceleration could not have been anticipated or the extent of the need for funds foreseen and consequently an emergency appropriation is needed in the named amount, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The application for a writ of review is grounded in three points: (1) the resolution does not set out the nature of the emergency in full as required by law; (2) the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>certiorari </em>should issue because the prosecutor denies the existence of any emergency; (3) the foreclosure of tax title liens does not come within that class of exceptional cases for which an emergency appropriation may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">It appears to us that the resolution does amply set out the nature of the emergency and, further, that the denial by the applicant of the existence of an emergency does not serve to vary the logic of the resolution supplemented by the undisputed proofs that an emergency does in fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The third point is rested by the applicant upon his conception of the meaning of the following provision in <em>R. 8. </em>40 :2-31, as amended, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1939, <em>ch. </em>23, <em>p. </em>36:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201c* * * Such an appropriation shall be made only to meet a pressing need for public expenditure, to protect or promote the public health, safety, morals or welfare or to provide for relief of the poor prior to the ensuing budget year. * * *\u201d The argument is that such an appropriation may be made only when there is a pressing need for public expenditure (1) to protect or promote'the public health, safety, morals or welfare or (2) to provide for relief of the poor prior to the ensuing budget year. The wording and the punctuation of the statute are such as to leave no doubt in our minds that the suggested construction is fallacious. We read the statute to provide that the purposes for which such an appropriation may be made are (1) to meet a pressing need for public expenditure, or (2) to protect or promote the public health, safety, morals or welfare, or (3) to provide for the relief of the poor prior to the ensuing budget year. The pressing need for the proposed expenditure has been shown to exist. We find no such debatable question of fact or law as calls for the issue of a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The application is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
