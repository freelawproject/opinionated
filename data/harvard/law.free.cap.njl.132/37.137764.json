The cited section provides a penalty of thrice the excess over maximum price, or $50, whichever is the greater. The maximum rent officially fixed in this case was $27 per month, and the plaintiffs for two successive months paid rent of $30 to one Thomas Earina, taking his personal receipt for the same. On this evidence, judgment was rendered for the penalty of $50 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We conclude that there was error. The case is barren of any direct evidence that the defendant, who became owner just prior to the collection of the $30, had directed any increase of rent, or had engaged Thomas Earina to collect the rent, or had received it from Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The action is for a penalty, and the law is settled that in a penal action against a master for the act of a servant the general rule of respondent superior in civil actions does not apply, and direct authority should be shown. 25 <em>C.
