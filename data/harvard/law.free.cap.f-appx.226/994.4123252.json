Hebron submits a response and a supplemental response to this court\u2019s order directing him to show cause why his petition for review should not be dismissed as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">Hebron sought review by the Merit Systems Protection Board of the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision affirming the decision to remove Hebron from a mail handler position. On November 17, 2006 the Board denied Hebron\u2019s petition for review and informed Hebron that its decision was final and that any petition for review must be received by this court within 60 calendar days of receipt of the Board\u2019s decision. The Board served its decision on Hebron via electronic mail on November 17, 2006. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s regulations, \u201cBoard documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission,\u201d i.e., November 17 in this case. The court received Hebron\u2019s petition for review on Wednesday, January 17, 2007, 61 days after Hebron received the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">A petition for review must be received by the court within 60 days of receipt of the Board\u2019s final order. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). To be timely filed, the petition must be received by this court on or before the date that the petition is due. <em>Pinat v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>931 F.2d 1544, 1546 (Fed.Cir.1991) (petition is filed when received by this court; court dismissed petition received nine days late). Because Hebron\u2019s petition was not timely received by this court, it must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-22\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-23\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-24\">(1) Hebron\u2019s petition for review is dismissed as untimely filed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-25\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
