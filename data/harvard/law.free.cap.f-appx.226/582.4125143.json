Because his state-appointed attorney was not constitutionally ineffective in representing Vinson at trial, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">On the night of November 24, 1995, Sheila Evans threw a birthday party for herself, after which she, her then-boyfriend Artie Embry and her previous boyfriend Everett Vinson repaired to her house for a \u201cdrink.\u201d JA 89. Evans and Embry fell asleep on a couch, while Vinson retired upstairs. Early in the morning of November 25, Evans was awakened by the sound of Vinson coming down the stairs. Wielding a butcher\u2019s knife, Vinson stabbed Embry several times. Evans screamed; her son woke up, came into the room and grabbed Vinson\u2019s arm. As the two wrestled for the knife, Vinson cut his own left hand and his right cheek and dropped the knife. The two were still struggling when the Michigan state police arrived 20 minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The State charged Vinson with assault with intent to commit murder, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.83, and with several lesser included offenses. In preparation for trial, Vinson and his state-appointed counsel, Theodore Hentchel, discussed Vinson\u2019s \u201chospital record at the VA hospital, [the] defense to use, ... and trying to get a ... plea.\u201d JA 115. The two discussed the \u201cpossible defense\u201d of intoxication, but Hentchel advised that \u201cintoxication and also diminished capacity\u201d were not \u201cgood defense[s].\u201d JA 116. Indeed, in his 17 years of practice, Hentchel had \u201cnever used alcohol\u201d as a defense because \u201c[j]urors do not like that.... Voluntary intoxication does not work.\u201d JA 186-87. Instead, Hentchel decided to argue that Vinson had acted in self-defense, relying on \u201cthe wound ... on [Vinson\u2019s] hand\u201d as corroborating evidence. JA 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">In May 1996, Vinson\u2019s first trial ended with a hung jury. The jury foreperson explained that one of the jurors refused to deliberate, but that the rest were ready to convict Vinson of assault with intent to do great bodily harm, Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.84, a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Vinson\u2019s second trial was held in August. On the morning of the second trial, the prosecutor said he would accept a plea to the lesser charge of assault with intent to do great bodily harm. Although Hentchel asked for \u201csomething better,\u201d \u201csince the first jury was already ready to give that to us,\u201d the prosecutor refused to accept anything less than \u201cthe 10-year charge\u201d <em>(ie., </em>assault with intent to do great bodily harm). JA 160. When Hentchel brought the offer to his client, Vinson turned it down. On August 9, the jury convicted Vinson of assault with intent to commit murder, and the judge sentenced him to 15-25 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">In his state court direct appeal, Vinson argued (among other things) that Hentchel was constitutionally ineffective in not raising defenses of intoxication and diminished capacity at trial and in advising Vinson about the plea offer. He also asked for an evidentiary hearing, which the Michigan Court of Appeals denied. <em>People v. Vinson, </em>No. 198432 (Mich.Ct.App. Dec. 2, 1997). In reviewing Vinson\u2019s claims on the merits, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that Hentchel had not \u201cerred\u201d in choosing this trial strategy and that Vinson waived his plea-bargain argument because he had not asked for an evidentiary hearing on the matter. <em>People v. Vinson, </em>No. 198432, 1998 WL 1990004, at *2 (Mich. Ct.App. Sept. 4, 1998). The Michigan Supreme Court denied Vinson leave to appeal this decision. <em>People v. Vinson, </em>No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>113326, 459 Mich. 994, 595 N.W.2d 852 (Mich. May 25,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">After exhausting his state post-conviction remedies, Vinson petitioned for federal habeas corpus relief. Noting that Vinson never had an opportunity to present evidence on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the district court held an evidentiary hearing. Vinson testified that he rejected the State\u2019s plea bargain because he thought he had been acquitted of assault with intent to commit murder at his first trial. Although Hentchel could not recall Vinson\u2019s case precisely, he said that he would have \u201curge[d][his] client\u201d to take a plea in Vinson\u2019s circumstances. JA 182. The district court denied the petition, <em>Vinson v. McLemore, </em>No. 01-10290-BC, 2006 WL 381663, at *6 (E.D.Mich. Feb. 17, 2006), but granted Vinson a certificate of appealability on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In reviewing the denial of Vinson\u2019s habeas petition, we give fresh review to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and defer to any factual findings stemming from the evidentiary hearing unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Fair v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 427, 430 (6th Cir.1998). Vinson is \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\u201d requiring us to defer to the factual findings of the state courts absent \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to the contrary, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1), and restraining us from granting the petition \u201cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication ... resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). When a state court has not resolved a claim on the merits (because, say, it mistakenly thought the claim was waived), we must decide for ourselves as a de novo matter whether the inmate is in custody \u201cin violation of the Constitution ... of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Vinson submits that Hentchel was constitutionally ineffective in advising him to reject the State\u2019s plea-bargain offer. To prevail, Vinson must show that Hentchel \u201cmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and that, but for this inadequate assistance, Vinson \u201cwould have pleaded ... guilty and [not] insisted on going to trial,\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 60, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Heightened AEDPA review does not apply to this claim because the state courts never reviewed it on the merits. They instead thought that Vinson had waived the claim because he \u201cdid not move for ... an evidentiary hearing,\u201d <em>Vinson, </em>1998 WL 1990004, at *2, which turns out not to be true, <em>see Vinson, </em>No. 198432 (Mich.Ct.App. Dec. 2,1997) (denying Vinson\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The key problem with Vinson\u2019s claim is that he has not established the factual predicate for bringing it. He has not shown that Hentchel ever told Vinson that the first (hung) jury acquitted him of assault with intent to commit murder. Vinson has shown only that <em>he </em>thought he had been acquitted, and even then he has not given a good explanation for why he reached that conclusion after the first jury\u2019s decision in open court, why he still held that opinion at the time of the plea-bargain offer and why he still held that opinion after the prosecutor\u2019s opening ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>gument in the second trial specifically addressed Vinson\u2019s \u201cintent to murder\u201d Embry. <em>See </em>JA 120, 125, 456-57; Trial Tr. at 13. While Hentchel could not remember exactly what he told Vinson after the initial jury decision, he did explain at the evidentiary hearing what he normally would have told a client under these circumstances based on his 17 years of criminal-trial experience. Hentchel (not surprisingly) understood that a hung jury does not mean acquittal but instead means that \u201c[y]ou start all over.\u201d JA 181. And if Vinson had suggested that he had been acquitted, Hentchel explained that he \u201cwould have told him he was dead wrong.\u201d JA 188. He also explained that he \u201cwould urge [his] client\u201d to take the plea in a case like Vinson\u2019s. JA 182. In crediting Hentchel\u2019s testimony over Vinson\u2019s testimony on this critical factual point, <em>see </em>D. Ct. Op. at 10, the district court did not make a clear error. In the absence of this factual predicate, this ineffective-assistance claim must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Vinson also complains that Hentchel did not sufficiently investigate and ultimately pursue two defenses: voluntary intoxication and diminished capacity. While Hentchel considered these defenses in the abstract (and did not investigate them), his strategic choice to rely on self-defense as Vinson\u2019s only theory of acquittal is \u201creasonable\u201d so long as his \u201creasonable professional judgment!] supports] the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The state court did not \u201cunreasonably\u201d apply this tenet of <em>Strickland </em>for three reasons. <em>First, </em>Hentchel\u2019s decision to stick solely with a theory of self-defense was legitimately and reasonably strategic. As Hentchel explained at the evidentiary hearing: he \u201cnever used alcohol\u201d as a defense, JA 186; he had \u201cnever known of it being successful,\u201d <em>id.; </em>he had \u201cnever known of any attorney\u201d in his county \u201cusing a successful alcohol\u201d defense, JA 186-87; and he thought \u201c[j]urors do not like\u201d the argument that \u201cI was too drunk to know what I was doing,\u201d JA 187. <em>See also </em>JA 187 (\u201cQ.... [W]ould it be fair to say that if you did not raise the defense of diminished capacity, that that was part of your trial strategy in this case?\u201d \u201cA. Yeah.\u201d); JA 116 (Hentchel said that \u201cdiminished capacity ... wasn\u2019t a good defense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Second, Hentchel\u2019s reasonable decision not to investigate alternative defenses had ample information to support it \u2014 he made the choice <em>after </em>Hentchel had heard all of the witnesses at the first trial and after Vinson had discussed his past alcohol abuse and counseling several times with Hentchel. At that point, Hentchel knew of Vinson\u2019s history, knew that there was no evidence (other than Vinson\u2019s statement) that he was too intoxicated to realize what he was doing several hours after he had stopped drinking and knew that Hentchel was competent enough to write letters to the state-court judge and prosecutor complaining of Hentchel\u2019s lack of communication, <em>see </em>JA 454, 456. While a qualified mental health expert may be necessary to look at this issue sometimes, <em>see Dando v. Yukins, </em>461 F.3d 791, 798-99 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that an attorney presented with a viable defense of Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome may need to hire a mental health expert before rejecting that defense), no expert was needed here when the facts and law known to Hentchel reasonably showed that neither voluntary intoxication nor diminished capacity had reasonable prospects for success.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\"><em>Third, </em>Hentchel had good reason to think that self-defense was Vinson\u2019s best option. Physical evidence corroborated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the theory (Vinson\u2019s wounded hand), and twelve jurors had been ready to acquit Vinson of assault with intent to commit murder based on that defense. Had Hentchel altered his theory or added a theory, the State surely would have introduced Vinson\u2019s \u201cstatement to police that he stabbed the victim in self defense\u201d to discredit him. JA 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
