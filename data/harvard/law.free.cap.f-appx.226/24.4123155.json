Aug. 10, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>A96-429-502 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 4, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a summary opinion that essentially adopts the IJ\u2019s conclusions, we review the IJ\u2019s decision, Sec<em>aida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003), and conduct our review pursuant to the substantial evidence standard, treating the IJ\u2019s factual findings as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Uddin overstayed a student visa, and asserted a risk of persecution as a defense to removal proceedings nine years after arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Uddin failed to establish a clear probability that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [Bangladesh] because of [his] ... religion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Uddin testified \u201cthat he is not of any particular religious faith\u201d and that this results in \u201cpressure\u201d from his Muslim peers, \u201creprimand[s]\u201d from his Muslim parents, and a feeling of \u201cnot fitting in.\u201d Uddin testified that his father told him that during Uddin\u2019s stay in the United States, members of an Islamic group extorted the equivalent of ten dollars from Uddin\u2019s family. Uddin admits that \u201che does not know what the situation would be\u201d if he returned to Bangladesh, but claims that, according to his parents, \u201cthere are cases of abduction for high ransom.\u201d His parents \u201cdo not want him to return because they are concerned for his safety.\u201d This evidence does not compel a conclusion that it is more likely than not that Uddin would face a threat to his life or freedom in Bangladesh, or that any such threat would be \u201cbecause of\u2019 his lack of religious belief (as opposed to his perceived ability to pay). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>cf. Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 544-45 (2d Cir.2005). Uddin\u2019s brief mainly argues that the record evidence does not focus on the situation of persons who, without converting to another religion, do not actively practice Islam. That may be; but it was Uddin\u2019s burden to make such a showing if his claim depended on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">For the reasons set forth above, the petition is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
