Lynch and his wife sued Nissan North America, Inc., alleging that Nissan had been negligent both in failing to properly maintain a catwalk involved in Lynch\u2019s 2003 fall at Nissan\u2019s manufacturing facility and in delaying the treatment that he received following the accident. Nissan moved for summary judgment on the ground that, as the principal contractor for the conveyor-construction project that Lynch was working on, it was immune from tort liability under the Tennessee Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The district court granted Nissan\u2019s motion, dismissing the Lynches\u2019 suit in its entirety. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-18\">After carefully considering the record on appeal, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, and having had the benefit of oral argument, we agree with the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Nissan. Because the reasoning that supports the judgment for Nissan has been clearly articulated by the district court in a thorough and comprehensive opinion, the issuance of a detailed written opinion by us would be unduly duplicative. The judgment rendered by the Honorable Aleta A. Trauger, District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, is accordingly affirmed on the basis of the reasoning set forth in her Opinion dated September 30, 2005.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
