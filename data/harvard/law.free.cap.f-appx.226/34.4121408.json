Petitioner Mir Mahabub Hassan, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, seeks review of the May 9, 2006, order of the BIA affirming the December 22, 2004, order of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Noel A. Ferris denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mir Mahabub Hassan, </em>No. A72 436 157 (B.I.A. May 9, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A72 436 157 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 22, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u2018Where, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we will review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir. 2005)(per curiam). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">In order to be sustained, an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons, [that] bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The IJ\u2019s primary reason for discrediting Hassan\u2019s testimony was that he testified to two beatings that he did not describe in his asylum application. Reliance on these omissions is logically flawed because \u2014 unlike current asylum applications \u2014 the application that Hassan completed did not ask him to describe how he was persecuted or why he believed he was entitled to asylum. Nor did it ask that he describe beatings or other incidents of persecution. Hassan described his imprisonment only because the application specifically asked whether he had been imprisoned or detained. While the IJ noted other factors that she believed undermined Hassan\u2019s credibility, given the centrality of the two supposed omissions to her analysis, we cannot conclude that remand would be futile. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The IJ alternatively decided that one of the beatings Hassan described, which occurred in July 1991, was not \u201cof an extreme nature\u201d and therefore did not constitute past persecution and that Hassan had not established that the other beating, which occurred in August 1991 and resulted in Hassan\u2019s hospitalization, involved government actors. We cannot affirm based on the IJ\u2019s conclusion concerning the first beating because \u201ca \u2018minor beating\u2019 or, for that matter, any physical degradation designed to cause pain, humiliation, or other suffering, may rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention on the basis of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006). In addition, Hassan testified that his August beating was inflicted by persons affiliated with the ruling government. Because it is unclear to what extent the IJ\u2019s finding of a lack of nexus was infected by an adverse credibility finding, we believe that the agency should also re-examine this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The IJ also held that Hassan\u2019s July 1991 beating did not constitute torture. We are uncertain of the basis for this conclusion because it would seem that being beaten with three-foot sticks for half an hour, as Hassan testified, would cause \u201csevere pain\u201d as required by the regulation defining torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). The IJ did not consider the August 1991 beating in terms of CAT relief presumably because she already had determined that Hassan failed to show that his assailants were government employees. Because we have required reexamination of that finding, the agency should, on remand, reconsider Hassan\u2019s CAT claim in light of both claimed beatings. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1208.16(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Because all of the IJ\u2019s subsequent reasoning rested on her error-infected conclusions that (1) Hassan had not testified credibly and (2) even if Hassan\u2019s testimony was credible, it did not establish past persecution on a protected ground or torture, we must vacate the BIA\u2019s order affirming the IJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and this mattter is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. We deny petitioner\u2019s motion for a stay as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
