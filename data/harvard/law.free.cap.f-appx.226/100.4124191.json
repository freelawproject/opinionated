Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). The petitioner must establish that she has \u201cno other adequate means\u201d to obtain relief and that she has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ, <em>and </em>the reviewing court must determine that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">This is Trader\u2019s second attempt to revive his Speedy Trial Act claims by petitioning for a writ of mandamus. On January 3, 2006, we denied his first petition because his Motion to Dismiss had been terminated upon entry of his guilty plea and was no longer pending. <em>See </em>161 Fed.Appx. 205 (3d Cir.2006). In the instant petition, Trader asserts that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Zedner v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1976, 164 L.Ed.2d 749 (2006), should be applied to invalidate retroactively the termination of his Motion to Dismiss. This is a misreading of <em>Zedner, </em>which did nothing to undermine the validity of Trader\u2019s guilty plea or the termination of his Motion to Dismiss, and in any event, a mandamus petition would not be an appropriate method for raising such a claim. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-26\">.
