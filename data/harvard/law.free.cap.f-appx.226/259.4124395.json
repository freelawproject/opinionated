The district court sentenced him to the statutory maximum term of 120 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). Philson appeals his conviction and sentence, contending that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>was insufficient and that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights at sentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Philson asserts that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the Government failed to prove he knowingly-possessed the firearm officers found between the mattress and box spring in his bedroom. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion filed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Smith, </em>451 F.3d at 216. This court \u201cmust consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). We \u201ccan reverse a conviction on insufficiency grounds only when the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Moye, </em>454 F.3d 390, 394 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 452, 166 L.Ed.2d 321 (2006). Applying these principles, our careful review of the trial testimony convinces us that Philson has not met the heavy burden he faces in seeking to overturn his conviction. Thus, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that Philson knowingly possessed the firearm found between the mattress and box spring of his bed. <em>See id. </em>at 395 (setting forth elements of \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>424 F.3d 431, 435-36 (4th Cir.) (discussing constructive possession), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 779, 163 L.Ed.2d 604 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Philson also contends on appeal that, in sentencing him, the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his base offense level based on a type of weapon about which there was no evidence presented at trial and by sentencing him under <em>de facto </em>mandatory guidelines. Because Philson did not challenge in the district court his sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We will affirm a post-Booker sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Here, the district court sentenced Phil-son <em>post-Booker </em>and appropriately treated the properly calculated guidelines range as advisory. The district court then considered that range along with the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), taking into account the arguments from Philson and his counsel about Philson\u2019s employment history before his arrest, family circumstances, the effect his arrest had on his children, and that he was a \u201cvictim of circumstance.\u201d The court ultimately imposed the statutory maximum sentence. Nothing in the record demonstrates that Philson has rebutted the presumption of reasonableness. We therefore find that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Philson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny Philson\u2019s motion to relieve his attorney and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> Philson also has filed pro se supplemental briefs raising several issues. We have carefully considered the arguments raised in the pro se briefs and find them to be without merit. To the extent Philson claims that counsel provided ineffective assistance, we decline to review that claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.) (providing standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
