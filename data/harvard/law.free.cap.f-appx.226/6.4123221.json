R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\n<em>MEMORANDUM OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Michael Gibbs appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss his indictment for Unlawful Reentry of a Removed Alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Gibbs argues the Government cannot establish the element of \u00a7 1326(a) requiring that he have been lawfully deported. In particular, Gibbs maintains <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), undermined the validity of his deportation order. Assessing whether the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) applied retroactively to applications pending on the date the statute became effective, the Supreme Court held that relief under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 remains available \u201cfor aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Gibbs, who did not enter a plea agreement and went to trial, argues that <em>St. Cyr </em>means his deportation proceedings were \u201cpretermitted\u201d and <em>therefore he </em>was not lawfully deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The district court rejected this argument, concluding \u201cGibbs cannot meet the second requirement of \u00a7 1326(d)\u201d because he \u201cwas not deported before his appeal was finalized and [he] was not deprived of judicial review.\u201d The court reasoned that <em>St. Cyr </em>was immaterial because Gibbs could not show his deportation proceeding somehow deprived him of judicial review; indeed, it was reviewed in the Fourth Circuit. Gibbs pleaded guilty but reserved his right to pursue this appeal of the denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">We need not decide whether <em>St. Cyr </em>makes the AEDPA\u2019s restriction upon relief under \u00a7 212(c) inapplicable to deportees who went to trial. Even if the AEDPA does not apply, Gibbs would be entitled only to consideration of his application for a discretionary waiver of deportation under \u00a7 212(c); Gibbs would still not have been deprived of the opportunity for judicial review. As the district court explained: \u201c[t]he subsequent decision in <em>St. Cyr </em>does not invalidate the finality of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision; it only reverses the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rationale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Because a collateral attack upon a deportation order made to defend against an indictment for violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) requires that the defendant meet all three requirements listed in \u00a7 1326(d), and Gibbs does not meet at least the second one, the Order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
