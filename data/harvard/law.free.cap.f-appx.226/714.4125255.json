We have jurisdiction over this diversity case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm in full. As the facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>First, there is no genuine issue of material fact that the May 1, 2002 letter did not constitute a binding contract. The letter plainly states that the duration of the contract was conditioned on Tosco management\u2019s approval. Duration was an essential and material term of the contract, known to both parties. Because the record contains no evidence Tosco management ever approved the contract, the May 1, 2002 letter cannot constitute a binding contract. <em>See Bustamante v. Intuit, Inc., </em>141 Cal.App.4th 199, 215, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 692 (2006). Furthermore, the parties did not perform under the May 1, 2002 letter. The two deliveries of oh Tosco accepted were purchased pursuant to spot contracts containing a price differing from the formula price contained in the May 1, 2002 letter, and the amounts shipped did not conform to the amounts required in the letter. <em>See </em>Cal. Comm.Code \u00a7 2201(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Second, there is no triable issue of fraud. Riverbank fails to show that Tosco acted with intent to defraud Riverbank or that Tosco fraudulently rejected conforming oil to obtain a better deal. Tosco\u2019s failure to buy Riverbank\u2019s shipped oil was a result of the nonconformance of the oil. <em>See Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell, </em>10 Cal.4th 1226, 1239, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 900 P.2d 601 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Third, there is no triable issue regarding Riverbank\u2019s claim of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Riverbank offers no evidence Tosco knew of any relationship between Riverbank and a third party and <em>intentionally </em>acted to disrupt such relationship. <em>See Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>29 Cal.4th 1134, 1153-54, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Finally, there is no triable issue regarding Riverbank\u2019s unlawful business practices claim. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200. Riverbank has not made the requisite factual proof to raise a triable issue for either fraud or intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, nor has Riverbank made a showing Tosco\u2019s actions were designed to deceive the public or were violative of public policy or were immoral and unethical. <em>See Cel-Tech Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tel. Co., </em>20 Cal.4th 163, 180, 83 Cal. Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999); <em>McKell v. Wash. Mut., Inc., </em>142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1471, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 227 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
