(\u201cSiemens\u201d) appeals from the June 24, 2005, Order of the District Court granting a motion by PNC Bank (\u201cPNC\u201d) for summary judgment on Siemens\u2019s <em>respondeat superior </em>claim and denying Siemens\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on the theory of apparent authority. We \u25a0will affirm the Order of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">From January of 1996 through March of 1998, Michelle Williams was employed as an assistant in the payroll department of Cerberus Pyrotronies, Inc. in Cedar Hill, New Jersey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the course of her employment, Williams defrauded Siemens through a check-cashing scheme in which she made out payroll checks to other employees, forged the endorsement signatures of those employees and then cashed the checks for her own gain at PNC Bank. In total, Williams cashed 689 fraudulent checks totaling over $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-21\">In February of 1998, when several Siemens employees complained that their 1997 W2 forms reflected earnings greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>than what they had actually received, Williams\u2019s superiors in the payroll department uncovered indications of her wrongdoing and, on March 6, 1998, confronted Williams with their suspicions. Williams admitted that she had defrauded Siemens and was terminated. Siemens subsequently hired the accounting firm KPMG to investigate the extent of Williams\u2019s fraud. In its May 1999 final report on the matter, KPMG notified Siemens of its discovery that Williams had cashed all of the fraudulent checks at one of two local branches of PNC Bank and that the same teller had handled all 639 of the transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">After Siemens notified PNC of the results of the KPMG investigation, the Bank identified Eloise Tanner as the teller who had cashed all of Williams\u2019s checks. Tanner held the position of \u201cHead Teller\u201d at PNC and, as such, had the discretion to cash non-customer checks when she had reason to believe they were backed by sufficient funds. When PNC confronted Tanner in January of 2000, she claimed that she did not know Williams and that she had cashed the checks because she believed that PNC had an agreement with Siemens to do so. PNC was unable to locate, and was otherwise unaware of, any such agreement. PNC subsequently dismissed Tanner, though PNC claims that Tanner\u2019s dismissal was prompted by the discovery of a $5,000 shortfall in Tanner\u2019s \u201creserve vault,\u201d rather than any role she may have played in Williams\u2019s scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In February of 2003, Siemens brought an action against PNC Bank, Williams, Tanner and nine \u201cJohn Doe\u201d employees of PNC Bank with supervisory powers over Tanner, alleging fraud, negligence, violations of federal and state racketeering statutes and seeking recovery of Siemens\u2019s lost $300,000. Although Siemens\u2019s complaint alleged eight counts, Counts I, II, V, VI, VII and VIII were disposed of early in the litigation and are not before us. Nor is Count IV, which Siemens voluntarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The District Court\u2019s order from which Siemens appeals deals only with Count III: Siemens\u2019s claim that \u201cPNC is vicariously liable to Siemens for the deliberate fraud of its agent, Tanner, under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.\u201d </em>PNC moved for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that PNC could not be vicariously liable for fraud because Tanner\u2019s actions were taken outside the scope of her employment. Siemens brought a cross-motion, arguing that \u201cPNC is vicariously liable for Tanner\u2019s wrongful conduct because PNC placed her in the position of head teller which enabled her, cloaked with apparent authority to cash non-customer checks, to commit a fraud upon Siemens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The District Court granted PNC\u2019s motion, reasoning that, though \u201c[bjank tellers commonly cash and process checks for customers of a bank; knowingly cashing fraudulent checks is not the same thing\u201d and, therefore, that \u201cTanner\u2019s acts [were] outside the scope of her employment and the doctrine of respondeat superior, as applied by New Jersey courts, is inapplicable.\u201d It also determined that \u201cno reasonable jury could conclude that Tanner was motivated, in whole or in part, to serve PNC\u2019s interests.\u201d Finally, the District Court also denied Siemens\u2019s cross-motion, holding that because \u201capparent authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>protects only the innocent third party and not all interested parties, PNC is not liable to Siemens for Tanner\u2019s fraudulent conduct under apparent authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Siemens now appeals these rulings of the District Court. We review the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Robeson Indus. Corp. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indent. Co., </em>178 F.3d 160, 164 (3d Cir.1999). Because we sit in diversity, we will apply the substantive law of New Jersey, the forum state in this matter. <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>II. </em>\u2014 Respondeat <em>Superior</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Siemens argues that PNC should be held vicariously liable for Tanner\u2019s fraudulent conduct under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Under New Jersey law, \u201can employer can be found liable for the negligence of an employee causing injuries to third parties, if, at the time of the occurrence, the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Carter v. Reynolds, </em>175 N.J. 402, 815 A.2d 460, 463 (2003). To succeed in bringing a <em>respondeat superior </em>claim, \u201ca plaintiff must prove (1) that a master-servant relationship existed and (2) that the tortious act of the servant occurred within the scope of that employment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In this case, neither side disputes that a master-servant relationship existed between PNC and Tanner. The question here is whether Siemens has offered enough evidence such that a reasonable jury could conclude that Tanner\u2019s acts were within the scope of her employment. \u201cThe question whether or not the act done is so different from the act authorized is decided by the court if the answer is indicated; otherwise, it is decided by the jury.\u201d <em>Mason v. Sportsman\u2019s Pub, </em>305 N.J.Super. 482, 702 A.2d 1301,1310 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Generally, the phrase \u201cscope of employment\u201d \u201crefers to those acts which are so closely connected with what the servant is employed to do, and so fairly and reasonably incidental to it, that they may be regarded as methods, even though quite improper ones, of carrying out the objectives of the employment.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>815 A.2d at 465 (citations omitted). More specifically, \u201cscope of employment is subject to analysis under Restatement [(Second) of Agency] sections 228 and 229,\u201d both of which the New Jersey Supreme Court has explicitly adopted as the guiding principles of this inquiry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Restatement (Second) \u00a7 228 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\">(1) Conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if, but only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">(a) it is the kind he is employed to perform;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-16\">(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">(2) Conduct of a servant is not within the scope of employment if it is different in kind from that authorize, far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Additionally, Restatement (Second) \u00a7 229 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">(1) To be within the scope of the employment, conduct must be of the same general nature as that authorized, or incidental to the conduct authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">(2) In determining whether or not the conduct, although not authorized, is nevertheless so similar to or incidental to the conduct authorized as to be within the scope of employment, the following matters of fact are to be considered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">(a) whether or not the act is one commonly done by such servants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">(b) the time, place and purpose of the act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">(c) the previous relations between master and the servant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">(d) the extent to which the business of the master is apportioned between different servants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">(e) whether or not the act is outside the enterprise of the master or, if within the enterprise, has not been entrusted to any servant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-14\">(f) whether or not the master has reason to expect that such an act will be done;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-15\">(g) the similarity in quality of the act done to the act authorized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-16\">(h) whether or not the instrumentality by which the harm is done has been furnished by the master to the servant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-17\">(i) the extent to which the departure from the normal method of accomplishing an authorized result; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-18\">(j) whether or not the act is seriously criminal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">Finally, \u201cwhether the conduct is intentional or negligent is generally irrelevant.\u201d <em>Cosgrove v. Lawrence, </em>214 N.J.Super. 670, 520 A.2d 844, 847 (1986). Nor is it determinative that the employee\u2019s tortious conduct violated a specific employer policy. <em>Wright v. Globe Porcelain Co., </em>72 N.J.Super. 414,179 A.2d 11,14 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">Although the Restatement sections set forth numerous factors for us to consider, we believe the core issue before us to be Tanner\u2019s intent. The District Court determined that \u201cno reasonable jury could conclude that Tanner was motivated, in whole or in part, to serve PNC\u2019s interests.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In approaching this issue, we are mindful that, as Siemens conceded at oral argument, it was Siemens\u2019s burden to show that Tanner was motivated \u201cat least in part, by a purpose to serve\u201d PNC. <em>Carter v. Reynolds, </em>175 N.J. 402, 815 A.2d 460, 463 (N.J.2003) (holding that \u201ca plaintiff must prove\u201d both the existence of a mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ter-servant relationship and that the employee\u2019s actions were in the scope of employment). Siemens has failed to meet this burden. Siemens did not depose Tanner and, therefore, has not offered any direct statement from her regarding her intentions. Although Siemens has offered evidence indicating that PNC tellers were encouraged to cash non-customer checks in order to build relationships and promote the bank\u2019s image, Siemens has not offered anything to indicate that Tanner was motivated by this policy. Siemens may not satisfy its burden in this case by relying solely on evidence of some hypothetical benefit to PNC generally \u2014 it must offer evidence of Tanner\u2019s motivations specifically in this situation. Siemens has simply offered no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Siemens argues that we should only examine whether the \u201cact itself\u2019 \u2014 here, cashing checks \u2014 comes within the scope of Tanner\u2019s employment and that we should disregard the \u201cintent to serve\u201d aspect of the analysis. In making this argument, Siemens relies heavily on <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp. Bd. of Ed., </em>138 N.J. 405, 650 A.2d 958 (1994), and <em>Hill v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Corr. Comm\u2019r, </em>342 NJ.Super. 273, 776 A.2d 828 (2001). We will forgo a lengthy discussion of <em>Abbamont </em>and <em>Hill </em>here, except to say that, though both cases set forth and describe the <em>respondeat superior </em>framework, neither case discusses, much less repudiates, the \u201cintent to serve\u201d aspect of the doctrine. Therefore, we are not persuaded that these cases reflect any change in New Jersey law regarding <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We have little difficulty in affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment that Siemens has failed to offer enough evidence to suggest that Tanner was acting within the scope of her employment in cashing the checks at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">III. \u2014 Apparent Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Siemens also argues that PNC is liable for Tanner\u2019s fraud under a theory of apparent authority.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, PNC\u2019s \u201capparent authority\u201d argument is an amalgamation of two separate arguments sounding in different sections of the Restatement. We find neither to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Siemens\u2019s first apparent authority argument evokes the doctrine\u2019s traditional notion, which dictates that liability \u201cwill be imposed upon the principal in cases ... where the actions of a principal have misled a third party into believing that a relationship of authority existed.\u201d <em>Lobiondo v. O\u2019Callaghan, </em>357 NJ.Super. 488, 815 A.2d 1013, 1018 (2003) (quoting <em>Rodriguez v. Hudson County Collision Co., </em>296 NJ.Super. 213, 686 A.2d 776, 780 (1997)). However, it is clear that apparent authority \u201cexists only to the extent that it is reasonable for the third person dealing with the agent to believe that the agent is authorized. Further, the third person must believe the agent to be authorized.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency, \u00a7 8 cmt. c (1958). Siemens neither articulates clearly how it was \u201cmisled\u201d nor identifies the particular act it believed Tanner was authorized to take. Indeed, Siemens fails to deal with the fact that it was Siemens\u2019s own employee who, rather than being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cmisled,\u201d initiated and perpetrated the fraud.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Siemens\u2019s other \u201capparent authority\u201d argument relies on \u00a7 219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency. Siemens argues that PNC should be held liable for Tanner\u2019s fraud because Tanner \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relationship.\u201d Siemens cites <em>Gaines v. Bellino, </em>173 N.J. 301, 801 A.2d 322 (N.J.2002), as supporting the application of this principle to intentionally tortious activity such as Tanner\u2019s. However, <em>Gaines, </em>like similar cases such as <em>Abbamont, Hill </em>and <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, </em>132 N.J. 587, 626 A.2d 445 (1993), deals with actions brought under very specific statutory schemes designed to govern sexual harassment and other employment-related claims. While not entirely clear, the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 219(2)(d) in these cases appears to be a discrete effort to realize and effectuate the policies giving rise to those statutory schemes rather than an endorsement of applying \u00a7 219(2)(d) to all <em>respondeat superior </em>situations. Indeed, applying \u00a7 219(2)(d) to this case would, in effect, strip certain prongs from the \u201cscope of employment\u201d aspect of the <em>respondeat superior </em>test. None of the cases cited by Siemens reflect the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s intention to depart so significantly from these well-established principles. We decline to predict that the New Jersey Supreme Court would engage in such a massive shift in the New Jersey law of agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\">. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-22\">. Cerberus was purchased by Siemens following the events giving rise to this litigation. As the parties have done in brief, we will refer to Williams\u2019s employer as Siemens throughout this Memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. Siemens did not maintain its payroll account with PNC and, otherwise, was not a customer of PNC. Therefore, Williams would cash the check at PNC and PNC would in turn seek reimbursement from Siemens\u2019s account-holder bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b218-11\">. Despite Tanner's claims that she did not know Williams, Tanner's original employment application for her position listed Williams as a reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\">. The New Jersey Supreme Court has not yet adopted the formulation of <em>respondeat superi- or </em>given in the Restatement (Third) of Agency, which was published earlier this year. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.07. For our purposes, the key difference between the Second and Third Restatement is the degree to which the employee must intend his or her actions to be in service of his or her employer before vicarious liability can attach. In the Second Restatement, as noted below, the conduct is not within the scope of employment if it is \u201ctoo little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(2) (1958). However, in the Third Restatement, conduct is not within the scope of employment \"when it occurs within an independent course of conduct not intended by the employee to serve <em>any purpose of the employer.\" </em>Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.07(2) (1958) (emphasis added). As stated, we will follow the approach set forth in the Second Restatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\">. The District Court also focused on whether Tanner was acting within the scope of her employment and concluded she was not because the act she took, \"knowingly cashing fraudulent checks,\" was \u201csufficiently different from the act authorized.\u201d We disagree with this approach. Under Restatement (Second) \u00a7 229(1), we are to determine whether the act at issue is \"of the same <em>general nature </em>as that authorized.\u201d (emphasis added). The plain language of this provision suggests that we should resist defining conduct with reference to the particular facts attendant to that conduct or with reference to any other limiting parameters. Instead, the Restatement makes clear that we should define the relevant act in broad terms. Here, it is more properly said that Williams \"cashed checks,\u201d and that this was the conduct authorized by PNC in her role as a teller.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">. We note that Siemens did not plead this theory in its complaint, instead raising it for the first time in its brief in support of its cross-motion for summary judgment. The District Court identified this defect but ultimately decided to rule against Siemens on the merits. Although PNC argues that the issue is not properly before us and that we should decline to entertain it, we will follow the lead of the District Court and opine on the merits of Siemens\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\">. Related to this argument is Siemens's reliance on Restatement (Second) \u00a7 261, which states that a \u201cprincipal who puts a servant or other agent in a position which enables the agent, while apparently acting within its authority, to commit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for fraud.\u201d However, the Restatement clearly states that liability under \u00a7 261 is premised upon \"the fact that the agent\u2019s position facilitates the consummation of the fraud, in that from the point of view of the third person the transaction seems regular on its face and the agent appears to be acting in the ordinary course of the business confided to him.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 261 cmt. a (1958). Siemens\u2019s argument is, apparently, that Williams was the \u201cthird party\u201d from whose point of view \"the transaction seem[ed] regular on its face.\u201d Again, however, it was Williams who created and implemented the scheme and, therefore, it defies all reason to suggest that Williams could have in someway been deceived by Tanner's actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b222-9\">AMBRO, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AXC\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">No part of the Court\u2019s substantive analysis of the <em>respondeat superior </em>and Restatement of Agency issues gives pause. I write separately only because I believe that this case presents substantial questions relating to the interplay of the Uniform Commercial Code with these issues. Indeed, the chain of consideration begins with the UCC, for in many cases it may preempt common-law claims. I ultimately conclude that the UCC does not preempt Siemens\u2019s cause of action, and so I join the Court\u2019s opinion. In this context, the UCC\u2019s reach in this area is shorter than it should be, and so I urge its drafters to consider extending the comparative negligence rule of U.C.C. \u00a7 3-404(d)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">\u201cUnless displaced by the particular provisions of [the UCC], the principles of law and equity ... supplement its provisions.\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 1-103. This text leaves the impression that the UCC\u2019s preemptive effects are limited and narrow. Not so. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the Official Comments explain, the UCC\u2019s preemptive reach is actually quite long:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aov\">[T]he Uniform Commercial Code is the primary source of commercial law rules in areas that it governs, and its rules represent choices made by its drafters and the enacting legislatures about the appropriate policies to be furthered in the transactions it covers. Therefore, while principles of common law and equity may <em>supplement </em>provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, they may not be used to <em>supplant </em>its provisions, <em>or the purposes and policies those provisions reflect, </em>unless a specific provision of the Uniform Commercial Code provides otherwise. In the absence of such a provision, the Uniform Commercial Code preempts principles of common law and equity that are inconsistent with either its provisions <em>or its purposes and policies.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">U.C.C. \u00a7 1-103 cmt. 2 (third and fourth alterations added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence, we apply the common law to commercial cases only when (1) the UCC explicitly so provides or (2) the common law supplements the text, purposes, or policies of the UCC without supplanting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Article 3 of the UCC regulates negotiable instruments, including checks. Specifically, it apportions liability among drawers, drawees, indorsers, and collecting banks when the check collection process goes awry. U.C.C. \u00a7 3-401 to 20. In particular, it provides that when a drawer corporation (here, Siemens) has a faithless employee (Williams) who enriches herself by causing the corporation to issue fraudulent checks, the default rule is that liability falls on the drawer, not the bank, because the UCC renders the faithless employee\u2019s fraudulent indorsement \u201ceffective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 3-404(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">This age-old scheme can take many forms. Here, Williams defrauded Siemens by causing it to issue checks payable to employees (current and former), fraudulently indorsing the checks, and cashing them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 3-404 by its terms comes into play: it applies when \u201ca person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable does not intend the person identified as payee to have any interest in the instrument.\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 3-404 (internal cross references omitted). While the wording no doubt is obtuse, both elements of the section are met here: Williams determined to whom payroll checks were payable,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and she did not intend for the named payees to have any interest in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The problem here is that Williams was not alone. Tanner, a head teller at a PNC branch, ensured that the scheme succeeded by cashing the fraudulently indorsed checks. Neither Siemens nor PNC , was particularly careful in monitoring its employee\u2019s activities, and Williams and Tanner got away with the scheme for quite a while. Eventually, both employers wised up and are now fighting to determine who will bear the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">In run-of-the-mill faithless employee scenarios, \u00a7 3^04(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">[I]f a person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection [here, PNC] fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss [Siemens] may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care [PNC] to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">This is a comparative negligence provision. 2 White <em>&amp; </em>Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 19-2 (4th ed.1995) (referring to the \u201ccomparative negligence\u201d rule in 3-404); <em>see also </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 3-405 cmt. 4 (\u201cIf the trier of fact finds that there was such a failure and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, it could find the depositary bank hable to the extent the failure contributed to the loss.\u201d). In other words, when the employer and the bank are both negligent, a trier of fact should apportion the loss between them to the extent each party\u2019s negligence contributed to the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Whether \u00a7 3-404(d) applies here becomes complicated, however, because Siemens does not allege PNC\u2019s actions were negligent, but fraudulent. Specifically, Siemens argues that Tanner\u2019s fraud<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> should be imputed to PNC. If Siemens is correct, then \u00a7 3-404 does not apply because it only protects banks that pay instruments \u201cin good faith.\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 3-404(b)(2). Tanner, of course, did not pay the instrument in good faith, and if we impute her fraud to PNC, it did not either. To determine whether we attribute Tanner\u2019s fraud to PNC (and thereby remove this claim from \u00a7 3-404\u2019s reach), we must look to state agency law, as the UCC does not provide an answer, and the state law on point does not conflict with the UCC\u2019s text, purposes, or policies. Hence, I agree with the Court that ordinary principles of agency law apply, and they prevent attributing Tanner\u2019s fraud to PNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Having disposed of this case, I write further to note that applying state agency law to claims like this one (which are not uncommon) introduces dissonance into a legal regime that should be uniform and predictable. I suggest that the UCC drafters consider explicitly providing the rules of decision in cases in which the drawer\u2019s faithless employee conspires with a bank teller or other line employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">The symmetry of this case is striking: PNC was negligent in not detecting Tanner\u2019s fraud in the same way that Siemens was negligent in not detecting Williams\u2019s fraud. Yet, <em>respondeat superior </em>threatened to shift liability from Siemens to PNC. In this case, it does not matter because New Jersey\u2019s version of <em>respondeat superior </em>emphasizes whether the employee intended to serve the master. In our case, and in analogous situations, New Jersey (along with many other states) is reluctant to hold a master liable for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>servant\u2019s fraud when the servant is acting against the master\u2019s interests. <em>See, e.g., J.D. Edwards &amp; Co. v. Podany, </em>168 F.3d 1020, 1024 (7th Cir.1999) (applying Illinois law); <em>Am. Bankers Life Assur. Co. of Fla. v. Tri City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>677 F.2d 28, 30 (6th Cir.1982) (applying Tennessee law); <em>Todd v. Skelly, 384 </em>Pa. 423, 120 A.2d 906, 909-10 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Other states, however, treat these situations differently, holding the master-principal hable so long as the servant-agent, viewed from afar, appears to be about the master\u2019s business, even if the putative agent is acting solely for her own benefit. <em>See, e.g., Dewey v. Lutz, </em>462 N.W.2d 435, 443 (N.D.1990); <em>Pac. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, </em>553 So.2d 537, 541 (Ala.1989); <em>Hedley Feedlot, Inc. v. Weatherly Trust, </em>855 S.W.2d 826, 837 (Tex.Ct.App.1993) (\u201cIf an agent is acting within the scope of his <em>general </em>authority, his wrongful act, though unauthorized, will nevertheless subject his principal to liability.\u201d) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>Billups Petroleum Co. v. Hardin\u2019s Bakeries Corp., </em>217 Miss. 24, 63 So.2d 543, 546 (1953); <em>McCarthy v. Brockton Nat\u2019l Bank, 314 </em>Mass. 318, 325-26, 50 N.E.2d 196 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Perhaps more importantly, even in states like New Jersey <em>respondeat superi- or </em>liability turns on the subjective \u201cstate of the servant\u2019s mind,\u201d which, as the Restatement notes, is typically provable only by circumstantial evidence. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 235 cmt. a (1958). This inquiry is naturally fact-intensive, and in cases involving the same basic facts (faithless employees conspiring to use the checking system to defraud their employers) factfinders can nonetheless reach opposite liability determinations because of differences in nuance and inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The same basic situation is treated differently in different states (and can be treated differently by different factfinders in the same state). While this is a normal and, in some circumstances, salutary effect of our federal-state system, the motivating logic of the UCC is that the law applying to certain commercial transactions should, for efficiency and predictability reasons, be uniform. <em>See </em>Karl N. Llewellyn, <em>Why We Need the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>10 U. Fla. L.Rev. 367, 372 <em>&amp; 381 </em>(1957). Long ago the UCC drafters (and before them the Negotiable Instruments Law drafters) determined that the banking system and its attendant routine transactions were ripe for standardization. <em>Id.; see also </em>Ralph L. Abercrombie, <em>Article 4: Bank Deposits and Collections, </em>15 Okla. L.Rev. 287, 287 (1962). Following the deregulation of interstate banking in the 1990s, it is more important than ever that the check collection process be governed by rules of decision that do not vary from state to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Moreover, it is worth noting that \u00a7 3-404 altered the substantive pre-Code law to relieve banks of liability when customers\u2019 employees used the check collection system to steal from their employers. According to White and Summers, the purpose of \u00a7 3-404 is to shift liability to employers who fail to take care in supervising employees who control their check-writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\">The drafters have concluded that the employer should bear the responsibility for the forgery of certain embezzlers\u2014 those who have \u201cresponsibility with respect to instruments,\u201d i.e., treasurers, payroll clerks, programmers of sensitive computer programs, and the like. <em>These people are known by the employer to have the keys to the bank. </em>In some cases they will be bonded. <em>All employers should have procedures that encourage these people to be trustworthy and that expose them when they are not.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak\">2 White &amp; Summers \u00a7 19-4 (emphasis added). Indeed, the insistence on employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>er liability is so strong that in a prior version of Article 3 the drawer had no recourse at all against a negligent bank. U.C.C. \u00a7 3-405 (1952). In the current version, however, the drafters have recognized that bank negligence could justify a sharing of liability, and so they have provided for comparative negligence. <em>Id. </em>When a bank employee is negligent \u2014 or even grossly negligent \u2014 in cashing the drawer\u2019s fraudulently indorsed check, the factfinder apportions liability between the negligent employer and the negligent bank according to well-worn comparative negligence principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The UCC\u2019s comparative negligence rule should be expanded to cover situations in which both the drawer and the bank have faithless employees because it is inexplicably asymmetric for the applicable rule of decision (UCC comparative negligence or <em>respondeat </em>superior) to turn on whether a low-level bank employee was involved in the fraud. At present, if the drawer\u2019s faithless employee acts alone, the rule of decision is UCC comparative negligence, but if she acts in concert with a low-level bank employee, <em>respondeat superior </em>sometimes shifts liability to the bank alone. At first blush, applying <em>respondeat superior, </em>rather than UCC comparative negligence, to such cases might seem of little moment given that comparative fault is now the preferred approach to all tort liability. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 1 (2000). Thus, even under a <em>respondeat superior </em>rubric, the bank would be able to use the drawer\u2019s negligence to limit its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The wrinkle is that the comparative fault inquiries under each approach differ. Under an expanded \u00a7 3-404, the jury would compare the conduct of two negligent employers. Under <em>respondeat superior, </em>the jury compares the drawer\u2019s negligence with the bank\u2019s imputed fraud. Comparing negligence to negligence is not the same as comparing negligence to fraud, as intent to harm becomes part of the comparative fault equation. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 8(b). Indeed, considering the bank employee\u2019s intent to defraud could move a jury to impose more liability on the bank than it would were it comparing negligence with negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">More important for our case, the UCC provides a three-year statute of limitations. U.C.C. \u00a7 3-118(g). In New Jersey (and many other states), statutes of limitations for common-law claims are longer. Indeed, the statute of limitations issue may be the only reason Siemens did not proceed with a UCC claim. Here, Siemens delayed bringing its claim until after the UCC\u2019s limitations period had expired; thus, it asserted common-law claims to get around the UCC\u2019s time bar. The UCC\u2019s limitations period reflects the drafters\u2019 decision that employers seeking to shift part of their loss to banks must bring suit within three years. I see no reason for the mere involvement of a teller to change that by providing employers with an \u201cend-around\u201d this limitations period by styling their suits as non-UCC actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">I do not advocate UCC preemption in the event that the principals of the bank are implicated in a fraudulent scheme. <em>See Brighton, Inc. v. Colonial First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>176 N.J.Super. 101, 422 A.2d 433 (1980) , <em>aff'd </em>86 N.J. 259, 430 A.2d 902 (1981) . There I agree with the UCC\u2019s usual practice of leaving this type of serious commercial fraud to the law of torts. Section 3-404 regulates only low-level fraud by faithless employees because those schemes are common, and they operate through the normal channels of the check collection process. Following that principle, I urge that the UCC extend to reach the not untypical collection problem that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>arises when both the drawer and the bank have faithless employees. I would not advocate delving into what New York law terms \u201ccommercial bad faith,\u201d that is, bad faith acts that implicate bank managers with \u201c \u2018actual knowledge\u2019\u201d of the fraud. <em>See Calisch Assocs., Inc. v. Mfrgs. Hanover Trust Co., </em>151 A.D.2d 446, 542 N.Y.S.2d 644, 645-46 (N.Y.App.Div.1989) (quoting <em>Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc. v. Citibank N.A., 73 </em>N.Y.2d 263, 539 N.Y.S.2d 699, 536 N.E.2d 1118,1124-25 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">^ ^ ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Because I agree that the UCC does not reach the situation presented here, I join the Court\u2019s opinion. I, however, urge the UCC drafters to consider redrafting \u00a7 3-404 to extend the comparative negligence rule to situations in which a drawer\u2019s faithless employee conspires with a teller or other line employee of the bank to cash fraudulent checks.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b222-14\">. Unless otherwise noted, all references to Article 3 of the U.C.C. are to the 1990 version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\">. I recognize that the 2001 revisions to Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code quoted here have not been officially adopted by the New Jersey Legislature. However, the drafters of the UCC note that \"except for changing the form of reference to the [UCC] and minor stylistic changes,\" revised \u00a7 1-103 simply combines former sections 1-102 and 1-103 to \"reflect the interrelationship\" between the two sections. UCC \u00a7 1-103 cmts. Thus, my reliance on revised \u00a7 1-103 is in line, as it is not substantively different from former \u00a7\u00a7 1-102 &amp; 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">. This scheme took three forms: Williams caused Siemens to issue (1) two payroll checks to a single employee, one of which went to the proper payee, the other of which she misappropriated; (2) payroll checks to terminated and suspended employees, which she misappropriated; and (3) checks for overtime pay that employees did not earn, which she misappropriated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\">.
