Dowd, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b156-19\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b156-20\">DOWD, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b156-22\">Gary Ward, a former employee of Merck <em>&amp; </em>Company (\u201cMerck\u201d), characterized his termination by Merck as a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act and sought compensatory and punitive damages, along with reinstatement to his former position as a chemist with Merck. Following extensive discovery, Merck\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. This appeal followed. We find no error and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-23\">II. The Factual Setting</p>\n<p id=\"b156-24\">Ward was hired by Merck as a staff chemist in 1996. Ward took a required pre-placement physical examination and, as a result, was determined to be able to perform \u201cany job without restriction.\u201d Ward received a promotion to a Grade 7 Research Biochemist in January of 2001. On November 6, 2002, Ward tendered his resignation from Merck, citing stress from perceived problems at work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At Merck\u2019s request, he withdrew his resignation two weeks later on November 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-25\">Beginning in February 2003, Ward began to engage in strange behavior that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>started with an episode in Merck\u2019s cafeteria on February 19th.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on this episode, Ward was off work until March 17, 2003. He returned to work with an initially restricted schedule of three days a week until March 31, 2003, when he was permitted to return to full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Upon his return to work, Ward\u2019s behavior and work performance were reported to have deteriorated. His supervisors became concerned for both Ward and his coworkers. Based on employee observations of Ward and a review of his conduct by Dr. Peter Nigro with Merck\u2019s Health Services, Ward was requested by e-mail on June 23, 2003, to make an appointment with Dr. Nigro for an evaluation. Ward\u2019s attempts to make an appointment apparently met with failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Ward had been supervised in a lab run by Dr. Stevenson who, in turn, was supervised by Dr. Michael Washabaugh. Following Ward\u2019s failure to make the requested appointment with Dr. Nigro, Dr. Washabaugh met with Ward on July 3, 2003, and emphasized the need to undergo the examination. Dr. Washabaugh advised Ward that the appointment was mandatory. Ward continued to reject the directive to take the evaluation. On July 7, 2003, Ward was given a letter which advised he was \u201cbeing suspended from work with pay, effective immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">During the suspension period, Ward had no contact with any Merck employees. On July 25, 2003, Ward was advised that his employment was terminated immediately, but he was also provided a final opportunity to reconsider his refusal to comply and to schedule an evaluation within the next two days. Ward did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">III. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">A. Ward\u2019s Complaint and Merck\u2019s Answer</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">Ward\u2019s complaint and Merck\u2019s answer set the stage for extensive discovery that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>preceded the summary judgment stage of the case. The three-count complaint alleged violations by Merck under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). It alleged that Ward was regarded as disabled by Merck and/or had a record of disability and that Merck terminated Ward\u2019s employment as a result of his disability, without any effort at accommodation. Specifically, paragraph 20 of the complaint alleged that, on or about June 26, 2003, Merck demanded that Ward undergo a psychiatric examination unrelated to any legitimate work requirement and demanded that the psychiatric examination be conducted by its in-house medical department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Continuing, paragraph 24 of the complaint alleged that Ward was terminated for refusing to submit to the unlawful psychiatric examination that Merck had directed him to undergo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">B. The District Court\u2019s Ruling Granting Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Before addressing the fitness-for-duty issue, the district court observed that it found no evidence that Ward was subjected to a hostile work environment; no evidence that Ward was compelled by Merck to take a leave of absence; and that Ward had abandoned a portion of his claim in Count III of his complaint alleging that Merck violated the FMLA by compelling him to take leave and requiring him to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Next, the district court addressed the subject of when an employer may seek a \u201cfitness-for-duty certification\u201d with regard to a particular health condition that caused the employee\u2019s need for FMLA leave and opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">Under certain circumstances, an employer may subsequently request re-certification of an employee\u2019s medical condition, for example where \u2018[cjircumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly\u2019... \u2018No second or third opinion on re-certification may be required.\u2019 \u201d (regulatory citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The district court rejected Ward\u2019s argument that Merck\u2019s request for Ward to undergo a fitness-for-duty evaluation constituted a \u201csecond opinion\u201d under the FMLA because there is no second opinion when there has been no re-certification and Ward\u2019s leave of absence had ended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>months before Merck requested that Ward undergo the challenged examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The district court addressed Ward\u2019s claims of a prohibited medical inquiry and retaliation in violation of the ADA in the context of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">A covered entity shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, <em>unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The district court, after a review of the testimony placed in the record in support of Merck\u2019s motion for summary judgment, declared that there was \u201cmore than sufficient evidence to justify Defendant\u2019s medical inquiry\u201d and indicated that it was compelled to conclude that the medical inquiry requested of Plaintiff was \u201cconsistent with business necessity\u201d as required by \u00a7 12112(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Continuing, the district court then ruled that Ward\u2019s retaliation claim must, of necessity, fail as there was no violation of the ADA in requiring the plaintiff to submit to a \u201cfitness-for-duty\u201d evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">IV. Issues and Arguments on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">A. The Four Issues Advanced by Ward on Appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Ward advances three issues which he then suggests should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Issue Number 2: Did the ADA prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to undergo a post-employment medical ex-animation where the employer has no reasonable belief that any physical or mental health condition was interfering with the employee\u2019s ability to perform the essential duties of his position?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">The premise of Issue Number 2 is that Merck, the employer, lacked a reasonable belief that Ward had any physical or mental health condition that was interfering with his ability to do his job as a chemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">Issue Number 3: Did the district court commit reversible error in concluding that a claim of retaliation under the ADA is not viable unless the claim is premised on opposition to employer actions that are actually unlawful under the ADA?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">The premise for this issue is that, even if Merck had a valid basis for requesting the fitness-for-duty examination, Ward is able to maintain a separate claim based on Merck\u2019s decision to terminate Ward\u2019s employment as a form of retaliation for refusal to take the fitness-for-duty examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-19\">Issue Number 4: Does the FMLA prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to undergo a medical examination where the employer has no reasonable belief that an employee\u2019s ongoing limitations may interfere with his ability to work?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-20\">In support of Issues Number 2 and Number 4, Ward cites to selected portions of the deposition testimony of Merck\u2019s employees, and contends, at a minimum, the cited testimony undercuts the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-21\">Specifically, Ward alleges or points to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-22\">(1) The deposition testimony of Dr. Cohen that Ward continued to perform the duties of his position. (R.R. A-501)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>(2) Michael Washabaugh gave testimony to the effect that there was no consideration given to requiring Ward to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination when he returned to work from his medical leave in February. (R.R. A-411 to A-412)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">(3) According to Merck\u2019s employee, Kathy Korsen, Dr. Washabaugh did not believe that any physical or mental condition was potentially restricting Ward in the functions of his job. (R.R. A-584)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-17\">(4) Dr. Nigro did not believe that the information supplied sufficiently documented the need for a fitness-for-duty examination. (R.R. A-590)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-18\">(5) Dr. Washabaugh directed Ward to submit to a fitness-for-duty examination, but did not inform Ward that performance deficiencies were placing his job at risk at the time he requested Ward to undergo the examination. (R.R. A-420)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-19\">(6) Furthermore, Dr. Washabaugh did not believe Ward was either physically or mentally restricted in performing his job. (R.R. A-421 to A-422)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(7) There were never any complaints that Ward engaged in any threatening behavior. (R.R. A-532 to A-533)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">(8) Dr. Cohen did not have any input into the decision to require Ward to undergo a fitness for duty examination. (R.R. A-538)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-19\">B. Merck\u2019s Appellate Response</p>\n<p id=\"b161-20\">1. The job-relatedness of the required fitness-for-duty evaluation was not an issue before the district court</p>\n<p id=\"b161-21\">Merck points to the fact that Ward made no such argument in his response to Merck\u2019s motion for summary judgment or in his motion for partial summary judgment, citing A-0679-91<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and A-0720-47. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Additionally, Merck disputes the citations to the record by Ward in support of his argument that the order to take a fitness-for-duty test was not job related.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">2. The ADA does not demand that an employer exhaust disciplinary options prior to requiring a fitness-for-duty evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Title 42, United States Code, \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A) only requires that a medical evaluation (fitness-for-duty) examination be job related and consistent with business necessity. The evidence advanced by Merck indicated that Ward was aware that his supervisors had concerns about his workplace behavior and performance prior to Merck\u2019s order that Ward submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">3. The observations of Ward\u2019s workplace behavior and performance were sufficient to cause a reasonable person to doubt plaintiffs ability to perform his job and supported Merck\u2019s decision to require Ward to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The record evidence of the information supplied to Merck in support of its decision to require Ward to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation is undisputed. That evidence included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\">(1) Ward\u2019s level of performance was at the absolute minimum<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">(2) Ward\u2019s \u201cproductivity has dropped to near zero \u2014 he is not performing or communicating at even a minimal level\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-16\">(3) Ward \u201cis not participating as a member of the lab or greater group\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-17\">(4) Ward \u201cseems to be resistant to advice, counseling, mentoring, or guidance \u2014 any and all forms of interaction\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-18\">(5) Ward is easy to anger, even during casual conversation, and \u201chis current behavior is disturbing and uncomfortable to be around\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-19\">(6) \u201cA face-to face conversation with Ward is now practically impossible; he will not initiate the conversation, even it is \u2018expected\u2019 of him\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-20\">(7) Ward \u201cwill talk only if asked and most of the time his comments will be terse and repetitive (like \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018yes\u2019) inappropriate to the situation and leaving you with the clear feeling that no connection was made\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-21\">(8) Ward \u201cappears deliberately slow, almost catatonic ... this behavior borders on frightening\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>4. Merck did not make \u201cdispositive admissions\u201d (as claimed by Ward in his appellate brief) that disputed the business necessity requiring Ward to submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">a. Did Dr. Washabaugh, as claimed by Ward (citing A-584), admit that he did not believe that any physical or mental condition was potentially restricting Ward in the functions of his job?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We find that the citation to the appendix is to the deposition of Merck employee, K. Korsen. The short answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">b. Did Dr. Cohen, as claimed by Ward (citing A-501), acknowledge that Ward continued to perform the duties of his position?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">During his deposition Dr. Cohen testified at length as to Ward\u2019s poor performance and his strange behavior, which Cohen described as catatonic in a general sense (A-500). Ward relies on the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">Q: How was his work doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">* * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">A: Very, very \u2014 you know, just barely doing what he needed to do. I mean he was still doing experimental work, you know. I found it quite amazing actually that somebody could still be performing, you know, mechanically, but so incredibly disengaged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">Q: Was he still \u2014 was he still \u2014 was his output still at the same level as it had been all along?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-16\">A: At the very bottom of that \u2014 you know, if I were to draw a scale it was just absolute minimal, yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-17\">(A-501-502). Cohen\u2019s deposition continued with examples of the poor and undependable employment performance of Ward in his role as a chemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-18\">Ward\u2019s claim that he continued to perform his duties in a manner that preempted Merck\u2019s demand that he take the fitness-for-duty evaluation ignores the reality of the nature of the complaints about not only Ward\u2019s work performance, but also his strange behavior among his fellow employees. The record is undisputed that Merck\u2019s supervisory employees had a concern about the safety of their other employees, given the unusual behavior of Ward, and this perceived safety concern was, standing alone, sufficient to establish the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d element of the ADA\u2019s standard for post-employment medical examinations. <em>See Conroy v. New York State Dept. of Correctional Services, </em>333 F.3d 88, 98 (2d Cir.2003)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (endorsing, <em>Cripe v. City of San Jose, </em>261 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>c. As claimed by Ward (citing A-421-422), Dr. Washabaugh did not believe that Ward was either physically or mentally restricted in performing his job when Ward was directed to take the fitness-for-duty test.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The testimony of Dr. Washabaugh at the cited pages follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">Q. Was physically an issue in your mind at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Q. Okay. What duties of his job were you concerned that Gary was not mentally capable of doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">A. My observation was that Gary was not doing his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">Q. Okay. Well, did you have a concern that \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">A. I continued asking him for explanations. We approached the low performance, tried to engage him in discussions about what was concerning him or what was causing him to underperform. We had zero response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">A. So it wasn\u2019t my place to <em>judge whether it was physical or mental capacity. </em>It was just incapability. He wasn\u2019t doing it. So I didn\u2019t know whether it was willingness or capability. Something was not engaged. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">Q. Did you have any belief that Mr. Ward was mentally incapable of doing his job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-14\">A. No. It was clearly this decision part of was fit capability, willingness or both ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">We find the claim advanced by Ward as to belief of Dr. Washabaugh unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">In sum, we reject the claim that the alleged deposition admissions by Merck witnesses disputed the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d for the fitness-for-duty evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">V. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">A. The Applicable Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">The standard of review in an appeal from an order resolving cross-motions for summary judgment is plenary or <em>de novo. Gordon v. Lewistown Hospital, </em>423 F.3d 184, 207 (3d Cir.2005). The issue on appellate review is whether, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), there is a genuine issue of any material fact that defeats the moving party\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The immediate focus in this case is whether there remains an issue as to a material fact on Merck\u2019s claim of a business necessity for its demand that Ward submit to a fitness-for-duty evaluation. Against that background, it is beyond dispute that the ADA allows an employer to require medical examinations of its employees when \u201csuch examination' or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\"><em>Conroy </em>teaches that, for the employer to justify the fitness-for-duty evaluation, it \u201cmust show that the asserted \u2018business necessity\u2019 is vital to business. For example, business necessities may include ensuring that the workplace is safe and secure or cutting down on egregious absenteeism.\u201d 333 F.3d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">The district court found more than sufficient evidence to justify Merck\u2019s medical inquiry. The appellate issue is whether, after a <em>de novo </em>study applying Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c), and reviewing the submissions in support and in opposition to the competing motions, there is a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of a business necessity to require the medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>In an attempt to establish a genuine issue as to Merck\u2019s claim of a business necessity, Ward has directed this court\u2019s attention to selected portions of the deposition testimony of Merck\u2019s employees, Cohen, Washabaugh, Nigro and Korsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We have already addressed and rejected Ward\u2019s proposition that the deposition testimony established a genuine and material issue requiring a jury trial as to Merck\u2019s claim of a business necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">B. The Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Merck had the burden of going forward in support of its claim of a business necessity for the fitness-for-duty test of Ward. We find, as did the district court, that Merck met its burden. Ward failed to produce any competent evidence disputing Merck\u2019s claim that, under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4), it had a business necessity justifying the fitness-for-duty evaluation. Ward\u2019s additional claim that he has a standalone cause of retaliation based on his refusal to take the fitness-for-duty test is totally devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">VI. The Challenged Grant of the <em>In Limine </em>Motion Regarding Ward\u2019s Treatment During his FMLA Leave</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The district court, apparently in the belief that a reviewing court might reverse the grant of summary judgment, also issued a ruling on Ward\u2019s claim that he was entitled to the granting of his motion <em>in limine </em>that was designed to prohibit Merck from introducing at trial testimony with respect to Ward\u2019s treatment while he was on an earlier sick leave. Given our ruling on summary judgment, it is unlikely that there will be a trial. However, after examining the district court\u2019s ruling on Ward\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion, we are of the view that his ruling, an evidentiary ruling, was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The judgment of the district court will be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-14\">. Ward\u2019s appellate brief describes the background for the resignation as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-26\">On October 23, 2002, after experiencing trouble sleeping for about a week because of \"problems at work,\u201d Mr. Ward visited the emergency room at Doylestown Hospital R.R.

Mr. Ward further reported \u201cthat his computer [at work was] being monitored and that he [was] being harassed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and ultimately advised to seek out-patient treatment for that condition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">On or about October 29, 2002, plaintiff visited Jonathan Beck, D.C., his primary care physician, and complained of \"feeling anxious, and tense\u201d over the past three weeks in relation to an \u201cincident at work,\u201d on which he \"didn\u2019t want to elucidate\u201d R.R.

Merck\u2019s medical file does not contain any information regarding either the Doylestown Hospital visit nor treatment by Dr. Beck. R.R. A-274 to A-323.
