The Chavezes allege intentional tort and negligence claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) and <em>Bivens </em>actions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the agents based on alleged Fourth Amendment violations. The Chavezes also seek injunctive and declaratory relief against the government\u2019s practice of using roving highway patrols to execute investigatory stops in search of illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">The district court dismissed all of the Chavezes\u2019 personal injury FTCA claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court additionally dismissed the Chavezes\u2019 First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment Bivens claims, and their claim for equitable relief, holding that the Chavezes failed to allege sufficiently cognizable claims. Of the remaining claims for negligence resulting in property damage, two were dismissed and the third \u2014 regarding an August 5, 2000 collision \u2014 was decided in the Chavezes\u2019 favor at trial. The Chavezes now appeal the dismissal of four of their five personal injury FTCA claims, their Fourth Amendment claim, and their claim for equitable relief. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>I. FTCA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">First, the Chavezes assert claims under the FTCA for assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the Chavezes failed to provide the government with sufficient administrative notice of the claims and damages alleged. Notice must include \u201c(1) a written statement sufficiently describing the injury to enable the agency to begin its own investigation, and (2) a sum certain damages claim.\u201d <em>Warren v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior Bureau of Land Mgmt., </em>724 F.2d 776, 780 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc). The Chavezes fell far short of describing the claims in a sufficient manner. Therefore, the district court was correct to dismiss the FTCA claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">II. Fourth Amendment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The Chavezes also bring <em>Bivens </em>claims, alleging the defendants\u2019 actions violated their Fourth Amendment rights. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the district court dismissed all the <em>Bivens </em>claims. However, federal courts may not dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) unless \u201cit is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>584 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to plead their claims sufficiently, the Chavezes must only provide \u201ca short and plain statement\u201d of the claims showing that they are entitled to relief, Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2); <em>see also Swierkiewicz, </em>534 U.S. at 512, 122 S.Ct. 992 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)), and giving the defendants fair notice of what their claims are and the grounds upon which they rest. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The Chavezes allege claims against, inter alia, Agents Guajardo, Sisto, Ayala, and Sandoval, by listing them as defendants, along with several other agents, in Paragraph 17 of the complaint. In Paragraph 18, the Chavezes allege that all of the defendants \u201cacted under color of Federal law and engaged in Federal action during all acts alleged hereafter and were at all times relevant hereto acting within the scope of their office or employment.\u201d Other than in these two general introductory paragraphs, Agents Guajardo, Sisto, Ayala, and Sandoval are never mentioned in the complaint, nor are any specific factual allegations made regarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Similarly, the Chavezes also allege that another defendant, Agent Gale, transported Mr. Chavez to Three Points, Arizona and left him there following Agent Hunt\u2019s investigatory stop and seizure of the shuttle. The complaint does not allege, however, that Gale violated Mr. Chavez\u2019s rights, nor does it provide any details regarding Gale\u2019s involvement. Additionally, the Chavezes allege that Agent Benzenhoefer, a border patrol supervisor, laughed when the Chavezes reported to him that another agent had asked Mrs. Chavez why she did not speak English well. The Chavezes do not allege that Benzenhoefer\u2019s actions amounted to a constitutional violation, nor do they allege any facts from which a violation can be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>In sum, the complaint does not give sufficient notice to Agents Blancas, Guajardo, Sisto, Ayala, Gale, Sandoval, and Benzenhoefer regarding the claims asserted against them, and the district court was correct in dismissing those claims. Moreover, we also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against Agent James. The Chavezes concede on appeal that, because they obtained an FTCA award regarding the August 5, 2000 collision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2676<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> bars a <em>Bivens </em>action based on the collision. Accordingly, James was also properly dismissed from the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">We disagree, however, with the district court\u2019s finding that the Chavezes have failed to satisfy the notice pleading requirement with respect to the remaining defendants. First, the Chavezes bring claims against Agents Rios, Demek, and Scharnweber. Unlike the vague and conclusory allegations regarding the eight defendants discussed <em>supra, </em>the complaint alleges that Rios, Demek, and Scharnweber each stopped the shuttle on a specific occasion. Those allegations, coupled with the allegation that \u201c[individual Defendants[\u2019] stops, detentions, and intrusive searches of Plaintiffs\u2019 shuttle lacked consent, probable cause, and reasonable suspicion, and warrants,\u201d are sufficient to provide notice of the claims against Agents Rios, Demek, and Scharnweber.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Second, the Chavezes assert claims against Agents Hunt, Obregon, Chavez, Ziglar, Aguilar, and Campbell, alleging that they violated the Chavezes\u2019 constitutional rights in their role as supervisors. \u201c[A] supervisor is liable for the constitutional violations of subordinates if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or knew of the violations and failed to act to prevent them.\u201d <em>Hydrick v. Hunter, </em>466 F.3d 676, 689 (9th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint adequately alleges the personal involvement of the supervisors in the unconstitutional patrols. Specifically, it alleges that the defendants \u201cpersonally reviewed and, thus, knowingly ordered, directed, sanctioned or permitted the roving patrol[s].\u201d The complaint also alleges that the unconstitutional patrols were exacerbated by a lack of reporting requirements, and that the Chavezes complained to Hunt, Obregon, Chavez, and Campbell about the allegedly unlawful stops. Furthermore, the complaint alleges that Aguilar knew of the roving patrols and deliberately sanctioned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">An unconstitutional policy and practice can be inferred from the complaint\u2019s description of directed and repeated roving patrols, the allegation that the supervisors sanctioned them, and the allegation that the agents had supervisory authority. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the claims against Agents Hunt, Obregon, Chavez, Campbell, Ziglar and Aguilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">III. Claims for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The Chavezes also seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed these claims on the ground that the complaint failed to allege sufficiently that the defendants\u2019 conduct was both likely to recur and in violation of the Chavezes\u2019 constitutional rights. <em>See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>(holding that to allege sufficiently a claim for equitable relief, a \u201cplaintiff must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must be both real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). We disagree with the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The Chavezes allege that \u201cthe roving patrol operations in issue involve systemic violations of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d that the operations are ongoing, and that they \u201care entitled to a declaratory judgment determining that the roving patrol detentions ... which are not based on suspicions particularized to the specific shuttle trip [are violations] of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d They also assert that they are entitled to a judgment \u201cdirecting [Defendants] to prescribe and implement measures sufficient to prevent continuation or resumption\u201d of all border patrol practices that do not adhere to \u201cCircuit determinations of Fourth Amendment dictates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Because we find that the complaint adequately alleges a constitutional violation against some of the defendants, see Section II, <em>supra, </em>and the gravamen of the complaint is an allegation that the roving patrols have caused injury on numerous occasions and will continue to do so, the Chavezes sufficiently allege \u201ca likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury.\u201d <em>Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, </em>199 F.3d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>see also Nicacio v. INS, </em>797 F.2d 700, 702 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe possibility of recurring injury ceases to be speculative when actual repeated incidents are documented.\u201d). Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the claims for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Finally, because the district court erred in dismissing under Rule 12(b)(6) the <em>Bivens </em>claims against some of the defendants and the equitable claims, the district court\u2019s decision to deny the Chavezes\u2019 Rule 56(f) motion and the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion as moot was also erroneous. Accordingly, we remand this case so the district court can properly address these motions. Each party shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
