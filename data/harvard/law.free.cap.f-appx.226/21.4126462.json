May 4, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 927 849 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 29, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-21\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum, v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review an IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance, \u201cunder a highly deferential standard of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sanusi v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 193, 200 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Chen\u2019s requested continuance where Chen was, after a lengthy delay in her hearing, afforded 30 additional days to submit her documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the BIA did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>abuse its discretion by not reviewing the evidence Chen submitted for the first time on appeal. With limited exceptions not present here, the BIA is expressly prohibited from engaging in such independent fact-finding. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1003.3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 158-60 (2d Cir.2006) (agreeing with this principle, but avoiding remand, in spite of deficiencies in an adverse credibility determination, because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the decision were the case remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Here, the IJ reasonably relied on the articles from the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board government in finding that although serious criminals may be mistreated in prison, the torture of illegal emigrants in China was unlikely. The reports indicated that detained persons who had illegally emigrated from China were not held for long periods of time or mistreated in detention. In addition, one report indicated that only \u201cthose illegal emigrants \u2018who bring disgrace to the nation\u2019 \u201d are sentenced to prison terms. The other report indicated that although a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Oxford indicated that \u201charassment by snakeheads is not infrequent,\u201d the coordinator for the Asian Organized Crime Unit at the Canadian Criminal Intelligence Service indicated that he was unaware \u201cof reports of loan sharks pursuing returnees or their families, and also reported that less than 10 per cent of illegal emigrants used loan sharks to finance their transactions with the snakeheads.\u201d We find that this information constitutes substantial evidence which supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Chen failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing a probability of torture in China, either by the government or by loan sharks. As we have noted, being \u201cpart of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China____[is not] sufficient to secure relief under the CAT\u201d. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 160 (2d Cir.2005). Instead, the law requires \u201cmore particularized evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral arguments in this case is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-22\">. We note that Chen's attorney conceded at her hearing that it normally takes only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>week to obtain the kinds of documents for which the continuance was sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
