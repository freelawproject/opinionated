Mr. Smith also seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Mr. Smith raises six contentions: (1) violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when the prosecution engaged in racial discrimination in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), when it struck minorities from the jury; (2) ineffective assistance of trial counsel pursuant to <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), for failure to (a) prepare for trial, (b) investigate the case, (c) cross-examine certain witnesses, (d) object to pre-trial photographic identification, and (e) object to certain evidence; (3) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for her failure to raise ineffectiveness of trial counsel for his failure to (a) challenge the lawfulness of Mr. Smith\u2019s arrest and (b) properly preserve the appellate record and also for (c) failure to develop the record for direct review; (4) denial of due process because of a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d created by the \u201cscandalous personal relationship\u201d between then Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) Judge Steven Lile and Comanche County District Attorney Robert Schulte; Rec. doc. 1, at 10, (5) insufficiency of the evidence and factual innocence; and (6) violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights based on cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">A District Court of Comanche County jury convicted Mr. Smith of first-degree felony murder, for which Mr. Smith is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed his conviction on direct appeal and denied his application for post-conviction relief. He then filed this \u00a7 2254 action. The magistrate judge, in a thorough and well-reasoned report and recommendation, recommended that the district court deny the petition. The district court reviewed and rejected Mr. Smith\u2019s objections to the report and recommendation, adopted the report and recommendation, and denied Mr. Smith\u2019s application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Smith must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to do so, Mr. Smith \u201cmust show that reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>336, 123 S.Ct. 1029,154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that [the] petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Here, for substantially the same reasons as those set forth in the district court\u2019s order and the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough report and recommendation, we conclude that Mr. Smith is not entitled to a COA. First, the OCCA concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Mr. Smith did not meet his burden of establishing purposeful discrimination. The OCCA\u2019s conclusion was not contrary to or an unreasonable determination of federal law, nor did it involve an unreasonable determination of the facts in the case. Second and third, we agree with the OCCA\u2019s conclusions that Mr. Smith\u2019s claims for ineffectiveness of trial and appellate counsel did not satisfy the well-established <em>Strickland </em>standard. Thus, the OCCA\u2019s rejection of those claims was not an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Fourth, we agree with the OCCA\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Smith has not established a conflict of interest between Judge Lile and the prosecutor. The OCCA\u2019s determination was also not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Fifth, the OCCA, applying <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), held that there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict. The victim was shot with a .38 caliber hand gun, which wielded a hydro-shock hollow point bullet. The authorities retrieved such a firearm, loaded with the same type of bullets, from Mr. Smith\u2019s room. The victim, who ran a convenience store had $3,000 stored in a can behind the counter on the day of her murder. Officers found the same can, empty, on the counter after her death. Mr. Smith was seen with a large amount of cash shortly after the murder. He attempted to buy a car, and spent $400 on jewelry. When officers arrested Mr. Smith two days after the murder, he had $813 in cash. The State also presented testimony that Mr. Smith was seen running across the road minutes after the murder occurred. In addition, Mr. Smith provided conflicting stories to law enforcement officials regarding his whereabouts at the time of the murder. This evidence demonstrates that the OCCA\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Finally, the OCCA\u2019s rejection of Mr. Smith\u2019s sixth claim based on cumulative error, was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. There can be no cumulative error analysis, because this analysis \u201cdoes not apply to the cumulative effect of non-errors.\u201d <em>Moore v. Reynolds, </em>153 F.3d 1086, 1113 (10th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Based on our review of the record, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order, and Mr. Smith\u2019s submissions to this court, we are not persuaded jurists of reason would disagree with the district court\u2019s disposition of his petition. Accordingly, we DENY his request for a COA, DENY his motion to proceed IFP, and DISMISS the matter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
