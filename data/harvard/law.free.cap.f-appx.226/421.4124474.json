Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), and its progeny, which have outlined this court\u2019s methodology for reviewing sentences for reasonableness. Torres also preserves for further review his contention that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry guideline is unduly severe. Torres concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006), which held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not give sentencing courts the discretion to impose a non-Guideline sentence based on the courts\u2019 disagreement with Congressional and Sentencing Commission policy.\u201d Finally, Torres raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
