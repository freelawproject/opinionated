We will vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">Xi, a citizen of Pennsylvania, filed in the District Court a breach of contract action against SCOF USA, Inc., and three of its \u201cshareholders\u201d: Shengchun Lu, president and chief operating officer; Chen Yi Yang, assistant president; and Li Xiao Li, public affairs director. The action arose out of an agreement in which Xi was given a partial ownership interest in SCOF USA, Inc. in return for contributing capital used to purchase liquor from China. Lu, Yang, and Li, co-signers of the agreement, represented the \u201cinterest of SCOF USA as a whole.\u201d Xi alleged that SCOF USA, Inc. was a New York corporation, that Lu and Yang were citizens of New York, and that Li was a Pennsylvania citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">The District Court sua sponte dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that complete diversity of the parties was lacking because both Xi and Li were citizens of Pennsylvania. <em>See Xi v. Lu, </em>428 F.Supp.2d 339, 341 (E.D.Pa.2006). Concluding that Li was an indispensable party, the District Court declined to drop her from the case to preserve jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at n. 3. Xi filed a timely motion for reconsideration, arguing that Li was not indispensable and that her absence would not leave the other parties subject to inconsistent obligations. The District Court denied the motion. Xi appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">In order to have subject matter jurisdiction, a District Court must be able to exercise either diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331-1332. Because Xi\u2019s complaint does not arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, he may proceed in District Court only if he proves facts by which diversity jurisdiction could be sustained. <em>See Quaker State Dyeing and Finishing Co. v. ITT Terryphone Corp., </em>461 F.2d 1140, 1142-43 (3d Gir.1972). Diversity jurisdiction exists if \u201cthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between ... citizens of different States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). To establish federal subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship, diversity must be complete; that is, no plaintiff can be a citizen of the same state as any of the defendants. <em>Mid</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>lantic Nat\u2019l Bank v. Hansen, </em>48 F.3d 693, 696 (3d Cir.1995). Xi\u2019s complaint states that both he and Li are citizens of Pennsylvania. Thus, we agree that Li\u2019s presence in the suit destroyed diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The District Court considered whether to preserve jurisdiction by removing Li from the case. \u201cParties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 21. Under Rule 21, District Courts have the authority to retain jurisdiction by dropping a non-diverse party, provided that the party is not indispensable to the suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. <em>See Newman-Green Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, </em>490 U.S. 826, 832, 109 S.Ct. 2218, 104 L.Ed.2d 893 (1989). Parties are indispensable if \u201c \u2018in the circumstances of the case [they] must be before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steel Valley Authority v. Union Switch and Signal Division, </em>809 F.2d 1006, 1011 (3d Cir.1987) (quoting 3A J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 19.02). In other words, indispensable parties are \u201c \u2018[p]ersons who not only have an interest in the controversy, but an interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shields v. Barrow, 58 U.S. </em>(17 How.) 130,139,15 L.Ed. 158 (1854)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The District Court found that Li could not be dismissed because she was indispensable to the case. In support of this conclusion, the District Court noted that Li co-signed the contract, that she agreed to refund Xi\u2019s money if the contract went unfilled, and that the other defendants would be subject to the risk of incurring inconsistent obligations in her absence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. These factors, however, are insufficient to support a finding of indispensability; indeed, the District Court\u2019s analysis omits several essential considerations, and does not provide us with a sufficient basis upon which to perform adequate appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The mere fact that Li signed the contract and agreed to refund Xi\u2019s money does not, by itself, make Li an indispensable party. Furthermore, contrary to the District Court\u2019s suggestion, the possibility that the diverse defendants may bear the whole loss if found liable is not the type of \u201cinconsistent obligation\u201d contemplated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. <em>See Janney Montgomery Scott, Inc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc., </em>11 F.3d 399, 412 (3d Cir. 1993). The District Court also failed to discuss whether the agreement between the parties is controlled by the law of Pennsylvania or New York, how the agreement should be characterized under that state\u2019s law (i.e., as contract for goods related to liquor sales, as a joint venture, or as a partnership agreement), and, perhaps most significantly, whether such an agreement provides for joint and several liability. <em>See id. </em>at 406 (declaring that \u201cif the Agreement in question can be construed or interpreted as a contract imposing joint and several liability on its co-obligors, ... complete relief may be granted in a suit against one of them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The determination of whether a party is indispensable is governed by pragmatic and equitable considerations. <em>See AT&amp;T Communications v. BellSouth Telecommunications Inc., </em>238 F.3d 636, 658 (5th Cir.2001). The District Court, however, did not address why, in \u201cequity and good conscience,\u201d the case could not proceed in Li\u2019s absence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b). In fact, the District Court made no reference to the factors listed in Rule 19(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>for determining whether a party is indispensable. Those factors are: (1) to what extent will a judgment rendered in the party\u2019s absence be prejudicial to the party or to those who remain; (2) to what extent will protective measures in the judgment ameliorate or avoid any such prejudice; (3) to what extent will a judgment rendered in the party\u2019s absence be adequate; and (4) to what extent will the plaintiff have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed due to the absence of the party. <em>See </em>Rule 19(b); <em>see also HB General Corp. v. Manchester Partners, L.P., </em>95 F.3d 1185, 1191 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In sum, because the District Court failed to make the findings necessary for meaningful appellate review, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand the matter for a redetermination concerning whether Li is an indispensable party and for any further action as may be appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
