Handono argues that the IJ erred in not granting him asylum or withholding of removal because he suffered past persecution in Indonesia and has a well-founded fear of future persecution if he returns. We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Handono recites a number of incidents that occurred in Indonesia many years ago which suggest hostility at least then on the part of the majority Muslim population against the minority of ethnic Chinese Christians. Handono testified that Muslim students made insulting remarks about his religious beliefs when he was in elementary school, causing him to transfer to a Catholic high school. At age 11, in 1994, native Indonesian children broke his arm and stole his bicycle. Handono received substandard care at the hospital after the doctor examined native Indonesian patients before treating his arm. Later, native Indonesians looted his parents\u2019 business, assaulted his father, and threw stones at his parents\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Where, as here, the BIA adopts the opinion of the IJ, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002). Our standard of review is extremely deferential; we must uphold the IJ\u2019s findings if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we may not reject them \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Under this standard, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Handono did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Handono has made no allegation of government-sponsored persecution, and no evidence exists of a pattern or practice of persecution at this time against individuals of Chinese descent in Indonesia. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537-38 (3d Cir. 2005). Furthermore, the State Department has reported that the Indonesian \u201cConstitution provides for freedom of religion for members of officially recognized religions [including Christianity] ... and the Government generally respects this right in practice....\u201d United States Department of State, <em>International Religious Freedom Report </em>(2001). The reasonableness of Handono\u2019s fear of persecution is further undercut by the fact that he chose to remain in Indonesia until June 2001, despite receiving a visa and passport to the United States in November 2000. Without a closer nexus between Handono\u2019s ethnicity and/or religion and the long-ago incidents of insult, assault, and theft that Handono describes, such discrimination does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (refugee status turns on a showing of past persecution suffered on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion or a well-founded fear of such future persecution); <em>Berishaj v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 314, 323 (3d Cir.2004) (a showing of past persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>must include proof that \u201cthe government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control\u201d perpetrated the harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
