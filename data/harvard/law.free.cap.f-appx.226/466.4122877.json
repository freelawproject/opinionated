Henderson, Postmaster General, in this employment discrimination action filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343 and 2201; Title VII of the the Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et. seq.; </em>the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791, <em>et seq.; </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et. seq. </em>For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">Lee, an African-American woman, was employed by the U.S. Postal Service in Louisville, Kentucky on September 1, 1984, \u201cas a casual employee,\u201d (J.A. 188), and later \u201cconverted to a career status,\u201d <em>id., </em>as a Flat Sorter Machine Operator (\u201cFSMO\u201d). This position essentially involves three functions: loading mail into a machine; keying in address codes; and sweeping or unloading mail. The machine is operated by a crew of employees who rotated among the three different tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">Since approximately 1987, Lee suffered from back problems associated with \u201cdegenerative disk disease.\u201d (J.A. 194) She had back surgery in 1988, and \u201csubsequently filed a [workers\u2019 compensation claim] alleging that her employment had adversely affected her back. The claim was denied.\u201d (J.A. 194) \u201cIn 1991, Lee filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim which was accepted by the Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Programs, for an ankle sprain.\u201d (J.A. 13) In 1992, Lee sustained a work-related injury to her back. She filed a new workers\u2019 compensation claim for this injury, which was accepted by the Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Programs, on July 20, 1992. On October 12, 1993, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>claim was closed. However, before the 1992 workers\u2019 compensation claim was closed, Lee filed a new claim based on an injury she sustained in January 1993. Lee\u2019s 1993 workers\u2019 compensation claim was denied on February 8,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Defendant provides \u201climited-duty\u201d positions to employees with work-related injuries, while \u201clight-duty\u201d positions are provided to employees with injuries that are not work-related. (J.A. 80) Because she reported a work-related injury, Defendant was required to offer Lee a \u201ctemporary limited-duty assignment,\u201d (J.A. 72), under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement which governed Lee\u2019s employment. Lee was offered a temporary limited-duty assignment with specified restrictions on lifting and carrying limited to fifteen pounds, no prolonged bending, and no prolonged twisting. The type of work which Lee performed during her temporary limited-duty assignment is unclear. Initially, her position appears to have involved \u201ccasing regular mail in a manual case.\u201d (J.A. 73) The record indicates that \u201csome of the work [Lee performed], such as [her] tenure on the label machine, was simply an attempt to find something for her to do[,] while at other times, such as when she worked as a manual sorter, she may actually have been filling a position.\u201d (J.A. 214) Indeed, \u201cthere is insufficient information in the record to establish that [Lee] had been performing the essential functions of \u25a0 a position or a number of positions between mid 1991 and early 1995; instead of doing whatever work Management may have cobbled together to keep her busy.\u201d (J.A. 214) Regardless of the nature of her work, it is clear that Lee held a limited-duty assignment, and did not work as a FSMO, from 1992 to March 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Since Lee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims were all resolved by February 8, 1995, she no longer qualified for her limited-duty assignment. On March 7, 1995, and March 16, 1995, Lee submitted requests for \u201ctemporary light duty assignment\u201d based on her non-work-related back problems. (J.A. 83; 141-45) Defendant offered Lee a temporary light-duty assignment, in accordance with the restrictions specified by her physician. The supervisor who authorized her request wrote on the request form that: \u201cThis is Temporary <em>Light </em>Duty; not Permanent Limited Duty.\u201d (J.A. 141) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In March 1995, Lee also discussed employment options with Defendant\u2019s personnel office. The personnel office found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apr\">[g]iven her permanent medical restrictions, it did not appear possible for her to perform the essential functions of most jobs for which she might be qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation. It appeared that she might be able to perform a MUM (Misadressed/Unaddressed Mail) or CFS Clerk job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">(J.A. 178) However, \u201cto qualify for either of these jobs, she needed to pass a typing test----[and] even if she did qualify, she would not be able to get a job unless she was the senior qualified bidder,\u201d (J.A. 178), under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Lee did not qualify or bid for these positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Lee started training for the MUM clerk position, but ceased training because she was allegedly informed that the position had a lifting requirement which could not be waived. Defendant concedes that the \u201clifting requirement for the MUM or CFS clerk job [ ] exceeds [ ] Lee\u2019s restriction of 15 lbs.\u201d (J.A. 178) However, Defendant argues that it \u201ccould accommodate [Lee] in this regard, which is why [personnel] encouraged her to bid for such a position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant maintains that \u201cif [Lee] was the senior qualified bidder, accommoda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tions would be considered at that time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In August 1995, Linda Ann Altic, (\u201cAl-tic\u201d), one <em>of Lee\u2019s </em>supervisors, \u201cdid not feel [Lee\u2019s] light duty restrictions and her light duty assignment, were well matched.\u201d (J.A. 226) Lee continuously \u201creport[ed] to work late,\u201d (J.A. 227); \u201cwas not productive,\u201d (J.A. 228); and was visibly \u201cin pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHer attitude was one of wanting to do the job, but she was not able to do the job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of her work performance and physical condition, \u201cthe decision was made to put her in for [a] Fitness For Duty\u201d examination. <em>Id. </em>On August 24, 1995, Altic requested that Lee be scheduled for \u201ca Fitness for Duty physical\u201d examination noting that \u201cLee\u2019s statement for temporary light duty stated that her disability is permanent,\u201d and \u201c[s]he is unable to perform the duties of her bid position.\u201d (J.A. 188)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Altic affirms that the \u201cmain reason for putting [Lee] in for the fitness for duty was that she was a hazard to herself as well as to the Postal Service,\u201d (J.A. 230), based on \u201cthe fact, [that] she was falling [sic] asleep and sometimes in a dazed condition, and I would often find her with her feet up on the ledge of the case. And safety procedures on the workfloor are that you always have one foot on the floor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Altic] felt [she] had a responsibility to the Postal Service to report this unsafe practice, as well as a responsibility to [Lee] to see that she was not put in a position where she was likely to sustain an injury.\u201d (J.A. 231) Altic asserts that the \u201cgoal of the fitness for duty was to get a better alignment of her capabilities under her medical restrictions to her actual assigned [sic] job duties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Lee\u2019s fitness-for-duty physical examination was scheduled for September 22,1995. (J.A. 160) The examination results revealed that she had lifting and carrying limitations and that \u201cshe [was] not medically fit to perform all the essential functions of her [ ] position.\u201d (J.A. 185) The physician who conducted the examination noted that \u201c[t]he severity of [Lee\u2019s lifting and carrying] restrictions are very arbitrary but do restrict her from normal functions of\u2019 her position. (J.A. 186) In light of the examination results, Lee met again with personnel in September 1995. \u201cTwo union representatives accompanied her at the meeting.\u201d (J.A. 97-98; 178) \u201cIt again appeared that the MUM or CFS clerk jobs were the best options for her. At that time, however, she still had not passed the typing test to qualify for those jobs. In addition, [personnel] was not aware of any vacancies in those positions.\u201d (J.A. 178) Lee did not qualify or bid for any position.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">On October 6, 1995, Lee requested a permanent light-duty position. On October 23, 1995, she was informed that \u201c[t]here are no permanent light duty positions in the Louisville Plant.\u201d (J.A. 147) Although the record is unclear, it appears that Lee renewed her request to be assigned to a permanent light-duty position several times. Lee\u2019s additional requests appear to have been similarly denied. On November 16, 1995, Defendant sent Lee \u201ca letter giving [her] information on disability retirement.\u201d (J.A. 189)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">On January 22, 1996, Lee received a notice of removal which \u201ccharged [her] with being medically restricted from safely performing the essential duties of a Flat Sorter Operator.\u201d (J.A. 188-91) Lee challenged her termination through the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in her collective bargaining agreement. She was represented by her union at a hearing held on October 10, 1996. On November 18, 1996, an arbitrator denied the grievance finding that Defendant properly removed Lee. The arbitrator found that \u201c[t]he overriding conclusion from all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>medical evidence in the record is that there was no position for which [Lee] could meet the essential qualifications even with reasonable accommodation. Because there was not, [Defendant] had a right to discharge her.\u201d (J.A. 217) After her removal, Lee applied for disability retirement and her application was approved on October 16,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">On April 25, 2002, Lee filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343 and 2201; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et. seq.; </em>the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791, <em>et seq.; </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et. seq., </em>alleging employment discrimination and wrongful termination on the basis of race, age, sex and disability against Defendant. On January 29, 2004, as a result of Lee\u2019s death and Thompson\u2019s appointment as administratrix of Lee\u2019s estate, Plaintiffs counsel filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. On February 13, 2004, the district court granted counsel\u2019s motion, and an amended complaint was filed on February 20, 2004. On August 1, 2005, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(b) and (c). The district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion on March 21, 2006. On April 13, 2006, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to this Court. It is important to note that Plaintiffs brief to this Court addresses only her disability and racial discrimination claims. Thus, Plaintiff appears to have abandoned the sex and age discrimination claims which were raised in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Dickerson v. McClellan, </em>101 F.3d 1151, 1157 (6th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cA fact is material and precludes grant of summary judgment if proof of that fact would have effect of establishing or refuting one of essential elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties, and would necessarily affect application of appropriate principle of law to the rights and obligations of the parties.\u201d <em>Kendall v. Hoover Co., </em>751 F.2d 171, 174 (6th Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 332-33, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If Defendant carries its burden of showing that there is an absence of evidence to support a claim, <em>id. </em>at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, plaintiff must come forward with \u201cspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,\u201d <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 270, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Ashbrook v. Block, </em>917 F.2d 918, 921 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">II. Plaintiffs Disability Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">A. The Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791-96, by failing to reasonably accommodate Lee\u2019s alleged disability. \u201cAl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>though the Rehabilitation Act predates the Americans with Disabilities Act [], 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>analyses of claims made under the two acts run roughly parallel.\u201d <em>Mahon v. Crowell, </em>295 F.3d 585, 588-89 (6th Cir.2002). \u201c[B]y statute, the Americans with Disabilities Act standards apply in Rehabilitation Act cases alleging employment discrimination.\u201d <em>McPherson v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>119 F.3d 453, 460 (6th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d) (providing that complaints of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the standards under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act). \u201cBecause the standards under both [] acts are largely the same, cases construing one statute are instructive in construing the other.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Ohio, </em>104 F.3d 803, 807 (6th Cir.1997); <em>see also Smith v. Henderson, </em>376 F.3d 529, 534 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>provides that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a); <em>see also Todd v. City of Cincinnati, </em>436 F.3d 635, 636 (6th Cir. 2006); <em>Moorer v. Baptist Mem\u2019l Health Care Sys., </em>398 F.3d 469, 479 (6th Cir.2005); <em>Hedrick v. Western Reserve Care Sys., </em>355 F.3d 444, 452 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Under the ADA, a \u201cqualified individual with a disability [is] an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d <em>Moorer, </em>398 F.3d at 479 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cUnder the ADA, a \u2018disability\u2019 means either (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The ADA defines \u201cmajor life activity [as] \u2018functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moorer, </em>398 F.3d at 479 (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i)). \u201cThe inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i). Indeed, \u201cplaintiffs [must] allege [that] they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.\u201d <em>Moorer, </em>398 F.3d at 479 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAn employer must make \u2018reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoge v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., </em>384 F.3d 238, 249 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">To successfully establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that: \u201c1) he is an individual with a disability; 2) he is otherwise qualified to perform the job requirements, with or without reasonable accommodation; and 3) he was [not hired] solely by reason of his handicap.\u201d <em>Hedrick, </em>355 F.3d at 452 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA plaintiff may prove that he was discriminated against based upon his disability either through direct or indirect evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">If a plaintiff presents direct evidence of disability discrimination,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>(1) The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that he or she is disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">(2) The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that he or she is \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d for the position despite his or her disability: (a) without accommodation from the employer; (b) with an alleged \u201cessential\u201d job requirement eliminated; or (c) with a proposed reasonable accommodation. (3) The employer will bear the burden of proving that a challenged job criterion is essential, and therefore a business necessity, or that a proposed accommodation will impose an undue hardship upon the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><em>Hedrick, </em>355 F.3d at 452 (citation omitted). If a plaintiff seeks to establish a case indirectly, a burden-shifting approach applies so that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing that: (1) he or she is disabled; (2) otherwise qualified for the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) suffered an adverse employment decision; (4) the employer knew or had reason to know of the plaintifPs disability; and (5) the position remained open while the employer sought other applicants or the disabled individual was replaced. The defendant must then offer a legitimate explanation for its action. If the defendant satisfies this burden of production, the plaintiff must introduce evidence showing that the proffered explanation is pretextual. Under this scheme, the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 452-53 (citation omitted); <em>see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). An adverse employment action \u201cconstitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257,141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998). Moreover, the Supreme Court has clarified that the elements necessary for the <em>prima facie </em>case are flexible because \u201c[t]he facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification [ ] of the prima facie proof required ... is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations.\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802 n. 13, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">B. The District Court Properly Dismissed Plaintiffs Disability Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">In the instant case, the sole issue before the Court is whether Plaintiff has proffered sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that she suffered an adverse employment action. In the cursory appellate brief, Plaintiff appears to argue that Defendant a) failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for Lee\u2019s alleged disability; b) unnecessarily and unfairly subjected Lee to a fitness-for-duty physical examination; and c) removed Lee as a result of discrimination. Plaintiffs arguments are meritless. Each argument will be addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">1. Reasonable Accommodation</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her alleged disability. For its part, Defendant maintains that the \u201crecord establishes] only that Lee had a history of back problems which rendered her incapable of performing her assigned job.\u201d (Def. Br. at 12) The record indicates that Lee was unable to perform duties associated with her position because of her physical condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-13\">Question: So, given the restrictions that you\u2019re under on this document ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>you could not do your regular flat sorter operator job. Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Answer: No, because the weight restrictions vary. You may lift up to 100 pounds, 90 pounds, two pounds. There is no significance on the weight when you\u2019re working on that machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">(J.A. 75-76) (formatting added). Lee\u2019s physical condition rendered her unable to perform her work. This conclusion is confirmed by the results of Lee\u2019s fitness-for-duty physical examination, which revealed that she had lifting and carrying limitations and that \u201cshe [was] not medically fit to perform all the essential functions of her [] position.\u201d (J.A. 185) More specifically, Lee conceded that she could not perform essential functions of her position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">Question: ... I\u2019m just asking if you know of anything ... that the postal service could have done that would have enabled you to perform the flat sorter job. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">Answer: I understand what you\u2019re talking about. I had the rest bar; I had the special chair that was in the manual. The only thing they could have done \u2014 see, in a bargaining thing like that, you\u2019re going to have conflict with the other employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">Now, I could have loaded ledges; I could just key. But, see, that\u2019s not the issue. You\u2019ve got to complete \u2014 be able to complete your task, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">In other words, after I keyed, I was supposed to be pulling boxes, break the machine down, and roll them AJP.C.\u2019s out to dispatch.

As illustrated above, Lee simply could not identify an accommodation that would have enabled her to perform her job. Therefore, it is an undisputed, material fact that Lee could not perform the essential functions of her job, with or without accommodations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">To recover under the ADA, a plaintiff must also establish that he is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d by showing: (1) that he \u201csatisfies the prerequisites for the position [he holds or desires], such as possessing the appropriate educational background, employment experience, [and] skills ... \u201d; and (2) that he \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the position held or desired, with or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-15\"><em>Burns v. Coca-Cola Enter., Inc., </em>222 F.3d 247, 256 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Dalton v. Subaru-Isuzu Auto., Inc., </em>141 F.3d 667, 676 (7th Cir.1998)) (alterations in original). Under the ADA, a \u201cqualified individual with a disability [is] an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d <em>Moorer, </em>398 F.3d at 479 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In the instant case, the record clearly indicates that Lee could not perform her job. Plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence to support the contention that Lee could perform the essential functions of her position. Because Lee could not perform essential functions of the position for which she was hired, with or without accommodation, the district court properly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">Plaintiff contends that Lee could have continued in the various jobs to which she had been assigned while on limited-duty for her work-related injury, or while on temporary light-duty for which she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>later approved. This argument is unpersuasive. Under the collective bargaining agreement which governed Lee\u2019s employment, Defendant had an obligation to provide Lee with a limited-duty position while her workers\u2019 compensation claims for work-related injuries were pending before the Department of Labor. When Lee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation status expired, Defendant had no obligation to maintain Lee on limited-duty assignments. Nevertheless, Defendant allowed Lee to remain in a temporary light-duty position, based on her non-work-related back injury, for a period of time. Lee\u2019s request for temporary light-duty assignment indicates that: \u201cThis is Temporary <em>Light </em>Duty; not Permanent Limited Duty.\u201d (J.A. 141) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Temporary light-duty assignments, which are provided to employees with non-work-related injuries, are governed by a collective bargaining agreement. \u201cThe [collective bargaining] agreement is clear [ ] that although the post office may grant temporary light duty status to an employee experiencing illness or injury, an employee must go through the proper application and bidding procedure for an assignment to permanent light duty status.\u201d <em>Hurst v. United States Postal Serv., </em>653 F.Supp. 259, 263 n. 2 (N.D.Ga. 1986). Lee\u2019s \u201climited and light duty assignments were not bid jobs.\u201d (Def. Br. at 14) Lee requested a permanent light-duty position, but \u201cthere [were] no permanent light duty positions in the Louisville Plant.\u201d (J.A. 147) Lee did not take the typing test required for the MUM or CFS clerk positions; failed to complete the MUM Clerk training; did not bid for a permanent position, and did not otherwise pursue other employment opportunities with Defendant. The record also indicates that Lee\u2019s physical condition was permanent. The permanence of her condition is evidenced by Lee\u2019s successful application for permanent disability retirement benefits. (J.A. 219-22) Defendant is simply not required to engage Lee in temporary light-duty assignment in perpetuity. \u201c[T]he ADA does not compel an employer to convert temporary positions it has set aside into permanent positions for its disabled employees.\u201d <em>Hoskins v. Oakland County Sheriffs Dep't, </em>227 F.3d 719, 730 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Nevertheless, Lee indicated that Defendant \u201ccan make a light-duty job out of anything, any position, if they want to. Because they have.\u201d (J.A. 101) More specifically, Lee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Answer: A guy that he had had surgery on his hand, and he went around\u2014 arm or something \u2014 went around taking inventory on trucks. Had a clipboard going around and taking inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">Question: And, that was his permanent job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">Answer: I don\u2019t know if it was a bid job or not, but it was a job he had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">Answer: There was another lady [Patricia Sauer] where she had \u2014 and its hereditary, I can\u2019t think of the name of it \u2014 anyhow, her bones were deteriorating from her neck on down. By her keying on the L.S.M. machines, it aggravated it worse, and they put her in a letter house, and they left her there. I asked her, are you going to have surgery? She said, no, because my bone structure is not sound. Surgery won\u2019t help her.... And, they left her in that job____until she got her disability, and she got disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">Question: And, then she retired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-14\">Answer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>(J.A. 102-04) (formatting added). Lee argues that Defendant has created positions for other disabled people. \u201cIt is well established, however, that an employer is not obligated to create a position not then in existence.\u201d <em>Hoskins, </em>227 F.3d at 729. Plaintiff has failed to show that Lee was entitled to a permanent light-duty position, and has failed to proffer evidence that there was a vacant position which Lee could fill. Lee was notified that there were no positions available with which to accommodate her condition. Lee\u2019s contention that other employees had a light-duty job created for them is not supported by any evidence in the record. At least with respect to Patricia Sauer (\u201cSauer\u201d), the record indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">Sauer was a Letter Sorting Machine (LSM) Operator who suffered from a condition that rendered her unable to perform that job. Although she was provided with light duty for a period of time, her request for permanent light duty was denied. Ms. Sauer later was able to return to work, however, because she qualified for, and was the successful bidder on, a MUM clerk position. She later applied for, and was granted, disability retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">(J.A. 179). As illustrated above, at least one other disabled employee was also denied permanent light-duty assignments. (J.A. 181)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Lee\u2019s right to a light-duty position under the collective bargaining agreement was litigated by the union on her behalf through the grievance and arbitration procedure. The arbitrator concluded that Lee was simply not entitled to a permanent light-duty assignment. In pertinent part, the arbitrator found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR4\">[t]he overriding conclusion from all of the medical evidence in the record is that there was no position for which [Lee] could meet the essential qualifications even with reasonable accommodation. Because there was not, [Defendant] had a right to discharge her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">(J.A. 217) The district court properly reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">2. Fitness-for-Duty Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Plaintiff argues that Lee should not have been asked to take a fitness-for-duty physical examination. In pertinent part, Lee stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">Question: Now, you\u2019ve claimed that you were discriminated against when you were sent for fitness for duty examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">Answer: The union stewards said that he wasn\u2019t supposed to give me a fitness for duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">Question: And do you know why they weren\u2019t supposed to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">Answer: He told me, but I forgot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">Answer: Usually, they send you downtown to the Heyburn Building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">Question: So you think it was discriminatory because they sent you to a different location than the usual one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-18\">Answer: You always go down to the Heyburn Building for the fitness for duty. That\u2019s number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-19\">And why \u2014 they couldn\u2019t understand why he would be giving me a fitness for duty. He\u2019s just a post office \u2014 a doctor that works for the post office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-20\">Question: Other than that, is there any reason why you think being sent for a fitness for duty examination was discriminatory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-21\">Answer: The whole thing was discriminatory, yes, the whole ordeal, and resolving and filing this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-22\">Question: So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s the same reasons that we discussed regarding your removal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Answer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">Question: So you think the fitness for duty examination was also taken in retaliation for your incident with Mr. Jewett?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Answer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">(J.A. 132-34) (formatting added). As illustrated above, Lee\u2019s allegation that her fitness-for-duty examination was discriminatory is grounded on 1) the location where the examination was conducted; and 2) her impression that it was done in retaliation for an altercation with her supervisor, Gordon Jewett (\u201cJewett\u201d). Lee\u2019s arguments are meritless. First, there is no evidence on the record to support a contention that Lee\u2019s fitness-for-duty physical examination was conducted in a meaningfully or significantly different manner vis-a-vis other fitness-for-duty examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Second, the examination was requested by Altic, not Jewett. (J.A. 228, 233, 236). In August 1995, Altic \u201cdid not feel [Lee\u2019s] light duty restrictions and her light duty assignment, were well matched.\u201d (J.A. 226) Lee continuously \u201creported] to work late,\u201d (J.A. 227); \u201cwas not productive,\u201d (J.A. 228); and was visibly \u201cin pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHer attitude was one of wanting to do the job, but she was not able to do the job.\u201d (J.A. 228) In light of her work performance and physical condition, \u201cthe decision was made to put her in for the Fitness For Duty\u201d examination. (J.A. 228) On August 24, 1995, Lee\u2019s supervisor requested that Lee be scheduled for a physical examination to determine her fitness-for-duty. (J.A. 183) Altic affirms that the \u201cmain reason for putting [Lee] in for the fitness for duty was that she was a hazard to herself as well as to the Postal Service,\u201d (J.A. 230), based on \u201cthe fact [that] she was falling [sic] asleep and sometimes in a dazed condition, and I would often find her with her feet upon the ledge of the case. And safety procedures on the workfloor are that you always have one foot on the floor.\u201d (J.A. 230) \u201c[Altic] felt [she] had a responsibility to the Postal Service to report this unsafe practice, as well as a responsibility to [Lee] to see that she was not put in a position where she was likely to sustain an injury.\u201d (J.A. 231) The supervisor further clarifies that the \u201cgoal of the fitness for duty was to get a better alignment of her capabilities under her medical restrictions to her actual assigned [sic] job duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Altic was authorized to request a fitness-for-duty physical examination pursuant to Defendant\u2019s Employee and Labor Relations Manual, which, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">Fitness for Duty (See Handbook El-311, 343)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\"><em>A fitness-for-duty examination is required in determining whether an employee is able to perform the duties of the position </em>because of medical reasons, i.e., disability, occupational/nonoccupational injury, or illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">\n<em>Management can order fitness-for-duty examinations at any time and repeat, as necessary, to safeguard the employee or coworker. Specific reasons for the fitness-for-duty should be stated by the referring official.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\"><em>A </em>specific test or consultation may be required in the judgment of the examining medical officer. The indications will be documented as part of the report. In cases of occupational injury or illness, the Division/MSC Injury Compensation Control office may request an examination in the course of monitoring an injury compensation case. (See 547.3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">(J.A. 180) (emphasis added). It is within Defendant\u2019s discretion and authority to request a fitness-for-duty physical examination. Indeed, the examination is required to determine whether an employee is able to perform the duties of his or her position because of medical reasons. In the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>case, Defendant set forth specific reasons for the examination. The record does not indicate that the examination was ordered for discriminatory reasons; and Plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence that the examination was ordered for discriminatory reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">3. Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Lee argues that her termination was the result of discrimination based on disability. \u201cThe Rehabilitation Act forbids discrimination based on stereotypes about a handicap, but it does not forbid decisions based on the actual attributes of the handicap.\u201d <em>Pesterfield v. Tennessee Valley Auth, </em>941 F.2d 437, 443 (6th Cir.1991). Defendant \u201cmay make an employment decision adverse to a handicapped person if, for example, the person\u2019s handicap causes him or her to be unable to perform an essential function of the job.\u201d <em>Burns v. City of Columbus, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, Div. of Police, </em>91 F.3d 836, 842 (6th Cir. 1996). In the instant case, as discussed above, Lee was unable to perform the essential functions of her job. Defendant has submitted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Lee\u2019s termination \u2014 namely, that Lee simply could not perform the essential functions of her job, with or without accommodation, and there was no reasonable accommodation available. Plaintiff proffers no evidence that the action taken by Defendant was discriminatory or based on discriminatory motives. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">III. Plaintiffs Racial Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">A. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The legal framework for analyzing racial discrimination claims is similar to the legal framework used to evaluate disability discrimination claims, which is set forth above. Title VII prohibits an employer from \u201cdischarging] any individual, or otherwise [ ] discriminating] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1); <em>Noble v. Brinker Int'l, Inc., </em>391 F.3d 715, 720 (6th Cir.2004); <em>see also McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 801, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (\u201cTitle VII tolerates no racial discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\u201d). \u201cIn Title VII actions, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by the defendant.\u201d <em>Talley v. Bravo Pitino Rest., Ltd., </em>61 F.3d 1241, 1246 (6th Cir.1995) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817). \u201cA plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination either by presenting direct evidence of intentional discrimination by the defendant, or by showing the existence of circumstantial evidence which creates an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">In <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the appropriate framework for reviewing claims of racial discrimination in the absence of direct evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">[t]he complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination. This may be done by showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; <em>Talley, </em>61 F.3d at 1246. \u201cThe fourth element may also be satisfied by showing that similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>situated non-protected employees were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>61 F.3d at 1246; <em>Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., </em>964 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir.1992). The plaintiff must proffer evidence that \u201cfor the same or similar conduct he was treated differently than similarly-situated non-minority employees.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d at 583. A plaintiff that meets this initial burden effectively \u201ccreates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against\u201d him. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">After an employee makes this initial showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the allegedly discriminatory employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Once the defendant advances a legitimate reason for its employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff \u201cto demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for [the employment action] were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805, 93 S.Ct. 1817. This inquiry is fact-specific and intimately tied to the evidence adduced by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">B. The District Court Properly Dismissed Plaintiffs Racial Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Plaintiffs brief to this court fails to meaningfully articulate Lee\u2019s racial discrimination claim. The brief is devoid of any support for the racial discrimination claim beyond the mere assertion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">In this case, Ms. Lee is African American. She was performing her light duty work capably. As set out above, there were no complaints regarding Ms. Lee\u2019s work. Ms. Lee was terminated. Pat Sauer, a white female was treated more favorably than Ms. Lee. Ms. Lee has demonstrated a prima facie case of racial discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">(Plaintiffs Br. at 15) Mere conclusory statements regarding alleged discrimination, which are unsupported by specific facts fail to raise a genuine issued of material fact and are insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. <em>Ackerman v. Diamond Shamrock Corp., </em>670 F.2d 66, 69-70 (6th Cir.1982). Lee simply offers no evidence or legal authority to support her racial discrimination claim. As illustrated above, Plaintiff merely alludes to Lee\u2019s alleged disparate treatment vis-a-vis a white co-worker. Lee\u2019s contention that Sauer was treated more favorably, is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">With respect to Sauer, the record indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">Sauer was a Letter Sorting Machine (LSM) Operator who suffered from a condition that rendered her unable to perform that job. Although she was provided with light duty for a period of time, her request for permanent light duty was denied. Ms. Sauer later was able to return to work, however, because she qualified for, and was the successful bidder on, a MUM clerk position. She later applied for, and was granted, disability retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">(J.A. 179). As illustrated above, Sauer is not similarly situated to Lee because Sauer held a different position; she was not a FSMO. Like Lee, Sauer was \u201cprovided with light duty for a period of time,\u201d <em>id., </em>and her request for reassignment to permanent light-duty was also denied. (J.A. 181) With respect to both temporary and permanent light-duty assignments, Lee and Sauer were treated identically. Unlike Lee, however, Sauer \u201cqualified for, and was the successful bidder on, a MUM clerk position.\u201d (J.A. 179) On the other hand, Lee did not take the typing test required for the MUM or CFS clerk posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>tions; failed to complete the MUM Clerk training; did not bid for a permanent position; and did not otherwise pursue other employment opportunities with Defendant. Plaintiff has simply failed to proffer evidence to support the contention that Lee\u2019s race was a motivating factor for Defendant\u2019s actions. Defendant has articulated legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons for requiring Lee to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination and ultimately removing her. The record simply does not support Plaintiffs racial discrimination claim. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
