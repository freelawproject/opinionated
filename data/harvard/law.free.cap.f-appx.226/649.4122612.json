Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After filing this appeal, Hayes filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, arguing that his counsel had ignored his request to pursue a direct appeal of his sentence. The district court granted the motion to vacate the judgment and resentenced Hayes. Accordingly, we find this appeal is moot, as the instant motion sought to enforce or modify a judgment that has since been vacated. <em>See Mills v. Green, </em>159 U.S. 651, 653, 16 S.Ct. 132, 40 L.Ed. 293 (1895) (when event occurs during pendency of appeal that renders it impossible for court \u2014 if it should decide case in favor of plaintiff \u2014 to grant effective relief, court will dismiss appeal as moot). We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-30\">.
