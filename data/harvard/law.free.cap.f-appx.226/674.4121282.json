Weber, </em>451 F.3d 552 (9th Cir. 2006). We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-24\">In imposing a sentence upon revocation of supervised release, a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553 factors specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2006). Because the record reflects that the district court properly weighed and considered the required factors, as demonstrated by its discussion of Andrews\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to protect the public from further crimes, and Andrews\u2019s need for medical care and other correctional treatment, and because the record reveals no consideration of impermissible factors, the district court did not err. Although it departed substantially from the policy statement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), we find that in light of the facts here, the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In <em>Weber, </em>we held that imposition of penile plethysmograph testing as a condition of supervised release requires \u201ca thorough, on-the-record inquiry into whether the degree of intrusion caused by such testing is reasonably necessary to accomplish one or more of the factors listed in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3583(d)(1) and involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary given the available alternatives.\u201d 451 F.3d at 568-69 (internal quotations omitted). Although the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Weber </em>at the time of sentencing, we must hold that imposition of the condition contrary to <em>Weber </em>constituted plain error. We therefore vacate the requirement that Andrews submit to plethysmograph testing and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with <em>Weber.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-25\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
