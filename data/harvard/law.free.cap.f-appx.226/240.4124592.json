For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-26\">Carmona pled guilty to various state criminal charges, and the Superior Court of Delaware sentenced him to an eight-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>year term of imprisonment on November 28, 2000. In 2001, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico issued a writ of habeas corpus <em>ad prosequendum </em>ordering state authorities to produce Carmona so that he could face federal criminal charges. In 2002, Carmona pled guilty in the District Court to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to a term of ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment to be served concurrently with his Delaware sentence. Carmona then returned to Delaware to serve the remainder of his state sentence. He left state custody on December 12, 2003, after the Superior Court of Delaware granted his motion for a reduced sentence, and was immediately taken into federal custody. Shortly thereafter, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) calculated that Carmona\u2019s ninety-six-month federal sentence commenced on the date it was imposed by the District Court (December 27, 2002) and credited him for time served from that date until his December 12, 2003 transfer into federal custody. The BOP also credited him for time served prior to the date his state sentence commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Carmona has filed the instant petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for the purpose of challenging the duration of his federal sentence. He argues that he is entitled to a shorter sentence based on his twenty-five months of confinement from the date of his state sentencing until the date of his federal sentencing. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denied the petition, and Carmona now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We agree with the District Court that the BOP did not err in denying Carmona credit for time served pursuant to his state sentence. Federal law expressly precludes the BOP from crediting a prisoner for time served prior to commencement of a federal sentence if such time has already been credited towards another sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a)-(b); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). Because the twenty-five-month period preceding the commencement of Carmona\u2019s federal sentence counted towards his state sentence, the BOP was not permitted to credit him for that period of confinement. Consequently, Carmona is also not entitled to credit for the fourteen months that he was detained pursuant to the <em>ad prosequendum </em>writ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002) abrogated on other grounds by Application Note 3(E) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. Carmona also raises an argument based on a limited exception to the rule against double credit stated in <em>Kayfez v. Gasele, </em>993 F.2d 1288 (7th Cir. 1993), but the District Court correctly concluded that <em>Kayfez </em>is inapposite to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Carmona also claims that the BOP\u2019s calculation was contrary to the terms of his plea agreement and the District Court\u2019s sentencing order, both of which expressly indicate that the federal sentence was to run concurrently with the state sentence. He appears to argue that the BOP improperly ignored the sentencing judge\u2019s decision to adjust his federal sentence to account for time already served pursuant to the undischarged state sentence. To the extent he does so, we find this argument meritless because there is no evidence indicating that the sentencing judge intended such an outcome. See <em>Ruggiano, </em>307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>F.3d at 132-33; <em>Rios v. Wiley, </em>201 F.3d 257, 265-68 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that Carmona has not shown that he is entitled to habeas relief. We will therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\">. We do not address the merits of Carmona\u2019s claim that fourteen months\u2019 detention pursuant to an <em>ad prosequendum </em>writ transmutes into federal custody, because he is asserting this claim for the first time on appeal. <em>See Moscato v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
