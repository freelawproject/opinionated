That is, Dibrell\u2019s claim was based on rights afforded to him by state law, not federal law, making a \u00a7 1983 claim improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court in its well-reasoned opinion, we affirm. Dibrell\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred by characterizing his claim as a \u00a7 1983 claim. We disagree. His complaint in one part stated: \u201cThis action arises under Title 42[,] U.S.C. \u00a7 1983....\u201d It in a later part stated: \u201cThis is an action under Title 42[,] U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.... \u201d Additionally, in response to Appellees\u2019 summary judgment argument that Dibrell\u2019s claim was barred by state law, Dibrell reemphasized that he was alleging a federal cause of action under \u00a7 1983 that could not be barred by state law. Therefore, Dibrell\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">In addition, even if we were to accept Dibrell\u2019s argument that he brought suit under state law, we would affirm for a different reason \u2014 lack of jurisdiction. If Dibrell, a Texas citizen and resident, brought solely a state law claim against Appellees, who are both Texas citizens and residents, federal jurisdiction would not exist. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331,1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">Either way, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
