We lack jurisdiction to hear Rico\u2019s asylum claim on appeal, and we find no reversible error on his other claims; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Rico, a native and citizen of Colombia, attempted to enter the United States via Miami International Airport in September 2003 using a false Colombian passport and visa. When questioned, Rico admitted that the entry documents were false and asserted that he left Colombia because he feared that he would be killed by members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (\u201cAUC\u201d), a paramilitary group, for his failure to pay a war tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued Rico a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), as an alien who procured a visa by fraud, and under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an alien who was not in possession of a valid immigrant visa at the time of admission. During a credible fear interview, Rico claimed that approximately 10 AUC members confronted him at his grandmother\u2019s farm, demanded that he pay five million pesos, and threatened to kill him if he failed to do so. Rico refused to pay and fled to the U.S. He stated that he feared that the AUC would kill him if he returned to Colombia because the group would impute to him a political opinion \u2014 namely, support of a competing guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) \u2014 based on his refusal to pay the war tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">In' March 2004, Rico appeared before the IJ, conceding removability and seeking asylum and withholding of removal. He reasserted his claims of past persecution and fear of future persecution by the AUC. In his application, Rico acknowledged that he had been arrested in New York for money laundering in December 2003 and had pled guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">After a brief hearing, the IJ denied Rico\u2019s claims for relief and ordered removal. The IJ found that Rico was ineligible for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(B)(i) because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(43)(D) \u2014 money laundering in an amount of funds in excess of $10,000. The IJ added that, even if Rico\u2019s prior conviction did not rise to the level of an aggravated felony,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rico had failed to carry his burden of proof on his asylum or withholding of removal claims. Rico appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred by failing to find that Rico had a well-founded fear of persecution. Rico did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum based on the determination that Rico was an aggravated felon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, and Rico now petitions this Court for review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider Rico\u2019s petition. <em>Bahar v. Ashcroft, </em>264 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). We review questions of our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). Because the IJ found that Rico was an aggravated felon and denied Rico\u2019s asylum claim on that basis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we must consider whether the jurisdiction-stripping provision of section 242 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, applies. Pursuant to section 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to1 review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in ... section [237](a)(2)(A)(iii)One such covered offense is an aggravated felony committed \u201cany time after admission.\u201d INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The issue here is whether the covered offense \u2014 Rico\u2019s aggravated felony conviction \u2014 can serve as the basis for a denial of judicial review under section 242 when DHS did not seek removal on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">We have previously held that the jurisdictional bar applies where the offense <em>covered </em>by and therefore triggering the bar was not the offense <em>charged </em>in the NTA, as long as the alien had notice of and an opportunity to be heard on the <em>covered </em>charge. <em>See Garcia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1221-22 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 (11th Cir.2001). We decline to extend this rule to the instant case. In <em>Fernandez-Bernal </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>both the offense covered under section 242 and the offense for which DHS sought removal were based on the same conduct. But here, the conduct underlying the aggravated felony \u2014 money laundering \u2014 is <em>not </em>the same conduct underlying the basis for Rico\u2019s removal. Applying the jurisdictional bar in such a case raises due process concerns, as \u201cthe alien could conceivably be denied the chance to challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that he is \u2018removable by reason of having committed\u2019 the new offense.\u201d Ferna<em>ndez-Bernal, </em>257 F.3d at 1310 n. 8; <em>see also Briseno v. INS, </em>192 F.3d 1320, 1323 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]e do not read \u2018deportable by reason of having committed\u2019 an aggravated felony ... as referring to felonies not charged at all in the Order to Show Cause.\u201d (internal citation omitted)); <em>Choeum v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is ... highly doubtful that ... Congress meant \u2018deport-able by reason of to mean, as the INS would have it, \u2018potentially susceptible to being deported by reason of.... \u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore find that section 242 does not bar our review of Rico\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Still, we lack jurisdiction to hear Rico\u2019s asylum claim. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), we may review a final order of removal \u201conly if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d This exhaustion requirement precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal, </em>257 F.3d at 1317 n. 13. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Because Rico failed to challenge before the BIA the IJ\u2019s determination that Rico was ineligible for asylum based on his money laundering conviction, which the IJ found to be an aggravated felony under the INA, we lack jurisdiction to hear this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">We now turn to Rico\u2019s contentions that the IJ erred by denying his requests for withholding of removal under the INA and CAT. Because the IJ\u2019s denial was based on factual findings that are \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u2019 \u201d we must affirm the IJ\u2019s order on these grounds. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)(4)). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under tie INA because Rico presented no specific evidence showing that his refusal to pay the war tax related to a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (alien must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir. 2004) (refusal to cooperate with or financially support guerillas is insufficient to show persecution on account of a political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Rico is ineligible for CAT relief because such relief is available only to those aliens who will be tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\u201d upon return to their country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Rico did not claim potential torture on the part of the Colombian government or its agents, nor did he provide evidence that the Colombian government has or will breach its legal responsibility to intervene in or prevent the AUC\u2019s activities. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004). In fact, the evidence indicates that the Colombian government has taken steps to punish military personnel who collaborate with the AUC. Thus, Rico cannot qualify for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">We conclude that Rico failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, precluding our jurisdiction on that issue, and that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under the INA and CAT. Rico\u2019s petition for review is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. As the IJ noted, it is unclear from the record whether or not Rico was convicted of laundering an amount of funds in excess of $10,000. He was charged under both provisions of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 470.05 (McKinney 2000). Section 470.05-2 requires that the amount of property involved exceed $10,000, while section 470.05-1 only requires that the amount exceed $5,000. The certificate of disposition, which records Rico\u2019s guilty plea, only refers to section 470.05 in general; it does not reference a specific subsection. At the time of their arrest, Rico and his codefendant had approximately $15,000 between them, but Rico carried only $4,000 himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b998-7\">. In cases of summary affirmation of the IJ's decision, we review the IJ's decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. INA \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b998-8\">. We note that the Fifth Circuit reached a different statutory interpretation in <em>Lopez-Elias v. Reno, </em>209 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2000), in which the court stated: \"What the INS originally charged is of no consequence; so long as the alien in fact is removable for committing an aggravated felony, this court has no jurisdiction, irrespective of whether the INS originally sought removal for that reason.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
