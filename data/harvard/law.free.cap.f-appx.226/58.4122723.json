Truex (\u201cTruex\u201d); nine members of the Board (\u201cBoard members\u201d); and four nonmember employees of the Board (\u201cBoard employees\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). Although, in their original complaint, Plaintiffs sued the nine Board members and four Board employees in their individual and official capacities, in the amended complaint, Plaintiffs sued them in their official capacities only.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint included seven counts, of which only counts one, two, five, six and seven are before us on appeal. Count one, brought pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleged that Defendants violated Jeremy\u2019s due process and equal protection rights because, between November 2001 and January 2002, (1) Jeremy \u2014 who at the time was enrolled as a ninth-grade student at Guilford High School; was 4'7\" tall and weighed approximately 75 pounds; and suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d) \u2014 was persistently harassed and bullied by classmates; (2) the Board employees allegedly \u201cknew of some or all of\u2019 the mistreatment to which Jeremy was subjected, and yet \u201ccondoned, permitted and/or acquiesced in\u201d in such mistreatment; and (3) Truex and the Board members \u201cfailed and refused to train and supervise adequately [the Board] employees in appropriate and necessary techniques and procedures for handling and caring for children with disabilities.... \u201d Count one also alleges that Defendants violated Jeremy\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to a \u201cfree appropriate public education,\u201d (\u201cFAPE\u201d), to which the Individuals with Disabilities Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1482, entitles him. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). Count two, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) and state common law, charged that Defendants conspired to deprive Jeremy of his \u201cdue process and equal protection rights.\u201d Counts five and six raised state-law negligence claims. Finally, in count seven, Plaintiffs sought, on their own behalf as parents of Jeremy, reimbursement for medical and psychiatric expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On November 23, 2005, the district court issued a ruling granting Defendants\u2019 Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(c) motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety, and ordering the case closed. <em>Smith v. Guilford Bd. of Educ., No. </em>03-01829, 2005 WL 3211449 (D.Conn. Nov. 30, 2005). Less than three months later, on February 7, 2006, the district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration, but, \u201c[u]pon thorough review, ... adhere[d] to its prior decision.\u201d Plaintiffs responded by bringing this timely appeal of the district court\u2019s November 23, 2005 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a suit pursuant to a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d <em>Desiano v. Warner-Lambert &amp; Co., </em>467 F.3d 85, 89 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c \u2018In deciding a Rule 12(c) motion, we apply the same standard as that applicable to a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Burnette v. Carothers, </em>192 F.3d 52, 56 (2d Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">I. <em>Count one\u2019s due process and equal protection claims, and count two</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim. Although count one of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not specify whether it is asserting a procedural or substantive due process claim \u2014 and Plaintiffs have remained non-committal in their briefing \u2014 we find that a due process claim under either analysis must be dismissed on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">\u201cEducation, of course, is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 35, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). Thus, \u201c[t]he Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a public education as a substantive fundamental right.\u201d <em>Handberry v. Thompson, </em>436 F.3d 52, 70 (2d Cir.2006). And even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Board employees\u2019 inaction can be said to have violated Jeremy\u2019s substantive due process rights under the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d or \u201cstate-created danger\u201d ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ceptions to <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 197-201, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), <em>see, e.g., Pena v. DePrisco, </em>432 F.3d 98, 107-110 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Dwares v. City of New York, </em>985 F.2d 94, 98-99 (2d Cir. 1993), Defendants\u2019 failure to respond to the harassing and bullying to which Jeremy was subjected (taking Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions to be true), while highly unfortunate, does not rise to the level of \u201cegregious conduct ... so brutal and offensive to human dignity as to shock the conscience.\u201d <em>Smith v. Half Hollow Hills Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>298 F.3d 168, 173 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The Due Process Clause does not confer an \u201caffirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.\u201d <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 196, 109 S.Ct. 998. But a procedural due process claim can lie where a plaintiff is deprived of a property interest without due process of law. Property interests can be created \u201cby existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law....\u201d <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). While state law creates the underlying substantive interest the plaintiff seeks to vindicate, \u201cfederal constitutional law determines whether that interest rises to the level of a \u2018legitimate claim of entitlement\u2019 protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 9, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978) (quoting <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701). \u201cIn order for a benefit to qualify as a property interest, the person claiming it must have a \u2018legitimate claim of entitlement\u2019 to the benefit, rather than a mere \u2018unilateral expectation of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Handberry, </em>436 F.3d at 70 (quoting <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701). In determining whether a party has a legitimate claim to a benefit, \u201cwe look to the statutes and regulations governing the distribution of benefits.\u201d <em>Kapps v. Wing, </em>404 F.3d 105, 113 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Plaintiffs assert that Defendants deprived Jeremy\u2019s state-law property interest in a public education by \u201cforcfingj\u201d him to withdraw from Guilford High School. Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. In <em>Handberry, </em>we concluded that a combination of a provision of the New York Constitution and New York\u2019s education laws established a property interest in education protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Handberry, </em>436 F.3d at 70-71 (citing N.Y. Const. Art. 8, \u00a7 1 and N.Y. Educ. L. \u00a7 3202(1)). Here, Article 8, Section 1 of the Connecticut Constitution provides: \u201cThere shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall implement this principle by appropriate legislation.\u201d Conn. Const. Art. 8, \u00a7 1. Under Connecticut law, \u201c[t]he public schools shall be open to all children five years of age and over ... and each such child shall have, and shall be so advised by the appropriate school authorities, an equal opportunity to participate in the activities, programs and courses of study offered in such public schools, at such time as the child becomes eligible to participate in such activities, programs and courses of study, without discrimination on account of race, color, sex, religion, national origin or sexual orientation.... \u201d Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 10-15c(a). Section 10-220(a) of the Connecticut General Statute also directs, <em>inter alia, </em>that each board of education \u201cshall cause each child five years of age and over and under eighteen years of age who is not a high school graduate and is living in the school district to attend school in accordance with the provisions of section 10-184.\u201d Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 10-220(a); Am. Compl. \u00b6 31. And section 10-184 provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201cSubject to the provisions of this section and section 10-15c, each parent or other person having control of a child five years of age and over and under eighteen years of age shall cause such child to attend a public school regularly during the hours and terms the public school in the district in which such child resides is in session....\u201d Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 10-184. As in <em>Handberry, </em>these provisions of state law confer to Jeremy a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to a property interest in a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">To state a cognizable procedural due process claim, however, Plaintiffs must also allege that Jeremy was deprived in some manner of a property interest in a FAPE by Defendants\u2019 conduct. Jeremy\u2019s property interest lies only in his \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to a free public education. But the amended complaint does not allege any infringement upon, or deprivation of, that property interest. Rather, the amended complaint alleges that Jeremy \u201chas been deprived of the ability to enjoy the friendships he established with students in Guilford and to continue the activities he had enjoyed while in Guilford.\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 44. Such an allegation does not raise a legally cognizable theory of liability under the Due Process Clause, requiring dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim, because the amended complaint nowhere alleges that Defendants, in condoning or acquiescing in the students\u2019 mistreatment of Jeremy, were <em>motivated </em>in any way by Jeremy\u2019s size or ADHD. Moreover, because Plaintiffs\u2019 due process and equal protection claims were properly dismissed, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 count-two \u00a7 1985(3) and state common-law conspiracy claims, which were based on the due process and equal protection claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">II. <em>Count one\u2019s IDEA claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1x\">Plaintiffs\u2019 count one also alleges that Defendants deprived Jeremy of his statutory right to a FAPE. It is well-settled that, while the IDEA itself does not provide for monetary damages, plaintiffs may sue pursuant to \u00a7 1983 to enforce its provisions \u2014 including the right to a FAPE \u2014 and to obtain damages for violations of such provisions. <em>See D.D. ex rel. V.D. v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>465 F.3d 503, 511 n. 10 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cthe IDEA creates rights in favor of disabled children and their families enforceable through \u00a7 1983,\u201d and collecting cases). The district court, however, faded to consider whether Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a violation of Jeremy\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to a FAPE; instead, the court considered Jeremy\u2019s right to a FAPE only to the extent that it might constitute a property interest protected by procedural due process. <em>See Smith, </em>2005 WL 3211449, at *4-5. Moreover, in concluding that, \u201ceven if the right to a FAPE was considered constitutional or fundamental, it is evident that Jeremy did not, in fact, experience a denial of this right,\u201d the district court failed to construe all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Id. </em>at *5. Specifically, the district court improperly found that Jeremy \u201cvoluntarily withdrew from Guilford High School,\u201d <em>id.; </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation, reasonably construed in their favor, is that Jeremy was effectively <em>forced, </em>to with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>draw. Finally, the district court erroneously assumed that, in order to sufficiently assert a claim, Jeremy must have been <em>permanently </em>deprived of his right to a FAPE. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]here is no claim that [Jeremy] did not receive a free and appropriate public education in his <em>subsequent </em>placement.\u201d (emphasis added)); see <em>also id. </em>(\u201cAssuming, arguendo, that the defendants had violated Jeremy\u2019s [FAPE] rights, ... placement in another school system would obviate the complaint\u201d because \u201c[i]t has long been held that an unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a violation of due process if a meaningful post-deprivation remedy for the loss is available.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Jeremy seeks monetary damages for the period during which his right to a FAPE was impinged; subsequent developments\u2014 while relevant to the question of whether Jeremy might properly seek injunctive relief-do not \u201cobviate\u201d the alleged violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">For these reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Defendants violated Jeremy\u2019s statutory right to a FAPE, and remand to the district court for further consideration. In doing so, we note two matters that, in addition to the merits of a putative claim under the IDEA, are better left to the district court to consider in the first instance. First, it is unclear whether subject matter jurisdiction exists over this claim. <em>See Polera v. Bd. of Educ., </em>288 F.3d 478, 483 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cA plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the IDEA deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>but see id. </em>at 488 (\u201cWe recognize that the IDEA\u2019S exhaustion requirement does not apply in situations in which exhaustion would be futile because administrative procedures do not provide adequate remedies.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, at oral argument before us, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asserted that Jeremy\u2019s ADHD \u2014 and not his diminutive stature\u2014 triggered the application of the IDEA. The underlying events described in the amended complaint, however, surround Jeremy\u2019s diminutive stature, not his ADHD. Because Jeremy\u2019s individual education plan is not before us on this appeal from the granting of a Rule 12(c) motion, we are unable to determine whether and to what extent liability may arise from conduct unrelated to the triggering disability under the IDEA. If the district court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction over this claim, it may be appropriate for the court also to consider this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">III. <em>Defendants\u2019 counterarguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In light of our reinstatement of Plaintiffs\u2019 count-one IDEA claim, we now consider \u2014 and in doing so, reject \u2014 the various arguments Defendants have made as to why Plaintiffs\u2019 suit cannot proceed. First, Defendants argue that the appeal was untimely as to the first through fourth counts \u2014 which were not part of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration\u2014 because it was filed more than thirty days after the court granted Defendants\u2019 motion. We conclude that the appeal of these counts was timely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have waived their arguments in count one because they failed to raise them in their Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration. But such motions serve the limited purpose of allowing \u201cthe moving party [to attempt to] point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked \u2014 matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\u201d <em>Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Cir.1995); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[A] motion to reconsider should not be granted where the moving party seeks solely to relitigate an issue already decided.\u201d). Thus, there is no basis to Defendants\u2019 contention that arguments not raised in a Rule 59(e) motion are thereby waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Third, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to allege that they had filed a written notice of claim with the Town or Board Clerk, as is required under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7-465. But Defendants did not assert this as an affirmative defense in their response to Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, and failed to include it as an argument in their papers for Rule 12(c) judgment on the pleadings. We therefore treat the argument as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Fourth, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs failed specifically to plead their reliance on Conn. Stat. \u00a7 7-465, the relevant state indemnity statute. However, as Plaintiffs persuasively rejoin, Defendants\u2019 argument is premised on a Connecticut rule of practice, Conn. Practice Book \u00a7 10-3(a), which Connecticut state courts have held to be directory, not mandatory. <em>See Spears v. Garcia, </em>66 Conn.App. 669, 676, 785 A.2d 1181 (2001) (\u201cAs long as the defendant is sufficiently apprised of the nature of the action ... failure to comply with the directive of Practice Book \u00a7 10-3(a) will not bar recovery.\u201d). Thus, Plaintiffs\u2019 suit is not necessarily barred by this defect in the amended complaint, and it cannot serve as a basis for affirming the Rule 12(c) dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA claim. We leave for the district court to consider on remand the question of whether Defendants were in fact \u201csufficiently apprised of the nature of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">IV. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining counts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint also raised several state-law claims, i.e., count two\u2019s conspiracy claim based on state common law, and counts five and six. The district court below did not expressly consider them, and we therefore assume that the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims was without prejudice, and in light of the then-absence of remaining federal claims. Given our remand of Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA claim, these state claims must be reinstated. Should the district court on remand, however, conclude that the IDEA claim must be dismissed, we presume that it will once again dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">In addition, given the reinstatement of Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA and state-law claims, we also reinstate count seven of Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED as to the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 count-one due process and equal protection claims, and Plaintiffs\u2019 count-two (\u00a7 1985 and state common law conspiracy claims); and VACATED and REMANDED as to Plaintiffs\u2019 count-one IDEA claim, counts five and six (state-law negligence claims), and Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for reimbursement in count seven. Costs will abide the ultimate result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">. Because we conclude that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled that the Board employees violated Jeremy\u2019s constitutional rights, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Board itself must also fail. <em>See Curley v. Village of Suffern, </em>268 F.3d 65, 71 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201d[W]e have recognized that a municipality cannot be liable for inadequate training or supervision when the officers involved ... did not violate the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. We note, in passing, that the district court erred in suggesting that, with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 federal claims, the Board employees might be entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Smith, </em>2005 WL 3211449, at *3. <em>Pinaud v. County of Suffolk, </em>52 F.3d 1139, 1146-47 (2d Cir.1995) (\u2018\u2018[T]he personal privilege ... of qualified immunity ... [is] available to governmental officials only with respect to damage claims asserted against them in their <em>individual </em>capacities.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
