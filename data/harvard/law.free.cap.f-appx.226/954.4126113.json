Jurisdiction was grounded upon diversity of citizenship. The district court dismissed the action as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">The parties agree that Georgia law determines whether Plaintiffs lawsuit is barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. v. City of Claxton, </em>720 F.2d 1230, 1233 (1983). Plaintiff does not dispute that: (1) the complaint was filed on the last day of the Georgia statute of limitations period for a renewal action; and (2) service was not effected within five days thereafter. Therefore, under Georgia law, the action is barred by the statute of limitations unless Plaintiff diligently attempted to perfect service. <em>Id. </em>We find no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Plaintiff presented insufficient evidence of his diligence in attempting to perfect service on Defendant.
