Videla denying Huang\u2019s motion to reopen immigration proceedings. <em>In re Bishan Huang, </em>No. A73 175 453 (B.I.A. June 27, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A73 175 453 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City December 13, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-17\">In this case, the BIA decision dismissing Huang\u2019s appeal failed to consider material, and mostly undisputed, evidence that Huang had \u201c \u2018pass[ed] with reasonable diligence though the period [she] seeks to have tolled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iavorski v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Nyack Hasp., </em>86 F.3d 8,12 (2d Cir.1996)). For the purposes of its decision, the BIA apparently tolled the limitations period until August 11, 2003, when, according to Huang, she learned of the 1994 <em>in absentia </em>deportation order entered against her. However, the BIA implicitly found that Huang was not entitled to further tolling past this date and, accordingly, that her September 2005 motion to reopen was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">This determination by the BIA failed to take into account evidence in the record that, once aware of the outstanding order of deportation against her, Huang acted diligently. Specifically, the record indicates that, by September 2003, Huang had retained counsel to investigate the <em>in absentia </em>order. Moreover, contrary to the BIA\u2019s explicit finding, the record is conclusive that Huang did not \u201cwait[ ] until September 21, 2005, to file her first motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge.\u201d Rather, Huang, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen in May 2004, but counsel withdrew this motion because he thought it was properly brought before the San Francisco IJ presiding over separate proceedings to rescind Huang\u2019s permanent resident status. The parties are in agreement on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The record also reflects that, the day after learning that the San Francisco IJ declined to exercise jurisdiction over the order of deportation, counsel filed the September 2005 motion to reopen in New York. The BIA\u2019s failure to discuss any of this procedural history in its order leads to the conclusion that the BIA\u2019s decision that Huang\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely is \u201cdevoid of reasoning\u201d on the issue of equitable tolling after August 2003 and, thus, is a \u201csummary or conclusory statement\u201d indicative of an abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In light of this conclusion, we cannot uphold the BIA\u2019s determination that Huang failed to show prejudice from her attorney\u2019s errors because the motion to reopen would have been untimely in any event. We have indeed held that, in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that she was prejudiced by former counsel\u2019s actions or inactions. <em>See Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993). However, as discussed above, the BIA\u2019s finding that the first motion to reopen was untimely is based on flawed reasoning and an apparent mischaracterization of the record. Because the BIA\u2019s finding that Huang was not prejudiced by prior counsel\u2019s errors relies on this same reasoning, Huang\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be reconsidered on remand as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is GRANTED. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
