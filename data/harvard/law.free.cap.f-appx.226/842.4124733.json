McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Defendant Odilon Mendoza-Velasco was charged with illegal reentry by a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his prior deportation proceeding violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights. When that motion was denied, Defendant conditionally pleaded guilty and was sentenced to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment with a twenty-four month period of supervised release. Defendant now appeals the denial of his motion and the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">In May 2000, Defendant was arrested in Southern Arizona for transporting eight illegal aliens.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Defendant, he intended only to provide transportation to two female aliens who had sustained minor injuries during their border crossing, but the other six aliens piled into his car and refused to exit. He was defended by counsel who, although noting Defendant\u2019s case was a \u201cclose\u201d one, advised Defendant to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of time served. Defendant, then a legal permanent resident intent on remaining in the United States, asserts that he only pleaded guilty because his attorney advised him that Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act would likely prevent his deportation. That provision, however, had been repealed in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">At the subsequent deportation hearing, Defendant elected to proceed without counsel despite the immigration judge\u2019s offers to delay the proceedings in order for Defendant to obtain retained or pro bono counsel. The IJ then questioned Defendant about his \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) conviction. Defendant acknowledged the conviction but disagreed that his circumstances made it a deportable offense. According to Defendant, because he only transported the aliens for \u201chumanitarian reasons\u201d rather than for money, he should not have faced the possibility of deportation. (Doc. 10 at 9.) The IJ informed Defendant: \u201cThe law changed many years ago\u201d and \u201cno longer requires the federal Government ... to prove that you transported anybody for monetary reasons---- Even if you transported them for humanitarian reasons, it is still a violation of federal law.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">Nevertheless, because of Defendant\u2019s protestation, the IJ requested, and the government produced, Defendant\u2019s conviction record. The IJ then explained the nature of Defendant\u2019s conviction as well as the implications of conviction on Defendant\u2019s deportability. Defendant stated that he understood and conceded his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>After determining that no other exceptions applied, the IJ offered Defendant the chance to address the court before it handed down a final decision. Defendant was cut off, however, when he began to speak on his life in the United States. When the IJ informed Defendant that the court was restricted by law from considering the effects of deportation on his family and that no other exceptions applied to Defendant, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">A. So, there is no law or code that would allow me cancellation of deportation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">Q. You are not eligible for cancellation of removal because of your conviction. Because it is an aggravated felony, you don\u2019t qualify for cancellation of removal as a statutory bar or [probation] for cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">A. So there\u2019s nothing I can do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">Q. Unless you can get a pardon from the President of the United States, there is nothing you can do. At least not within my power to grant you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-8\"><em>(Id. </em>at 14-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Defendant ,was deported, but later illegally reentered the U.S. Thereafter, he was arrested and charged with illegal reentry. After denying Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, the district court accepted Defendant\u2019s conditional plea and sentenced him. At sentencing, Defendant objected to the pre-sentence report\u2019s recommendation of a 16-point enhancement for Defendant\u2019s illegal transportation conviction. Defendant argued that the facts underlying his conviction did not warrant such harsh treatment. That objection was overruled, and Defendant was sentenced to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the recommended Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A2f\">A. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Defendant argues that his Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights were violated because the IJ\u2019s \u201cpresidential pardon\u201d comment amounted to an \u201caffirmatively misleading statement about the relief available,\u201d thereby rendering his deportation proceeding fundamentally unfair. (Def.\u2019s Opening Br. at 14.) Specifically, Defendant asserts that the IJ\u2019s \u201cincorrect legal advice\u201d precluded him from challenging his \u00a7 1324 conviction via a \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. <em>(Id. </em>at 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">\u201cWhen a previous deportation proceeding is attacked on constitutional grounds, we are presented with a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguirre-Tello, </em>353 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc). Defendant bears the burden of proving that the underlying deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair, which requires showing that he was prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>Deportation proceedings are afforded a \u201cpresumption of regularity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">As we have previously noted, it is an \u201cundisputed proposition that a potential deportee is entitled in his deportation proceeding to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment, designed to ensure that the proceeding is fundamentally fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not believe, however, that the IJ\u2019s comment violated Defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">The comment was made <em>after </em>an extensive discussion regarding the nature of Defendant\u2019s conviction, which ended when Defendant conceded the conviction. At that point, the discussion turned to Defendant\u2019s deportation. The comment was made in the context of exceptions to deportation, and pertained specifically to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>\u201cpossibility of cancellation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The potential availability of habeas relief from the underlying conviction was not applicable in this context, and we see no reason why the IJ should have interpreted the question in that manner. As the district court recognized, where the IJ had been given no \u201csuggestion, indication, or slightest hint that there might be some legitimate basis for challenging the underlying conviction,\u201d the IJ could not reasonably be expected to intuit a right to habeas relief, particularly after the conversation had \u201cshifted from the circumstances <em>surrounding </em>[the] underlying conviction to the <em>consequences </em>of the criminal conviction.\u201d (Doc. 14 at 10-11 (Mem. Decision &amp; Order Den. Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 10-11).) Nor does Defendant\u2019s follow-up question, \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing I can do,\u201d alter the context. That question relates directly to his cancellation-specific question, not to a broader context.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Defendant contends that his forty-six month sentence is unreasonable given his lack-of-profit motive in the underlying alien transportation offense. He argues that the district court erred by not varying downward because it failed to examine the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Sentencing decisions are reviewed de novo, and sentences within the Guidelines\u2019 range are entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">According to Defendant, the district court\u2019s error is evident from its statement that, despite the \u201chumanitarian\u201d justification for his crime, sentencing Defendant below the recommended Guidelines\u2019 range would require it to \u201cignore\u201d or \u201cset aside\u201d the underlying conviction. (Sent\u2019g Tr. at 14.) As above, context is key: Defendant\u2019s argument ignores the context in which the district court made those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">After hearing from both parties\u2019 counsel on the variance issue, the district court commended defense counsel but decided to adhere to the recommendation of the presentence report pending any statement by Defendant. Defendant then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">I know that I committed a crime in 2000. I will take it as a crime. I was attempting to help my people. In the situation that I saw them in, anyone would have done it. The situation that they were in was really sad and because of the women, I felt my heart broken. And the other situation is, the men jumped into my van, and I couldn\u2019t just get them out. I told them I was going to have problems, but I couldn\u2019t do anything else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-11\"><em>(Id.) </em>The district court stated that Defendant\u2019s argument would require it to \u201cignore\u201d and \u201cset aside\u201d an otherwise valid conviction not because it misapplied \u00a7 3553, but because it interpreted Defendant\u2019s arguments as contesting the elements of the \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) conviction. The district court stated, \u201cWhat he\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ing to me is the fact that [the other six alien males] forced their way into the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 15.) This confusion was then corrected by defense counsel, who noted that Defendant was not contesting the validity of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">It is clear that the district court did consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court noted that, even after reading the parties\u2019 briefs concerning Defendant\u2019s motion for downward departure, it did not see a \u201cbasis\u201d under \u00a7 3553 to vary from the Guidelines\u2019 range. <em>(Id. </em>at 4.) As Defendant\u2019s own brief points out, neither \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) nor U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii) reflect any profit-motive requirement. That limitation was eliminated from the applicable Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 provision in 2003. While Defendant argues that his \u201chumanitarian intent\u201d nonetheless warrants variance from the Guidelines\u2019 range, we note that Defendant did not transport just the two injured illegal aliens, but also six, uninjured, illegal aliens. The district court stated that with such a \u201cserious\u201d crime \u201c[t]here is no question about knowing the gravity of [it] when it happens. You don\u2019t just think: I\u2019ve got a nice hitchhiker that needs a ride for a couple of miles.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 13.) In addition, the pre-sentence report listed Defendant\u2019s four DUI convictions, drug-related conviction, domestic assault conviction, and use of nine aliases, two different social security numbers, and three different dates of birth. Consequently, we do not believe that Defendant has rebutted the presumption of reasonableness attached to his sentence. Moreover, even absent the presumption, we would still find Defendant\u2019s sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-12\">. According to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), it is a crime for any person who, \"knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, transports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\">. Defendant initially argues that the use of an interpreter at the deportation hearing prejudiced his ability to fully comprehend the colloquy, an argument that Defendant failed to raise in his motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>See Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992) (refusing to take up issue raised for first time on appeal). Recognizing this problem, Defendant switches tack and argues not that Defendant \"did not understand what was going on but that the court should not expect a pro se immigrant to litigate his case with the same vigor as a law-trained attorney.\u201d (Def.'s Reply Br. at 5.) As a result, \"[a]ny contextual ambiguity should be resolved in favor of this uncounseled alien.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The record contains no evidence reflecting Defendant's confusion. To the contrary, Defendant more than adequately represented his position to the IJ. Moreover, as explained herein, we find no \"contextual ambiguity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
