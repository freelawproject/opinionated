We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">1. The district court properly declined to consider Michael Palmquist\u2019s hypnosis-refreshed recollections in opposition to summary judgment. <em>See United States v. Sioux, </em>362 F.3d 1241, 1244 n. 5 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that de novo review applies to the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence). In this civil action, Washington\u2019s law regarding the competency of a witness applies. Fed. R.Evid. 601. That is so because state law \u201csupplies the rule of decision,\u201d <em>id., </em>under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), and under Plaintiffs\u2019 product liability claims, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 7.72.030(1). <em>See Trevino v. United States, </em>804 F.2d 1512, 1516 (9th Cir.1986) (applying Washington law on the competency of an expert witness to testify). Under Washington law, a witness is incompetent to testify concerning post-hypnotic recollections. <em>State v. Martin, </em>101 Wash.2d 713, 684 P.2d 651, 656 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">2. The district court did not abuse its discretion in bifurcating discovery, denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel discovery, denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to continue, denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike an exhibit, or in refusing to allow Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to use a visual aid during argument to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">3. The district court did err, however, in granting summary judgment to Defendants. We review that question de novo. <em>Patelco Credit Union v. Sahni, </em>262 F.3d 897, 906 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that a United States military C-17 aircraft flew by and caused the crash of Plaintiffs\u2019 small Piper aircraft when the Piper was caught in the wake turbulence of the C-17. The record contains information concerning C-17 wake turbulence and the associated danger to small aircraft. Evidence in the record also excludes many common causes of an airplane crash, including the pilot\u2019s physical condition, the weather conditions, the mechanical condition of the aircraft, and a wingtip striking something. Finally, the timing of the crash is consistent with eyewitness accounts placing a C-17 in the area. The Piper was last seen flying at about 8:15 p.m.; it crashed between 8:15 p.m. and a few minutes later. One eyewitness testified that a C-17 was in the immediate area between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m. A second eyewitness also saw a C-17 in the area and estimated the time as being between 8:20 and 8:40 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">\u201c[V]iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to ... the non-moving party,\u201d <em>Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2004), we hold that a reasonable trier of fact could find proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>by 9th Cir.
