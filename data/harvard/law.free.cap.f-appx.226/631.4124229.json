The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 230 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), containing a request to withdraw. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Counsel argues that the district court erred by denying the defense\u2019s motion in limine to exclude any evidence of additional, similar abuses by Billie against the same victim during the same approximate period of time. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence under Federal Rules of Evidence 413 and 414 because, in the circumstances of this case, the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See United States v. Benais, </em>460 F.3d 1059, 1063 (8th Cir.2006) (upholding admission of evidence of other sexual assaults under Fed.R.Evid. 413 and 414 when applying Fed.R.Evid. 403\u2019s balancing test).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and having found no non-frivolous issues for appeal, we affirm the judgment of the district court and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. We deny Billie\u2019s pending motion for substitute counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">.
