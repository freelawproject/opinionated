Because we agree with the District Court and conclude that this appeal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Bethea\u2019s complaint asserts that three employees of the Trump Plaza Atlantic City Hotel and Casino falsely testified at a grand jury proceeding and at his criminal trial that he placed illegal wagers at the Casino\u2019s roulette table on December 8, 1998. Bethea alleges that the Casino employees\u2019 purported false testimony led to his conviction for swindling and cheating, and that they thereby violated his civil rights. Bethea further contends that the Casino employees\u2019 testimony was perjured, and that defendant Donald Trump is liable for gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Bethea is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>so we review this appeal to determine whether \u201cit lacks an arguable basis in law or in fact\u201d and thus should be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325,109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). In short, after conducting an independent review, we agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning for dismissing Bethea\u2019s complaint. He cannot maintain an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of his civil rights against the Casino employees because they did not act under color of state law when they testified before the grand jury or at the criminal trial. <em>See Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 329-30, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (\u201cIt is beyond question that, when a private party gives testimony in open court in a criminal trial, that act is not performed \u2018under color of law1 \u201d as is required for recovery under \u00a7 1983.). Additionally, as the District Court explained, the remaining claims for perjury and gross negligence arise under state law, and because Bethea\u2019s federal claims are being dismissed at an early stage of litigation, \u201cthe state claims should be dismissed as well\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c). <em>Borough of West Mifflin v. Lancaster, </em>45 F.3d 780, 788 (3d Cir.1995). <em>See also United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. As a result of our disposition, Bethea\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied as moot. Bethea\u2019s motion for state court transcripts is denied because the transcripts are not relevant to our current inquiry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. Although the District Court dismissed Bethea\u2019s complaint without prejudice, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because the dismissal was pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e). <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir. 1976). Our review is plenary. <em>Mitchell v. Horn, </em>318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
