On appeal, Roldan-Samudio argues that the district court clearly erred in denying a minor-role reduction and that his sentence is unreasonable. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Roldan-Samudio and seven codefendants were indicted on the above-mentioned charges, to which Roldan-Samudio pled guilty. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), on January 12, 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard obtained permission to board and search a Panamanian commercial freighter, ultimately finding 50 bales of cocaine, which weighed 1,134 kilograms. Roldan-Samudio was identified as the second engineer, and the other seven codefendants held the following positions: captain, chief engineer, first and second officers, deck seaman, machinist, and cook. The freighter\u2019s route took it from Spain, to Trinidad, to the Dominican Republic, to Guyana, and to Haiti. In the early morning hours of January 12, 2006, the entire crew participated in the transfer of the 50 bales of cocaine from a go-fast vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Roldan-Samudio was held accountable for 1,134 kilograms of cocaine at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">Roldan-Samudio argued that he should receive a minor-role adjustment based on the circumstances surrounding his participation in the voyage, contending that he did not learn of the illegal purpose of the voyage until the ship left port and was threatened when he tried to leave the ship. Roldan-Samudio further argued that this was his first voyage and he was there as a trainee, he did not have any real leadership role, and he did nothing of any great relevance concerning the drug voyage. The district court overruled Roldan-Samudio\u2019s objection, relying on Roldan-Samudio\u2019s accountability for 1,134 kilograms of cocaine and the lack of evidence that Roldan-Samudio was less culpable than any of the other crew members. His resulting Guideline range was 135-168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">After hearing arguments concerning a reasonable sentence, the district court found that Roldan-Samudio embarked on a major drug venture and that nothing in the statutory factors warranted a variance from the advisory Guidelines. Noting that it gave an enhancement to the captain and downward departures based on the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>ernment\u2019s motion to two other defendants, the court found no reason to treat Roldan-Samudio differently than any of the remaining defendants in this case who had received 135-month sentences. Accordingly, the court imposed a 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">I. Mitigating-role reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">On appeal, Roldan-Samudio asserts that the district court clearly erred in denying a minor-role reduction because he was tricked into going on the voyage and lacked a leadership role or a role in planning the criminal scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease if the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Section 3B1.2 permits an adjustment to the Guideline range for a defendant who is substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3). A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role cannot be described as minimal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">In determining a defendant\u2019s mitigating role in the offense, the district court first \u201cmust measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing\u201d and, second, \u201cmay also measure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent that they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. As to the second prong, \u201cthe district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Moreover, relative culpability is not necessarily dispositive, as none of the participants may have played a minor or minimal role. <em>Id. </em>Where a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to his own criminal act, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in that crime. <em>See id. </em>at 942-43. We have provided a non-exhaustive list of examples of relevant factual considerations informing the ultimate finding of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense: the \u201camount of drugs, fair market value of drugs, amount of money to be paid to the courier, equity interest in the drugs, role in planning the criminal scheme, and role in the distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Roldan-Samudio\u2019s actual and relevant conduct were one and the same. He was held accountable only for the 1,134 kilograms of cocaine aboard the vessel, which he and the rest of the crew transferred from the go-fast boat onto the ship. Despite his claim that he was tricked into going on the voyage and lacked a planning or leadership role, Roldan-Samudio provided no evidence showing that his responsibilities aboard the vessel were less important to the enterprise than those of the other crew members. Thus, Roldan-Samudio failed to show that he was less culpable than most other participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5); <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in denying a minor-role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">II. Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Roldan-Samudio contends that his sentence is unreasonable, relying on his positive history and characteristics, the circumstances surrounding his participation in the voyage, and the shorter sentences received by two of his codefendants, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>eluding the Chief Engineer, who outranked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). We consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-7\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[TJhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201cWhen reviewing the length of a sentence for reasonableness, we will remand for resentencing if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">The district court noted Roldan-Samudio\u2019s participation in a major drug venture and, rather than comparing him to his two codefendants who received downward departures based on the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, found that he should be treated the same as the codefendants who received 135-month sentences. Roldan-Samudio\u2019s offenses carried a statutory maximum term of life imprisonment. 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(g)(1) (repealed 2006); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii). We hold that the district court\u2019s 135-month sentence, which was at the low end of the advisory Guideline range, significantly below the applicable statutory maximum term of life imprisonment, and was the same sentence imposed on Roldan-Samudio\u2019s codefendants who were not beneficiaries of a downward departure, was reasonable. <em>Cf. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d at 1356-58 (rejecting the argument that the defendant\u2019s 121-month sentence was unreasonable when compared to his co-conspirators\u2019 significantly lower sentences, as it was \u201cwell within the bounds of reasonableness\u201d for the district court to find that the defendant was a leader or organizer and, therefore, impose a lengthier sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">In light of the foregoing, we</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
