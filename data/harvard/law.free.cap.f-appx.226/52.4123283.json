Jankun that denied petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and ordered him removed to Albania. <em>In re Deliu, </em>No. A 79 659 606 (B.I.A. May 8, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 79 659 696 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 1, 2004). Where, as here, the BIA does not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision to any extent, we review only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-22\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 submissions to this Court, we cannot say that <em>any </em>reasonable adjudicator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>would be <em>compelled </em>to disagree with the BIA\u2019s conclusions that petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution was rebutted by fundamental changes in Albania, that petitioner lacks compelling reasons to remain in the United States regardless, and that petitioner is not subject to a reasonable possibility of suffering other serious harm in Albania. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Petitioner\u2019s claim that the BIA engaged in improper fact-finding is without merit. <em>See Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 624 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) merely prohibits the BIA from taking new evidence into the record). Finally, petitioner provides no rationale for his conclusory statement that the BIA exceeded its \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in not considering evidence presented to it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
