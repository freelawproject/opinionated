Whether Bradford\u2019s motion to reconsider was brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) or 60(b), we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying it. <em>See Christensen v. Qwest Pension Plan, </em>462 F.3d 913, 920 (8th Cir. 2006) (clear-abuse-of-discretion standard of review for Rule 59(e) motion); <em>Arnold v. Wood, </em>238 F.3d 992, 998 (8th Cir.2001) (abuse-of-discretion standard of review for Rule 60(b) motion). To the extent he was seeking Rule 60(b) relief, he gave no reason for his motion and merely restated arguments and declarations he had already made. See <em>Arnold, </em>238 F.3d at 998 (noting Rule 60(b) motion is not vehicle for simply rearguing merits). To the extent he was seeking Rule 59(e) relief, he provided no basis to challenge the conclusion that he had not met his burden of proving a preliminary injunction should issue under the factors set forth in <em>Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. CL Sys., Inc., </em>640 F.2d 109, 113-14 &amp; n. 5 (8th Cir.1981) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\">. The Honorable Jean C.
