Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record regarding asylum and conclude that Tchabong fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15 (2006). In addition, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Tchabong failed to qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, we uphold the finding that Tchabong failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cameroon. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
