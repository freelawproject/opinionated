Made\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a supporting brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Made was notified of his right to submit a <em>pro se </em>brief in support of his appeal, but has not done so. For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">On July 7, 2003, pursuant to a written agreement with the government, Made pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin. Made\u2019s presentence report noted that under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), the conspiracy count carried a mandatory minimum term of 5 years and a maximum term of 40 years. Made\u2019s Offense Level of 27 with a Criminal History Category of I brought him within a Sentencing Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months. At the sentencing hearing on January 14, 2004, the District Court imposed a sentence of 70 months. Made appealed his sentence. The Third Circuit remanded for resentencing in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">At Made\u2019s resentencing hearing on February 28, 2006, the District Court reduced his sentence to 60 months. The government did not file a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) based on his substantial assistance to authorities and defendant\u2019s counsel agreed that Made had no \u201csafety valve\u201d eligibility under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). (App. 15.) Emphasizing the \u201cflexibility\u201d allowed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (App. 23), the District Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-17\">I can\u2019t imagine that Mr. Made has not realized the seriousness of the offense and that the amount of time he\u2019s spending in the federal facility along with the Passaic County Jail does not afford adequate deterrence to any future conduct. I\u2019m satisfied that he doesn\u2019t need another ten months to protect the public from further crimes, and I don\u2019t think he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>needs another ten months to reflect [on] the seriousness of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>(Id. </em>at 23.) The District Court therefore determined that the mandatory minimum was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, ... to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) Made filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), the Supreme Court held that if court-appointed counsel \u201cfinds [an appeal] to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination\u201d of the record, he should \u201cso advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a) (\u201cL.A.R. 109.2(a)\u201d), enacted in response to the <em>Anders </em>guidelines, permits counsel to file a motion to withdraw and supporting <em>Anders </em>brief if, upon review of the record, counsel \u201cis persuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit.\u201d Third Circuit L.A.R. 109.2(a). In an <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel must \u201csatisfy the court that he or she has thoroughly scoured the record in search of appealable issues\u201d and must also \u201cexplain ... why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 780-81 (3d Cir.2000). The Third Circuit evaluates counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief to determine: \u201c(1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">In this case, we find that Made\u2019s counsel has adequately fulfilled the requirements of L.A.R. 109.2 by scrutinizing the record and determining the appeal to be frivolous. Made\u2019s counsel has a filed a 13-page <em>Anders </em>brief, which set forth the factual background and procedural history of the case, and attached a 24-page appendix. Made\u2019s counsel identified one possible issue for appeal \u2014 whether Made\u2019s 60-month sentence is reasonable \u2014 and explained why this issue is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">Additionally, an independent review of the record presents no non-frivolous issue. Made might possibly challenge his sentence as unreasonable. However, the record reveals the District Court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the District Court, in fact, imposed a sentence below the advisory guidelines range. (App. 19-24.) In addition, Made\u2019s sentence is reasonable under <em>Booker </em>because the District Court did not have the discretion to sentence him to a term lower than the statutory minimum. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>419 F.3d 521, 532 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Payton, </em>405 F.3d 1168,1173 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]here is no merit to Raad\u2019s claim that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker </em>... [because] Raad was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence based on the facts to which he pleaded guilty.\u201d); <em>United States v. Painter, </em>400 F.3d 1111, 1111 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Because the sentence is mandated by statute, it is free of error under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Booker </em>.... \u201d); <em>United States v. Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005). Further, this case did not involve two bases that permit sentencing courts to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum: a substantial assistance motion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), or a defendant\u2019s safety-valve eligibility, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). <em>(See </em>App. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Accordingly, we will affirm the February 28, 2006 judgment of the District Court and we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. The Third Circuit has appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
