See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed for the reasons set forth in the attached memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">Pursuant to DC Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.

RApp. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">Appellant Gail A. Fuller-Avent asserted Privacy Act, common law tort, and constitutional claims against the United States Probation Office for the District of Columbia and several individual defendants, relating to a probation officer\u2019s alleged disclosure of her criminal history to her employer and Pennsylvania bar authorities during her term of supervised release. She appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\">As the district court correctly held at its June 16, 2003 hearing, Fuller-Avent has failed to state a claim under the Privacy Act, because that statute does not apply to \u201cthe courts of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552a(a)(l), 552(f)(1), 551(1)(B). Federal probation offices are administrative units of the United States courts, and thus are not subject to the Privacy Act. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602; <em>Pickus v. U.S. Board of Parole, </em>507 F.2d 1107, 1112 (D.C.Cir.1974) (noting that U.S. probation service is an \u201cauxiliary of the courts\u201d for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)(B)). To the extent that Fuller-Avent has asserted Privacy Act claims against individual defendants, those claims fail because the Act only authorizes suit against an \u201cagency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-16\">Under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), the Attorney General\u2019s certification that the individual defendants were acting within the scope of employment establishes the United States as the only proper defendant for Fuller-Avent\u2019s common law tort claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679. Moreover, the FTCA\u2019s discretionary function exception bars claims against the United States \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of ... an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a). Courts engage in a two-part inquiry to determine whether the discretionary function exception applies. <em>United States v. Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 322-23, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991); <em>Macharia v. United States, </em>334 F.3d 61, 65 (D.C.Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>First, the court must determine whether the challenged conduct involves \u201can element of judgment or choice,\u201d or whether a \u201cfederal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,\u201d leaving the employee \u201cno rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 322, 111 S.Ct. 1267 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. FDA </em>402 F.3d 1249, 1252 (D.C.Cir. 2005). Here, no statute or regulation prescribes specific conditions for releasing information to third parties. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.37, 2.205 (2006). Nor does the United States Probation Manual, under which a probation officer \u201chas a duty to warn specific third parties of a particular prospect of harm ... which the officer \u2018reasonably foresees\u2019 the offender may pose to them.\u201d Guide To Judiciary Policies and Procedures, vol. X (U.S. Probation Manual), ch. IV, at 36, part D.3 (1992) (emphasis omitted) [hereinafter <em>Manual]. </em>Harm is assessed based on a number of factors, including \u201cthe offender\u2019s employment, offense, prior criminal background, and conduct\u201d and any particular \u201copportunity or temptation\u201d for recidivism. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, part D.3.D(1). While part D.3.D(3)(e) of the Manual states that if an offender \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the disclosure of information to her employer, the matter should be presented to the court, <em>id. </em>at 38, in context this provision is not a \u201cspecific[] prescription]\u201d against disclosure under the facts here: Fuller-Avent\u2019s supervised release was explicitly conditioned on her \u201cpermitting] the probation officer to make ... notifications\u201d to third parties of risks she might present, and Fuller-Avent certified in monthly reports to the Probation Office that her employer was aware of her criminal status and consented to the release of information to Pennsylvania bar authorities. Appellant\u2019s Appx. B, Judgment at 3; <em>Fuller-Avent v. U.S. Probation Office, </em>No. 02-2380, Mem. Op. at 4-5, 11-12 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2004) [hereinafter \u201cMem. Op.\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Second, even where conduct \u201cinvolves an element of judgment,\u201d the exception protects only \u201cgovernmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.\u201d <em>Berkovitz v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 531, 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988); see also <em>Loughlin v. United States, </em>393 F.3d 155, 163-64 (D.C.Cir.2004). The Probation Manual reflects the competing policy considerations at stake: officers \u201chave an equal obligation to control risk to the public and provide correctional treatment to the offender.\u201d <em>Manual </em>at 36, part D.3. Thus, the discretionary function exception applies, and appellant\u2019s tort claims fail for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Appellant also asserted that disclosing her criminal history deprived her, without due process, of a constitutional liberty interest in following her chosen profession. However, as the district court correctly concluded, see Mem. Op. at 10-12, appellant failed to show appellees\u2019 actions \u201cnot only ... harmed [her] reputation, but also that the resulting stigma altered [her] status in a tangible way.\u201d <em>Trifax Corp. v. District of Columbia, </em>314 F.3d 641, 644 (D.C.Cir.2003) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Termination from employment did not constitute a \u201cformal exclusion from a chosen trade or profession,\u201d see <em>id., </em>and as to the denial of readmission to practice law, Fuller-Avent explicitly consented to the release of her criminal record to Pennsylvania bar authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Finally, appellant appears to claim that the disclosure of her criminal history violated a right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment, and that the district court erred in finding individual defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>dants immune from suit. Government officials enjoy qualified immunity where their conduct has not violated a \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional right[ ] of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). A court undertaking the qualified immunity inquiry first determines \u201cwhether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Here, however, Fuller-Avent has failed to develop-beyond conclusory allegations and a citation to non-germane, out-of-circuit precedent-the proposition that the disclosures at issue violated any constitutional right. See <em>Crawford-El v. Britton, </em>523 U.S. 574, 588, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (noting \u201cplaintiffs initial burden of proving a constitutional violation\u201d); <em>Carducci v. Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171, 177 (D.C.Cir.1983) (declining to address \u201casserted but unanalyzed constitutional claim\u201d). Thus the individual defendants are immune from suit. To the extent that appellant has asserted constitutional claims against the U.S. Probation Office directly, these are foreclosed by <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 484-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (rejecting extension of <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), to suits against federal agencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
