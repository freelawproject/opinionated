He identifies no error, however, in the Tax Court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction over that issue. I.R.C. \u00a7 6402.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-27\">The appellant asserts that certain retirement-related distributions should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>been construed as exempt loans. He fails to identify anything in the record tending to show both that the distributions were loans and that they satisfied exemption requirements. I.R.C. \u00a7 72. Finally, the appellant identifies no error in the Tax Court\u2019s determination that he did not satisfy requirements for head-of-household status or a dependency deduction. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2,151(c) &amp; 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
