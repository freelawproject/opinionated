Upon review of the district court\u2019s finding for clear error, <em>see United States v. Mickle, </em>464 F.3d 804, 807 (8th Cir.2006), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">It is undisputed that more than 5 persons were involved in the conspiracy, and that Paeper directed others to obtain precursors for him and compensated some participants with small amounts of the manufactured drugs in return for their obtaining supplies for him. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 comment. (n. 4) (factors distinguishing leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision); <em>United States v. Bohena, </em>223 F.3d 797, 804 (8th Cir.2000) (terms \u201corganizer\u201d and \u201cleader\u201d are given broad definition in assessing applicability of enhancement); <em>cf. United States v. Lashley, </em>251 F.3d 706, 712-13 (8th Cir.2001) (evidence sufficient to support leadership enhancement where defendant directed where drugs were cooked, paid property owners in drugs, and directed others to steal precursors); <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>148 F.3d 897, 902-03 (8th Cir.1998) (evidence sufficient to support leadership enhancement based on defendant\u2019s decision-making authority over procurement of equipment, supplies, and chemical ingredients in methamphetamine-manufacturing conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-19\">.
