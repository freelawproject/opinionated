He did not appeal his conviction or sentence. On August 3, 2006, Martinez-Tull filed a \u201cMotion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d He argued that he was denied the right to a direct appeal and that there had been an intervening change in the law concerning the sentencing guidelines. The District Court denied the motion. It stated that there is no Rule 60(b) right to resentencing under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) is not retroactively applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The District Court did not err in denying Martinez-Tull\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. It appears that Martinez-Tull intended to proceed under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; however, those rules apply to civil cases, not criminal cases. A motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the appropriate vehicle for the claims Martinez-Tull seeks to raise. We express no opinion over the merits of such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
