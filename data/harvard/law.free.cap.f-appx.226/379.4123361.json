The district court denied Johnson leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP here, Johnson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-19\">Liberally construed, Johnson\u2019s motion contends that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3)\u2019s good faith requirement does not apply to prisoners. This argument lacks merit. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 200. Liberally construed, Johnson\u2019s motion also argues generally that a claim dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted is not automatically frivolous under \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and (e). However, Johnson does not contend that the district court in fact conflated those standards when denying IFP in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">Johnson does not challenge the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. Therefore, Johnson\u2019s motion fails to show error in the district court\u2019s certification decision and fails to show that he will raise a nonfrivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>lous issue on appeal. Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Although the district court also determined that its dismissal of several of Johnson\u2019s claims for failure to state a claim counted as a strike, we do not decide at this time whether that dismissal in fact constitutes a second strike. Johnson is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
