He was sentenced to 360 months imprisonment. Marulanda now appeals the denial of his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the grounds that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by referring to his previous trial on the same charge, and that this claim was timely raised in his amended \u00a7 2255 motions because it relates back to claims raised in his original, timely-filed \u00a7 2255 motion. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Marulanda\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion de novo, including whether the claim raised in his amended \u00a7 2255 motion relates back to his original, timely-filed \u00a7 2255 motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c). <em>Mendoza v. Carey, </em>449 F.3d 1065, 1068 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Oja v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>440 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2006). Marulanda\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of fact and law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Rodrigues, </em>347 F.3d 818, 823 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">Marulanda\u2019s ineffective assistance claim does not relate back to his timely-filed \u00a7 2255 motion under Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Civil Procedure 15(c)(2) because it is not based on \u201cthe same core facts as [his] timely filed claims.\u201d <em>Mayle v. Felix, </em>545 U.S. 644, 125 S.Ct. 2562, 2571,162 L.Ed.2d 582 (2005). In his timely-filed \u00a7 2255 motion, Marulanda claimed that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by insulting the judge, failing to object to the jury selection process, failing to inform Marulanda of his right to testify, and failing to object to the government\u2019s use of word \u201cColumbian\u201d at trial. Marulanda\u2019s claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by referring to his previous trial on the same charge does not relate back to any of these other claims because it does not depend \u201con the existence of a common core of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2572 (internal quotation omitted). Rather, Marulanda\u2019s new claims are based on independent facts, different in both time and type. <em>Id. </em>at 2566.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Marulanda objects to the characterization of his September 9, 1998 motion for equitable tolling as his original \u00a7 2255 motion. However, this argument yields him little. If Marulanda\u2019s September 9, 1998 motion for equitable tolling were not characterized as a \u00a7 2255 motion, all of his subsequent filings would be time-barred. Although the district court failed to warn Marulanda of the consequences of such a characterization, without the characterization Marulanda would have no timely \u00a7 2255 claims. <em>Cf. Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). As a matter of fact, up until this appeal, Marulanda repeatedly insisted that his September 9, 1998 motion for equitable tolling be considered a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Even if it had been timely raised, Marulanda\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacks merit. Trial counsel\u2019s decision to refer to Marulanda\u2019s prior trial in order to impeach witnesses with their pri- or trial testimony was not objectively unreasonable. <em>Hensley v. Crist, </em>67 F.3d 181, 185 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see Wilson v. Henry, </em>185 F.3d 986, 991 (9th Cir.1999). Trial counsel referred to Marulanda\u2019s prior trial in order to explain the weight of the impeachment evidence without giving the jury reason to speculate as to other crimes for which Marulanda might have been charged. This tactical decision does not fall outside the \u201cwide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Lord v. Wood, </em>184 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
