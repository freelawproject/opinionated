Defendant Mota\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), on the ground that there are no non-frivolous bases for Mota\u2019s appeal. The government has filed a motion seeking dismissal of Mota\u2019s appeal or summary affirmance of his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">We review sentencing decisions for \u201cunreasonableness,\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), both as to procedure and substance, <em>see United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114-15 (2d Cir.2005). While we review issues of law <em>de novo, </em>we review issues of fact only for clear error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Selioutsky, </em>409 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural background of this ease, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">1. <em>Johan Bitini</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">We begin with Johan Bitini, whose receipt of the most severe sentence, a 240-month prison term, prompts the most challenges. We conclude that his arguments are uniformly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">First, Bitini\u2019s claim that the sentencing court erred by basing its sentence, in part, on evidence presented at the trial of co-defendants is refuted by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Granik, </em>386 F.3d 404, 414 n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that sentencing court can rely on any in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>formation known to it when determining sentence), and <em>United States v. Carmona, </em>873 F.2d 569, 574 (2d Cir.1989) (rejecting due process challenge to sentencing court\u2019s reliance on evidence from trial at which defendant was not a party).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Second, Bitini\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s reliance on the \u201ctypical weight\u201d table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 is unconvincing. Even if we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that any extrapolation of drug quantity in this case should have been made from the weight of contraband in pills actually seized, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 11, any error would be harmless in light of uncontested evidence that the seized pills had a greater-than-typical weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Third, we identify no clear error in the district court\u2019s treatment of Bitini as an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a) in light of evidence from which the court could reasonably have concluded that (a) Bitini exercised considerable decision making authority, particularly about drug movements, in the large-scale enterprise; (b) he recruited and directed various confederates, notably his girlfriend Wisky-Mota and members of her family; and (c) he claimed a right to a large share of the profits. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. nn. 2 &amp; 4; <em>see also United States v. Si Lu Tian, </em>339 F.3d 143,157 (2d Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Zichettello, </em>208 F.3d 72, 107 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Fourth, Bitini\u2019s attempt to demonstrate unwarranted sentencing disparity, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), by comparing himself to confederates who received lesser sentences necessarily fails in light of record differences in the roles and plea agreements of Bitini and the purported comparators. <em>See generally United States v. Florez, </em>447 F.3d 145, 158 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Finally, although Bitini asserts that his sentence violates the parsimony clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), under the \u201cdeferential\u201d standard of review that we apply to sentencing challenges, <em>United States v. Canora, </em>412 F.3d 331, 350 (2d Cir.2005), that conclusory assertion is insufficient to demonstrate that the Guidelines sentence imposed in this case is unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95,100 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">2. <em>Helen Yahara Wisky-Mota</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Wisky-Mota challenges her 63-month term of incarceration on the grounds that the district court (a) erroneously viewed the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory and (b) failed to consider the range of sentencing factors identified in \u00a7 3553(a). She urges us to infer these errors from the district court\u2019s sentencing statement that \u201cI think it is important to follow the guidelines and I intend to follow them.\u201d Wisky-Mota Sentencing Tr. at 9. We are not convinced. This court has itself recognized the particular importance of the Guidelines to sentencing determinations even after they were rendered non-mandatory by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738. As we observed in <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>the guidelines are not \u201cjust \u2018another factor\u2019 in the statutory list, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because they are the only integration of the multiple factors,\u201d 452 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2006) (citation omitted). For precisely this reason, we have concluded that \u201c[a] sentencing judge\u2019s decision to place special weight on the recommended guideline range will often be appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Capanelli, </em>479 F.3d 163, 165 (2d Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s decision to afford the Guidelines special weight in this case does not indicate that it impermissibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>gave them controlling weight. Indeed, that suggestion is undercut by both the formal judgment against Wisky-Mota, which on its face references the advisory nature of the Guidelines, and by the court\u2019s own statement to that effect a few weeks later at the sentencing of co-defendant Mojica-Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Because there is nothing else in the record to suggest that the district court failed to consider the totality of \u00a7 8553(a) factors in determining the sentence, <em>see United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30, 33 (recognizing \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that sentencing court considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201cin the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise\u201d), we reject Wisky-Mota\u2019s sentencing challenge as without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">3. <em>Gerry Mojica-Hernandez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Bitini\u2019s son, Gerry Mojica-Hernandez, similarly complains that his 70-month sentence is a result of the district court\u2019s erroneous mandatory application of the Guidelines. There is no merit to this claim because, at the time of sentencing, the district court explicitly acknowledged that \u201cthe guidelines are advisory.\u201d MojicaHernandez Sentencing Tr. at 6. To the extent Mojica-Hernandez questions the weight accorded the Guidelines by the district court, his argument necessarily fails in light of our decisions in <em>United States v. Rattoballi </em>452 F.3d at 133, and <em>United States v. Capanelli, </em>479 F.3d at 165.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">4. <em>Vely Antonio Mota</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Although Vely Antonio Mota, who was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 incarceration, filed a notice of appeal, his counsel has submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. at 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396 stating that there are no non-frivolous bases upon which to challenge Mota\u2019s plea or sentence. Upon review of the record, we agree. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment of convictions as to defendants Bitini, Mojica-Hernandez, and Wisky-Mota are hereby AFFIRMED; the motion of Mota\u2019s counsel to withdraw is GRANTED; and the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance of Mota\u2019s conviction and sentence is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. To the extent Mojica-Hernandez faults the district court for imposing a guidelines sentence notwithstanding the additional imprisonment <em>and </em>hardship he would face under immigration law, counsel withdrew this claim at oral argument in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Wills, </em>476 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2007). Accordingly, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
