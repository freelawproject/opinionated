Mendieta-Robles pleaded guilty to selling or offering to sell 1,000 grams of cocaine, a felony under Ohio Revised Code (\u201cORC\u201d) \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1). The immigration judge determined that this conviction qualified as a drug-trafficking \u201caggravated felony\u201d under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), subjecting Mendieta-Robles to deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Because we hold that Mendieta-Robles\u2019s Ohio conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the INA, we REVERSE the BIA\u2019s order dismissing Mendieta-Robles\u2019s appeal and REMAND this case to the BIA for entry of an order terminating deportation proceedings against Mendieta-Robles.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Mendieta-Robles, a citizen and native of Mexico, was lawfully admitted to the United States in 1996 as a conditional resident and adjusted to permanent-resident status in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In October 2002, Mendieta-Robles was arrested and charged in a two-count indictment with (1) trafficking in cocaine, and (2) possession of cocaine, in violation of ORC \u00a7\u00a7 2925.03 and 2925.11, respectively. Count One read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\"><em>Benjamin Medieta </em>..., on or about the 8th day of October in the year of our lord, 2002, within the county of Franklin aforesaid, in violation of section 2925.03 of the Ohio Revised Code, did knowingly sell or offer to sell a controlled substance included in Schedule II, to wit: methylbenzoylecgonine, commonly known as cocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding one thousand(l,000) grams of cocaine as defined in section 2925.01 of the Ohio Revised Code....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">(JA 105.) In September 2003, MendietaRobles pleaded guilty to Count One only, without specification, a felony in the first degree. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas sentenced Mendieta-Robles to four years\u2019 imprisonment and suspended his drivers license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Mendieta-Robles, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an admitted alien who had been convicted of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Specifically, the definition of aggravated felony includes \u201cdrug trafficking crimes\u201d and crimes involving \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). At his removal hearing, Mendieta-Robles conceded that he was convicted under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) of knowingly selling or offering to sell a controlled substance, and did not contest the amount of the controlled substance. Mendieta-Robles argued, however, that the statute was divisible and that a mere offer to sell is not an aggravated felony. On October 20, 2003, an immigration judge concluded that Mendieta-Robles\u2019s conviction under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) qualified as an aggravated felony and ordered Mendieta-Robles removed to Mexico. Mendieta-Robles timely appealed to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order and dismissed Mendieta-Robles\u2019s appeal, concluding that MendietaRobles had been convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of the INA and Sixth Circuit law. Mendieta-Robles timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">We review de novo whether a state drug conviction qualifies as an aggravated felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>ny under the INA. <em>Patel v. Ashcroft, </em>401 F.3d 400, 407 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he BIA\u2019s ultimate conclusion that a particular state conviction amounts to an aggravated felony conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) is reviewed <em>de novo </em>because such a conclusion depends upon interpreting state statutes and federal statutes unrelated to immigration.\u201d (citing <em>Chery v. Ashcroft, </em>347 F.3d 404, 407 (2d Cir .2003))).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">An admitted alien may be deported if he is convicted of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INA defines a multitude of offenses that qualify as aggravated felonies \u2014 for example, murder, rape, laundering over $10,000, managing a prostitution business, and commercial counterfeiting. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Certain drug offenses may also amount to aggravated felonies if they fall within the following definition: \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802]), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)]).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). In 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2), \u201cthe term \u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.),\u201d or two other federal acts not relevant here. The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d applies to violations of both federal and state law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We have interpreted the INA\u2019s definition to provide two routes for a state drug conviction to qualify as an aggravated felony. <em>United States v. Palacios-Suarez, </em>418 F.3d 692, 697 (6th Cir.2005); <em>Garcictr-Echaverria v. United States, </em>376 F.3d 507, 512 (6th Cir.2004); <em>accord Gerbier v. Holmes, </em>280 F.3d 297, 299 (3d Cir.2002). Under the first route \u2014 the \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d approach \u2014 a state drug conviction is an aggravated felony if it is (1) a felony under state law, and (2) contains a trafficking element. <em>See Garcia-Echaverria, </em>376 F.3d at 512; <em>Gerbier, </em>280 F.3d at 299. Under the second route \u2014 the \u201chypothetical federal felony\u201d or \u201chypothetical felony\u201d approach \u2014 a state drug conviction is an aggravated felony if it would be punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act, regardless of whether the conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under state law. <em>See Garcia-Echaverria, </em>376 F.3d at 512; <em>Gerbier, </em>280 F.3d at 299. The question then is whether MendietaRobles\u2019s state drug conviction under ORC \u00a7 2925.03 qualifies as an aggravated felony under either of these approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">To determine whether a prior conviction should be considered an aggravated felony for deportation purposes, we start with the analytical model constructed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See, e.g., Martinez-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 1022, 1025-26 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 144, 148 (3d Cir.2004); <em>cf. United States v. Sanders, </em>470 F.3d 616, 619 (6th Cir.2006) (employing <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>approach to determine whether a state conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act). Under this categorical approach, an adjudicator \u201cmust look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,\u201d and may not \u201cconsider other evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior crimes,\u201d including \u201cthe particular facts underlying [the] conviction[ ].\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In some cases, however, \u201cthe language of the particular subsection of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) at issue will invite inquiry into the underlying facts of the case,\u201d or \u201cthe disjunctive phrasing of the statute of conviction will similarly invite inquiry into the specifics of the conviction.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>383 F.3d at 148. In these cases, courts have interpreted <em>\u201cTaylor\u2019s </em>edict to include examination of documentation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction ..., such as the indictment, the judgment of conviction, jury instructions, a signed guilty plea, or the transcript from the plea proceedings[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotations marks, alterations, and citation omitted); <em>accord Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (explaining that in a nonjury case, a court might examine not only the \u201ccharging document\u201d but also \u201cthe terms of a plea agreement,\u201d the \u201ctranscript of colloquy between judge and defendant,\u201d or \u201csome comparable judicial record\u201d of information about the \u201cfactual basis for the plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Therefore, we must first analyze the statute that formed the basis of MendietaRobles\u2019s conviction. ORC \u00a7 2925.03 is a broad statute that reads in relevant part as follows: \u201cNo person shall knowingly ... [sjell or offer to sell a controlled substance[.]\u201d ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1). The statute punishes a broad range of conduct: an individual can be convicted under it for either selling drugs or merely offering to sell drugs, without possession or even transfer to a buyer. <em>State v. Chandler, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 223, 846 N.E.2d 1234,1236-37 (2006). Indeed, ORC \u00a7 3719.01(AA) defines \u201csale\u201d extremely broadly to include delivery, barter, exchange, transfer, or even gift. Under the statute, the offense is complete when an offer is made with the requisite intent \u2014 neither delivery of the drug, exchange of money, nor a direct unequivocal act towards a sale are necessary elements of the offense. <em>See, e.g., Chandler, </em>846 N.E.2d at 1236-37. This means, for instance, that a mere offer to give away marijuana falls within the ambit of ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The relevant documents and judicially noticeable facts do not indicate whether Mendieta-Robles was convicted of selling or merely offering to sell cocaine. Mendieta-Robles pleaded guilty to Count One only: \u201cin violation of section 2925.03 ... [Mendieta-Robles] did sell or offer to sell at least one thousand (1,000) grams of cocaine that is not crack cocaine.... \u201d (JA 105.) No other documents help clarify whether Mendieta-Robles did anything more than offer 1,000 grams of cocaine for sale, exchange, barter, or gift. Nothing in the record indicates whether MendietaRobles even possessed cocaine. To be sure, Mendieta-Robles did not plead guilty to Count 2 (possession of cocaine). The only indication that Mendieta-Robles may have done more than simply offer to gift cocaine is the title of Ohio\u2019s statutory section to which he pleaded: \u201cTrafficking offenses.\u201d ORC \u00a7 2925.03. How a state titles its statutory provisions, however, is irrelevant for determining the nature of the statute a defendant was convicted under. <em>See Warner v. Zent, </em>997 F.2d 116, 133 (6th Cir.1993) (\u201cSuch headings, however, do not constitute any part of Ohio law. Resort to a title in construing a statute is unnecessary and improper.\u201d). Indeed, the Ohio legislature has stated, \u201cTitle, Chapter, and section headings and marginal General Code section numbers do not constitute any part of the law as contained in the \u2018Revised Code.\u2019 \u201d ORC \u00a7 1.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">We now turn to whether Mendieta-Robles\u2019s Ohio conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under the two routes: (1) the \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d approach, and (2) the \u201chypothetical federal felony\u201d approach. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">A. \u201cIllicit Trafficking\u201d Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Under the \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d approach, a state drug conviction is an aggravated felony if it is (1) a felony under state law, and (2) contains a trafficking element. <em>Garcia-Echaverria, </em>376 F.3d at 512; <em>Ger</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>bier, </em>280 F.3d at 299. Here, there is no question that Mendieta-Robles\u2019s conviction under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) was a felony. The parties dispute, however, whether his conviction contains a trafficking element.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Mendieta-Robles\u2019s conviction does not contain a trafficking element. A trafficking element involves the \u201cunlawful trading or dealing of a controlled substance.\u201d Garci<em>a-Echaverria, </em>376 F.3d at 513 (citing <em>Gerbier, </em>280 F.3d at 305). \u201cEssential to the concept of trading or dealing is activity of a business or merchant nature, thus excluding simple possession or transfer without consideration.\u201d <em>Steele v. Blackman, </em>236 F.3d 130, 135 (3d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As already noted, ORC \u00a7 3719.01(AA) defines \u201csale\u201d extremely broadly to include delivery, barter, exchange, transfer, or even gift. Thus, an individual may be convicted under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) without the offered transfer being commercial in nature \u2014 MendietaRobles could merely have offered to gift 1,000 grams of cocaine. Consistent with this, neither possession nor exchange is a prerequisite to punishment under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1). <em>Chandler, </em>846 N.E.2d at 1236-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The Attorney General argues that Mendieta-Robles\u2019s conviction falls within the definition of \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d because either portion of the statute \u2014 selling or merely offering to sell cocaine \u2014 is, at least, \u201can attempt to sell cocaine for consideration \u2014 i.e. unlawful trading or dealing for profit.\u201d (Att\u2019y Gen. Br. 10 (underline omitted).) This argument, however, ignores ORC \u00a7 3719.01(AA), which defines \u201csale\u201d to include gift \u2014 a form of transfer that does not require consideration. <em>See, e.g., Guethlein v. Ohio State Liquor Control Comm., </em>No. 05AP-888, 2006 WL 827434, at *3 (Ohio App. Mar. 30, 2006) (\u201cThe usual and customary meaning of \u2018gift\u2019 is a \u2018voluntary transfer of property to another made gratuitously and without consideration.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 688 (6th ed.1990))).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Accordingly, an individual may be convicted under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) without trading or dealing in a controlled substance for profit. Here, neither the relevant documents nor judicially noticeable facts indicate whether Mendieta-Robles engaged in commercial trading or dealing of cocaine. Mendieta-Robles\u2019s conviction is therefore insufficient to establish that the underlying crime involved \u201cillicit trafficking.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d at 908 (\u201c[I]f the statute and the judicially noticeable facts would allow the defendant to be convicted of an offense other than that defined as a qualifying offense ..., then the conviction does not qualify as a predicate offense.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Thus, under the \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d approach, his conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">B. \u201cHypothetical Federal Felony\u201d Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Under the \u201chypothetical federal felony\u201d approach, a state drug conviction is an aggravated felony if it would be punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act, regardless of whether the conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under state law. <em>Garcia-Echaverria, </em>376 F.3d at 512; <em>Gerbier, </em>280 F.3d at 299. This approach \u201c \u2018require[s] a comparison between the elements of the [state] drug offense and [the elements of] a federal drug provision referenced in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2)....\u2019\u201d <em>Steele, </em>236 F.3d at 136 (quoting <em>Matter of Davis, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 536, 541,1992 WL 443920 (BIA 1992)). In making this determination, the BIA \u201clooks to what the convicting court must necessarily have found to support the conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>and not to other conduct in which the defendant may have engaged in connection with the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The Attorney General argues that, as the BIA found, Mendieta-Robles\u2019s state conviction is analogous to a felony conviction under two sections of the Controlled Substances Act: 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. We hold that neither are analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As an initial matter, \u00a7 841(a)(1) is not analogous to ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1). Section 841(a)(1) makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally \u201cmanufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance[.]\u201d \u201cThe term \u2018distribute\u2019 means to deliver ... a controlled substance.... \u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(11). Because ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) encompasses convictions where the individual neither possessed nor transferred a controlled substance, it is difficult to see how 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is analogous to the Ohio statute. It would mean that offering to sell cocaine is the same as delivering cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Moreover, the relevant documents and judicially noticeable facts fail to establish that Mendieta-Robles had the requisite mens rea to commit a distribution crime. To be convicted under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1), an individual need only intend to offer to sell a controlled substance. <em>Chandler, </em>846 N.E.2d at 1236-37; <em>see also State v. Mughni, </em>33 Ohio St.3d 65, 514 N.E.2d 870, 872 (1987) (holding that an offense is complete under ORC 2925.03(A)(1) when a person knowingly offers to <em>sell </em>a controlled substance); <em>State v. Scott, </em>69 Ohio St.2d 439, 432 N.E.2d 798, 799 (1982) (\u201cThe proscribed conduct is offering to sell a controlled substance, not offering the controlled substance. Therefore, our analysis of the statute should not turn on whether appellant transferred a controlled substance.\u201d). On the other hand, under \u00a7 841(a)(1), an individual must intend to or knowingly distribute a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (\u201c[I]t shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally ... distribute ... a controlled substance....\u201d); <em>accord, e.g., United States v. Pope, </em>561 F.2d 663, 670 (6th Cir.1977) (\u201cThe \u2018intent to distribute\u2019 is an essential element of \u00a7 841(a)(1).... 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) requires both general criminal intent and the specific \u2018intent to distribute\u2019 before a violation is proven.\u201d). Thus, the mens rea elements of each crime are substantially different. That is, an individual may be convicted under \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) without having any intent to distribute a controlled substance. <em>Cf. United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274-76 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that offers to transport, sell, furnish, administer or give away a controlled substance do not fall within the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2); <em>United States v. Foster, </em>No. 93-50402, 1994 WL 201201, at *1 (9th Cir. May 23, 1994) (\u201cORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(4) falls short of the federal definition of a controlled substance offense. It does not require the State to prove an intent to distribute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument that Mendieta-Robles\u2019s Ohio conviction is analogous to a conviction under \u00a7 846 must fail for the same reason. To be convicted of attempted distribution, the Government must prove that (1) the defendant acted \u201cwith the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime which he is charged with attempting,\u201d and (2) the defendant \u201cengaged in conduct constituting a substantial step toward commission of the crime.... \u201d <em>United States v. Stone, </em>960 F.2d 426, 433 (5th Cir.1992) (quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also, e.g., United States v. Pratt, </em>351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cAn attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to commit a crime, which is recognized as a crime distinct from the crime intended by the attempt, punishes conduct that puts in motion events that would, from the defendant\u2019s point of view, result in the commission of a crime but for some intervening circumstance.\u201d). Because, here, a hypothetical conviction under \u00a7 846 would require the government to prove that Mendieta-Robles acted with the same mens rea as a conviction under \u00a7 841, and because, as already noted, the mens rea elements of \u00a7 841 and ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) are substantially different, Mendieta-Robles\u2019s Ohio conviction would also not be punishable as a felony under \u00a7 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">C. <em>Matter of Garcia-Torres</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">A recent BIA decision supports our analysis. <em>In Matter of Garcia-Torres, </em>No. A45-864-724, (BIA Oct. 19, 2006), the BIA held that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Garcia-Torres\u2019s two convictions under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A) qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA. The BIA first addressed the \u201chypothetical federal felony\u201d approach. The BIA explained that offering to sell a controlled substance can be simplified to a verbal or written communication, which entails no physical delivery of a controlled substance, and, without the act of delivery, Garcia-Torres could not be found to have distributed cocaine. Similarly, the BIA also concluded that Garcia-Torres\u2019s conviction did not amount to an aggravated felony under the \u201cillicit drug trafficking\u201d approach. The BIA found that the record failed to disclose whether Garcia-Torres was convicted of selling cocaine for profit. The BIA noted that it is possible for an individual to be convicted under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) without trading or dealing in a controlled substance for profit. Even though the BIA found that the record did not support a conclusion that Garcia-Torres\u2019s conviction qualified as an aggravated felony, the BIA remanded the case to the immigration court to allow both parties the opportunity to introduce evidence as to whether either of Garcia-Torres\u2019s convictions qualified as an aggravated felony under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Although we agree with the BIA\u2019s analysis in <em>Garcia-Torres, </em>a remand in this case is unnecessary. As already noted, reviewing courts \u201cmust look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,\u201d and may not \u201cconsider other evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior crimes,\u201d including, \u201cthe particular facts underlying [a] convietion[ ].\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Only in limited circumstances may courts look beyond the conviction and examine documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish the conviction as a predicate conviction, such as the indictment, the judgment of conviction, a signed guilty plea, or the transcript from the plea proceedings. <em>Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d at 908. Because, in this case, the relevant documents are already part of the record, a remand to supplement the record is unnecessary. We have a complete record with which to make a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">D. Two Recent Supreme Court Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Finally, the Attorney General calls our attention to two recent Supreme Court decisions: <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007), and <em>James v. United States, </em>549 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Neither helps the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">In <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a conviction for aiding and abetting a theft, under California law, qualified as a \u201cgeneric theft offense\u201d under the INA. 127 S.Ct. at 820. In holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that the California conviction qualified, the Supreme Court rejected Duenas-Alvarez\u2019s argument that the California statute, under which he was convicted, punished conduct outside the scope of generic definition of theft (as the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states). <em>Id. </em>at 822. The Supreme Court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhF\">[mjoreover, in our view, to find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute\u2019s language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime. To show that realistic possibility, an offender, of course, may show that the statute was so applied in his own case. But he must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (non-generic) manner for which he argues. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The Attorney General takes <em>DuenasAlvarez </em>to mean that we should proceed assuming Mendieta-Robles was convicted of selling cocaine instead of offering to sell cocaine because it is less likely he was simply a cocaine offerer \u2014 despite the relevant documents\u2019 silence as to the specifics of Mendieta-Robles\u2019s conviction. This argument fails for two reasons. First, it requires us to ignore the clear language of ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) (\u201cNo person shall ... [s]ell or offer to sell a controlled substance\u201d), which expressly and unequivocally punishes both sales and offers. Second, that a defendant could be convicted under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) for offering to sell a controlled substance is not a \u201ctheoretical possibility,\u201d nor does it require \u201cthe application of legal imagination.\u201d Rather, as the Ohio Supreme Court has repeatedly stated, \u201c[undoubtedly, a person can be convicted for offering to sell a controlled substance in violation of [ORC] \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) without actually transferring a controlled substance to the buyer.\u201d <em>Chandler, </em>846 N.E.2d at 1236-37; <em>accord, e.g., Mughni, </em>514 N.E.2d at 872; <em>Scott, </em>432 N.E.2d at 799. Thus, <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Neither does <em>James v. United States </em>assist the Attorney General. In <em>James, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether attempted burglary, under Florida law, is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act. 127 S.Ct. at 1590. In holding that the Florida attempted-burglary statute did qualify as a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the Supreme Court explained that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>categorical approach does not \u201crequire[] that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute ... necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1597 (citing <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 815). \u201cRather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, <em>in the ordinary case, </em>presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Here, the Attorney General relies on <em>James </em>to contend that \u201cselling\u201d is the ordinary conviction under ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) and \u201coffering to sell\u201d is merely a conceivable factual offense covered by the statute. We do not agree for the same two reasons that <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>is inapposite. First, \u201coffering to sell\u201d is more than a conceivable factual offense covered by ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1). Section 2925.03(A)(1) by its own terms expressly contemplates and punishes offers to sell. ORC \u00a7 2925.03(A)(1) (\u201cNo person shall ... [s]ell or offer to sell a controlled substance\u201d). Moreover, as noted, the Ohio Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>an offense under section 2925.03(A)(1) is complete merely by making an offer to sell. <em>See, e.g., Chandler, </em>846 N.E.2d at 1236-37; <em>Mughni, </em>514 N.E.2d at 872; <em>Scott, </em>432 N.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the BIA\u2019s order dismissing Mendieta-Robles\u2019s appeal and REMAND this case to the BIA for entry of an order terminating deportation proceedings against Mendieta-Robles.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
