Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990). Whether the government sought permission to administer drugs on <em>Harper-type </em>grounds, and if not, why not, should ordinarily be determined at the outset as that determination (or what is learned in the course of it) may inform the decision-making process under <em>Sell, </em>or even obviate a merits determination on the question of trial competence. <em>See Sell v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 166, 183, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003). If there is some particular reason why a <em>Harper </em>analysis is not possible or indicated in this case, it would be helpful to know it. Otherwise, whether forced medication can be authorized on these alternative grounds should be considered and clear findings made as <em>Sell </em>suggests. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Second, we have difficulty with the district court\u2019s findings \u2014 and hence, its conclusion \u2014 under the first prong of <em>Sell. </em>Espinoza-Pareda\u2019s criminal history and the particular circumstances leading up to her arrest and indictment no doubt bear on the importance of the government\u2019s interest in bringing her to trial, because the nature of the offense and characteristics of the offender shed light on the seriousness of the crime. We recognize that courts are to \u201cconsider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the Government\u2019s interest in prosecution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 180,123 S.Ct. 2174, but Espinoza-Pareda\u2019s conduct in prison and in court following her indictment do not appear probative of the government\u2019s interest in prosecution. Because these were two of the five facts that influenced the district court\u2019s conclusion, on remand the court should reconsider it decision on <em>Sell\u2019s </em>first prong without factoring in post-indictment conduct. It is, of course, free to explain in the alternative why it believes these facts bear on the strength of the government\u2019s interest in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Further on prong one, <em>Sell </em>indicates that the potential for future civil confinement affects, though it does not \u201ctotally undermine,\u201d the strength of the need for prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 123 S.Ct. 2174. The record is undeveloped on this point. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>We cannot tell, for example, what the prospects of civil commitment are or whether they lessen, or increase, the government\u2019s interest in prosecution. The consequences of Espinoza-Pareda\u2019s failure to take drugs voluntarily, including the effect, if any, of lengthy confinement in an institution for the mentally ill on the government\u2019s interests in prosecuting her now, as well as the effects, if any, of such confinement on the potential for trial at the end of any such period, should be considered on remand and findings made with respect to them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Finally on this prong, the district court should consider, and make findings with respect to, the implications, if any, of <em>United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir.2006), for the seriousness of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We have not addressed Espinoza-Pareda\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s findings on <em>Sell </em>prongs two, three and four because inquiry into <em>Harper </em>grounds, and findings on prong one, are foundational. However, if the court orders forced medication on remand, then its order should also specify precisely which antipsychotic medication(s) the government is authorized to administer without further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">This panel will retain jurisdiction over further appeals, which will be expedited in the same fashion as this one has been. Meanwhile, the outstanding stay order shall remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
