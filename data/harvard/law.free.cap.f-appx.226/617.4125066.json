Abbott pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846. On appeal, Abbott\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Abbott\u2019s guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made because of her extensive history of substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">The attack on the voluntariness of Abbott\u2019s plea is not properly before us, however, because she failed to first raise the issue to the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by seeking to withdraw her guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>899 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990) (claim of involuntary guilty plea \u201cfirst must be presented to the district court and [is] not cognizable on direct appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-24\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we allow counsel to withdraw, and we affirm, on condition that he show that he has informed Abbott of the procedures for petitioning the Supreme Court for certiorari, in compliance with Part V of our plan to implement the Criminal Justice Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-20\">.
