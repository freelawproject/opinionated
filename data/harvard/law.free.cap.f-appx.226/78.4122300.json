Abrams, denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Patience Iyoha, </em>a.k.a. <em>Cheryl Ann Dennis, </em>No. A97 516 501 (B.I.A. Jul. 10, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 516 501 (Immig. Ct. Jamaica, N.Y. Nov. 22, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">A petitioner\u2019s attorney must \u201cinclude his most cogent arguments in his opening brief, upon pain of otherwise finding them waived.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. SEC, </em>406 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2005). Here, contrary to the arguments in her reply brief, Iyoha failed to directly address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in her opening brief to this Court. Although she offered conclusory assertions that her testimony was \u201ctotally uncontroverted\u201d and \u201cplausible,\u201d she did not point to any errors in the IJ\u2019s findings, nor did she acknowledge that the IJ made an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Although Iyoha also asserts that she implicitly challenged the IJ\u2019s credibility determination by discussing his related legal findings, we do not search for arguments \u201chidden between the lines of petitioner\u2019s brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is also inadequate that Iyoha eventually challenged the IJ\u2019s credibility determination in her reply brief, where arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief do not cure a prior waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">Accordingly, because we do not find that manifest injustice would result if we decline to reach the adverse credibility determination, we deem any challenges to it to be waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, the finding stands as a valid reason for the agency to have denied Iyoha\u2019s application for asylum. Finally, we note that Iyoha does not challenge the agency\u2019s denial of her applications for withholding of removal or for relief under the CAT. Therefore, we also deem these claims to be abandoned. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, Iyoha\u2019s previously granted motion to stay removal is VACATED, and her motion for release and to set bail is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
