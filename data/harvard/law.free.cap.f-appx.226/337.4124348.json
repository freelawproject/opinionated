Clark filed a personal injury claim with the VA under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), on September 23, 2002. <em>See </em>28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The VA\u2019s Regional Counsel denied the claim on March 10, 2004, and the Office of General Counsel denied it on review. The VA General Counsel informed Clark in a notice dated February 16, 2005, that he could file suit in federal district court within the six-month statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). That six-month period expired on August 16. Clark, however, did not file suit until October 25, more than two months late.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We find no support for Clark\u2019s argument that his untimely filed lawsuit is nonetheless preserved because the circumstances of the instant case merit equitable tolling. <em>See Clymore v. United States, </em>217 F.3d 370 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Perez v. United States, </em>167 F.3d 913 (5th Cir.1999). <em>Clymore </em>and <em>Perez </em>stand for the proposition that equitable tolling is available to plaintiffs who \u201cactively pursued judicial remedies but filed a defective pleading.\u201d <em>Clymore, </em>217 F.3d at 375 (quoting <em>Perez, </em>167 F.3d at 917). Clark does not fall within this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Moreover, Clark\u2019s asserted participation in ongoing settlement negotiations with the VA is irrelevant to the operation of equitable tolling because he has offered no evidence of misconduct on the part of the VA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Perez, </em>167 F.3d at 917 (equitable tolling appropriate when \u201cthe complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary\u2019s misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.\u201d). Finally, although his counsel\u2019s untimely filing mistake was unfortunate, such mistakes do not equitably toll the FTCA\u2019s limitations period. Clark\u2019s assertions of equitable estoppel and the doctrine of laches are likewise entirely inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">. In the district court, he argued that the chaos created by Hurricane Katrina justifies equitable tolling, but the storm made landfall thirteen days <em>after </em>the August 16 filing deadline elapsed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
