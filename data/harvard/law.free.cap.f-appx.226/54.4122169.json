Airborne Express, Inc., </em>No. 02 CV 3369, 2006 WL 229913 (E.D.N.Y. January 31, 2006). Plaintiff alleged that defendant breached its duty of fair representation to plaintiff by failing to seek arbitration of his grievance regarding the allegedly unlawful termination of his employment by defendant Airborne Express, Inc. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">We reject plaintiffs arguments substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Townes\u2019s careful and comprehensive opinion. We merely add that defendant\u2019s interpretation of the \u201caccommodation clause\u201d in plaintiffs bargaining agreement \u2014 on which plaintiff relies to suggest that defendants improperly declined to pursue arbitration \u2014 was a plausible, even if debatable, reading of that clause. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s behavior was not \u201cso far outside a wide range of reasonableness ... as to be irrational,\u201d as is required for plaintiff to prevail in showing a breach of representation by defendant. <em>Spellacy v. Airline Pilots Ass\u2019n-Int\u2019l, </em>156 F.3d 120, 129 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
