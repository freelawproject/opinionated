Pagan\u2019s first trial resulted in a mistrial due to a hung jury. Pagan appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for mistrial at the second trial following the prosecution\u2019s allegedly improper impeachment of a defense witness in violation of the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-22\">Pagan did not preserve this issue for appeal. He failed either to move to suppress in a timely manner following receipt of the government\u2019s notice to impeach or to object when the prosecutor asked questions touching on the witness\u2019s prior conviction. Additionally, Pagan was not prejudiced because his oral motion to strike evidence following the impeachment was granted, curative instructions were given, the impeachment was a single instance, and there existed substantial evidence of guilt against Pagan.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b767-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
