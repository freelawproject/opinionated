At an evidentiary hearing, counsel stated (and the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found) that initially Ledesma wanted to appeal, but after they discussed her case, he believed she no longer wished to appeal. Although Ledesma testified that she never discussed the possibility of appeal with her counsel, she now relies on his testimony to argue that she told him she wanted to appeal. The district court found counsel credible, concluding that Ledesma\u2019s desire to appeal was not made manifest to him, and therefore counsel did not fail in his duty to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">This court defers to a district court\u2019s credibility determination. <em>Barger v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1180, 1182 (8th Cir.2000) (affirming district court decision crediting attorney\u2019s testimony that his client did not request an appeal); <em>Green v. United States, </em>323 F.3d 1100, 1103 (8th Cir.2003) (same). Ledesma\u2019s assertion that she made a request is not \u201cby itself sufficient to support a grant of relief [under \u00a7 2255], if evidence that the fact-finder finds to be more credible indicates the contrary position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having carefully reviewed the record, this court finds that the district court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and no error of law appears. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>406 F.3d 505, 508 (8th Cir.2005); <em>Green, </em>323 F.3d at 1103; <em>Barger, </em>204 F.3d at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-24\">As an extended opinion would have no precedential value, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-20\">. The Honorable James E. Gritzner, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
