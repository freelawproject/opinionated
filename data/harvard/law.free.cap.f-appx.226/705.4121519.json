NELSON, SILER,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and HAWKINS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\"> The Honorable Eugene E. Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b730-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-22\">Charles Nowotny, a former police detective, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, the City of Huntington Beach, and several police officials. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-23\">The record established that, due to several disabilities, both mental and physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>cal, and even with reasonable accommodations, Nowotny was unable to perform his former position as a detective or a police officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence to which Nowotny points does not establish any genuine issue of material fact with respect to this question. Further leave to determine the final result of his knee surgery was not reasonable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> particularly given that he had disabling conditions besides his knee that also precluded his employment. The record also established that the City satisfied its duty to engage in the accommodation process required by California Government Code \u00a7 12940(n) and in the process required by the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Nowotny\u2019s age discrimination claim. Nowotny pointed to nothing that supported a \u201crational inference that <em>intentional discrimination, on grounds prohibited by the statute, was the true cause </em>of the employer\u2019s actions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, he failed to point to any evidence that could counter the City\u2019s proffered nondiseriminatory reason for his termination and summary judgment was appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">The district court also correctly granted summary judgment on Nowotny\u2019s First Amendment claims. Even assuming that the content of the parody newsletter addressed matters of public concern, which is questionable, Nowotny never directed his speech to the public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court correctly held that Nowotny\u2019s successful administrative appeal regarding the discipline imposed after the elevator incident precluded his inclusion of that discipline in his First Amendment retaliation claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the record conclusively established that the City would have placed Nowotny on disability retirement regardless of the article he wrote criticizing the police chief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we reject Nowotny\u2019s retaliation claims under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">Nowotny appeals three issues with respect to his claims under the Public Safety Officer\u2019s Procedural Bill of Rights (POBR).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nowotny did not raise the first issue, which involves the denial of an appeal regarding discipline imposed for the parody newsletter, before the district court. Accordingly, we decline to reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the first issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The second issue, regarding the City\u2019s request that Nowotny account for his whereabouts in its investigation of his alleged absence from duty, is moot.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Upon Nowotny\u2019s retirement, the City dropped the absence from duty charges and rescinded all discipline imposed. Thus, nothing is left to enjoin or prohibit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With respect to the third issue, the district court correctly held that the California Government Code \u00a7 3303 did not apply. The City\u2019s decision to retire Nowotny based on his disabilities, and the proceedings leading to that decision, were not punitive in nature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Finally, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Nowotny\u2019s claims of wrongful discharge and civil conspiracy. Nowotny established no genuine issues of material fact with respect to either issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b730-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">.
