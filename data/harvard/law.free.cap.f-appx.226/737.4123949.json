R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b762-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-23\">Petitioner petitions for review the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s affirmance of the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) order of removal and denial of her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-24\">Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not review them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-25\">Petitioner argues that the IJ erred in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress an authenticated 1-213. Petitioner argues that the admission of the 1-213 denied her the right to cross-examine the witnesses against her, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308 (9th Cir.1995). As in <em>Espinoza, </em>Petitioner has not presented any evidence contradicting the challenged evidence and has not alleged that the statements were not her own or were obtained through coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-26\">Petitioner also moved to suppress the 1-213 based on an asserted egregious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See Orhorhaghe v. INS, </em>38 F.3d 488, 493 (9th Cir. 1994). By her own account of the events, Petitioner admitted her identity, alienage, and lack of a driver\u2019s license before the police searched her car. The police therefore had probable cause to arrest Petitioner before the alleged violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. Her arrest for driving without a license and subsequent statements were thus not \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). That Petitioner\u2019s detention pursuant to a detainer was longer than the 48 hours provided for by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7 is immaterial to the Fourth Amendment analysis because that detention occurred after her statements to the INS agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Petitioner also argues that her rights under the Fifth Amendment and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B) were violated by the \u201cvoir dire\u201d conducted by the government during her hearing. The only statements made by Petitioner were that she understood that she was not in a criminal court, and that she recalled being taken into INS custody and interviewed by an INS agent. Petitioner does not explain how the voir dire might violate 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B); by its plain language, that provision is not implicated. Even if the voir dire somehow violated Petitioner\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment, the claim fails for lack of prejudice. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
