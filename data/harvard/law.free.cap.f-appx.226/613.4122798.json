Upon careful de novo review, <em>see Robinette v. Jones, </em>476 F.3d 585, 588-90 (8th Cir.2007), and for reasons stated by the district court, we affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Gossai\u2019s first through fifth claims, and the dismissal without prejudice of his sixth claim. We further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in partially denying Gossai\u2019s motion to amend the complaint. <em>See United States ex rel. Joshi v.
