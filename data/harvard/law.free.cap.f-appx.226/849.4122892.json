The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Tony Ray Ferguson pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. His counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California </em>and a motion for leave to withdraw as counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In her brief, counsel identified no non-frivolous issues for appeal; the brief was given to Ferguson. Ferguson did not file a responsive brief. However, he did announce his position in a motion to extend the time for filing, which we will construe as his response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his response, Ferguson argues the district court improperly enhanced his sentence under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for possessing a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense. The government responded to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and Ferguson\u2019s responsive brief. After thorough examination of the record, we agree with Ferguson\u2019s counsel that no non-frivolous grounds for appeal appear on this record. Therefore, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">In June and July 2004, Agent Joshua Petree arranged for a reliable confidential informant to purchase crack cocaine from Ferguson. During one meeting between the confidential informant and Ferguson, the informant noted Ferguson stored a semi-automatic pistol in a dresser by his bed. Subsequently, Petree sought and obtained a search warrant for Ferguson\u2019s residence. On July 28, 2004, law enforcement officers executed the warrant. In Ferguson\u2019s bedroom, they discovered crack cocaine in a trash can next to Ferguson\u2019s bed, a semi-automatic pistol in a laundry basket next to his bed, two sets of digital scales on top of his dresser and ammunition. They also found a set of digital scales in the kitchen and ammunition throughout the house. After the search, Petree interviewed Ferguson\u2019s ex-girlfriend, who was at the residence at the time of the search. She provided a writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ten statement in which she denied possessing the gun and drugs found in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">On November 3, 2004, Ferguson was indicted with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). On August 18, 2005, he pled guilty to the indictment. Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), Ferguson\u2019s presentence report (PSR) recommended a 4 level enhancement to his base offense level of 20 because a firearm was used in connection with the felony offense of possession of a controlled substance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The PSR also recommended subtracting 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 21. With a criminal history category of V, the guideline range was 70-87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">At Ferguson\u2019s initial sentencing hearing, Ferguson\u2019s ex-girlfriend was scheduled to testify. She allegedly was going to testify that the drugs found in Ferguson\u2019s home were hers and did not belong to Ferguson, thereby refuting the application of the USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. Her attorney appeared instead and explained she would not be testifying. The hearing was continued to allow Ferguson an opportunity to subpoena her; Ferguson\u2019s subsequent attempts to subpoena her were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">On February 13, 2006, Ferguson reappeared for sentencing. At the hearing, the court received evidence to determine whether the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement applied. Petree testified concerning the controlled buys and the items found in Ferguson\u2019s bedroom. When asked by the district court whether he had anything to say prior to sentencing, Ferguson stated his attorney was in possession of an affidavit from his ex-girlfriend stating the drugs belonged to her. If the court considered this document, he argued it would conclude his firearm possession was not in connection with any drug offense. The court noted the document was not introduced as evidence. Thus, there was no evidence before the court supporting Ferguson\u2019s allegations. Based on Petree\u2019s testimony, the court found a 4 level increase under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) was appropriate and sentenced Ferguson to 87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Ferguson claims the district court improperly enhanced his sentence under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l). In deciding \u201cwhether the district court properly applied the Sentencing Guidelines, [we] review[] its legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Fonseca, </em>473 F.3d 1109, 1112 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">Section 2K2.1(b)(l) of the sentencing guidelines provides for a four level increase in the base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d \u201cThe government must support the \u2018in connection with\u2019 element of the enhancement offense with a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Arrellano, </em>5 F.3d 464, 466 (10th Cir.1993). \u201c[A] weapon\u2019s proximity to narcotics may be sufficient to provide the nexus necessary to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).\u201d <em>United States v. Bunner, </em>134 F.3d 1000, 1006 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Ferguson complains his possession of the firearm was not in connection -with any other crime or offense. He argues his ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>girlfriend\u2019s affidavit should have been considered to show the enhancement was not applicable. In essence, Ferguson argues the district court should have considered an affidavit not in evidence. The district court cannot be faulted for such failure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under <em>Burner, </em>Petree\u2019s testimony, which demonstrated the proximity between the drugs and firearm/ammunition in Ferguson\u2019s bedroom, was sufficient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence Ferguson used or possessed the firearm and ammunition in connection with the felony offense of drug possession. The district court did not err in applying the enhancement. Thus, Ferguson has identified no non-frivolous issues for us to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Ferguson\u2019s attorney did not address Ferguson\u2019s claim of an affidavit, either in the district court or in her <em>Anders </em>brief. The record suggests the ex-girlfriend gave Ferguson's attorney some sort of statement, but does not indicate the statement\u2019s substance. Assuming Ferguson truthfully described the contents of the statement, the failure to admit it as evidence, if any, lies at the foot of counsel. To the extent Ferguson may have an arguable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, such a claim is best considered on collateral review. <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239, 1240 (1995) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
