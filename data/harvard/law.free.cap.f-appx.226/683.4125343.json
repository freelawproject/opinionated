We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review due process claims de novo, <em>Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, 255 </em>F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001), factual findings for sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>stantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), and the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">First, Velasquez-Andres\u2019 contention that the agency violated his due process rights by not recognizing the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Second, the agency properly conducted an individualized analysis to determine that country conditions in Guatemala had changed to rebut any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 1000-01 (9th Cir.2003). Because Velasquez-Andres failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Velasquez-Andres also failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief because he did not show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Guatemala. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Velasquez-Andres\u2019 motion to reopen because, as the BIA concluded, even if he satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he failed to show that he was prejudiced by the conduct of his first attorney. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 899-900 (requiring ineffecfive assistance of counsel claimants to show prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
