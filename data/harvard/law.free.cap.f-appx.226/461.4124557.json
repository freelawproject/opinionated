Kramer, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that the quality of mental health services provided by the Ohio prison system has decreased, that he was treated inappropriately by staff, and that he has been forced to take psychotropic medication. We reverse and remand in light of recent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-25\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b485-26\">In 2005, Kramer filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against Reginald Wilkinson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Dr. Ronald Moomaw<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in district court, alleging violations of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Kramer\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201c[m]ental health in the Ohio prison system, has gone down ...\u201d and that \u201ctwo doctors [have said he] would have to go off [his] medication (lithi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>um) because of kidney failure.\u201d Kramer also claims that he was placed in solitary confinement, sprayed with mace, and given shots against his will, all in an effort to force him to \u201cconform to his meds.\u201d In March 2005, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that Kramer failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Three days later, the district court, sua sponte, dismissed Kramer\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. The district court then denied Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We review the dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s civil rights claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies <em>de novo. Boyd v. Corrs. Corp. of America, </em>380 F.3d 989, 993 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The district court below dismissed Kramer\u2019s complaint for failure to prove exhaustion of administrative remedies pursuant to the Sixth Circuit\u2019s heightened pleading standards that were designed to facilitate the screening requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 110 Stat. 1321-71, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1997e <em>et seq. See Knuckles El v. Toombs, </em>215 F.3d 640, 642 (6th Cir.2000); <em>Brown v. Toombs, </em>139 F.3d 1102, 1103-04 (6th Cir. 1998) (per curiam). Under these heightened pleading standards, prisoners bore the burden of pleading and proving exhaustion. <em>See Brown, </em>139 F.3d at 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">In <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), however, the Supreme Court recently invalidated these heightened pleading standards, holding that \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921. Although <em>Jones </em>was not decided at the time the district court dismissed Kramer\u2019s complaint, it is now controlling precedent. Thus, Kramer does not bear the burden of specially pleading and proving exhaustion; rather, this affirmative defense may serve as a basis for dismissal only if raised and proven by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">We therefore REVERSE the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of Kramer\u2019s complaint and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-18\">.
