SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b841-25\">David G. Pflum, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>seeks a Certificate of Appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate or correct his sentence. For the reasons set out below, we decline to grant a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-26\">Mr. Pflum was convicted by a jury on eight counts of failure to pay quarterly employment taxes, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202, and three counts of failure to file a federal income tax return, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. He was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He appealed his conviction, claiming the district court erred in refusing to give the jury his proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>instruction on \u201cwillfulness,\u201d and in denying a motion to strike the testimony of two IRS agents regarding the amount of taxes Mr. Pflum allegedly owed the government. We affirmed. <em>United States v. Pflum, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 840 (10th Cir.2005). Regarding his second claim, we held that because Mr. Pflum\u2019s objection to the IRS agents\u2019 testimony was untimely, he could not assert a claim on appeal that the testimony was admitted in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Mr. Pflum filed the present \u00a7 2255 action asserting his counsel was ineffective for failing to object in a timely fashion to the agents\u2019 testimony and to the accompanying exhibits. In a thoroughly reasoned opinion, the district court denied Mr. Pflum\u2019s motion, concluding he had failed to show that his counsel\u2019s untimely objections prejudiced his defense at trial or resulted in an illegal sentence. Rec., vol. I, doc. 121. The court also denied Mr. Pflum\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>Id. </em>doc. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). A COA can issue only \u201cif the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cA petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In order to establish a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Pflum must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this deficient performance prejudiced his defense, depriving him of a fair trial with a rehable result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In determining Mr. Pflum failed to show that his counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced his defense, the district court found that the testimony and exhibits Mr. Pflum claims his counsel was deficient in failing to challenge pertained to the amount of taxes Mr. Pflum owed the government. After reviewing the trial record, the court concluded the amount of taxes owed was never a defense Mr. Pflum asserted at trial, and therefore his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the manner in which the amount was calculated did not interfere with Mr. Pflum\u2019s chosen \u201cgood faith\u201d defense. Moreover, the court noted Mr. Pflum\u2019s concession on appeal \u201cthat the challenged testimony of [the agents] \u2018affected only his sentence,\u2019 not his convictions.\u201d Rec., vol. I, doc. 121 at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Mr. Pflum contends on appeal that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object because \u201chis entire sentence was based on inadmissible evidence of the 28% of the wages that he did not deduct from his employees\u2019 wages.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 4. The district court concluded Mr. Pflum failed to show that, but for his counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance, the result at sentencing would likely have been different. The court pointed out that the amount of taxes Mr. Pflum owed could have been constitutionally determined by the court instead of the jury at a sentencing hearing <em>post-Booker. Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">After reviewing the record, we conclude Mr. Pflum has not demonstrated that jurists of reason could debate the district court\u2019s resolution of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Mr. Pflum\u2019s assertion that he would have been given a lesser sentence if his counsel had objected to the IRS agents\u2019 testimony and the government\u2019s exhibits is speculative at best and fails to meet the requirements of the second <em>Strickland </em>prong for a showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Accordingly, for substantially the same reasons given by the district court, we DENY Mr. Pflum\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-16\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-17\">. We liberally construe Mr. Pflum\u2019s <em>pro se </em>application. <em>See Hall v. Scott, 292 </em>F.3d 1264, 1266 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-18\">. Mr. Pflum\u2019s trial took place between the two Supreme Court opinions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The trial court, in an abundance of caution, submitted to the jury all applicable sentencing factors, including the amount in taxes owed by Mr. Pflum. Accordingly, the sentencing range faced by Mr. Pflum was calculated using facts found by a jury under the reasonable doubt standard. <em>See United States v. Pflum, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 840, 841 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
