We dismiss in part, deny in part and grant in part the petitions for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153,1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Babayan\u2019s motion to reopen to reapply for asylum based on changed circumstances affecting Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Armenia because Babayan faded to demonstrate that the agency\u2019s prior adverse credibility determination was in error. <em>See Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that a motion to reopen must establish a prima facie case demonstrating \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The BIA failed to address the petitioners\u2019 claims that the deadlines for filing their motions to reopen to apply for adjustment of status should have been equitably tolled. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[t]he BIA [is] not free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner\u201d). We remand for the BIA to address these claims in the first instance. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">No. 05-72911: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">No. 05-73276: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
