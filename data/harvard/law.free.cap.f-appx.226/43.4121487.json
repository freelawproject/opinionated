Morace denying as untimely petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen removal proceedings. <em>See In re Qui Hua Gao, </em>No. A 73 183 195 (B.I.A. June 23, 2004), <em>affg </em>No. A 73 183 195 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 22, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">On appeal, petitioner contends that the IJ abused his discretion in denying as untimely (by more than six years) her motion to reopen removal proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of petitioner\u2019s arguments is without merit. First, petitioner\u2019s argument that the IJ should have granted the motion to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of her allegedly <em>bona fide </em>marriage fails because proving a <em>prima facie </em>case of eligibility for relief is not sufficient to require that an IJ grant an untimely motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 108, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (noting the agency\u2019s \u201cright to be restrictive\u201d because granting motions to reopen \u201ctoo freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Second, petitioner\u2019s reliance on 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iv) is inapt because the record clearly demonstrates that the government, rather than agreeing to reopening (as required by that regulation), actively opposed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">Third, petitioner\u2019s argument that the IJ should have exercised his <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen removal proceedings is not reviewable by our Court. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[The decision] whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte </em>... is entirely discretionary and therefore, beyond our review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">Finally, petitioner\u2019s argument that the medical necessities of her U.S.-born child prevented her from voluntarily departing the United States is also unavailing. As Respondent\u2019s brief notes, \u201cthe IJ did not deny petitioner\u2019s application for adjustment as barred ... because petitioner failed to <em>depart voluntarily </em>[but] denied petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen <em>as untimely.\u201d </em>Respondent\u2019s Brief at 38 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of deportation is also hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">. Motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the entry of a removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-16\">. In particular, we reject petitioner\u2019s argument that she is entitled to equitable tolling of the statutory deadline for filing her motion to reopen due to ineffective assistance of counsel. It appears from the record that petitioner did not comply with the diligence require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ments for pursuing an ineffective assistance claim set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. at 9 (conceding that petitioner \u201cmay not have perfectly fulfilled all the requirements of <em>Lozada </em>\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
