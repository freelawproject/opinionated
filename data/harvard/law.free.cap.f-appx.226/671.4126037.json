Bright, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">Levit\u00f3n Manufacturing Company (\u201cLevit\u00f3n\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Q &amp; D Construction Inc. (\u201cContractor\u201d) and Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (\u201cSurety\u201d), the Contractor and Surety on a project to construct a building for Levit\u00f3n. The district court concluded that the architect and engineer were responsible for the defects at the building (awarding Levit\u00f3n damages from those parties), but determined that the Contractor followed the design specifications provided to it, precluding its liability. In addition, the court awarded the Contractor and Surety attorneys\u2019 fees from Levit\u00f3n because Levit\u00f3n rejected an offer of judgment made prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity of citizenship) and this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (final order). Levit\u00f3n appeals both the judgment and award of attorneys\u2019 fees as to the Contractor and Surety, setting forth nine issues on appeal. We reject Levi-ton\u2019s appeal pertaining to liability, but agree as to attorneys\u2019 fees and reverse the district court\u2019s order on that issue. The parties are familiar with the factual background and related proceedings so we confine this opinion to the issues before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">I. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b696-17\">Levit\u00f3n appeals the judgment in favor of the Contractor and Surety and the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. It argues that the district court should have held the Contractor and Surety liable and awarded additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>damages. Levit\u00f3n raises nine arguments on appeal. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard and review de novo principles of contract interpretation. <em>L.K. Comstock &amp; Co. v. United Eng\u2019rs &amp; Constructors, Inc., </em>880 F.2d 219, 221 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The first eight of Leviton\u2019s claims of error pertain to the district court\u2019s determination that the Contractor was not liable to Levit\u00f3n for damages resulting from defects in a warehouse building referred to as the distribution center. The contract required the Contractor to provide a cement mix for the architect\u2019s approval that met certain specifications in the contract documents, and the court concluded that the Contractor substantially performed those obligations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the court determined that while Levit\u00f3n showed some minor breaches by the Contractor, Levit\u00f3n failed to prove actual damages resulting from those breaches. The district court correctly considered the scope and performance of the Contractor\u2019s obligations. Its determinations in this regard are not clearly erroneous; Leviton\u2019s arguments to the contrary lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Leviton also challenges the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case. In <em>MRO Communications, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>197 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (9th Cir.1999), this court held that a defendant, sitting in federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction in a case applying Nevada substantive law, may recover attorneys\u2019 fees under state law by invoking its offer under the federal rule. <em>See id. </em>We need not reach whether attorneys\u2019 fees are available to the Contractor and Surety under <em>MRO </em>because regardless of whether <em>MRO </em>applies, Nevada law requires an evaluation of the <em>Beattie </em>factors before fees can be awarded. <em>See Beattie v. Thomas, </em>99 Nev. 579, 668 P.2d 268, 274 (1983). In the present case, the district court abused its discretion when applying those factors. We reverse the award of fees on that basis. <em>See MRO, </em>197 F.3d at 1279, 1283-84 (reviewing the decision of a district court to award attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to state law for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">The Nevada Supreme Court has held that when a court exercises its discretion to allow attorney\u2019s fees under Nev. R. Civ. P. 68<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it must consider four factors: (1) whether the plaintiffs claim was brought in good faith; (2) whether the defendant\u2019s offer of judgment was reasonable and in good faith in both its timing and amount; (3) whether the plaintiffs decision to reject the offer and proceed to trial was grossly unreasonable or in bad faith; and (4) whether the fees sought by the offeror are reasonable and justified in the amount. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>Beattie, </em>668 P.2d at 274. The court in the present case weighed each of these factors and concluded that all four factors weighed in favor of awarding fees. Leviton argues that the district court should not have found that (1) Leviton did not pursue its claims against Contractor and Surety in good faith and (2) Leviton\u2019s decision to reject the offer was grossly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In finding that Levit\u00f3n did not proceed against the Contractor and Surety in good faith, the district court concluded that Levit\u00f3n ignored evidence that the damage to the warehouse would have occurred regardless of who installed the concrete slab because the design was inherently defective. Levit\u00f3n disputes this characterization and relies on reports prepared by the Contractor\u2019s experts that attributed certain defects to the \u201cconcrete supplier\u201d and \u201cconcrete contractor.\u201d Although we accept the district court\u2019s findings that the design of the building and cement mix caused the building\u2019s defects, not the Contractor\u2019s execution of those designs, Levi-ton\u2019s belief that the district court would be persuaded otherwise was not unfounded. Provisions in the contract documents could be read to indicate that the Contractor\u2019s duties with respect to the mix might have required more than merely meeting the specifications. Although the district court ultimately determined that the weight of those factual discrepancies favored the Contractor, Levit\u00f3n nevertheless proceeded in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The district court also concluded that Leviton\u2019s decision to decline the $1.2 million offer was grossly unreasonable in light of the Contractor\u2019s and Surety\u2019s no-fault position, Leviton\u2019s waiver of consequential damages, and the Nevada precedent in the analogous case, <em>Home Furniture, Inc. v. Brunzell Construction Co., </em>84 Nev. 309, 440 P.2d 398 (1968). Leviton explains, to the contrary, that it reasonably believed it would recover from the Contractor and Surety and certain damages were properly characterized as direct, not consequential. Indeed, Levit\u00f3n reasonably believed that it would cost approximately $4,000,000 to repair the building, at least half of which amount would not have constituted consequential damages. While Leviton\u2019s decision to decline the offer proved to have been imprudent in hindsight, it was not grossly unreasonable at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Given these considerations, the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment in favor of the Contractor and Surety, but reverse the court\u2019s order awarding them attorneys\u2019 fees. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">. The court stated in its Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">2. Where, as here, the Contractor must follow the plans and specifications, he cannot be held liable for damages caused by defects inherent to the design. Rather, he remains liable only for damages directly caused by defects in his own workmanship or other fault on his part. <em>See Home Furniture v. Brunzell Construction Co., Inc., </em>84 Nev. 309, 314, 440 P.2d 398 (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">3. Contractor did not breach the Contract with regard to the placement, finishing or curing of the concrete slab in any way that substantially contributed to lost load transfer or unacceptably curled slab edges or which caused any other identifiable damage. Contractor substantially complied with its obligations under the Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">Leviton's E.R. at 505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-15\">. Nev. R.

(2) the offeree shall pay the offeror\u2019s post-offer costs, applicable interest on the judgment from the time of the offer to the time of entry of the judgment and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any be allowed, actually incurred by the offeror from the time of the offer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
