Swigert applied for social security disability and supplemental security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>income benefits, alleging a combination of disabling impairments including Type II diabetes, liver disease, hypertension, back pain, severe fatigue, severe acid reflux causing nausea, depression, and other mental disorders. After a hearing, the Commissioner\u2019s administrative law judge found that Ms. Swigert\u2019s diabetes, obesity, and back disorder are severe impairments, her other physical impairments are not severe, her mental impairments cause no more than slight limitations in the four relevant functional areas of daily living, and her subjective complaints are not fully credible. Crediting the testimony of a vocational expert, the ALJ found that Ms. Swigert is unable to perform her past relevant work but retains the residual functional capacity to perform the unskilled sedentary work of food and beverage order clerk and is therefore not disabled. After the Commissioner\u2019s Appeals Council denied Ms. Swigert\u2019s administrative appeal, she commenced this action seeking judicial review of the agency\u2019s final adverse action. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner, concluding that the decision is supported by substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole. Ms. Swigert appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On appeal, Ms. Swigert primarily argues that the ALJ erred in failing to afford controlling weight to the opinion of her primary treating physician that her impairments make rest \u201cnecessary at intervals and durations in Ms. Swigert\u2019s discretion\u201d during an eight-hour workday. The vocational expert testified that a person so limited is unable to work. The physician\u2019s opinion appears in a Medical Source Statement he completed at the request of Ms. Swigert\u2019s attorney. The form asked, \u201cWould rest be medically helpful to necessary during an 8-hour workday in coping with symptoms,\u201d and if so, at what intervals and for what time periods. The physician checked the <em>\u201cYes\u201d </em>box and wrote \u201cPt. discretion\u201d beneath the interval and time period questions. The physician\u2019s conclusory opinion that this amount of rest is necessary (as opposed to helpful) is unsupported by the extensive medical evidence in the record. Therefore, many of the physician\u2019s limitations, but not this disabling rest limitation, were included in the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity findings. This was not error. A treating physician\u2019s checkmarks on an MSS form may be discounted if they are contradicted by other objective medical evidence in the record. <em>See Stormo v. Barnhart, </em>377 F.3d 801, 805-06 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Hogan v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 958, 961 (8th Cir.2001); Social Security Ruling 96-2p, <em>Titles II and XVI: Giving Controlling Weight to Treating Source Medical Opinions </em>(July 2,1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Ms. Swigert further argues that the ALJ gave excessive weight to the opinions of a one-time consultative examiner, erred in failing to find her depression and mental disorders to be severe mental impairments, and did not properly evaluate the credibility of Ms. Swigert\u2019s subjective complaints of pain, fatigue, and depression. After careful review of the record, we agree with the district court that these contentions must be rejected because substantial evidence on the administrative record as a whole supports the ALJ\u2019s findings and analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\">. The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
