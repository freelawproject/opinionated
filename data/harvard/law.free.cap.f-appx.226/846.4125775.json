McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Defendant Juan Carlos Elizalde-Altamirano pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry of a deported alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and was sentenced to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment and twelve months of supervised release. At sentencing, the district court followed the recommendation provided in the presentence report and classified Defendant\u2019s prior Utah misdemeanor joyriding conviction as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d As a result, the district court imposed an eight-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Defendant appeals the imposition of this sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Martinez-Macias, </em>472 F.3d 1216, 1218 (10th Cir.2007). Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) calls for an eight-level sentencing increase where a defendant previously was deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201caggravated felony\u201d has the same meaning given that term by Section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. 3(A). According to INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(g), the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201ca theft offense (including the receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(g). The phrase \u201ctheft offense (including the receipt of stolen property)\u201d is not further defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Defendant previously received a one-year suspended sentence following his conviction in Utah state court for joyriding, a class A misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41-1a-1314(1). Under the INA, a misdemeanor conviction may qualify as an aggravated felony if a one-year sentence is imposed, even if that sentence is entirely suspended. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). Thus, the question facing this court is whether the term \u201ctheft offense\u201d as employed by the INA includes the crime of joyriding as defined by Utah law, such that joyriding must be labeled an \u201caggravated felony\u201d warranting the eight-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">In analyzing this question, we employ the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d established by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599-600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and need \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense\u201d to resolve the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <em>see also United States v. Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>388 F.3d 779, 782 (10th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">Under Utah law, a person is guilty of misdemeanor joyriding if he \u201cexercise[s] unauthorized control over a motor vehicle that is not his own, without the consent of the owner or lawful custodian, and with the intent to temporarily deprive the owner or lawful custodian of possession of the motor vehicle.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41-1a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>1314(1). We compare this definition to that set forth in <em>United States v. Vasquez-Flores, </em>265 F.3d 1122 (10th Cir.2001), which stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">distilled to its essence, ... the modern, generic, and broad definition of the entire phrase \u201ctheft offense (including receipt of stolen property)\u201d is a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1125 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Hernandez-Mancilla v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1002, 1009 (7th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Defendant argues that joyriding involves so limited a deprivation that it falls outside the generic definition of \u201ctheft offense.\u201d According to Defendant, joyriding \u201ccould entail only a brief borrowing of a vehicle without any significant interference with ownership rights\u201d and \u201cthe reference in <em>Vasquez-Flores </em>to deprivations which are \u2018less than permanent\u2019 is dicta.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Reply Br. at 2; <em>see id. </em>(\u201cIn ruling on this issue, the court in <em>Vasquez-Flores </em>did not need to consider, <em>and did not consider, </em>whether a minor, temporary deprivation of property should be considered as a theft offense.\u201d).) Rather, Defendant urges this court to apply the reasoning of the Model Penal Code, which \u201cdraws a fundamental distinction between a temporary unauthorized use of a vehicle and a theft.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Opening Br. at 15 (citing MPC \u00a7 223.9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Defendant\u2019s position that the generic definition stated in <em>Vasquez-Flores </em>is mere dicta is wrong. The fact that <em>Vasquez-Flores </em>dealt with a different Utah law does not alter the importance or necessity of its statement. Defining \u201ctheft offense\u201d in the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) context<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was essential to the determination of the issue on appeal in <em>Vasquez-Flores. See Rohrbaugh v. Celotex Corp., </em>53 F.3d 1181, 1184 (10th Cir. 1995) (\u201cDicta are \u2018statements and comments in an opinion concerning some rule of law or legal proposition not necessarily involved nor essential to determination of the case in hand.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 454 (6th ed. 1990))).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Moreover, <em>Vasquez-Flores </em>acknowledged the role the MPC played in the reasoning of other courts in deriving the broader generic definition and implicitly elected to define \u201ctheft offense\u201d more broadly than the MPC definition. <em>See Vasquez-Flores, </em>265 F.3d at 1124-25; <em>see also United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1205 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cAlthough use of the MPC is certainly a plausible approach, adoption of the standard established by the two other circuits that have construed the phrase makes more sense in a national context.\u201d). As we concluded in <em>Vasquez-Flores, </em>\u201c \u2018theft offense (including receipt of stolen property)\u2019 includes more crimes than just \u2018theft\u2019\u201d because Congress\u2019 intentional use of the phrase \u201ctheft offense\u201d \u201c \u2018signal[s] that it was not presenting an exhaustive list of offenses (i.e. just theft and receipt).\u2019 \u201d <em>Vasquez-Flores, </em>265 F.3d at 1124 (quoting <em>Hernandez-Mancilla, </em>246 F.3d at 1008). Accordingly, we interpret the phrase broadly. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Our interpretation leads us to conclude that the state statute fits within the federal generic definition. The fact that Section 41-1a-1314(1) criminalizes joyriding based in part on an \u201cintent to temporarily deprive the owner ... of the motor vehicle\u201d is completely in line with <em>Vasquez-Flores\u2019s </em>\u201cless than total or permanent\u201d intent language.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 815, 822, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007) (\u201c[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute\u2019s language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Based on our determination that a Utah misdemeanor joyriding conviction constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(g), we AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">. <em>Vasquez-Flores </em>concerned the predecessor to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), then designated \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-17\">. While we have rejected the view that whether a particular crime constitutes an aggravated felony under the definitions referred to in the Sentencing Guidelines depends upon how the crime is characterized under state law, <em>see United States v. Frias-Trujillo, </em>9 F.3d 875, 876 n. 1 (10th Cir.1993), we observe that Utah law treats both misdemeanor and felony joyriding as a lesser-included-offense of theft, <em>see </em>Utah Code Aim. \u00a7 41-1a-1314(5); <em>see also State v. Cornish, </em>568 P.2d 360, 362 (Utah 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
