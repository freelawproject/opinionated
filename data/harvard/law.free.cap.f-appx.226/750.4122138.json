Cabaccang, </em>332 F.3d 622 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) <em>(\u201cCa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>baccang I </em>\u201d), we held that the transport of drugs on a nonstop flight through international airspace from one location in the United States to another does not constitute importation within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 623. We therefore reversed the convictions on all of the importation-related counts of Roy, James, and Richard (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) and remanded to the district court to reconsider Roy\u2019s conviction for a continuing criminal enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 637. We affirmed the judgment of the district court on the counts that were not importation-related, adopting the decisions of the three-judge panel with respect to those counts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Appellants then filed a motion for clarification of the remand, asking us to remand James\u2019 and Richard\u2019s convictions and sentences on Count II of the indictment, conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and to remand Roy\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count VI, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. We denied the motion as to Count II but remanded Count VI. <em>United States v. Cabaccang, </em>341 F.3d 905 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) <em>(\u201cCabaccang II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">On remand, the district court concluded that our opinion and clarification order affirmed the non-importation-related convictions of James and Richard and that it accordingly lacked jurisdiction to resentence them. James and Richard contend that this was error. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\"><em>Cabaccang I </em>clearly stated that the convictions and sentences that were not importation-related were affirmed. <em>Cabaccang I, </em>332 F.3d at 637. The remand order concerned only Roy, not James or Richard. <em>See id. Cabaccang II </em>denied Appellants\u2019 motion to remand James\u2019 and Richard\u2019s convictions on Count II. <em>Cabaccang II, </em>341 F.3d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">James\u2019 and Richard\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Ruiz-Alvarez, </em>211 F.3d 1181 (9th Cir.2000) (as amended), is unavailing. Unlike <em>Ruiz-Alvarez, </em>in which \u201cresentencing was not inconsistent with the panel\u2019s decision,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1184, resentencing here would have been directly contrary to the express language of our decision. <em>See Mendez-Gutierrez v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e have repeatedly held, in both civil and criminal cases, that a district court is limited by this court\u2019s remand in situations where the scope of the remand is clear.\u201d); <em>United States v. Pimentel, </em>34 F.3d 799, 800 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (Where \u201cwe expressly limited the scope of our remand to consideration of a single sentencing issue ..., the district court was without authority to reexamine any other sentencing issues on remand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">\u201cThe rule of mandate requires a lower court to act on the mandate of an appellate court, without variance or examination, only execution.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Beltran, </em>443 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 319, 166 L.Ed.2d 239 (2006). Both <em>Cabaccang I </em>and <em>Cabaccang II </em>clearly limited the scope of the remand. The district court accordingly did not err in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to resentence James and Richard. The judgments of the district court on remand are</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
