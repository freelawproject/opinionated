On appeal, Brown argues that the district court unreasonably sentenced him above the guideline range without conducting any analysis regarding departures under the guidelines or the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, especially considering that the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) noted no factors warranting an upward departure, and the government did not ask for a higher sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">A grand jury indicted Brown for: (1) possession of counterfeit obligations, with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472; and (2) attempt to utter a counterfeit obligation with intent to defraud, in violation of \u00a7 472. Brown pled guilty to both charges, without the benefit of a plea agreement. The PSI assigned him a base offense level of 9, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.1, and reduced it by 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 7. Brown\u2019s criminal history included: (1) first degree petit theft, for obtaining checks belonging to the Okeechobee County School Board, in 1998; (2) battery in 1998; (3) attempted lewd/lascivious conduct on a child under 16, with the victim stating that he had forced her to have intercourse, in 1998; and (4) stalking in 2003. With a criminal history of V, his guideline range was 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. No objections to the PSI were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">At sentencing, Brown requested a sentence of time-served because, despite his high criminal history category, his conviction for attempted lewd conduct was more of an \u201colder boyfriend-younger girlfriend \u2014 18 and 16 \u2014 kind of combination that mom and dad didn\u2019t think too much of.\u201d He stated that he realized, for the first time when reading his PSI, that his criminal history was serious, and he wanted the court to give him the opportunity to \u201cturn things around.\u201d The court further questioned Brown about the nature of his attempted lewd conduct on a child conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The court then reviewed more of Brown\u2019s criminal history, stating, \u201cAll of this occurred \u2014 the theft occurred in April of '98, the battery occurred in July, the rape occurred in December. It was a good year, huh?,\u201d noting that Brown had received probation for the theft and battery, and all had occurred in the same year. Brown replied that the state was perhaps at fault for sending the wrong message. The court stated that the federal courts are \u201cnot within the guidelines anymore, other than to look at them and see if the guideline range is appropriate by looking at the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors ... and to the extent that we go outside the guidelines, that we impose a sentence that is reasonable.\u201d The court then stated that, considering all of the statements and the PSI, the guideline range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a sentence above the guideline range was merited, and it sentenced Brown to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brown objected to the sentence as unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted). We review for plain error, however, where the defendant did not state the grounds for an objection in the district court. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Brown has two separate grounds for arguing that his sentence was erroneous: (1) the district court did not follow the proper procedure for an upward departure, and (2) his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. The first challenge is without merit because the district court sentenced above the guidelines based not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, but rather, pursuant to its \u00a7 3553(a) authority. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam), <em>petition for cert. </em>filed, (U.S. Oct. 26, 2006) (No. 06-7517).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Brown has not met his burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (defendant bears the burden). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning a reasonable sentence. A district court need not explicitly consider every single \u00a7 3553(a) factor in order for the sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In fact, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Here, the court specifically reviewed Brown\u2019s criminal history with him, going through each crime and allowing him to explain, at one point noting that all the crimes had occurred within a year. The court also noted that Brown had been treated with \u201ckid gloves\u201d by the state. It stated that it had considered the statements of the parties, the PSI, and the guideline range, as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and then sentenced him above the guideline range, indicating that, to the extent that it was reasonable, a sentence above the guideline range could be imposed. Given that the court considered Brown\u2019s extensive criminal history of sexual impropriety and battery, and the fact that punishment had not deterred him previously, all factors under \u00a7 3553(a), the court\u2019s sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
