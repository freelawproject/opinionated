His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw, and Cardona-Saldana has filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Counsel notes in his <em>Anders </em>brief that his client is dissatisfied with the length of his sentence. The sentence, however, is the statutory minimum for the offense. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(viii); <em>United States v. Davidson, </em>437 F.3d 737, 741 (8th Cir.2006) (finding statutory minimum sentence not unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Cardona-Saldana seems to argue in his pro se supplemental brief that his trial counsel was ineffective, but such a claim should be raised, if at all, in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Hemandez, </em>449 F.3d 824, 827 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">After reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw subject to counsel informing appellant about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a cert petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-27\">.
