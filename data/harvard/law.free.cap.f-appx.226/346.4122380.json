(Fo was a fugitive for six years prior to sentencing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">A district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a safety-valve adjustment are reviewed for clear error; its legal interpretations, <em>de novo. United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1999). As noted, Fo claims only clear error by the district court in its findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u201cU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, also known as the \u2018safety valve\u2019 provision, limits the applicability of statutory minimum sentences in certain cases, specifically, those involving less culpable defendants who fully assist the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir.) (internal citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 555, 166 L.Ed.2d 413 (2006). To receive a safety-valve adjustment, a defendant must meet five criteria listed in \u00a7 5C1.2; if he does, the sentencing court may impose its sentence in accordance with the Guidelines rather than the statutory minimum. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In rejecting Fo\u2019s safety-valve-adjustment request, the district court found Fo had not satisfied \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5), which requires that, \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant ... truthfully provide! ] to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan\u201d. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). Fo maintains he made a timely and complete disclosure of all relevant facts surrounding the commission of the offenses charged. He also claims the district court\u2019s factual findings as to drug quantities likewise support the necessary findings for a safety-valve adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The defendant has the burden of establishing eligibility for the safety-valve reduction, including showing he truthfully provided the Government with all relevant information and evidence regarding the offense. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996). Information in the Presentence Investigation Report, which the district court adopted in relevant part, shows: Fo\u2019s involvement in the drug conspiracy extended beyond the two kilogram deals to which he admitted; and he was actively involved in negotiations regarding a sale of 100 kilograms of cocaine, a fact Fo denies. Despite Fo\u2019s contentions to the contrary, a review of the record shows Fo failed to truthfully provide the Government with all information and evidence regarding the instant offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); <em>Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d at 146-47. Accordingly, because the district court\u2019s safety-valve-reduction finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole, <em>see United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996), its challenged finding is <em>not </em>clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
