Oct. 20, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A79 419 306 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 15, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">When the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, then adds supplemental analysis, as it did here with Jzang\u2019s asylum and withholding claims, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review legal issues, and the application of law to fact, de novo. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Jzang, an unmarried young woman who has no children and has never been pregnant, and who has not alleged any personal contact with Chinese family planning officials in the past, asserts that she has a well-founded fear of persecution under the family planning policy. We are not compelled to conclude, contrary to the IJ and BIA, that she met her burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal. She cannot demonstrate <em>per se </em>eligibility for asylum based on her mother\u2019s sterilization, <em>see Shao Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 305 (2d Cir.2005), nor does the fact of her mother\u2019s sterilization, by itself, suggest that she faces a heightened risk of sterilization. Moreover, the IJ reasonably found that Jzang\u2019s general fears relating to future enforcement of the family planning policy were too speculative to be considered well-founded, absent any evidence in the record to suggest that someone in her particular situation was likely to face forced sterilization or comparable punishment. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s analysis of Jzang\u2019s CAT claim to any extent, we review only the BIA\u2019s rationale for denying that claim. <em>See Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271. We conclude that the BIA\u2019s denial of that claim is likewise supported by substantial evidence. The BIA reasonably found that Jzang failed to establish that she was more likely than not to be tortured based solely on the fact that she departed China illegally, and that she failed to allege any circumstances that would put her, in particular, at an elevated risk of torture. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). The back<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ground evidence she submitted, indicating that some individuals who left China illegally are imprisoned, and that human rights violations including torture occur in Chinese prisons, is insufficient to establish that she was more likely than not to be tortured. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 159-60. Finally, the BIA correctly noted that the 2004 State Department report indicated that individuals like Jzang, who had made only one illegal departure, might be subject to fines upon/repatriation, at most, and that a fine does not amount to torture. <em>See San Chung Jo v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 104, 109-10 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, the IJ did not violate due process by taking administrative notice of that report. It is well established that the agency may take administrative notice of current events bearing on an alien\u2019s claim, <em>see Qun Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 163 n. 4 (2d Cir.2002), and that State Department reports are generally considered the \u201cbest available\u201d source of information on country conditions. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Given that Jzang did not object to the IJ\u2019s taking of administrative notice during her hearing, and the record evidence was in any case insufficient to sustain her burden, she cannot establish that she was denied due process. <em>Cf. Ajdin v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 261, 265-66 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, Petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot, and Petitioner\u2019s pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
