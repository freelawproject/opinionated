We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s conclusions as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). The agency\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The IJ determined that Gao had failed to show an objective fear of future persecution, given that, at most, she would be subjected to a fine under the family planning policies on her return to China. As this finding is sufficient and supported by substantial evidence on the record, we need not, and hence do not, consider the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
