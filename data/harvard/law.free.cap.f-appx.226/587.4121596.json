Judgment was entered in October 2001, and no direct appeal was filed. In February 2005, Gordon filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court dismissed the motion as time-barred and denied a certificate of appealability. Gordon appealed the dismissal of his motion, and this court granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues: (1) whether Gordon\u2019s motion was timely filed; (2) whether Gordon\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance; and (3) whether Gordon\u2019s sentence was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we conclude that a panel opinion further addressing the issues raised would serve no jurisprudential purpose. We further note that this court has confirmed that <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply retroactively in collateral proceedings. <em>Humphress v. United States, </em>398 F.3d 855, 860 (6th Cir. 2005). Therefore, on the grounds identified by the district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
