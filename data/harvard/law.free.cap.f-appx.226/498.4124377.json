DuPont conceded responsibility for the accident, and a jury awarded Lawrence $3.2 million in damages. On appeal, DuPont argues that Lawrence did not introduce sufficient medical evidence to prove that his injuries from the accident were permanent, that Lawrence\u2019s vocational expert\u2019s testimony was unduly speculative and that the verdict form was prejudicially defective. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">For 24 years, Murray Lawrence worked as a free-lance welder, offering his special<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ized services to companies willing to buy his time. Because Lawrence was a skilled welder and because he was small enough to \u201cweld all the tight spots,\u201d JA 94, he worked regularly and earned an average of $36,000 to $42,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In early February 2003, Koch Specialty Plant Services Inc. contacted Lawrence and offered him an emergency welding job at a plant owned by DuPont in Old Hickory, Tennessee. Lawrence arrived at the job site on February 10 and welded for several days without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On the morning of February 16, however, a toxic cloud of methyl benzoate, methyl p-toluate, orthoxylene and water vapor burst from the pipes at the plant and enveloped Lawrence as he walked to his work site. Exposure to such toxins may cause \u201ccardiac stress, anemia ... respiratory difficulties, mucosal hemorrhage, possible liver and kidney damage\u201d and even death. JA 299. After Lawrence ran from the cloud and radioed his supervisor, a foreman took Lawrence to the plant\u2019s control room. Despite Lawrence\u2019s repeated requests for a doctor, DuPont employees waited four hours before taking Lawrence to see the company doctor. The company doctor gave Lawrence morphine for his headaches, took x-rays and tested Lawrence\u2019s blood, and he eventually told Lawrence that he could return \u201cto work in the morning.\u201d JA 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The next morning, however, Lawrence saw another doctor, who gave him analgesics for his headache and placed Lawrence under a nebulizer to cool the burning sensation in his lungs. This doctor referred Lawrence to a pulmonary specialist, who saw him the next day. The pulmonary specialist told Lawrence that he had \u201cinflamed lungs[,] ... a sinus infection, and ... a rash on [his] neck.\u201d JA 125. The specialist also sent Lawrence to take a pulmonary function test at another hospital, but Lawrence could not complete the test because his \u201cchest was hurting so bad.\u201d JA 125. Unable to work, Lawrence returned to his home in Fairhope, Mabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">In Aabama, Lawrence\u2019s family doctor referred him to a local pulmonary specialist, Dr. Michael Houston, who with Dr. Frank Hixon treated Lawrence for the next few years. Dr. Houston administered breathing tests to Lawrence on February 27, 2003, which showed that Lawrence had developed asthma. A computed-tomography scan of his sinuses showed \u201csubstantial sinusitis,\u201d which ultimately prompted Dr. Hixon to perform a sinus endoscopy on Lawrence a few months later. JA 174. In August 2003, Dr. Houston diagnosed Lawrence with \u201c[occupational induced lung disease,\u201d \u201cleft maxillary sinusitis\u201d and \u201csome degree of reactive airway disease.\u201d JA 177. Dr. Houston thought that Lawrence\u2019s symptoms were caused by the accident at the DuPont facility, and he pointed out that the chemical exposure had at least aggravated Lawrence\u2019s underlying sinus condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In a November 14, 2003, letter, Dr. Houston suggested that Lawrence had reached maximum medical improvement\u2014 that, despite Lawrence\u2019s remaining respiratory symptoms, it was \u201cas good as it\u2019s going to get ..., which is intermittent symptoms.\u201d JA 206. In a January 5, 2004, letter, Dr. Houston noted that \u201cit\u2019s quite obvious that [Lawrence] had a toxic gas exposure.... I believe it\u2019s imperative that Mr. Lawrence not be exposed to smoke or hazardous chemicals.\u201d JA 200. Dr. Houston also explained that \u201cI\u2019m uncertain how he will be able to continue his position as a welder\u201d unless \u201cappropriate respiratory modifications can be made\u201d\u2014 unless, in other words, there was a way he could work as a welder \u201cwithout being in a smokey, dusty environment.\u201d JA 200-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>In November 2004, Lawrence took a methacholine challenge test, which returned a negative result. Based on this test, Dr. Houston revised his diagnosis: Lawrence no longer showed signs of reactive airway dysfunction syndrome but still had \u201crecurrent respiratory symptoms\u201d and \u201crecurrent sinopulmonary symptoms.\u201d JA 194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On February 11, 2004, Lawrence filed this lawsuit against DuPont, claiming that DuPont\u2019s negligence exposed him to toxic fumes and caused a variety of injuries, some of them permanent. At trial, DuPont admitted negligence, and both parties agreed that the sole issue for the jury was the determination of damages arising from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Lawrence relied on Dr. Houston as his medical expert. Among other things, Dr. Houston testified that Lawrence still suffered from recurrent respiratory and sinopulmonary problems, had reached maximum medical improvement in his condition, and should not be exposed to fumes, smoke, dust or other irritants. Dr. Houston could not say whether Lawrence\u2019s \u201cintermittent recurrent respiratory symptoms\u201d were \u201cpermanent or not,\u201d JA 213, but when asked if he had an \u201copinion as to any type of permanent condition with his sinusitis[ ] and ... his pulmonary condition,\u201d Dr. Houston noted that Lawrence would have \u201clong-term issues in employment, ... I think he\u2019s going to have major problems with being exposed ... to common things that a welder is exposed to,\u201d JA 185. He also expected that Lawrence\u2019s sinusitis would aggravate his asthma. Dr. Houston linked all these problems to Lawrence\u2019s exposure to methyl p-toluate at the DuPont facility. <em>See </em>JA 172 (\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is sure how much [Lawrence] was exposed to, [but it was] enough to ... cause[ ] substantial problems.\u201d). Reviewing his treatment of Lawrence, Dr. Houston noted that he had previously prescribed Accolate, Allegra D, Astelin, Flonase, Prednisone, Singulair, Tylenol 3 and Zyrtec for Lawrence\u2019s sinus problems; Accolate, Albuterol, Combivent and Qvar for Lawrence\u2019s asthma; Advair, Flovent, Prednisone and Singulair for Lawrence\u2019s other pulmonary symptoms; and Augmentin and Quinoline as antibiotics. As of January 4, 2005, Lawrence was still taking Astelin, Albuterol and Quinoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Dr. Houston stressed that Lawerence \u201ccan\u2019t be in a dusty, smoky environment. He needs to be trained to do something else. That\u2019s what he needs. He needs ... a new occupation.\u201d JA 187. Dr. Houston said that he did not believe a welder could avoid \u201cfumes and the smoke and this dust,\u201d JA 178, and that short of a \u201cwind tunnel\u201d or a \u201cbubble,\u201d he could not see any modifications that could be made to allow Lawrence to return to his job as a welder, JA 204. All in all, because Lawrence needed a \u201cdust-free, irritant free, respiratory irritant free environment,\u201d JA 210, Dr. Houston testified that Lawrence is now \u201cunable to work as a welder,\u201d JA 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Dr. Roy Johnson testified as DuPont\u2019s medical expert. Based on an April 29, 2005, examination of Lawrence and laboratory results, Dr. Johnson concluded that the chemical exposure at the DuPont facility had \u201cprobabl[y] aggravated] ... preexisting sinusitis\u201d so that Lawrence now had \u201crecurrent sinusitis.\u201d JA 342. He explained that the exposure had likely caused Lawrence\u2019s reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, but that this condition had likely resolved itself. \u201cLawrence potentially could continue to work as a welder,\u201d Dr. Johnson said, \u201cif some reasonable job modifications could be made, such as use of a local exhaust system, a power air purifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>respirator, isolation or enclosure.\u201d JA 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Lawrence himself testified that the ventilation systems proposed by Dr. Johnson were unrealistic and that, with such restrictions, he would never find a job as a welder. Since his sinus surgery, Lawrence\u2019s sinuses \u201cdrain from the back,\u201d clogging his throat, \u201cehok[ing][him] at night\u201d and inducing coughing attacks. JA 143. His lungs sometimes \u201cclose up\u201d and \u201cget[] real sore\u201d so that he \u201ccan\u2019t stand for someone to touch [him] in [the] chest.\u201d JA 124. He testified that he sometimes gets a \u201cburning sensation in his throat when [he] eough[s]\u201d and that his chest frequently tightens up and \u201cburns all night.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He also has \u201cblurred vision in [his] left eye.\u201d JA 153. Lawrence stated that he had worked odd jobs around his home town since the accident and that he was taking five or six medications a day to treat his respiratory ailments. The medications make Lawrence \u201cvery forgetful\u201d and \u201cconfused,\u201d JA 144, and give him \u201cbad diarrhea\u201d and \u201cheadaches,\u201d JA 145. In short, Lawrence can no longer perform many routine activities \u2014 such as cleaning the bathroom with a chemical solvent like Tilex, jogging or playing with his three-year-old son \u2014 without significant difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Lawrence also called David Strauser, a vocational expert, to testify about Lawrence\u2019s lost future earnings and vocational disability. He said that the \u201cwork life expectancy\u201d of someone Lawrence\u2019s age was 13.4 years, but that most individuals would work a full 16 years to the age of 65. JA 242. Noting that Lawrence was unable to work as a welder, Strauser calculated Lawrence\u2019s post-accident yearly earnings to be $18,200. Concluding that Lawrence could have earned $42,000 a year as a welder had he not been injured, Strauser calculated Lawrence\u2019s loss of earning capacity to be between $318,920 and $380,800, depending on when Lawrence retired. JA 243. \u201cClearly,\u201d he said, \u201cLawrence has suffered a loss in his earning capacity as a result of the injuries he sustained at the DuPont facility.\u201d JA 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">At the end of the trial, DuPont asked the district court to include several questions on the verdict form. One of them asked the jury if Lawrence had a \u201cpermanent sinus injury\u201d; another asked if Lawrence had a \u201cpermanent [lung] injury.\u201d JA 36-37. The district court rejected both proposed questions. It instead gave the jury a special verdict form that read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">We, the jury, unanimously find that the defendant DuPont is liable to the plaintiff for the following damages, which have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">Non-Economic Damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">(a) Pain and suffering \u2014 past $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">(b) Pain and suffering \u2014 future $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">(c) Permanent impairment $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-14\">(d) Loss of the ability to enjoy life \u2014 past $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-15\">(e) Loss of the ability to enjoy life \u2014 future $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH8\">Economic Damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-16\">(f) Medical care/services \u2014 past $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-17\">(g) Medical care/services \u2014 future $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-18\">(h) Loss of earning capacity \u2014 past $_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-19\">(i) Loss of earning capacity \u2014 future $._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-20\">TOTAL $._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">JA 83-84. The jury returned a verdict of $3,174,627 in damages for Lawrence, which included $400,000 for permanent impairment, $1,997,725 for future pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment and medical expenses and $327,030 for loss of future earning capacity. The trial court rejected each of DuPont\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law as well as its motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">We give fresh review to the denial of DuPont\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Estate of Riddle v. S. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., </em>421 F.3d 400, 408 (6th Cir.2005). And we review the denial of DuPont\u2019s motion for a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Anchor v. O\u2019Toole, </em>94 F.3d 1014, 1021 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">DuPont first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, questioning whether it supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that Lawrence\u2019s injuries were permanent. As the company sees it, Lawrence\u2019s medical evidence was \u201cequivocal,\u201d \u201cself-contradictory\u201d and ultimately insufficient to submit the case to a jury. Br. at 13. As we see it (or at least as we believe a reasonable jury could see it), the medical evidence supports a damages award premised on permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">As a federal court sitting in diversity, we follow the state-law rules governing evidentiary challenges to the jury verdict. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652; <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78-79, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>K&amp;T Enters., Inc. v. Zurich Ins. Co., </em>97 F.3d 171, 176 (6th Cir.1996). Under Tennessee law, \u201c[fjindings of fact by a jury in civil actions shall be set aside only if there is no material evidence to support the verdict.\u201d Tenn. R.App. P. 13(d); <em>Overstreet v. Shoney\u2019s, Inc., </em>4 S.W.3d 694, 718 (Tenn.Ct. App.1999). A verdict, however, cannot be based on pure conjecture, <em>Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Whittemore, </em>59 Tenn.App. 495, 442 S.W.2d 266, 274 (1969), and to submit the \u201cissue of permanency of all but the most obvious injuries\u201d to a jury, Tennessee law requires expert medical testimony on the subject, <em>Owens Ill., Inc. v. Lane, </em>576 S.W.2d 348, 350 (Tenn.1978); <em>see also Miller v. Willbanks, </em>8 S.W.3d 607, 615 (Tenn. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Once we give Lawrence the benefit of \u201call reasonable inferences to sustain the verdict,\u201d as we also must do under Tennessee law, <em>Alley v. McLain\u2019s Inc. Lumber &amp; Constr., </em>182 S.W,3d 312, 316 (Tenn.Ct.App. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), we believe that the jury had sufficient medical evidence from which to conclude that Lawrence\u2019s injuries were permanent and that he would sustain damages from his injuries in the future. Dr. Houston, Lawrence\u2019s medical expert, testified that the chemicals at the DuPont facility had caused, or at least substantially aggravated, Lawrence\u2019s respiratory and sinus problems. And Dr. Houston gave every indication that these problems were permanent: Lawrence had reached the maximum medical improvement since the injury and yet still suffered from recurrent respiratory and sinus problems that required him to avoid smoke, chemical fumes and dust. Dr. Houston also repeatedly testified that Lawrence would have \u201clong-term issues in employment,\u201d JA 185, because he needed a \u201cdust-free, irritant free, respiratory irritant free environment,\u201d JA 210, which (as other evidence confirmed) was simply unavailable to a welder. <em>See </em>JA 178, 185, 187, 200, 203-04. Even DuPont\u2019s own medical expert, Dr. Johnson, acknowledged that Lawrence had \u201crecurrent sinusitis within reasonable medical probability,\u201d JA 325, and that at most Lawrence could \u201cpotentially\u201d return to his work as a welder but only with substantial accommodations, JA 324. <em>See also </em>JA 342 (diagnosing Lawrence with \u201crecurrent sinusitis\u201d); <em>cf. Barron v. State of Tenn. Dep\u2019t of Human Sens., 184 </em>S.W.3d 219, 222 (Tenn. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">DuPont responds that Dr. Houston\u2019s testimony cannot support the verdict because he never declared that Lawrence\u2019s injury was permanent \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d Br. at 18. Tennessee law, however, does not have an unyielding requirement that expert medical opinions be phrased only in terms of a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d \u201c[Njothing in Tennessee law requires that those or any other specific words be recit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ed in order for expert testimony to be admissible.\u201d <em>State v. Young, </em>No. 01C01-9605-CC-00208, 1998 WL 258466, at *22 (Tenn.Crim.App. May 22, 1998); <em>see also Mitchell v. Ensor, </em>No. W2001-01683-COA-R3-CV, 2002 WL 31730908, at *11 (Tenn.Ct.App. Nov.18, 2002); <em>Jackson v. Allen, </em>No. M2000-01673-COA-R3-CV, 2002 WL 661930, at *2 (Tenn.Ct.App. Apr.23, 2002). While the absence of <em>any </em>reliable medical testimony will condemn a verdict, the record \u201cin its entirety\u201d must be bereft of competent medical evidence in order to prohibit a finding of permanent injury. <em>Barron, </em>184 S.W.3d at 222. <em>Compare, e.g., Singleton v. Procon Prods., </em>788 S.W.2d 809, 811-12 (Tenn.1990) (overturning award when doctor merely stated that permanence was \u201cpossible\u201d); <em>Owens Ill., </em>576 S.W.2d at 350 (overturning award when permanent injury was \u201cjust a possibility\u201d); <em>Int\u2019l Yarn Corp. v. Casson, </em>541 S.W.2d 150, 152 (Tenn.1976) (overturning award when injuries \u201cmay be with [plaintiff] for the rest of her life, or they may not be, depending on what the future holds\u201d); <em>Md. Cas. Co. v. Young, </em>211 Tenn. 1, 362 S.W.2d 241, 243 (1962) (overturning award when the injury \u201ccould\u201d be permanent and that it was \u201cvery possible] ... but I couldn\u2019t tell you more [than] that\u201d); <em>Porter v. Green, </em>745 S.W.2d 874, 877-78 (Tenn.Ct.App.1987) (overturning award when doctor stated that \u201cwe don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with [one plaintiff], even to today\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m almost sure [the other plaintiff] has some chronic problem\u201d); <em>with Walker v. Saturn Corp., </em>986 S.W.2d 204, 207 (Tenn.1998) (upholding award when doctor restricted plaintiffs use of her right thumb based on a \u201cchronic\u201d condition); <em>Hill v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>937 S.W.2d 873, 875-76 (Tenn.1996) (upholding award when doctor required that plaintiff no longer work near a particular chemical); <em>Jones v. Walters, </em>1989 WL 54103, at *2 (Tenn.Ct.App. May 23, 1989) (upholding award even though doctor admitted that plaintiff could \u201cspontaneously get better with time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Even if Tennessee law does not require medical testimony concerning the permanence of an injury to be phrased in terms of a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d DuPont points out that Dr. Houston expressly disclaimed that the injury was permanent. Dr. Houston, DuPont notes, gave this equivocal response \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s permanent or not,\u201d JA 213\u2014 when DuPont asked him on cross-examination, \u201cAre you able to state within a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether or not [Lawrence\u2019s recurrent respiratory symptoms] [are] permanent?\u201d But in view of the specific question that DuPont\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Houston as well as the remainder of Dr. Houston\u2019s testimony, <em>see Int\u2019l Yarn, </em>541 S.W.2d at 152 (\u201c[T]he testimony of the witness must be considered in its entirety....\u201d), it is clear that Dr. Houston was addressing Lawrence\u2019s <em>respiratory </em>symptoms <em>(i.e., </em>his lung condition), not Lawrence\u2019s recurrent sinusitis (ie., his sinus condition). At most, this question thus undermines the weight of the medical evidence regarding the permanence of Lawrence\u2019s respiratory symptoms, not the permanence of his sinus conditions. <em>See Gardner v. Steinforth, </em>No. 01A01-9307-CV-00327, 1994 WL 55365, at *4 n. 1 (Tenn.Ct.App. Feb.25, 1994) (noting that doctor\u2019s equivocal testimony \u201cweaken[s]\u201d but \u201cdo[es] not completely destroy\u201d reasonably certain medical testimony elicited earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">DuPont further contends that Dr. Houston\u2019s testimony was \u201cinternally inconsistent\u201d and therefore cannot be credited at all. Br. at 26. While \u201c[contradictory statements of a witness in connection with the same fact have a result of cancelling out each other\u201d under Tennessee law, <em>Tibbals Flooring Co. v. Stanfill, </em>219 Tenn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>498, 410 S.W.2d 892, 896 (1967), Dr. Houston\u2019s statements regarding the permanence of Lawrence\u2019s injury do not suffer from this defect. He consistently maintained that Lawrence needed a \u201cdust-free, irritant free, respiratory irritant free environment,\u201d JA 210, that Lawrence could not return to his work in any other environment, that Lawrence had reached maximum medical improvement and that Lawrence had \u201crecurrent sinopulmonary symptoms,\u201d JA 195. As a result of the accident, Lawrence now faced long-term pain and suffering \u2014 including sinus drainage, aggravated asthma, coughing attacks, a \u201cburning sensation\u201d in his throat and chest, JA 124, and \u201cblurred vision\u201d in one eye, JA 153 \u2014 and needed to take several medications that made him \u201cvery forgetful\u201d and \u201cconfused,\u201d JA 144, and gave him \u201cbad diarrhea\u201d and \u201cheadaches,\u201d JA 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">DuPont persists that Dr. Houston acknowledged that Lawrence was \u201cable to return to gainful employment\u201d in a November 2003 letter, JA 205, which (DuPont claims) is necessarily inconsistent with his other testimony given that Lawrence was a welder and given that the most likely \u201cgainful employment\u201d to which Lawrence would return was work as a welder. This argument, however, hardly gives Lawrence the benefit of all reasonable inferences and, worse, ignores the context in which Dr. Houston wrote the letter. Just three months before writing this letter, Dr. Houston had diagnosed Lawrence with \u201c[ojccupational induced lung disease\u201d and \u201creactive airway disease,\u201d JA 177, casting doubt on whether he would be able to work at all \u2014 in any profession. In the interim, Lawrence\u2019s medical condition improved, prompting Dr. Houston to conclude that Lawrence could now work, but not necessarily that he could work as a welder. In the historical context of Dr. Houston\u2019s treatment of Lawrence, in the context of a record in which all agreed (including Dr. Houston) that Lawrence could not return to a work environment that contained dust, chemical fumes or smoke and in the context of a record in which ample evidence showed that it was impractical for welders to insist on working in an environment free of dust, chemical fumes or smoke, it becomes clear that Dr. Houston\u2019s letter conveyed the point that Lawrence could now work in <em>some </em>capacity, not that he could return to work as a welder. On this record, the jury could consider Dr. Houston\u2019s testimony and could rely on it in awarding damages premised on permanent injuries to Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">DuPont seeks a new trial on the ground that Strauser\u2019s loss-of-earning-capacity calculations were unduly speculative. <em>See John E. Green Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., Inc. v. Turner Constr. Co., </em>742 F.2d 965, 968 (6th Cir.1984) (prohibiting damage awards based solely on \u201cmere speculation, guess, or conjecture\u201d). The record undermines this argument: Lawrence testified that, on average, he earned between $36,000 and $42,000 per year; Lawrence\u2019s tax return showed that his actual salary for 2002 ($36,875) fell within that range; DuPont failed to introduce any evidence to the contrary; and Strauser candidly explained to the jury that he used the top of Lawrence\u2019s salary range in preparing his calculations. The range that Strauser presented to the jury (from $318,920 to $380,800) thus represented a reasonable, not a speculative, estimate of Lawrence\u2019s lost earning capacity, and the jury\u2019s award at the low end of that range ($327,030) shows that it critically considered Strauser\u2019s expert testimony rather than unthinkingly speculating about an appropriate award.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>DuPont separately maintains that the jury verdict on loss of future earning capacity must be vacated because the final figure of $327,030 \u201cis not adjusted to the present value as required by the jury instructions.\u201d Br. at 42. Besides saying that this is what happened, however, DuPont offers no reason \u2014 record supported or otherwise \u2014 to doubt the jury\u2019s good faith in following the court\u2019s instructions regarding the present value of any award. <em>See </em>JA 484 (\u201c[Y]ou must adjust the award of [future] damages to allow for the reasonable earning power of money and the impact of inflation.\u201d). And although DuPont critiques the award on the ground that the jury did not pick the low or high end of Strauser\u2019s range (but rather a number in between), the fact remains that Strauser never testified that these were the only alternatives available. In the final analysis, the law requires only the \u201cdegree of certainty that the nature of the case admits,\u201d <em>John E. Green Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., </em>742 F.2d at 968 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), and the jury award falls well within this modest \u2014 and necessarily flexible \u2014 requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">DuPont also seeks a new trial on the ground that the special verdict form did not say that \u201cpermanency of injury [was] a necessary predicate to a finding of future damages,\u201d making the form prejudicially misleading. Br. at 33. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Although general verdicts are the norm, a district court \u201cmay require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a). When a court uses a special verdict form, it must explain the form in a way that \u201cenable[s] the jury to make its findings upon each such issue.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Hickson Corp. v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., </em>260 F.3d 559 (6th Cir.2001). We leave the decision to use a special verdict to \u201cthe sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Workman v. Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>165 F.3d 460, 465 (6th Cir.1999), just as we do with respect to the \u201cdiscretion\u201d of district courts to \u201cdraft[ ] jury instructions\u201d generally, <em>United States v. Prince, </em>214 F.3d 740, 761 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Broad as the trial court\u2019s discretion may be in choosing a verdict form, it is not unlimited. If the instructions and special verdict form, taken together, are \u201cconfusing, misleading and prejudicial,\u201d we will require the district court to hold a new trial. <em>Hostetler v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>123 F.3d 387, 393 (6th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Alpine Indus., Inc., </em>352 F.3d 1017,1027-28 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The special verdict form used by the district court in this instance did not run into any of these problems. By stipulation of the parties, the verdict form did not ask if DuPont was negligent. It instead listed nine categories of damages that the jury could award. By distinguishing among these categories of damages that the jury <em>could </em>award, the form ensured that the jury could award certain damages (such as \u201cpermanent impairment\u201d or \u201closs of earning capacity \u2014 future\u201d) only if Lawrence had proved his entitlement to each of them \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d JA 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">At least one Tennessee appellate court has approved a similar form \u2014 and language \u2014 when parties disputed the damages arising from an injury. <em>See Over-street v. Shoney\u2019s, Inc., </em>4 S.W.3d 694, 713 (Tenn.Ct.App.1999) (approving a special verdict form that states: \u201cIf [the defendant is liable], set forth the amount of damages, if any, you find have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence in each of the following categories,\u201d followed by a list of the nine categories of damages used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>here). The form used by the district court also closely follows one approved by the Tennessee Judicial Conference. <em>See 8 </em>Tenn. Prac. Pattern Jury Instr. T.P.I.\u2014 Civil Appendix B, Form 3, at 579-80 (2006) (stating in relevant part: \u201cDecide the total amount of damages sustained by plaintiff. ... What amount of damages, if any, which have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d and listing the nine categories of damages at issue here).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The district court, moreover, removed any lingering risk of confusion from the use of this form through its instructions to the jury. The district court instructed the jury (1) that Lawrence was only \u201centitled to recover compensation for any injury that was legally caused by the negligent conduct of DuPont,\u201d JA 481; (2) that the jury should \u201cnot duplicate damages for any element by also including that same loss or harm in another element of damage,\u201d <em>id; </em>(3) that if Lawrence had a preexisting condition, then he was \u201centitled to recover damages only for any aggravation of the preexisting condition,\u201d JA 482; (4) that Lawrence had to \u201cprove the future effect of [his] injury with reasonable certainty\u201d and that the jury could not rely on \u201cmere conjecture or ... possibility,\u201d JA 483; and (5) that the jury should \u201center either zero or an amount of money for the various kinds of injury\u201d described on the verdict form, JA 485. These instructions thus properly made clear what the jury could, and could not, do in awarding each type of damages, removing any risk of confusion about the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u201cTo allow the jury to conclude that Lawrence has a permanent injury without specifying what injury he has,\u201d DuPont persists, \u201cforced the jury to speculate ... about Lawrence\u2019s current condition.\u201d Br. at 36. Yet a general verdict form \u2014 which, as DuPont acknowledges, is the norm\u2014 would not solve <em>that </em>problem. And DuPont offers no explanation why the special verdict used here required any more speculation than a general verdict would require. No less importantly, it did not take speculation to conclude that Lawrence suffered a permanent injury. As we have shown, Dr. Houston linked Lawrence\u2019s recurrent sinusitis to the accident at the facility and repeatedly asserted that Lawrence could work only in a \u201cdust-free ... respiratory irritant free environment.\u201d JA 210. And because of his long-term injuries, Lawrence testified that he now deals with sinus drainage; aggravated asthma; coughing attacks; a \u201cburning sensation\u201d in his throat and chest, JA 124; and \u201cblurred vision\u201d in one eye, JA 153; and needs to take several medications that make him \u201cvery forgetful\u201d and \u201cconfused,\u201d JA 144, and give him \u201cbad diarrhea\u201d and \u201cheadaches,\u201d JA 145. In the face of the medical evidence, it is speculation only <em>on our part </em>that would allow us to conclude that the jury based its decision on conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
