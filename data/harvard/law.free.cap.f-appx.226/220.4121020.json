Catanzaro appeals <em>pro se </em>from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging violations of his constitutional rights in divorce proceedings and a prior civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-23\">In September 2005, Catanzaro filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint, asserting that the defendants conspired to violate his rights to due process, meaningful access to the courts, and equal protection by effecting the dismissal of his federal civil rights action in <em>Catanzaro v. County of Lackawanna, et al., </em>Civ. A. No. 01-01865 (M.D.Pa., Nov. 1, 2002). He alleges that Judges Cottone and Murray, Special Divorce Master Sotak, Catanzaros\u2019 ex-wife, Josephine, and her attorney, Brian Cali, \u201cwere believed to be\u201d members of a plan or agreement between Judges Harhut and Jones to deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Catanzaro\u2019s Constitutional rights. He claims that Judge Jones evidenced his prejudice against Catanzaro in Civ. A. No. 01-01865 by referring to him in various interlocutory orders as a \u201cdisgruntled divorce litigant.\u201d According to Catanzaro\u2019s allegations, Judge Jones declined to disqualify himself and proceeded to deny all of Catanzaro\u2019s motions and grant the defendants\u2019 motions, including their Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal motions. He claims that Judge Harhut conspired with Judge Jones by encouraging Judge Jones to deny Catanzaro due process, access to the courts, and equal protection, in the federal civil rights action, just as Judge Harhut did in Catanzaro\u2019s divorce proceedings in 1997. He also alleged that the state defendants conspired in ordering the execution of a temporary Protection from Abuse Act order against him. He seeks damages and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">After the defendants filed Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, Catanzaro filed a motion to amend his complaint, which the District Court granted in May 2006, ordering that Catanzaro file the amended complaint within fifteen days. The District Court denied Catanzaro\u2019s requests to extend the time for filing an amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 7, 2006, the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 Rule 12 dismissal motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The District Court held that the Complaint was barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations. Noting that Catanzaro alleged a conspiracy beginning in 1997 and ending in 2002, the District Court determined that Catanzaro knew or should have known of the injury upon which his civil rights action was based when Judge Jones dismissed the complaint and denied consideration in Civ. A. No. 01-01965 in late 2002, and at the very latest in January 2003, when Catanzaro filed a notice of appeal. Using that latest date, the District Court calculated that Catanzaro \u00a7 1983 complaint, filed in September 2005, was at least eight months too late. The District Court ruled that Catanzaro\u2019s action against the judicial defendants was barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity, in any event, because the Complaint alleged acts performed by the judges within the scope of their judicial duties, specifically, making rulings unfavorable to Catanzaro. Thus, the judicial defendants enjoy absolute immunity from Catanzaro\u2019s suit for damages against them. <em>See Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). The District Court also summarily granted the non-judicial defendants\u2019 Rule 12 dismissal motions, which claimed that the Complaint failed to allege an \u201cagreement\u201d among or between any of the defendants to deprive Catanzaro of his constitutional rights, and failed to allege state action under \u00a7 1983, to the extent that Catanzaro raised non-conspiracy related claims against private-party defendants Brian Cali and Josephine Catanzaro. Catanzaro timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will summarily affirm for essentially the same reasons set forth by the District Court in its Order entered August 7, 2006. The District Court properly held that the Complaint was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Because the \u00a7 1983 Complaint was properly dismissed and no substantial question is presented by this appeal, Appellee Cali\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted and the District Court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\">. For the reasons set forth in its opinion, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to extend the time for filing an amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
