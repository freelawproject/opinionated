Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw, and Smith has filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">With or without the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, Smith has not shown that the district court based the sentence on an improper or irrelevant factor or failed to consider a relevant factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 840, 163 L.Ed.2d 715 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">After reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), as well as considering Smith\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, we conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-39\">. The Honorable Mark W.
