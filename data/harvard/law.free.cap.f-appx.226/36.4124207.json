We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">When the BIA denies a motion to reconsider, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006)(per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conelusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Shang\u2019s motion to reconsider. In denying the motion, the BIA properly relied on Shang\u2019s failure to identify any legal or factual error in its prior decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 90. The BIA noted that it had denied Shang\u2019s motion to reopen because it was untimely and she did not establish that it fell within an exception to the filing deadline by adequately demonstrating meaningfully changed circumstances in China. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The BIA properly considered the fact that Shang\u2019s prior motion was not supported by specific evidence that Chinese nationals returning to Zhejiang province with children born abroad were subjected to forced sterilizations. <em>Matter of C-C- </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 899, 902-03 (BIA 2006). <em>But see Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109, 114-15 (2d Cir.2006) (remanding case for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>BIA to consider documents purporting to show that foreign-born children would be counted in Fujian province in determining violations of China\u2019s one-child policy).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Further, the BIA acknowledged that Shang had provided generalized evidence of country conditions and a statement from her father that two people from her town had been forcibly subjected to the family planning policy. The BIA properly found that Shang did not identify evidence it previously overlooked concerning mistreatment of Chinese nationals returning home with foreign born children following the implementation of the 2002 family planning law. Therefore, the BIA properly denied Shang\u2019s motion and provided adequate reasoning for doing so. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">. We decline to remand in light of the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents. In <em>Shou Yung Guo, </em>we remanded to the BIA because it had failed to sufficiently examine several administrative decisions from the Fujian Province family planning authorities which indicated that a parent of children born abroad would be subject to forced sterilization. 463 F.3d at 115; <em>see also Jin Xiu Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>468 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006) (taking \u201ccognizance\" of the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents in the record); <em>Tian Ming Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>473 F.3d 48 (2d Cir.2007) (remanding based on the existence of the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents). However, the <em>Shou Yung </em>Guo documents are not relevant to Shang\u2019s case because they pertained to family planning practices in Fujian Province, whereas Shang is from Zhejiang Province.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
