Barker argues that the Texas Department of Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Justice grievance procedures were unavailable at the time of his injury. Alternatively, Barker asserts that he should be exempt from the \u00a7 1997e exhaustion requirement due to his physical and mental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The Supreme Court recently held \u201cthat failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Under <em>Jones, </em>the district court erred by dismissing the case because Barker did not demonstrate in his pleadings that he had exhausted his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
