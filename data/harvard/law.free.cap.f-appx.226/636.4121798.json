At sentencing, over Harrell\u2019s objection, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and sentenced Harrell to 168 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. He appeals, contesting the two-level enhancement. Reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>district court\u2019s finding for clear error, <em>see United States v. Braggs, </em>817 F.3d 901, 904 (8th Cir.2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The district court concluded that, because two handguns and $7,700 in admitted drug proceeds were found in Harrell\u2019s house, it was not clearly improbable that there was a nexus between the guns and drug activities; the court also noted the presence of a small amount of crack cocaine in the house plus drug-packaging paraphernalia in the detached garage. The court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>169 F.3d 531, 533 (8th Cir.1999) (\u201cclose proximity of firearms and \u2018drug money\u2019 can give rise to an inference that the firearms are present to protect the money and drugs, which is a nexus sufficient to support an enhancement under 2D1.1(b)(1)\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), comment. (n.3) (clearly improbable standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. The Honorable Linda R. Reade, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
