Hladylowycz, denying petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Song Hua Lien, </em>No. A77-998-379 (B.I.A. Nov. 10, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77-998-379 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 26, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir. 2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. As the IJ properly noted, Lian\u2019s testimony about when his girlfriend first discovered that she had become pregnant is inconsistent. Lian first testified that his girlfriend first learned that she was pregnant in July 2001, when \u201cshe went to her friend[\u2019]s private clinic for [an] exam.\u201d However, on cross-examination, Lian stated that his girlfriend learned that she was pregnant in August 2001, when \u201cshe went to get [a] check up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The IJ did not err in finding Lian\u2019s testimony that \u201che and his girlfriend ... ran to the roof of the home and then [he] abandoned his girlfriend on the roof and was able to jump off the roof and find safety at a neighbor\u2019s home and ultimately at a neighboring village\u201d to be implausible. Although Lian\u2019s account of his escape may not be inherently unbelievable, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to credit this testimony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d at 73 &amp; n.7. Furthermore, the IJ properly noted that this account of Lian\u2019s escape was missing from both his asylum application and his girlfriend\u2019s letter. While \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the application process do not often lend themselves to a perfectly complete and comprehensive recitation of an applicant\u2019s claim to asylum or withholding,\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003), it was reasonable for the IJ to expect that Lian\u2019s girlfriend would have mentioned Lian\u2019s dramatic escape in her letter. A reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to credit Lian\u2019s explanation that \u201cshe didn\u2019t bring that up because she\u2019s too much in pain.\u201d <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005). Substantial evidence, therefore, supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the absence of corroboration cast a negative inference on the Lian\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Additionally, the IJ properly relied on the significant inconsistencies between Lian\u2019s airport interview and the account of persecution he presented during his immigration hearing. While the immigration officer\u2019s question \u2014 'What is the purpose of your visit to the United States today?\u201d\u2014 may not have been designed to elicit the details of Lian\u2019s asylum claim, Lian answered the question with specificity by stating, \u201cI want to stay with the girl that I came with, I want to get married and stay here. She came with me and she is preg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>nant and they wanted to get me so we ran away.\u201d Because nothing in the record suggests that Lian was reluctant to reveal information to immigration officials, or that Lian did not understand English or the translations provided, the IJ properly relied on the transcript of the airport interview. The transcript and testimony were inconsistent on the central issues of whether Lian\u2019s girlfriend was in the United States or China at the time of his entry, and whether his girlfriend was pregnant at the time Lian entered. These inconsistencies provide substantial support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Finally, the IJ properly relied on Lian\u2019s failure to corroborate his assertions that his parents had been detained with a letter from a his parents substantiating that portion of his claim. An applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony may bear on credibility, because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question. <em>See Zhou Yun </em>Zhang, 386 F.3d at 78. There is nothing in the record to indicate that it would be unreasonable for the IJ to expect a statement from Lian\u2019s parents corroborating his assertion that they had been detained. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was also supported by Lian\u2019s failure to produce correspondence from his parents that would corroborate his testimony on this central issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Lian\u2019s life or freedom was his testimony, the adverse credibility determination pursuant to the asylum claim necessarily precludes success on Lian\u2019s claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Finally, Lian\u2019s CAT claim is unexhausted, as he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 165-69,174 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">. Accordingly, Lian\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
