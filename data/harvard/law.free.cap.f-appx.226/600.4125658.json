Barnhart, who was originally the named Commissioner of Social Security at the time of the complaint and oral argument in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b625-20\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">In 2001, Allen Adkins applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under the Social Security Act, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(I), 423, 1382(a)(3)(A), claiming disability due to mental retardation, breathing problems, and chronic pain. Adkins\u2019s claim was denied at the initial levels of administrative review and on reconsideration. Adkins then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ found that Adkins was not disabled and was capable of working within certain limitations. On appeal, Adkins raises only the issue of disability based on mental retardation. The record contains substantial evidence in support of the finding that Adkins failed to qualify for disability based upon mental retardation under Listing 12.05C, and furthermore because we are convinced that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Adkins has received all the process he is entitled to, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Adkins was born on December 31, 1956. He completed the eighth grade in special education classes. He was gainfully employed performing the duties of a general laborer, including assembling waterbeds, servicing trucks, carrying furniture, working as a security guard, driving a delivery truck, as well as repairing machines in a factory. In December of 1998, at forty-one years of age, Adkins was injured at work when a 400-pound drum fell on his chest, fracturing his ribs and puncturing his lung, necessitating surgical intervention including the removal of a portion of one of his lungs in the following March of 1999. He has remained unemployed since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The next month, in April of 1999, Adkins consulted with a Dr. Dennis Zawadski, a pulmonary specialist, who after examination determined that Adkins smoked and suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, right pleural effusion with fibrothorax,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reduced forced vital capacity, and dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion. Dr. Zawadski prescribed Celebrex for pain relief. The following September, Dr. Michael G. Koelsch, Adkins\u2019s thoracic surgeon, released Adkins to return to work, advising him against working in dusty environments or other areas with strong chemical smells that might affect his lungs and interfere with his breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In 2000, Dr. Paucen N. Mathur, another pulmonary specialist, concluded that Adkins was suffering from early emphysema, and that his fibrothorax, initially diagnosed in 1999, had healed fairly well. Later that year Adkins consulted with another physician, Dr. Scott B. Taylor, board certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation, who diagnosed degenerative disk disease in Adkins\u2019s back and recommended physical therapy. Dr. Taylor determined that Adkins struggled -with heavy lifting, but would be able to perform sedentary work, such as truck driving, and employment that required no continuous or repetitious lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">In 2001, Adkins was examined by Dr. Anton N. Kojouharov, a general practitioner, at the behest of the state disability determination service. Dr. Kojouharov found that Adkins\u2019s pain increased with bending or lifting and recommended a lifting restriction of fifteen pounds. He also noted cervical spine pain, lower back pain, COPD, and nicotine addiction. Dr. A. Landwehr, a state agency medical consultant, concluded that Adkins could perform medium-level work activities, including lifting twenty-five to fifty pounds and standing, sitting, and walking for as much as six hours in a workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">In 2002, Dr. Amy M. Carter, a primary care physician, saw Adkins and found that he was suffering from respiratory problems, lower back pain, arthritis, and depression. She prescribed Celexa to treat anxiety and depression. In April 2003, Carter opined in a letter regarding Adkins\u2019s disability claim that Adkins had \u201cvery few occupational options\u201d due to his various medical problems as well as his very limited education. In November 2003, Dr. Carter examined Adkins again and concluded that he was \u201cpermanently unable to work due to chronic pain and dyspnea s/p lobectomy\u201d (difficult or labored breathing after surgical removal of a portion of a lung).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>At a hearing in October 2002, testimony was presented by Dr. Mark 0. Farber, a medical expert in internal medicine and lung diseases, concerning Adkins\u2019s damaged lungs, stemming in part from his 1998 accident, and degenerative joint disease, as well as concerns about his mental ability. Dr. Farber, appearing at the ALJ\u2019s request, testified that Adkins was suffering from restrictive lung disease and COPD associated with long-term smoking. Dr. Farber also stated that Adkins had degenerative joint disease and a history of anxiety and depression, as reported to his primary care physicians. Dr. Farber also determined that Adkins did not meet the criteria for any of the listed impairments. Dr. Farber opined that Adkins would be able to lift twenty pounds occasionally, ten pounds frequently, and work about six hours a day with periodic breaks while alternating sitting and standing. Adkins testified that he attended special education classes in school, even though his IQ had never been tested. At the request of Adkins\u2019s attorney, the ALJ ordered that a psychological evaluation combined with intelligence testing be conducted and appointed the necessary experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Thereafter, the two court-appointed psychologists, Dr. Ceola Berry and Dr. Susan Spencer, examined Adkins and concluded that Adkins had problems with cognition and mental health. Dr. Berry diagnosed dysthymic depression with anxiety features and nicotine dependency, and she rated Adkins poorly in his ability to work. Dr. Spencer determined that Adkins\u2019s Verbal IQ was sixty-eight, his Performance IQ was seventy, and his Full Scale IQ was sixty-six \u2014 all scores falling within the classification of \u201cmildly mentally handicapped.\u201d On the other hand, Dr. Spencer failed to classify him as being mentally retarded; instead she reported \u201cNo Diagnosis on Axis II,\u201d where a diagnosis of mental retardation would ordinarily be expected. She believed that these IQ scores were a \u201crelatively valid representation\u201d of Adkins\u2019s intellectual capacity, but also cautioned that the scores might be lower because he was suffering from depression as well as chronic pain. Spencer found that Adkins read at a fifth-grade level, a \u201clevel sufficient to read information required in his past line of work.\u201d Spencer also administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and noted that Adkins had \u201cclaimed many more psychological symptoms than most patients do,\u201d thus suggesting that he might be \u201cexaggerating his symptoms in order to gain attention or services\u201d or may possibly be suffering from \u201cunusually severe psychological problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">At a supplemental hearing before the ALJ in February 2004, Dr. Jack E. Thomas,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an independent, court-appointed psychologist, disagreed with some of the conclusions offered by Drs. Berry and Spencer. Dr. Thomas opined that Adkins\u2019s psychological symptoms seemed to be exaggerated and that the indications of severe mental limitations did not comport with evidence in the record of Adkins\u2019s usually intact cognitive status. Dr. Thomas stated that the validity scales on Adkins\u2019s MMPI suggested a \u201cfake bad, exaggerated profile,\u201d meaning Adkins might be exaggerating his symptoms. He also identified internal inconsistencies in Dr. Spencer\u2019s report and ultimately rejected the suggestion made by Adkins\u2019s attorney that Adkins was mentally retarded and stated that he may possibly suffer from a learning disability. Dr. Thomas opined that the overall data suggested a \u201cless than severe\u201d mental impairment that fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>short of meeting or equaling any listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In April 2004, in concluding that Adkins was not entitled to benefits, the ALJ used the familiar five-step inquiry. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. In the first step the ALJ considers the applicant\u2019s present work activity. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). Second, the ALJ weighs the severity of the applicant\u2019s impairment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). The impairment or combination of impairments must significantly restrict an applicant\u2019s physical or mental ability to perform basic work activities or an ALJ should enter a finding of not disabled. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). Third, the ALJ decides whether the impairment or combination of impairments meets or equals an impairment listed within the regulations that are conclusively disabling. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If an ALJ is unable to make a disability determination in the first three steps, then the process proceeds to an assessment of the applicant\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(e). At the fourth step, the ALJ determines whether the RFC prevents the applicant from performing his or her past relevant work. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). If not, in the fifth and final step the ALJ uses the assessment of RFC to determine if the applicant can make an adjustment to other work based on the applicant\u2019s age, education, and work experience. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v). In the last step, the burden is on the Commissioner to demonstrate that the applicant is capable of performing other work \u201cin the national economy.\u201d <em>Butera v. Apfel, </em>173 F.3d 1049, 1054 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The ALJ found that: (1) Adkins had no history of performing substantial employment since his accident and the alleged onset of his disability in March 1999; (2) Adkins had a variety of severe impairments, including COPD, lumbar and cervical disc disease, and a mild cardiac impairment; (3) Adkins did not have an impairment that met or equaled a listed impairment in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4; (4) Adkins could perform his past work as a sedentary semiskilled security guard-patroller; and (5) Adkins also could perform similar sedentary light and unskilled occupations such as hand sorting and assembly, as long as he avoided certain environmental conditions that aggravated his breathing problems. The ALJ also found that Adkins\u2019s \u201cveracity in general is somewhat suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">After the Appeals Council denied Adkins\u2019s request for review, Adkins appealed to the district court, arguing that his mental retardation combined with his physical ailments constituted a disability under Listing 12.05C. The district court affirmed the denial of benefits, finding that Adkins did not suffer from any severe mental impairments and that no physician of record opined that Adkins met or medically equaled Listing 12.05C.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">We refuse to overturn or reject the ALJ\u2019s findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Blakes v. Barnhart, </em>331 F.3d 565, 568 (7th Cir.2003). The ALJ\u2019s decision is not required to address every piece of evidence or testimony presented, but must provide a \u201clogical bridge\u201d between the evidence and his conclusions. <em>Clifford v. Apfel, </em>227 F.3d 863, 872 (7th Cir.2000). We will not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Jens v. Barnhart, </em>347 F.3d 209, 212 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">On appeal, Adkins argues that the ALJ improperly discounted evidence supporting his claim that he was mentally retarded and thus met Listing 12.05C. These are the four requirements for a finding of mental retardation under Listing 12.05C: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning; (2) deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period before age 22; (8) a valid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of sixty through seventy; and (4) a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant work-related limitation of function. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P., App. 1 \u00a7 12.05; <em>Maggard v. Apfel, </em>167 F.3d 376, 380 (7th Cir.1999). Adkins points to his placement in special education classes diming childhood; Dr. Spencer\u2019s determination that he had a mild mental handicap, with IQs of sixty-eight, seventy, and sixty-six; Dr. Berry\u2019s conclusion that he suffered from depression, anxiety, and possible borderline personality disorder; and Dr. Carter\u2019s finding that he could not work due to chronic pain and breathing problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">After our review of the record, we are of the opinion that Adkins has failed to establish that he met the requirements of Listing 12.05C because his IQ test scores were inconsistent with other evidence of his cognitive stability and were thus invalid. Dr. Spencer\u2019s own evaluation questioned the validity of the IQ test she performed. Significantly, Dr. Spencer refrained from making a diagnosis of mental retardation. Dr. Thomas testified at length regarding his reasons for questioning the credibility of some of the findings made by Drs. Berry and Spencer, explaining that the results of Adkins\u2019s MMPI test cast doubt on the validity of the IQ tests. Dr. Thomas explained that the MMPI test can only be completed by someone who has at least an 8th grade comprehension level, a level that is inconsistent with mental retardation. The MMPI test results led Dr. Thomas to conclude that Adkins\u2019s cognitive skills were \u201cexcellent\u201d and that the IQ scores and findings of serious mental impairment were \u201cinvalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In addition, Adkins has failed to demonstrate significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning nor deficits in his adaptive functioning prior to age twenty-two, as required in the listing schedule. Indeed, aside from Adkins\u2019s testimony that he completed school only through the eighth grade, the record contains only minimal evidence concerning his cognitive and medical state before he reached twenty-two years of age. The fact that Adkins was able to be gainfully employed until the age of forty-one without material complaints from his employers further exemplifies his adaptive abilities. Although low IQ scores are indicative of retardation, other factors, such as the claimant\u2019s life activities and employment history, must be considered and weighed and properly play into the ALJ\u2019s analysis. <em>See Mendez v. Barnhart, </em>439 F.3d 360, 361 (7th Cir.2006) (noting that because IQ of seventy is just at borderline of mental retardation, grid requires additional impairment to establish disability); <em>Maggard, </em>167 F.3d at 380 (low IQ scores did not demonstrate mental retardation where claimant showed an ability to perform his work assignments, understand and follow directions, relate to coworkers, and withstand the stress of daily work).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Adkins also argues that because the ALJ failed to discuss Listing 12.05C we must remand the case. <em>See Ribaudo v. Barnhart, </em>458 F.3d 580, 583 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201can <em>ALJ </em>should mention the specific listings he is considering and his failure to do so, if combined with a \u2018perfunctory analysis,\u2019 may require a remand\u201d). It is true that the ALJ did not refer to the Listing\u2014 which would have been helpful \u2014 and thus we are somewhat at a loss to be able to ascertain how meaningfully he considered it. However, we are convinced that the ALJ\u2019s treatment and consideration of this issue certainly was not done in a perfune<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tory fashion. The ALJ ordered a supplemental hearing in order that Adkins might be examined by two psychologists and have his psychological condition examined more thoroughly. The ALJ devoted several pages of his decision to an exhaustive discussion of the psychological and intelligence testing, weighing the opinions of the mental health specialists, and considering the issues relevant to Listing 12.05C, including the results of various intelligence and psychological tests as well as physical medical examinations. After his examination and weighing of this evidence, the ALJ concluded that Adkins \u201cdoes not have a \u2018severe\u2019 emotional, mental, psychological, or psychiatric impairment as contemplated by the Social Security Act\u201d and that he \u201cdoes not have any limitations or restrictions due to any emotional, mental, psychological, or psychiatric impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Next, Adkins asserts that the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination violated Social Security Ruling 96-7p, which requires an ALJ to provide \u201cspecific reasons\u201d for a credibility determination and not simply state that \u201cthe individual\u2019s allegations have been considered\u201d or that \u201cthe allegations are credible.\u201d SSR 96-7p. After reviewing Adkins\u2019s medical and employment history and questioning him personally, the ALJ stated that his \u201cveracity in general is somewhat suspect.\u201d We defer to a credibility finding and will reverse only if the finding is \u201cpatently wrong.\u201d <em>See Prochaska v. Barnhart, </em>454 F.3d 731, 738 (7th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). The ALJ based his determination on a combination of medical evidence \u2014 including Dr. Spencer\u2019s belief that Adkins may be exaggerating his symptoms \u2014 and the ALJ\u2019s own perception of Adkins as a witness. Because the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding is supported by the record, it should not be disturbed. <em>See Sienkiewicz v. Barnhart, </em>409 F.3d 798, 803-04 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Adkins also argues that the ALJ erred in formulating his RFC \u2014 by not factoring in his alleged mental retardation \u2014 and that the ALJ improperly found that he could adequately perform the jobs he previously held. As discussed above, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Adkins was not mentally retarded. The record reflects substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Adkins could perform sedentary work away from harsh environmental conditions troublesome to his pulmonary problems. Furthermore, the ALJ calculated that there are over 17,000 sedentary and light unskilled occupations throughout the state of Indiana that Adkins would be capable of performing.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Finally, Adkins contends that the ALJ failed to provide a \u201cfair determination\u201d of his disability claim because he used \u201cmisleading rhetorical devices;\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> considered psychological research from outside the record; reported that Carter found Adkins was not totally disabled; and improperly excused Thomas\u2019 failure to complete an evaluation of Adkins\u2019s ability to work. In our opinion, these arguments are without merit and warrant but limited discussion. Adkins cites <em>Ray v. Bowen, </em>843 F.3d 998 (7th Cir.1988), for the proposition that disability claimants are entitled to a \u201cfair hearing.\u201d In this case, we observe that the ALJ reviewed and developed a thorough record dealing with Adkins\u2019s mental health and conducted an extensive hearing with a psychological medical expert. This record and medical evidence, when consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ered in its entirety, defeats Adkins\u2019s claim of unfairness. Adkins also suggests that it was a violation of the Federal Rules of Evidence for the ALJ to consult a medical reference text from outside the record. However, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in Social Security disability hearings. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b)(1). Ultimately, Adkins has failed to demonstrate that the ALJ exhibited sufficient antagonism to a degree that would constitute a denial of due process. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. A condition characterized by adhesion of the two layers of pleura, the lung being covered by a thick layer of nonexpansible fibrous tissue; often a consequence of traumatic hemothorax or of effusion. <em>See </em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 629 (28th ed.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. Dr. Thomas did not examine Adkins personally but, after reading the medical reports on file, gave his interpretation of the psychological evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-5\">. Adkins complains, for example, that the ALJ \"exaggerated\" the significance of his own medical experts' evidence by repeatedly stating that this evidence was provided by a \"board certified\u201d or \"licensed\" practitioner, without applying the same descriptive phrases to Adkins\u2019s primary care physicians, who were also certified and licensed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
