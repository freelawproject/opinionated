Gapinski pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to manufacture more than 100 marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(B)(vii). He now appeals his 156-month sentence, which the district court imposed before the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Gapinski has withdrawn his request for oral argument, Reply Br. at ii, and the government never requested oral argument. We accordingly conclude that this case is amenable to disposition without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Both parties agree that the district court\u2019s <em>pre-Booker </em>sentence on December 22, 2004, applying the United States Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, was erroneous. The district court also announced a 120-month \u201calternate sentence,\u201d which the district court intended to impose in the event that the Sentencing Guidelines did not apply. Joint Appendix at 71. We now know that <em>Booker </em>held that the Sentencing Guidelines do apply, but are only advisory and are only one of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the district court must consider. Accordingly, the parties agree that there is no mechanism by which the \u201calternate sentence\u201d can be put into place, and that Gapinski therefore is entitled to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We concur with the parties\u2019 position, and accordingly VACATE Gapinski\u2019s sentence and REMAND the case to the district court for a new sentencing hearing and resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and its progeny, and in light of any other relevant factors.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
