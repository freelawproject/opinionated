Baker (Baker) challenges his sentence as unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for failure to give appropriate weight to mitigating factors in his criminal history, such as his age, and for making a clear error in judgment when balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-25\">Upon careful review of the record, we conclude the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Baker to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 276, 163 L.Ed.2d 246 (2005). We afford a presumption of reasonableness to the district court\u2019s sentence, which fell at the bottom of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2007) (affirming the application of a presumption of reasonableness by a court of appeals to a district court\u2019s sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines); <em>United States v. Likens, </em>464 F.3d 823, 825 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe guideline range, though advisory, is presumed to be reasonable.\u201d (citation omitted)). The district court appropriately weighed Baker\u2019s youth and relatively minor past crimes against other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as the need for a significant prison sentence to halt Baker\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct and the need for a sentence long enough to provide Baker with meaningful rehabilitation and training. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (history and character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>istics of defendant), (a)(2)(B) (afford adequate deterrence), and (a)(2)(D) (provide defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in most effective manner); <em>United States v. Swehla, </em>442 F.3d 1143, 1145-47 (8th Cir.2006) (upholding sentence and finding criminal history not overstated where the defendant committed many crimes from ages 15 to 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-21\">.
