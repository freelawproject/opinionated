We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Yee v. Duncan, </em>463 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir.2006). Our review of Kunkler\u2019s petition is guided by the deferential standard of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1127 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-27\">Kunkler was considered for parole ten times since he became eligible in 1991. The California Board of Prison Terms (\u201cthe Board\u201d) denied parole at his first seven hearings because of the gravity of Kunkler\u2019s offense and his prior record. At his eighth hearing on August 30, 2000, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Board found him suitable for parole. Governor Gray Davis reversed the Board\u2019s decision. On September 1, 2004, at Kunkler\u2019s tenth hearing, the Board again found he was suitable for parole. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger reversed the Board\u2019s decision, finding Kunkler posed an unreasonable risk of danger to society because of the gravity of his offense and his significant criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Kunkler filed a <em>habeas </em>petition in California Superior Court. The court denied his petition, concluding that the governor\u2019s decision was supported by some evidence in the record. <em>In re Edgar Kunkler, </em>No. BH003236, at 1 (Cal.Super.Ct. May 11, 2005). The court held, however, that the governor could not properly rely on Kunkler\u2019s criminal record in denying parole because the record contained no evidence that any of his prior convictions involved violence. <em>Id. </em>at 2. The California Court of Appeal and the California Supreme Court affirmed the denial of Kunkler\u2019s <em>habeas </em>petition. <em>In re Edgar Kunkler, </em>No. B183275 (Cal.Ct.App. May 26, 2005); <em>In re Edgar Kunkler, </em>No. S134458 (Cal. Aug.17, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Kunkler filed a <em>habeas </em>petition in the Central District of California. The district court granted the petition on the authority of <em>Biggs v. Terhune, </em>334 F.3d 910 (9th Cir.2003). <em>Biggs </em>affirmed denial of a <em>habeas </em>petition on the ground that the Board\u2019s decision to deny parole was supported by some evidence: the gravity of the commitment offense. <em>Biggs, </em>334 F.3d at 916. However, <em>Biggs </em>cautioned that reliance on the gravity of the offense, and conduct prior to imprisonment, to justify repeated denials of parole \u201cruns contrary to the rehabilitative goals espoused by the prison system and could result in a due process violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The district court concluded this court\u2019s comments in <em>Biggs </em>were applicable. <em>Kunkler v. Muntz, </em>No. CV 05-6473, at 4 (C.D.Cal. March 16, 2006). In granting Kunkler\u2019s petition, the district court found that, because the circumstances of Kunkler\u2019s commitment offense would never change, the repeated parole denials based on the gravity of his offense effectively converted his sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. <em>Id. </em>The court noted Kunkler had twice demonstrated his suitability for parole release to the Board, and had served in excess of the maximum prison term for first degree murder. <em>Id. </em>The court held that repeated denial of Kunkler\u2019s parole could not be justified by reliance on his commitment offense because \u201ccontinued reliance on such an unchanging event undermines the use of prison as a rehabilitative tool.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Following the district court\u2019s <em>habeas </em>order, this court decided a case that controls the disposition of this appeal. California inmates have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in parole. <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123 (9th Cir.2006). <em>Sass </em>recognized that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard set forth in <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985), is clearly established in the parole context. 461 F.3d at 1129. Denial of <em>Sass\u2019 habeas </em>petition was affirmed on the grounds that his prior convictions and the gravity of his convicted offenses constitute some evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision to deny parole. <em>Id. Sass </em>considered the <em>Biggs dictum, </em>but held that under the AEDPA, \u201cit is not [this court\u2019s] function to speculate about how future parole hearings could proceed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">This court has jurisdiction to review Kunkler\u2019s <em>habeas </em>petition because he has a liberty interest in parole. <em>Id. </em>at 1127-28; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). The governor\u2019s decision to reverse Kunkler\u2019s parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>was supported by some evidence: the gravity of Kunkler\u2019s offense, second degree murder under aggravated circumstances. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. at 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768; <em>Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1129. The California Supreme Court decision denying Kunkler\u2019s petition was not contrary to, nor did it involve an unreasonable application of, federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We have considered Kunkler\u2019s additional citations and find them inapplicable because California and federal district court decisions are not binding authority under the AEDPA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
