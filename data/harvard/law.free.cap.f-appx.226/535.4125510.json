Allan Edgar, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b562-15\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b562-16\">McKEAGUE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Co-defendants WillieAnn and John Madison, husband and wife, appeal their convictions and sentences for numerous counts of tax evasion, money laundering, conversion of property, and fraud. For the following reasons, the convictions are affirmed, Mr. Madison\u2019s sentence is affirmed, and Mrs. Madison\u2019s sentence is reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b562-19\">Between 1996 and 1999, Mr. Madison worked as a certified public accountant; was self-employed as a minister; worked as the Director of the Little People\u2019s Child Development Center (\u201cLittle People\u2019s\u201d), a day care; and participated with Mrs. Madison in a number of real estate and other financial ventures. Mrs. Madison\u2019s principal employment from 1996-1999 was as the executive director for Cherokee Children and Family Services, a non-profit organization that \u201cbrokered\u201d federal financial assistance for the day care needs of low-income families.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">The defendants treated their personal property and the property of the businesses for which they worked as substantially interchangeable. In 1999, Mrs. Madison purchased at auction the property at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>2755, 2759, 2763, 2771, and 2768 Colony Park Drive in Memphis, Tennessee, for a total price of $1,083,500. She paid $98,500 down on March 5, 1999, the day of the auction. In February of 1999, Mrs. Madison directed Cherokee to write her a check for a $141,000 retroactive \u201crent increase due\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the office space she rented to Cherokee. Mrs. Madison used these funds to pay the down payment on the Colony Park property. On March 22, 1999, Mrs. Madison secured an <em>additional </em>retroactive increase in the rent, in the amount of $437,000. She used this money to pay part of the balance due on Colony Park. On April 1, 1999, Cherokee wrote a check for $250,000 to \u201cFund Management.\u201d Mrs. Madison endorsed the check as \u201cFund Management\u201d and paid these funds also to the sellers of the Colony Park properties. A total of $834,000 of the purchase money for the Colony Park properties came from Cherokee.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In 1998, both defendants, a Cherokee employee, and nine of Mrs. Madison\u2019s relatives took a pleasure trip to London, for which Cherokee paid substantially all of the expenses. In May of 1999, Cherokee paid $2,554 for travel expenses for approximately thirty members of Mrs. Madison\u2019s family to attend the college graduation of Mrs. Madison\u2019s daughter. In 1999, Cherokee and Little People\u2019s also paid over $25,000 for seventeen members of Mrs. Madison\u2019s family to go on a Caribbean cruise. Cherokee also paid for a weekly cleaning service to clean not only its offices, but also the homes of Mrs. Madison and her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In addition to misappropriating almost $1 million in Cherokee funds, Mr. and Mrs. Madison engaged in a systematic deception of both the IRS and the Tennessee Department of Human Services (the \u201cTDHS\u201d), the agency for which Cherokee brokered day care subsidies for the poor. Between 1996 and 1998, Cherokee paid Mrs. Madison $72,000 per year in rent for the Cherry Center property. In 1999, Cherokee paid Mrs. Madison $241,530 in rent for the Cherry Center property, in addition to the $437,000 \u201cretroactive rent increase.\u201d By contrast, defendants\u2019 tax returns for 1996, 1997, and 1998 reflected $36,000 in rental income for the Cherry Center property; in 1999, the defendants reported $72,000 in rental income for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Mr. Madison was paid at least $108,000 per year under contracts to perform accounting work for Cherokee Family and Children Services, Cherokee Children Nutrition Program, and Creative Learning Center, Inc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, on his tax returns, he reported $41,845 in total accounting income for 1996; $27,295 for 1997; $28,576 for 1998; and $40,000 for 1999. The defendants also omitted from their income tax returns $22,287.88 in 1997 and $6106.86 in 1998 in net profits for the A.C. Jackson day care, which they ran. In addition, in 1999, Mrs. Madison sold a parcel of real estate and provided financing; she failed to report the interest income from that mortgage. Mrs. Madison also failed to report as income Cherokee\u2019s payment of her personal expenses for such items as clothing, travel, utility payments and cleaning services for her residence, and a cruise.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">On the Form 990 returns Mr. Madison prepared for Cherokee in 1996,1997, 1998, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>and 1999, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cDuring the year, has the organization, either directly or indirectly, engaged in any of the following acts of any of its trustees, directors, officers, creators, key employees or members of their families, or with any taxable organization with which any such person is affiliated as an officer, director, trustee, majority owner, or principal beneficiary: ... a sale, exchange, or leasing of property?\u201d In fact, of course, Cherokee leased its offices from its executive director, Mrs. Madison.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">One of the leases between Cherokee and Mrs. Madison for the Cherry Center property listed the size of the Cherry Center property as 20,000 square feet, a figure provided by Mrs. Madison. This figure also appeared on the copy of the Cherry Center lease provided to TDHS as a verification of the reimbursable costs in Cherokee\u2019s 2000 budget. In fact, the Cherry Center property contained 9,648 square feet, which Mrs. Madison knew. Finally, as part of a required disclosure regarding whether a broker of subsidized child care \u201cwould be placing children in child care providers that they had some sort of relationship with,\u201d Mrs. Madison wrote a letter to the TDHS, stating that she \u201cowns properties where two nonprofit day care centers are operated in the Memphis area, but is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the centers.\u201d Transcript 4/20/04 at 176, 178. In fact, Mrs. Madison was in charge of the operations of Little People\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Following a fifteen-day jury trial, Mrs. Madison was convicted on May 12, 2004, of four counts of Attempt to Evade or Defeat Tax in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201; one count of False Statements on Tax Documents Under Penalty of Perjury in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1); two counts of False Statements on a matter within the jurisdiction of the federal government in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001; four counts of False or Fraudulent Claims against a department of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287; five counts of Theft from Programs Receiving Federal Funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1); and five counts of Engaging in Monetary Transactions Involving Property Derived from Unlawful Activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. Mr. Madison, who was tried jointly with Mrs. Madison, was convicted of four counts of Attempt to Evade or Defeat Tax in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201, and four counts of Aiding the Preparation of Tax Documents Containing False or Fraudulent Statements in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Mrs. Madison was sentenced to twenty-one months\u2019 incarceration on each count, to run concurrently, and thereafter to three years of supervised release. She was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $751,832.04, and to forfeit over $1.1 million and the two Colony Park properties she had not yet sold, or substitute property of equivalent value. Mr. Madison was sentenced to ten months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, and thereafter to three years of supervised release, to include ten months\u2019 home confinement. Mr. Madison was ordered to pay $564,832.04 in restitution, for which he was jointly and severally liable with Mrs. Madison; she bore sole responsibility for the remaining $187,000. Both defendants now appeal their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">II. LAWFULNESS OF SEARCH</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">On April 1, 2001, Cherokee\u2019s board terminated the lease of the Colony Park premises between itself and the defendants. On April 12, the court-appointed receiver for Cherokee\u2019s assets visited the Colony Park property. On April 17, with the receiver\u2019s free consent, an FBI agent investigating the activities of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>dants examined the contents of 2771 Colony Park Drive. Later that day, the FBI Agent served the receiver with a subpoena from the Grand Jury, which required the receiver to turn over certain records at the Colony Park office.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Mrs. Madison contends on appeal that the search of Cherokee\u2019s office space at 2771 Colony Park, Memphis, Tennessee, was unlawful and that all evidence obtained as a result of that search should have been suppressed by the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIn reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>435 F.3d 660, 663 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Harris, </em>192 F.3d 580, 584 (6th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Police may lawfully search a location if they receive valid consent. <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>435 F.3d 660, 663 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)). This consent may be given by any person \u201c \u2018who possessed] common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974)). Common authority is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-10\"><em>United States v. Waller, </em>426 F.3d 838, 845 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 988). Common authority is not a function of actual ownership rights in the premises. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 988). In fact, an actual owner does <em>not </em>have authority to give consent if the premises searched are occupied by his tenant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wilhelm v. Boggs, </em>290 F.3d 822, 826 (6th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">The district court reasonably found based on the evidence that \u201cat least one employee, Mrs. Weathers, continued to work for Cherokee Children from the Colony Park location after April 1.\u201d Report and Recommendation on Motion to Suppress (\u201cR.R.\u201d) at 8. Despite the termination of the lease on April 1, when the receiver took control of 2771 Colony Park Drive on April 12, Cherokee was still engaging in \u201cuse of the property\u201d and had \u201ccommon authority over\u201d the premises. Thus, Cherokee itself had authority to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>sent to the search. The appointing court here ordered the receiver to \u201c[t]ake exclusive custody, control and possession of all ... effects, books and records of account and other papers and property or interests owned or held by the [Cherokee Corporations] ... with full power to ... receive and take possession of such receivership properties.\u201d R.R. at 9. Thus, the receiver exercised Cherokee\u2019s own authority, and had the authority to consent to the FBI agent\u2019s search of 2771 Colony Park Drive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Javitch v. First Union Sec., Inc., </em>315 F.3d 619, 626 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Mrs. Madison additionally argues that the seizure was invalid because the Grand Jury subpoena was facially defective. However, it is not necessary for the panel to decide this question, because the receiver voluntarily consented to the FBI agent\u2019s seizure of the materials. The district court found that the receiver \u201cdid not ask for a subpoena; he only asked that [the FBI agent] provide him with an inventory of the documents taken,\u201d and that the receiver said, prior to being served with a subpoena, that the FBI agent \u201cwas free to look around the building and to collect whatever files he needed.\u201d R.R. at 26-27. Consent to a search may be voluntary even if the person giving the consent has already been served with a subpoena for the items to be seized, to say nothing of the case here, where the receiver consented when he had not yet been served with a subpoena. <em>See United States v. Susskind, </em>965 F.2d 80, 87 (6th Cir.1992) (holding that the defendant\u2019s consent to search was voluntary although he had been served with a subpoena), <em>vacated, </em>975 F.2d 1206 (6th Cir. 1992), <em>analysis adopted, </em>4 F.3d 1400, 1401 (6th Cir.1993) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Iglesias, </em>881 F.2d 1519, 1522 (9th Cir.1989) (the fact that an officer threatened the \u201cissuance of a grand jury subpoena\u201d held not \u201csufficient to render ... consent [to search] involuntary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The district court did not clearly err in finding the consent to be voluntary. Because a person lawfully in control of the premises consented to the search and to the removal of documents, Mrs. Madison\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">\u201cThe sufficiency of an indictment is reviewed <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>409 F.3d 325, 331 (6th Cir.2005). The statute prohibiting theft from a program receiving federal funds contains a jurisdictional limit, making it applicable only if the defendant steals from or defrauds an organization that \u201creceives, in any one-year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving ... [a] form of Federal assistance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(b). Mrs. Madison argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>indictment was insufficient because instead of alleging that Cherokee received <em>benefits </em>in excess of $10,000, the indictment alleged that Cherokee received <em>federal assistance </em>in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u201c[A]n indictment is only sufficient if it (1) contains the elements of the charged offense, (2) gives the defendant adequate notice of the charges, and (3) protects the defendant against double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Valentine v. Konteh, </em>395 F.3d 626, 631 (6th Cir.2005). Mrs. Madison has not made a colorable argument that the indictment here fails so much as one of these requirements. The indictment was not insufficient, but gave Mrs. Madison adequate notice of the charged offense \u2014 namely, theft from an organization receiving federal benefits under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">IV. ADMISSIBILITY OF LAY OPINION TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">A district court\u2019s decision to permit a witness offering opinion testimony to testify as a lay witness is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>JGR, Inc., v. Thomasville Furniture Indus., </em>370 F.3d 519, 524 (6th Cir.2004). Mrs. Madison argues that the trial court improperly permitted FBI analyst Joe Ford to offer opinion testimony when he had not been offered as an expert witness. The Rules of Evidence permit a non-expert witness to testify \u201cin the form of opinions or inferences\u201d if these \u201care (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Mrs. Madison complains that Ford offered the conclusion that she would not have been able to purchase the Colony Park property without the Cherokee funds. She cites <em>JGR, </em>in which this court adopted the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in <em>DIJO, Inc. v. Hilton Hotels Corp., </em>351 F.3d 679 (5th Cir.2003). In <em>DIJO, </em>a \u201cfinancial consultant,\u201d who was not offered as an expert, testified regarding the value to the plaintiff of a lost contract. 351 F.3d at 685, 686. The Fifth Circuit held that admitting this testimony was an abuse of discretion, because the witness\u2019s \u201c \u2018opinion ... was based on preliminary income figures and other information that he had received from [the plaintiffs founder],\u2019 and his \u2018appraisal ... was [not] based upon his own independent knowledge or observations.\u2019 \u201d <em>JGR, </em>370 F.3d at 525 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>DIJO, </em>351 F.3d at 685-87). However, <em>DIJO </em>is distinguishable from this case. In <em>DIJO, </em>the witness offered an appraisal of the economic value of a lost contract, which necessary is a matter of opinion. Here, Ford merely examined the records of transactions involving Mrs. Madison\u2019s and Cherokee\u2019s accounts and stated the origin and the destination of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The Eleventh Circuit recently addressed a similar situation in <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316 (11th Cir.2006). In that case, a company was billed not only for its own construction work, but also for construction performed on the personal property of its CEO. <em>Id. </em>at 1319. The government offered testimony to show that the company paid for the CEO\u2019s private projects. <em>Id. </em>at 1331. The Eleventh Circuit held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">Contrary to Appellants\u2019 contention, the government was not required to certify Odom as an expert witness.... To prepare for his testimony, Odom simply added and subtracted numbers from a long catalogue of MCC records, and then compared those numbers in a straightforward fashion. As Odom himself explained at trial, while his expertise and the use of computer software may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>have made him more efficient at reviewing [the company\u2019s] records, his review itself was within the capacity of any reasonable lay person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1331-32. We find the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning to be persuasive, and applicable to Ford\u2019s testimony. His status as a financial analyst may, like the computer expertise of the witness in Hamaker, have facilitated his review of accounting records. However, his conclusion that Mrs. Madison would not have been able to make the down payment on the Colony Park property without funds converted from Cherokee is a matter of arithmetic \u201cwithin the capacity of any reasonable lay person.\u201d <em>See also Bryant v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>432 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cA mathematical calculation well within the ability of anyone with a grade-school education is, in our opinion, more aptly characterized as a lay opinion under Fed. R.Evid. 701.\u201d). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in permitting Ford\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">V. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cThe standard of review for [a] challenge as to the sufficiency of the evidence is \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>473 F.3d 680, 681 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Woods, </em>877 F.2d 477, 479 (6th Cir.1989)). Mrs. Madison first contends that the government failed to prove attempted tax evasion under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201, because there was not sufficient evidence of willfulness or of the commission of an affirmative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cA jury may, of course, find the requisite knowledge on defendant\u2019s part by drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d; that is, willfulness can be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>Ratzlaf v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 149 n. 19, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994); <em>see also United States v. Bank of New England, N.A., </em>821 F.2d 844, 854 (1st Cir.1987). The fact that a defendant filed a false tax return, without more, may constitute an affirmative act. <em>United States v. Garavaglia, </em>566 F.2d 1056, 1058 (6th Cir.1977). If the return was prepared by someone other than the defendant, more is required. In <em>United States v. Cor-Bon Custom Bullet Co., </em>287 F.3d 576 (6th Cir.2002), this court held where a third party prepares a return, an affirmative act of evasion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsI\">includes, but is not limited to, \u201cconduct such as keeping a double set of books, making false entries or alterations, or false invoices or documents, destruction of books or records, concealment of assets or covering up sources of income ... [or] any conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">287 F.3d at 579 (quoting <em>Spies v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S.Ct. 364, 87 L.Ed. 418 (1943)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In this case, Mrs. Madison was convicted of evading tax in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. Among the inaccuracies in reporting was her listing of only half the rent received for the Cherry Center property through 1998, and approximately 10% of the rent in 1999. There were four different leases between Mrs. Madison and Cherokee for the Cherry Center property covering overlapping time periods; the four leases showed three different monthly rent rates between them, none of which was the $3000 per month Mrs. Madison reported from 1996 to 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Thus, Mrs. Madison was keeping a triple or quadruple set of records, which was an affirmative act concealing her real income. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Moreover, from Mrs. Madison\u2019s conduct as a whole, including her extensive misappropriation of Cherokee funds for her own purposes and elaborate concealment of her activities from Cherokee, its auditors, and the government, the jury could certainly conclude that her under-reporting of income was willfully calculated to enhance her own holdings and defraud the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Mr. Madison likewise argues that there was not sufficient evidence to convict him of attempted tax evasion in 1996,1997, 1998, and 1999. In addition to the rental income from the Cherry Center property discussed above, Mr. Madison failed to report his accounting income from Cherokee Children and Nutrition, Creative Learning Center, and Little People\u2019s. In 1996,1997, and 1998, he prepared the defendants\u2019 joint returns. As stated above, this constitutes an affirmative act. In 1999, the defendants\u2019 return was prepared by a law firm. However, Mr. Madison engaged in affirmative acts of evasion in that year as well. Although he prepared 1099 forms indicating the income of other Cherokee independent contractors, he failed to prepare any 1099 for himself as Cherokee\u2019s accountant. This failure entails \u201cconcealment of assets or covering up sources of income\u201d and certainly as \u201cconduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.\u201d Thus, Mr. Madison engaged in affirmative acts to evade the payment of income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Mrs. Madison also contests her conviction for Making False Statements on Tax Documents in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). This charge was based on the fact that she signed Cherokee\u2019s form 990 for 1999, which stated that Cherokee was not involved in any related-party real estate transactions, although Mrs. Madison knew that she was the lessor of Cherokee\u2019s office space. Mrs. Madison argues that the false statement was not material. \u201cA matter is \u2018material\u2019 if it has a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing or affecting, the ability of the IRS to audit or verify the accuracy of a tax return.\u201d <em>See United States v. Tarwater, </em>308 F.3d 494, 505 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 16, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)). A revenue agent for the IRS Tax Exempted Government Entities Division testified that if an entity reported that it engaged in related-party transactions, the IRS would ask seek documentation of such transactions during the audit interview, but would not do so if no such transactions were reported. Thus, a false answer to the question is capable of affecting and actually affects the ability of the IRS to perform an audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Mr. Madison contends that his conviction for aiding in the preparation of false tax documents in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2) was also invalid. The charges were based on his preparation of Cherokee\u2019s form 990 submissions for 1996-1999, which denied that Cherokee engaged in related-party transactions. He argues that because Mrs. Madison was acquitted of making false statements on tax documents for 1996, 1997, and 1998, he should not have been convicted for aiding in making false statements for those years. However, \u201c \u2018there is no ... bar to prosecuting someone as an aider and abettor after an alleged de facto principal is acquitted.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>306 F.3d 295, 307 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Yost, </em>24 F.3d 99 (10th Cir. 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Mrs. Madison also contests her conviction for Making False Statements on a Matter within the Jurisdiction of the Federal Government in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. She argues that her false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>statement regarding the square footage of the Cherry Center property was not willful, <em>see United States v. Rogers, </em>118 F.3d 466, 470 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Steele, </em>933 F.2d 1313, 1318-19 (6th Cir.1991) (en banc)), because she did not know that the number she gave was false, and that her statement that she was \u201cnot involved in the day-to-day operations\u201d of the Little People\u2019s day care centers was actually true.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The word \u201cwillfully\u201d has the same meaning in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1), (2) as it does in \u00a7 7201. <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 359-60, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973). Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that willfulness for purposes of \u00a7 7206(1) can be \u201cestablished by drawing reasonable inferences from the available facts,\u201d as it can for purposes of \u00a7 7201. <em>See Bank of New England, </em>821 F.2d at 854. Here, the government presented evidence that the square footage of the Cherry Center property had been discussed with Mrs. Madison. The evidence also showed that she was knowledgeable regarding real property transactions. This evidence, in conjunction with Mrs. Madison\u2019s broad practice of dishonest reporting and false rent charges, permitted a rational trier of fact to find that she was aware of the real square footage of the property, and misstated it deliberately.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Mrs. Madison\u2019s argument that the jury was required to find that her claim not to be involved in the day-to-day operations of Little People\u2019s was truthful is without merit. The government presented evidence that she made hiring decisions, set salaries and the fees clients were charged, approved time cards, and authorized purchases. The director of Little People\u2019s discussed the day care\u2019s business with Mrs. Madison two or three times a week. It was the province of the jury to determine whether the statement in the letter was true, and given the evidence they were eminently rational in finding it to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Mrs. Madison argues that her conviction for Theft from a Program Receiving Federal Benefits in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1) was based on insufficient evidence because the government did not establish that she committed the offense willfully. The statute applies to one who \u201cwithout authority <em>knowingly </em>converts\u201d or <em>\u201cintentionally </em>misapplies\u201d the funds of an organization receiving federal benefits. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Mrs. Madison\u2019s argument is, in essence, that her conversion of Cherokee\u2019s property was not knowing or intentional. This argument is not even facially meritorious. To violate the statute, she needed only to misapply intentionally funds which she knew not to be hers. As discussed above, the government presented evidence of her elaborate scheme to convert Cherokee\u2019s funds to pay for the Colony Park properties; her habitual use of the Cherokee American Express card for her personal expenses; and her efforts to conceal her conversion of Cherokee funds. The jury could rationally have concluded based on this evidence that Mrs. Madison knew Cherokee\u2019s property was not hers and that she intentionally converted it to her use despite this fact. In addition, because there was sufficient evidence to convict Mrs. Madison of theft under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(A), she was also properly convicted of Engaging in Monetary Transactions Involving Property Derived from Unlawful Activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Finally, Mrs. Madison claims that the evidence was insufficient to convict her of Making False Claims Against a Department of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287. However, she provides no hint as to what about the evidence was insufficient. Therefore, the panel need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>address this assignment of error. <em>See United States v. Lanzotti </em>205 F.3d 951, 957 (7th Cir.2000) (\u201cIt is not this court\u2019s responsibility to research and construct the parties\u2019 arguments.\u201d); <em>see also Figueroa-Rubio v. INS, </em>108 F.3d 110, 112 (6th Cir.1997). In sum, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that both Mr. and Mrs. Madison were guilty of every offense of which they were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">VI. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 AS APPLIED</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">A \u201cchallenge to the constitutionality of the application of \u00a7 666 involves questions of law,\u201d and is therefore reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Suarez, </em>263 F.3d 468, 476 (6th Cir.2001). As a jurisdictional requirement for conviction under \u00a7 666, \u201cthe [victim] organization, government, or agency [must] receive[ ], in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(b); <em>see also Suarez, </em>263 F.3d at 484. Mrs. Madison argues that \u00a7 666 was unconstitutional as applied to her because she did not convert Cherokee\u2019s federal benefits themselves, but rather the fee the federal government paid Cherokee to administer those benefits. Her argument has been rejected by this court. \u201cA defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 need not be shown to have actually stolen any of the federal funds given to the \u2018federal recipient\u2019 or even that his malfeasance affected those federal funds.\u201d <em>Suarez, </em>263 F.3d at 484 (citing <em>Salinas v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 52, 55-58, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">To determine whether the conversion of the assets of a funded program falls under \u00a7 666, the Supreme Court in <em>Fischer v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 667, 120 S.Ct. 1780,146 L.Ed.2d 707 (2000),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">recommend[ed] a fact-based inquiry into the \u201cprogram\u2019s structure, operation, and purpose\u201d to determine whether the criminal conduct posed a threat to the integrity of <em>the federal program. </em>If it does pose such a threat (as was found with defendant Fischer\u2019s conduct), then the statute may be applied constitutionally, regardless of whether the federal funds are affected directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\"><em>Suarez, </em>263 F.3d at 486 (quoting <em>Fischer, </em>529 U.S. at 681-82, 120 S.Ct. 1780) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Cherokee\u2019s purpose was to disburse federal and state funds appropriated to help low-income families pay for day care, and the evidence showed that Mrs. Madison\u2019s continual self-dealing endangered Cherokee\u2019s non-profit status. The loss of that status, and the resulting significant tax liability, would certainly have threatened the integrity of Cherokee\u2019s program. Therefore, under the standard in Suarez and Fischer, \u00a7 666 was constitutional as applied to Mrs. Madison.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">VII. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF FACTFINDING BY SENTENCING JUDGE</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Defendants assert that their sentences violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because their guidelines ranges were based on facts found by the judge rather than the jury. In fact, <em>Booker </em>explained that the remedy for the Sixth Amendment violation inherent in the guidelines sentencing scheme was not that all sentencing facts be found by a jury, but that sentencing courts apply the guidelines as advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 125 S.Ct. 738. The district court here did so. The defendants\u2019 argument is therefore meritless, and in fact has already been rejected by this court. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>397 F.3d 340, 352 (6th Cir.2005) (Cook, J., con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>curring); <em>see also United States v. Wood, </em>188 Fed.Appx. 353, 354-55 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">VIII. ORDERS OF FORFEITURE AND RESTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the federal forfeiture laws <em>de novo. </em>But the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and the question of whether those facts are sufficient to constitute a proper criminal forfeiture is reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. O\u2019Dell, </em>247 F.3d 655, 679 (6th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). \u201c We review <em>de novo </em>whether a restitution order is permitted under the law. If it is, then the amount of restitution ordered is reviewed under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>440 F.3d 832, 849 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Wood, </em>364 F.3d 704, 714 (6th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Mrs. Madison was ordered to forfeit $578,000, the sum of the $437,000 and $141,000 she converted from Cherokee. The judgment appears also to order, and the government to argue for, $147,000 and $437,000, the value of the checks that were proceeds of her unlawful transactions; and the parcels at 2771 Colony Park Drive and 2768 Colony Park Drive, also proceeds of the transactions. Mrs. Madison argues that the order to forfeit $578,000 <em>\u201cin addition to </em>her real property is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the alleged offense.\u201d The forfeiture of the $578,000 Mrs. Madison converted is required by the terms of the forfeiture statute; a sentencing court \u201cshall order\u201d a person convicted of engaging in monetary transactions involving property derived from unlawful activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957 to \u201cforfeit to the United States any property, real or personal, involved in such offense, or any property traceable to such property.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(1). Mrs. Madison\u2019s Brief at 57. At oral argument, the government conceded that \u201cwe can go no farther than $578,000.\u201d Therefore, the forfeiture of property in excess of that amount is no longer an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Mrs. Madison\u2019s claim that the forfeiture amount was excessive under the Eighth Amendment is not meritorious. \u201cThe touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.\u201d <em>United States v. Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, 334, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). Mrs. Madison possessed the $578,000 only because she misappropriated it from Cherokee, and the amount therefore bears a direct relationship to the offense it is designed to punish. Finally, Mrs. Madison was not entitled to have the forfeiture amount found by a jury, because she expressly waived a jury determination. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(4); <em>see also United States v. Hall, </em>411 F.3d 651, 654-55 (6th Cir.2005) (finding no constitutional right to a jury determination of forfeiture).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Mrs. Madison was ordered to pay $751,832.04 in restitution. For $564,832.04 of that amount, which was based on tax losses to the IRS, she was jointly and severally liable with Mr. Madison. The remaining $187,000 was incurred by the receivership for Cherokee because the Cherry Center property, which Mrs. Madison deeded to Cherokee to cover the funds she converted under the guise of retroactive rent, sold for considerably less than the amount of the converted funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Mrs. Madison argues on appeal that the restitution amount was excessive and not supported by the evidence. A \u201cdistrict court must consider \u2018the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense, the financial re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>sources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate\u2019 when ordering restitution.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>214 F.3d 724, 730 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Dunigan, </em>163 F.3d 979, 981 (6th Cir.1999)). The district court heard evidence at sentencing as to the amount of tax loss and loss to the receivership from the sale of the Cherry Center property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It adopted the findings in the pre-sentence investigation report (the \u201cPSIR\u201d), which detailed the financial resources of the defendants, their earning ability, and their expenses. The district court thus considered all of the required factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Moreover, contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertions, they have the ability to pay the restitution award. The PSIR here concluded that the defendants were able to pay restitution because they had a net worth of $978,781, or $421,630, after subtracting the properties included in the forfeiture order; and a net monthly income of $7,311. The PSIR also addressed the assets and income of both defendants. Based on these findings, which the district court adopted, the restitution amount is consistent with the defendants\u2019 financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">XL SENTENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 \u2018is treated as a question of law in the Sixth Circuit. We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s determination that [the defendant] occupied a position of trust for the purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Young, </em>266 F.3d 468, 474 (6th Cir.2001) (citation and some internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Brogan, </em>238 F.3d 780, 783 (6th Cir.2001)). This court examines the sentence itself to determine \u201cwhether [the] sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 262-63, 125 S.Ct. 738). This review is both substantive, examining \u201cthe length of the sentence,\u201d and also procedural, requiring that the district court consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the advisory guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103,114 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Although the Guidelines are merely advisory following <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[sentencing courts must still take the guidelines into account and must construe the guidelines properly in doing so.\u201d <em>United States v. Forrest, </em>402 F.3d 678, 684 (6th Cir.2005). The government argues that Mrs. Madison\u2019s offense level should have been adjusted upward two levels based on her abuse of trust. \u201cIf the defendant abused a position of public or private trust ... in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,\u201d the sentencing court must increase the offense level by two. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. However, \u201c[t]his adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The district court made the factual determination that Mrs. Madison was \u201cenable[d] to perpetrate\u201d the thefts from a program receiving federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1) \u201clargely ... because of her position.\u201d Transcript 3/31/05 at 120. In determining whether the adjustment applies, this court examines \u201cwhether the defendant held a position of trust, and whether the position of trust facilitated the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>270 F.3d 356, 371 (6th Cir.2001). The official commentary to the Guidelines explains that a position of trust is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">characterized by professional or managerial discretion.... Persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature. For this adjustment to apply, the position of public or private trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, Application Notes 1. The record indicates that it was Mrs. Madison who instructed Cherokee\u2019s director of operations to write checks, including checks to herself for sizable amounts. She also had the ability to write checks herself, which she used on the occasion she wrote a $250,000 check to the fictitious entity \u201cFund Management,\u201d by which device she was apparently able to conceal the conversion of those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Given her use of authority to direct payments and write checks, Mrs. Madison clearly held a position of trust and relied on that position to convert Cherokee funds. In fact, this court held a defendant to have abused a position of trust based on substantially indistinguishable facts in <em>United States v. Freeman, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 35, 37-38, 43 (6th Cir.2003) (chief executive officer of federally-funded non-profit \u201chad a tremendous amount of discretion\u201d and used that to cause the organization to pay her mortgages without the knowledge of the directors). Thus, the district court correctly determined that Mrs. Madison abused a position of trust as defined in \u00a7 3B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The district court determined that the \u00a7 3B1.3 adjustment should not be applied, however, because Mrs. Madison\u2019s \u201cconviction on those [\u00a7 666(a)(1) ] counts fairly subsume[s] the argument of abuse of trust and ... no further enhancement is warranted.\u201d Transcript 3/31/05 at 120. This court held in <em>United States v. Brown, </em>66 F.3d 124, 129 (6th Cir.1995), that abuse of trust is not \u201ca necessary element of the crime of embezzlement\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1). Although the government must prove that the defendant is an agent of a government or organization receiving federal benefits to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 666(a)(1), it does \u201cnot have to prove the degree of independence and discretion that the enhancement provision requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the district court erred in not applying the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Because the district court erred in failing to make a two-level adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.3, Mrs. Madison\u2019s case must be remanded to the district court for resentencing consistent with that adjustment. <em>See United States v. Galloway, </em>439 F.3d 320, 324 (6th Cir.2006). However, Mrs. Madison\u2019s sentence is otherwise proeedurally and substantively reasonable under <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005), as is Mr. Madison\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">The district court discussed each of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>in determining Mrs. Madison\u2019s sentence, and incorporated these comments in its sentencing deliberation regarding Mr. Madison. This consideration of the factors was sufficient; as this court has frequently observed, \u201csatisfaction of the procedural reasonableness requirement does not depend on a district court\u2019s engaging in a rote listing or some other ritualistic incantation of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Dexta, </em>470 F.3d 612, 615 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">A sentence is \u201csubstantively plainly unreasonable\u201d where \u201cit is \u2018greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ].\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Yopp, </em>453 F.3d 770, 773 (6th Cir.2006) (alteration in original) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The Guidelines yielded a range of forty-one to fifty-one months for Mrs. Madison, and thirty-three to forty-one months for Mr. Madison. The district court decided to sentence both Mr. and Mrs. Madison to sentences significantly lower than the guidelines ranges: twenty-one months\u2019 incarceration plus three years of supervised release for Mrs. Madison, and ten months\u2019 incarceration followed by three years\u2019 supervised release for Mr. Madison, with ten months of home confinement as a condition of supervised release. The district court based its decision not only on the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), but also on Mrs. Madison\u2019s age and the fact that she was responsible to raise her five-year-old grandson, as well as the couple\u2019s standing in and support from the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The government argues that the sentences are shorter than is necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). However, the government has not refuted the district court\u2019s finding that, even without any term of incarceration, neither defendant would commit an offense again. The government\u2019s arguments with respect to the magnitude of the sentences also fail to address the accompanying orders of forfeiture and restitution, which total over $1 million. Under all the circumstances, it appears that the district court\u2019s sentences were substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">X. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">For these reasons, Mr. Madison\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED, and Mrs. Madison\u2019s case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-12\">.

Clutter, </em>914 F.2d 775, 778 (6th Cir.1990) (a twelve- and a fourteen-year-old boy had common authority to consent to a search of their parents' home where they were \"routinely left in exclusive control of the house\u201d and their parents\u2019 \"possession of large quantities of marijuana was ... open and patently non-exclusive\u201d). Thus, the fact that Cherokee\u2019s board terminated the lease on April 1 and the search and subsequent seizure occurred on April 17 is not dispositive of whether Cherokee had authority to consent to the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\">. The FBI agent also seized files in a locked closet at 2771 Colony Park Drive. Because the receiver stood in the shoes of Cherokee, he could consent to the search of a locked closet to which Cherokee had access. The fact that Cherokee as an entity had access to the closet is demonstrated by the fact that Cherokee employees other than Mrs. Madison had keys to the closet. Moreover, a Cherokee employee testified that Mrs. Madison had come to 2771 Colony Park and removed her personal possessions before April 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Mrs. Madison also argues that even if the receiver had authority to consent to a search of the Colony Park premises, he did not have authority to consent to a search of her office, which she sometimes, but not always, kept locked. However, she never so much as alleges what, if any, incriminating documents were seized from her office, nor contends that she was prejudiced by the admission of any particular document. <em>See Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 53, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970) (holding that the admission of evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure is subject to a harmless-error analysis).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">. Both defendants incorrectly assert that the government failed to prove the amount of loss. They cite only the fact that the audit performed by TDHS found no losses as a result of their offenses. Because the TDHS audit examined losses to TDHS, and the receiver\u2019s testimony regarded losses to Cherokee itself, the results of the TDHS audit are irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\">. <em>But see United States v. Lang, </em>333 F.3d 678, 682 (6th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 66, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001)) (\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.3 under the 'clearly erroneous\u2019 standard where, as here, it is fact-bound.\u201d). The standard of review does not make a difference in this case, however, because the district court\u2019s determination was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. Age, family responsibilities, and \"employment-related contributions\u201d and \"prior good works\u201d are discouraged factors for calculating Guidelines ranges.
