Brown appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the summary judgment against his complaint for review of the denial by the United States Patent and Trademark Office of Brown\u2019s request for a waiver or reduction of the fee associated with his document request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552. Brown also appeals the denial of his motion for the recusal of the magistrate judge assigned to his action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-20\">This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Times Publ\u2019g Co. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>236 F.3d 1286, 1288 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001). The court reviews the denial of a motion for recusal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Draper v. Reynolds, </em>369 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">Brown makes multiple arguments on appeal that challenge the propriety of the summary judgment against his complaint. The majority of Brown\u2019s arguments relate to his status as a <em>pro se </em>litigant. In addition, Brown contends that the administrative record certified by the Patent and Trademark Office was incomplete. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">Brown\u2019s assertions, that as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, he is entitled to the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>present evidence, discovery, a trial, and a lesser standard of review are without merit. Although <em>pro se </em>pleadings are to be liberally construed, <em>Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1213 (11th Cir.1992), ordinary rules of procedure and summary judgment still apply. <em>Cf., e.g., Pugh v. Smith, </em>465 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Stephens v. Tolbert, </em>471 F.3d 1173, 1174 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>Kelley v. Hicks, </em>400 F.3d 1282, 1283 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Brown\u2019s argument that the district court erroneously relied on an incomplete administrative record also fails. The substance of Brown\u2019s argument is that the Patent and Trademark Office failed to include in the certified Administrative Record pages of information that were accessed by that office on Brown\u2019s website while his FOIA request was pending. The Administrative Record contained all the information given by Brown to the Patent and Trademark Office for a determination of his request. If information from Brown\u2019s website was necessary and relevant to the resolution of his request, it was Brown\u2019s obligation to include that information with his FOIA request. <em>See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.11(k)(5). Any information allegedly obtained from Brown\u2019s website by the Patent and Trademark Office was not part of the administrative record. The district court did not err when it relied on the certified Administrative Record. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Although Brown\u2019s brief contains no express argument regarding the legal basis for the summary judgment against his complaint, because Brown is <em>pro se, </em>we nonetheless address the legal conclusions of the district court with regard to Brown\u2019s fee waiver request. The FOIA mandates that \u201cfees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use\u201d and the request is made by certain specified institutions, including \u201crepresentative[s] of the news media.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). The regulations of the Patent and Trademark Office define a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d as \u201cany person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public.\u201d 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.11(b)(6). \u201cExamples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if they can qualify as disseminators of \u2018news\u2019) that make their products available for purchase or subscription by the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Freelance journalists can qualify as \u201crepresentative^ of the news media\u201d if they \u201cdemonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through [a news] organization.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In addition, \u201c[documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced ... if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). The requester bears the burden of presenting reasonably specific evidence that shows that he meets the statutory criteria. <em>See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.11(k)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">The district court did not err when it granted summary judgment. Brown\u2019s correspondence with the Patent and Trademark Office failed to establish that he was a \u201crepresentative of the news media\u201d or that the information requested was related to the activities and operations of that office. Brown\u2019s status as the publisher of a website does not make him a representative of the news media, and Brown\u2019s statements regarding the purpose of his website and the traffic and notice it has received do not establish that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>broadcasts or disseminates news to the public at large. Brown also failed to provide an adequate explanation how the requested information was related to the activities and operations of the Patent and Trademark Office or why the information would contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Brown\u2019s argument with regard to the bias of the magistrate judge also fails. Section 455 of Title 28 \u201ccreates two primary reasons for recusal.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2003). A judge \u201cshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), and a judge should recuse himself \u201c[wjhere he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\u201d or \u201c[wjhere in private practice he served as [a] lawyer in the matter in controversy,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 455(b)(1) \u2014 (2). \u201cThus, the standard of review for a \u00a7 455(a) motion is whether an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Patti </em>337 F.3d at 1321 (quotation marks and citation omitted). A party\u2019s complaints regarding \u201cjudicial rulings, routine trial administration efforts, and ordinary admonishments (whether or not legally supportable) to counsel\u201d are not sufficient to require recusal. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 556, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1158, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Under these standards, none of Brown\u2019s complaints regarding the magistrate judge or the district court requires recusal. The rulings against and admonishments of Brown do not demonstrate bias, and neither the employment of the magistrate judge, two decades ago, nor her ownership of stock in companies that may hold patents give rise to a significant doubt about her impartiality. <em>See Patti </em>337 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
