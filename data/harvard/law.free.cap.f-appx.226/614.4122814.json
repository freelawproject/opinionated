Castillo-Ramirez\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning the reasonableness of the sentence, which was at the low end of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We conclude the sentence is not unreasonable. In determining the sentence, the district court considered Castillo-Ramirez\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range, along with other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (\u00a7 3553(a) factors will guide reasonableness review). Moreover, nothing in the record suggests the district court failed to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or considered only appropriate factors but in weighing those factors committed a plain error of judgment. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005) (reasonableness of sentence reviewed for abuse of discretion; defining ways in which abuse of discretion may occur).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-30\">. The Honorable Lyle E. Strom, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
