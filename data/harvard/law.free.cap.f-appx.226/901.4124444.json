He argues that the ability to communicate effectively at his termination meeting was both an \u201cessential function\u201d of his job and one of the \u201cprivileges and benefits\u201d of employment, requiring a reasonable accommodation \u2014 specifically, the presence of an interpreter \u2014 under the ADA. Furthermore, he argues that his termination, while purportedly due to management\u2019s conclusion that he had written obscene graffiti on the bathroom walls, was in retaliation either for his reporting of the graffiti, or for his request that an interpreter be present at his termination meeting, in violation of the Florida Whistleblower Act (FWA), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 448.102(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">We review a grant of summary judgment on an ADA claim <em>de novo. Lowe v. Ala. Power Co., </em>244 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We have recognized that summary judgment is appropriate in an employment case where the plaintiff has offered evidence that is <em>\u201cmerely color-able, </em>or is <em>not significantly probative.\u201d Earley v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1080-81 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">In order to state a claim of discrimination under the ADA, Novella must have made a <em>prima facie </em>case showing: (1) he has a disability; (2) he is a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d which is to say, able to perform the essential functions of the employment position with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) Wal-Mart unlawfully discriminated against him because of his disability. <em>Reed v. Heil Co., </em>206 F.3d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir.2000). It was undisputed here that Novella has a disability. The district court did not reach the issue of whether Novella was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d Instead, the court decided the issue solely on the ground that the third prong was not met because no reasonable accommodation was required at the termination meeting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Regarding the third prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case, in the context of disability law, \u201cdiscrimination\u201d eneom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>passes the failure to make reasonable accommodations for the known disabilities of otherwise qualified persons. <em>D\u2019Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., </em>422 F.3d 1220, 1236 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations define the term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to include both modifications that enable an employee to \u201cperform the essential functions\u201d of the job, and modifications that enable an employee to \u201cenjoy the equal benefits and privileges of employment\u201d as other, non-disabled employees. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(o )(1)(ii), (iii). The \u201cessential\u201d functions of a job are the fundamental duties of the job and are distinct from \u201cmarginal\u201d functions. <em>LaChance v. Duffy\u2019s Draft House, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cDetermining whether a particular job duty is an essential function involves a factual inquiry to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Lucas v. <em>W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[I]n conducting this inquiry, \u2018consideration shall be given to the employer\u2019s judgment ... and if an employer has prepared a written description for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1361,1365 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">We have not addressed whether the ability to understand charges and defend oneself at a termination meeting qualifies as one of the \u201cbenefits and privileges\u201d of employment. Nonetheless, we have held that \u201c[a]n \u2018accommodation\u2019 is \u2018reasonable\u2019 \u2014 and, therefore, required under the ADA \u2014 only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.\u201d <em>LaChance, </em>146 F.3d at 835 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">In light of our earlier pronouncement in <em>LaChance, </em>we conclude that communication at a termination meeting, the purpose of which is to give the employee notice of his termination, is not an \u201cessential function\u201d of an employee\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation under the FWA, Novella was required to show: (1) that he engaged in protected activity; (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>853 So.2d 1125, 1132 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Opposing any act or activity that is made unlawful by the ADA is a \u201cprotected activity.\u201d <em>Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1218-19 (11th Cir.2004). The causation requirement is construed broadly, so that a plaintiff must only show the employer\u2019s awareness of a protected activity and a \u201cclose temporal proximity\u201d between the awareness and the adverse decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. However, an employer may rebut a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation with evidence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory purpose, which the employee must then prove by \u201csignificantly probative evidence\u201d to have been pretextual. <em>Carter v. City of Miami, </em>870 F.2d 578, 584 (11th Cir.1989). We may affirm the judgment below on any legal ground, regardless of the grounds relied upon by the district court. <em>Cuddeback v. Fla. Bd. of Educ., </em>381 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004). Thus, even if Novella were able to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, we may affirm the judgment below on the basis that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>was insufficient evidence of pretext. <em>Id. </em>at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">After careful review of the record we conclude that Novella failed to establish any causation between his reporting of the graffiti and his termination. Consequently, he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliatory firing. Because Novella otherwise failed to rebut Wal-Mart\u2019s showing of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business purpose for his ultimate termination, his claim that he was fired in retaliation for requesting an interpreter also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-10\">. After carefully reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties, we have determined that Novella\u2019s additional state law claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress is barred by the state law \"impact rule\u2019\u2019 and thus is without merit. <em>See RJ. v. Humana of Fla., </em>652 So.2d 360, 362-63 (Fla. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-15\">. While we refer to this as a termination meeting, the record demonstrates that it was really a meeting where Novella was simply given notice of his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. To the extent that Novella also asserted retaliation in violation of the ADA, we note that the test was the same as for FWA violations. <em>Standard, v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
