He claims that he is entitled to citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(c) because his mother was a citizen of the United States when he was born out of wedlock as the result of an adulterous affair, while she was married to Ronald Everton Gilkes.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The District Court denied the Government\u2019s motion to transfer this matter to the Second Circuit pursuant to \u00a7 106(c) of the REAL ID Act and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2). Instead, it transferred the petition to this Circuit. We will remand this matter to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing to resolve, in the first instance, the disputed factual issue regarding whether the Petitioner was born out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">The present record shows that the Petitioner\u2019s mother, Gloria Anita Gilkes (\u201cMrs. Gilkes\u201d), was born in the United States. She moved to Barbados in 1933, at the age of seven. Mrs. Gilkes married Ronald Everton Gilkes (\u201cMr. R.E. Gilkes\u201d), a Barbados citizen, in 1945. The Petitioner was born in Barbados on July 12, 1955. Mr. R.E. Gilkes is named as the Petitioner\u2019s father on his birth certificate and his baptismal certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">On June 15,1956, Mr. R.E. Gilkes filed a petition in the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes in Barbados for the dissolution of his marriage with Mrs. Gilkes on the ground of adultery. The dissolution petition contains the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-17\">1. That on the 22nd day of March 1945, the petitioner was lawfully married to Gloria Anita Gilkes, then Gloria Anita Cumberbatch, Spinster, (hereinafter called \u201cthe Respondent\u201d) at Ml Saints Church in the parish of Saint Peter and Island of Barbados.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-18\">2. That after the said marriage the petitioner and respondent lived and cohabited at Rose Hill in the parish of Saint Peter and Island of Barbados and there is issue of the said marriage now living two children, namely, Claudette Izolo Gilkes, born on the 22nd day of June 1946, and Hugh Rodney Rubinstein Gilkes, born on the 9th day of March 1950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-19\">5. That the respondent has frequently committed adultery with Arnold Sandiford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-20\">6. That from the month of Marth 1954 to the month of May 1956 at Rose Hill in the parish of Saint Peter aforesaid the respondent frequently committed adultery with the said Arnold Sandiford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-21\">7. That on the 12th day of July 1955 the respondent was delivered of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>child named \u201cCurvan Wayne\u201d the paternity of whom is not admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_f\">The petitioner therefore prays that the discretion of the court may be exercised in his favor and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">1. That his said marriage may be dissolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">2. That he may have the custody of the children Claudette Izolo Gilkes and Hugh Rodney Rubinstein Gilkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In an accompanying affidavit, Mr. R.E. Gilkes admitted the statements contained in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 were true. He further alleged that the statements contained in paragraph 5 and 6 were true to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On October 5, 1956, the Barbados Court dissolved the marriage \u201cby reason that since the celebration [of the marriage] the said respondent has been guilty of adultery----\u201d The Court also ordered that \u201cClaudette Izolo Gilkes and Hugh Rodney Rubinstein Gilkes the children, issue of the marriage between [Mr. R.E. Gilkes] and [Gloria Anita Gilkes], do remain in the custody of [Mr. R.E. Gilkes] until further order of the Court____\u201d The decree of the Barbados Court did not refer to the paternity of Curvan Wayne Gilkes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">In 1967, the Petitioner entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident. The Petitioner was convicted in the New York Supreme Court on January 4, 2001, of the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, in violation of \u00a7 220.31 of the New York State Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">Based on this conviction, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service commenced removal proceedings against the Petitioner by filing a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) on April 4, 2001. The NTA charged that the Petitioner was removable from the United States pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense. The Petitioner challenged his removal by claiming that he was a derivative citizen of the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(7) (1952). Under the 1952 version of \u00a7 1401(a)(7), one could obtain United States citizenship at birth if he or she was born outside of the United States and had one United States citizen parent who, prior to the birth of this person, was physically present in the United States for periods totaling not less than ten years, and at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\">On October 16, 2001, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that the Petitioner was not a derivative citizen of the United States. The IJ ordered that the Petitioner be removed to Barbados. The Petitioner appealed the decision of the IJ to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s decision. It concluded that the IJ erred in construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the applicable law regarding the citizenship of a child born abroad when one parent is a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On April 30, 2002, the IJ rejected the Petitioner\u2019s derivative citizenship claim. It ordered him removed from the United States. Following this decision, the Petitioner filed a motion to reopen. On June 11, 2002, the IJ denied the Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen. The Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. On July 25, 2002, the BIA dismissed the Petitioner\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was untimely filed. On August 21, 2002, the Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider. This motion was denied by the BIA on October 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">On June 1, 2003, the Petitioner filed an application for Certificate of Citizenship, Form N-600, with the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cBCIS\u201d). On August 27, 2003, the BCIS denied the Petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of citizenship. The BCIS informed the Petitioner that he had thirty days to file an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Unit (\u201cAAU\u201d). The appendix contains a notice of appeal to the AAU from the denial of the Petitioner\u2019s application for a Certificate of Citizenship, Form N-600. It is not time stamped.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">On August 19, 2003, the Petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In his brief in support of this application, the Petitioner contended that \u201che is a citizen [of the United States] because of [his] USA born mother.... \u201d Brief of Petitioner at 6, <em>Gilkes v. Ridge, </em>No. 4:03-CV-1417 (M.D.Pa. Aug. 19, 2003). The Petitioner alleged that \u201c[t]he immigration court and the BIA discriminated against the Petitioner\u2019s mother and her offspring which violate[d] the equal [protection] clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Petitioner did not rely on any specific statutory provision to support his claims. In support of his application, the Petitioner filed his mother\u2019s affidavit in which she alleged: \u201cI took care of [the Petitioner] from the time he was born until he was eighteen (18) years old with no help from his father. Ronald Everton Gilkes.\u201d Response Brief of Petitioner at Attachment D, <em>Gilkes v. Ridge, </em>No. 4:03-CV-1417 (M.D.Pa. Sept. 29, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">On December 4, 2003, the District Court denied the Petitioner\u2019s application for habeas corpus relief. It held that there was no basis for exercising habeas corpus jurisdiction because the Petitioner had failed to allege a violation of the Constitution or the laws of the United States. It also concluded that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), it lacked the jurisdiction to transfer this matter to the Court of Appeals as a petition for review because it was filed more than thirty days after the final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">The Petitioner filed a timely appeal in this Court on December 11, 2003. In his appeal to this Court, the Petitioner raised three separate claims. The Petitioner\u2019s first claim asserted that the BIA erred in its application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(7) (1952) to the facts of his case. The Petitioner\u2019s second claim asserted for the first time that he was entitled to United States citizenship pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431 (1994). Under the 1994 version of \u00a7 1431, a child born outside of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>with one alien parent and one United States citizen parent may become a citizen of the United States if the alien parent is naturalized and if certain other conditions are met.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Petitioner\u2019s third claim asserted for the first time that he was entitled to United States citizenship as he owed permanent allegiance to the United States, evidenced by his registration for the draft in 1972. On July 19, 2004, this Court reversed the District Court\u2019s decision and remanded the matter to the District Court for a decision on the merits of the Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 1401(a)(7) claim. <em>Gilkes v. Ridge, </em>No. 03-4889, slip. op. at 10 (3rd Cir. May 26, 2004). This Court concluded that the Petitioner had exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his \u00a7 1401(a)(7) claim. <em>Id. </em>It also concluded that the Petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim of citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431 (1994) and his non-citizen nationality claim that he owed permanent allegiance to the United States. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, this Court dismissed the unexhausted claims. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Upon remand, the Petitioner maintained that he automatically acquired United States citizenship under the 2001 version of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431. The District Court concluded that the 2001 version of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431 did not apply because the Petitioner was not under the age of eighteen on the statute\u2019s effective date. <em>Gilkes v. Ridge, </em>No. 4:03-CV-1417, at 3-4 (M.D.Pa. Oct. 8, 2004). The Petitioner also argued for the first time that he was entitled to citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3), (5). The District Court concluded that the 1988 version of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a) controlled the Petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Gilkes v. Ridge, </em>No. 4-.03-CV-1417, at 4-5 (M.D.Pa. Oct. 8, 2004). Under that section, a child born outside of the United States of alien parents could become a citizen of the United States upon the fulfillment of certain conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u00a7 1432(a)(3), (5) \u201cdoes not render [the Petitioner] a derivative citizen\u201d because \u201che was not born of alien parents.\u201d <em>Gilkes v. Ridge, </em>No. 4:03-CV-1417, at 5 (M.D.Pa. Oct. 8, 2004). Accordingly, the District Court denied the Petitioner\u2019s application for habeas corpus relief on October 8, 2004. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Petitioner filed an appeal to this Court on October 27, 2004. For the first time he contended that he was entitled to derivative citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(c). Under \u00a7 1409(c), a person born after December 23, 1952, outside the United States and out of wedlock, may derive United States citizenship from his or her United States citizen mother if certain conditions are met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On April 26, 2005, this Court issued an order which states: \u201cThis matter is hereby remanded to the District Court for consideration of Gilkes\u2019 claim that he is entitled to derivative citizenship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">After this Court\u2019s mandate was issued, the Petitioner\u2019s mother filed an affidavit dated June 15, 2005, in a Barbados court, alleging that \u201cRonald Everton Gilkes is not the father of my son Curvan Wayne Gilkes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">While this matter was pending in the District Court, the REAL ID Act became effective. Section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f an alien's case, brought under section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, and challenging a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, is pending in a district court on the date of the enactment of this division, then the district court shall transfer the case ... to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed under ... 8 U.S.C. 1252 [ (b)(2) ].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 (Transfer of Cases Note) (codifying REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, Title I, \u00a7 106(c), 119 Stat. 231, 311 (2005)). Section 1252(b)(2) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he petition for review [of orders of removal] shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">On July 29, 2005, the Government filed a motion to transfer this matter to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit pursuant to Section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2). On November 7, 2005, the District Court denied the Government\u2019s motion to transfer this matter to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit because proceedings had previously been initiated before this Court. In addition, it ordered the Clerk of Court to transfer this matter to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit pursuant to \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">The Petitioner requests that this Court grant his petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409(c) and direct the Government to take all necessary steps to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>his application for citizenship. He argues that the evidence in the present record is sufficient to support a finding that he was born out of wedlock as the product of his mother\u2019s adulterous affair. In short, he maintains that a child born to a woman married to a man who is not the child\u2019s biological father should be considered \u201cborn out of wedlock.\u201d Alternatively, he requests that this Court should</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX\">remand the case to the District Court with instructions to hold the matter in abeyance to permit [the Petitioner] the opportunity to apply to the Barbados courts for an order <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>stating that [the Petitioner] was born out of wedlock, and to reconsider the merits of [the] Petition in light of that <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Brief of Petitioner at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>constitutional claims or questions of law presented in an application for a writ of habeas corpus that has been converted to a petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>Kamara v. Attorney General, </em>420 F.3d 202, 210-11 (3rd Cir.2005); <em>Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 446 (3rd Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Before determining whether we should consider the merits of the Petitioner\u2019s derivative citizenship claim under \u00a7 1409(c), we must address the Government\u2019s argument that \u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction to address the merits of Gilkes\u2019s claim and should transfer the petition to the court of appeals in which a petition for review could be properly filed, i.e. the Second Circuit.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 18. We disagree with the Government\u2019s contention that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2) of the REAL ID Act limits this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over this matter. Section 1252(b)(2) provides as follows: \u201cthe petition for review [of orders of removal] shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.\u201d The Petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings were heard and completed by an IJ in Napanoch, New York. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that \u00a7 1252(b)(2) contains a venue provision \u2014 it is not jurisdictional. <em>Nwaokolo v. I.N.S., </em>314 F.3d 303, 306 n. 2 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">In <em>Bonhometre, </em>the immigration proceedings were conducted in the First Circuit, but the petitioner filed his petition in this Circuit, where he was being detained. <em>Bonhometre, </em>414 F.3d at 446 n. 5. This Court declined to transfer the matter to the First Circuit. <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned as follows: \u201c[G]iven that this case has been thoroughly briefed and argued before us, and given that Mr. Bonhometre has waited a long time for the resolution of his claims, we believe it would be a manifest injustice to now transfer this case to another court for duplicative proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">In this case, the Petitioner\u2019s derivative citizenship claim has been before this Court since December 11, 2003. Twice before, we have ordered a remand for further proceedings in the District Court. Once again, briefs have been filed by the parties and the case has been argued before us. In light of the procedural history of this matter in this Circuit, we are persuaded that it would be unreasonable for us to transfer this matter to another venue for a review of the Petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The Petitioner now contends that the evidence shows that he acquired United States citizenship through his mother under \u00a7 1409(c). Section 1409(c) provides as follows in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">[A] person born, after December 23, 1952, outside the United States and out of wedlock shall be held to have ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>quired at birth the nationality status of his mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the time of such person\u2019s birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">There is no dispute between the parties that the Petitioner was born after December 23, 1952, in Barbados, that his mother was a citizen of the United States on the date he was born, and that she had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of one year. The parties do, however, dispute whether Mr. Gilkes was born \u201cout of wedlock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Petitioner argues that the conclusion that Mr. R.E. Gilkes is not his biological father \u201cis irrefutable as a matter of fact.\u201d Brief of Petitioner at 20. He relies on the following evidence to support this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">One. In Mr. R.E. Gilkes\u2019s petition for a dissolution, he alleged that his wife had an adulterous affair beginning more than a year before the Petitioner was born and continued until after his birth date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">Two. He also alleged that the only issue of the marriage were Claudette and Hugh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">Three. Mr. R.E. Gilkes further alleged that the paternity of Curvan Wayne Gilkes is \u201cnot admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">Four. Mr. R.E. Gilkes only prayed for the custody of Claudette and Hugh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6H\">Five. The Barbados court granted the petition for dissolution on the ground of adultery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">Six. The court awarded custody of Claudette and Hugh to Mr. R.E. Gilkes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">Seven. Mrs. Gilkes filed a sworn affidavit to a Barbados court in which she alleged that Mr. R.E. Gilkes was not the father of Curvan Wayne Gilkes, after the Petitioner claimed on January 19, 2005 that he was entitled to citizenship under \u00a7 1409(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">In challenging the Petitioner\u2019s contention that Mr. R.E. Gilkes was not his biological father, the Government asserted in its responsive brief that \u201cthere is significant doubt regarding [the Petitioner\u2019s] paternity.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 28. The Government points to the following facts in support of this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-15\">One. Mrs. Gilkes married Mr. R.E. Gilkes, a citizen of Barbados, on March 22,1945.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-16\">Two. The Petitioner was born on July 12,1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-17\">Three. Mr. R.E. Gilkes is named as the Petitioner\u2019s father in his birth certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">Four. Mr. R.E. Gilkes is named as the Petitioner\u2019s father on his baptismal certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-19\">Five. In his application for a writ of habeas corpus, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 on August 19, 2003, the Petitioner declared under penalty of perjury that his mother \u201cmarried the Petitioner\u2019s father on March 22,1945.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-20\">Six. The Petitioner filed an affidavit signed by his mother, in support of his application for habeas corpus relief, in which she swore that Curvan Wayne Gilkes\u2019s father was Ronald Everton Gilkes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-21\">Thus, contrary to the Petitioner\u2019s argument, the question whether Mr. R.E. Gilkes is his father is clearly not an \u201cirrefutable fact.\u201d It is highly contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-22\">No court has resolved the factual question whether Mr. R.E. Gilkes is the Petitioner\u2019s father. The Barbados Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes did not make a finding regarding who was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>biological father of the Petitioner. Because Petitioner\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1409(c) was still pending in the District Court when the REAL ID Act was enacted, the District Court transferred this matter to this Court before holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve the paternity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Our jurisdiction in reviewing a claim that a person is a national of the United States is limited to petitions where \u201cno genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner\u2019s nationality is presented.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A). Section 1252(b)(5)(B)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> expressly provides that if \u201cthe court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner\u2019s nationality is presented, the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim.\u201d Section 1252(b)(5)(B) was not affected by the enactment of the REAL ID Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Because conflicting evidence has been presented by the Petitioner regarding whether Mr. R.E. Gilkes was his biological father, we lack the jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B) to make a finding on this factual question. Accordingly, we will remand this matter to the District Court with instructions that it make findings regarding whether Mr. R.E. Gilkes is the biological father of the Petitioner. Upon such determination this Court will have the jurisdiction to address the legal questions presented in this petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-13\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a)(7) (1952) provides in relevant part that the following persons shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">[A] person bom outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">.
