O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b821-27\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>mously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Craig C. Garrett, a federal prisoner represented by counsel, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. The district court dismissed the motion. Garrett then filed a notice of appeal, but the district court did not issue a Certificate of Appealability (COA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, Garrett requested a COA in his opening brief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">On April 3, 2003, Garrett pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to possession of a firearm after a conviction of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9). On June 20, 2003, he was sentenced to 51 months in custody. Garrett did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Garrett filed a \u00a7 2255 motion on June 21, 2004, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel based on his counsel\u2019s failure to argue he was not convicted of a crime of domestic violence. The district court denied the motion on September 12, 2005, concluding Garrett was previously convicted of the crime of domestic violence in violation of Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 18-918 (2003). The district court noted the title of Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 18-918 (2003) was \u201cdomestic violence\u201d and the Idaho Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he domestic violence statute, I.C. \u00a7 18-918 (2003), generally prohibits assaults and batteries among \u2018household members.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. Hansell, </em>141 Idaho 587, 114 P.3d 145, 147 (2005). Two days later, the Sixth Judicial District of Idaho amended Garrett\u2019s conviction to correct a typographical error and reflect the fact he was convicted of a simple assault misdemeanor under Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 18-901 (2003) rather than domestic violence under Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 18-918 (2003). Based on this clarification, Garrett filed a motion for reconsideration on September 16, 2005, attaching the amended conviction and an affidavit from the prosecuting attorney in his state case stating that Garrett was convicted of simple assault under Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 18-901 (2003) and not \u00a7 18-918. Despite his amended conviction, the district court denied the motion on September 19, 2005. On September 27, 2005, Garrett filed a notice of appeal with the district court and a motion for clarification. On November 4, 2005, the district court responded to Garrett\u2019s motion for clarification and outlined the same reasons stated in its September 12, 2005 decision. On July 5, 2006, Garrett filed his second corrected opening brief and an application for COA in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) and Rule 22(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"AQe\">\n<em>Certificate of Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Asg\">A COA is a jurisdictional pre-requisite to our review. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA only if Garrett makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make this showing, he must establish that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved [by the district court] in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number><em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. English v. Cody, </em>241 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir.2001). The district court correctly found Garrett\u2019s conviction qualified as a crime of domestic violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9). While it is unclear whether the district court considered Garrett\u2019s amended conviction, even the amended conviction meets the definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The definition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) does not require the underlying misdemeanor offense to have, as an element of the crime, a domestic relationship. <em>See United States v. Heckenliable, </em>446 F.3d 1048, 1050 (10th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 287, 166 L.Ed.2d 219 (2006). Information presented to the district court by Garrett shows a domestic relationship was involved in the underlying offense, even though the state assault statute did not include a domestic relationship element. (Pet\u2019r Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Ex. 4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). The district court\u2019s denial of Garrett\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not reasonably debatable. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Garrett has failed to make a sufficient showing that he is entitled to a COA. Accordingly, we DENY COA and DISMISS his application.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. \"If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district judge who rendered the judgment must either issue a certificate of appealability or state why a certificate should not issue.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). The district court did not act on Garrett's constructive request for a COA. A COA is deemed denied if the district court does not address the issuance of a COA within thirty days. 10th Cir. R. 22.1(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-9\">.
