In August 2003, NPC promoted Paula Stanford, a white female, from the position of restaurant general manager (\u201cRGM\u201d) to area general manager (\u201cAGM\u201d), with responsibility for overseeing five to ten restaurants. At that time, Olivia and Eddie Davis were RGMs for NPC restaurants, while Taylor was an assistant manager at Olivia Davis\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-22\">The district court granted summary judgment to NPC. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Little v. United Techs., </em>103 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir.1997). Sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>mary judgment is appropriate where the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The plaintiffs attempted to use circumstantial, rather than direct, evidence to prove discrimination on the basis of race. When a plaintiffs Title VII claim is based on circumstantial evidence, we evaluate the claim under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-4, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-5, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. \u201cIn order to establish a prima facie case ... the plaintiff must demonstrate only that: (i) he or she belonged to a protected class; (ii) he or she was qualified for and applied for a position that the employer was seeking to fill; (iii) despite qualifications, he or she was rejected; and (iv) the position was filled with an individual outside the protected class.\u201d <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. System, </em>408 F.3d 763, 768 (11th Cir.2005) (in context of failure to promote claim). Once the plaintiff has presented a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for its employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 5. Ct. at 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">If the employer does articulate such a reason, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove that the reason provided by the defendant is a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006). The employee must meet his or her burden of production on pretext in order to avoid summary judgment. <em>See Kelliher v. Veneman, </em>313 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]he employer is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff proffers evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that discrimination was actually the reason for the challenged action.\u201d). To show pretext, the employee must \u201ccome forward with evidence ... sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, Meadowcraft, Inc., </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir.1997). <em>Accord Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Here, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the plaintiffs have made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, NPC has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for promoting Stanford rather than one of the plaintiffs. NPC stated that it promoted Stanford because she was more qualified for the position than the plaintiffs. NPC produced evidence showing that Stanford met the internal minimum qualifications for the AGM position, had years of experience managing multiple restaurants for another company, and had owned and managed several of her own restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Plaintiffs then had the burden of producing evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that NPC\u2019s stated reason for promoting Stanford was pretextual. <em>Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1528. Plaintiffs produced no such evidence. They asserted that Stanford was less qualified than they were, based on the plaintiffs\u2019 greater length of service with NPC. This did not, however, demonstrate pretext. \u201c[A] plaintiff may not establish that an employer\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual merely by questioning the wisdom of the employer\u2019s reasons, at least not where ... the reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer.\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006). Therefore, to establish pretext on the basis of a comparison of qualifications, \u201cthe dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>ference in qualifications must be so glaring that no reasonable impartial person could have chosen the candidate selected for the promotion in question over the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Vessels, </em>408 F.3d at 772. <em>Accord Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 454, 126 S.Ct. 1195,1197,163 L.Ed.2d 1053 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Here, the difference in qualifications did not meet this standard. There must be a \u201cglaring\u201d difference in qualifications if that difference alone is used to impeach the employer\u2019s stated reason for its decision. <em>Vessels, </em>408 F.3d at 772. In the instant case, this difference in qualifications was simply not present. In fact, it was reasonable for NPC to conclude that Stanford was more qualified for the AGM position than the plaintiffs were, despite their longer tenure with NPC. Stanford had managed multiple restaurants for years, while plaintiffs had managed at most one restaurant. One of the plaintiffs, Taylor, had not even been an RGM at the time Stanford was promoted. The plaintiffs therefore could not establish pretext simply by comparing their qualifications to Stanford\u2019s. Because they produced no additional evidence of pretext, they did not meet their burden of production, and summary judgment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Plaintiffs further argue on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing their case with prejudice. Dismissal with prejudice was, however, a necessary result of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to NPC. <em>See Tuley v. Heyd, </em>482 F.2d 590, 594 n. 2 (5th Cir.1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\">. In <em>Bonner v.
