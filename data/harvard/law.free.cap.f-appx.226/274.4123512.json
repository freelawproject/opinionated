Hope timely appealed, arguing that his sentence as a career offender was unreasonable and greater than necessary to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews a sentence to determine whether the district court has correctly calculated the advisory guideline range and has considered the range, as well as the factors set out \u00a7 3553(a), and whether the sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005) . A sentence within the properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-20\">Hope concedes that his sentence was within the correctly calculated guideline range of 151 to 188 months. Therefore, the sentence is presumptively reasonable. While Hope argues that the district court failed to adequately address the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that the district court considered the applicable \u00a7 3553 factors and did not impose a sentence that was greater than necessary to comply with \u00a7 3553. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir. 2006) .</p>\n<p id=\"b299-22\">Accordingly, we affirm Hope\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
