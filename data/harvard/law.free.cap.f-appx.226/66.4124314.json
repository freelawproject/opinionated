Videla denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yong Hui Liu, </em>No. A78 861 556 (B.I.A. Oct. 22, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 861 556 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 9, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">In general, we liberally construe the papers filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>See Marmolejo v. United States, </em>196 F.3d 377, 378 (2d Cir.1999). However, \u201cwe need not manufacture claims of error for an appellant proceeding <em>pro se.\u201d LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir.1995) (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (noting that a brief must contain \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d). Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>LNC Invs., Inc. v. Nat'l Westminster Bank, N.J., </em>308 F.3d 169,176 n. 8 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Even construed liberally, Liu\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief does not raise any arguments that address the IJ\u2019s substantive findings \u2014 notably the adverse credibility determination \u2014 and we are not obliged to \u201cmanufacture claims of error\u201d on Liu\u2019s behalf. <em>LoSacco, </em>71 F.3d at 93; <em>see Marmolejo, </em>196 F.3d at 378. Moreover, there is no indication that declining to consider the arguments waived by Liu would result in a manifest injustice, especially in light of the fact that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusions. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7; <em>see also Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
