Sutton appeals, challenging an evidentiary ruling by the district court and also arguing his sentence is unreasonable and so grossly disproportionate to Sutton\u2019s offense that his sentence violates due process and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>463 F.3d 803, 808 (8th Cir.2006), and the reasonableness of Sutton\u2019s sentence, <em>see United States v. McMorrow, </em>471 F.3d 921, 924 (8th Cir. 2006). We review de novo whether Sutton\u2019s sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime committed and thus violates due process and ultimately the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See United States v. Weis, </em>487 F.3d 1148, 1154 (8th Cir.2007) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment challenge upon finding the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cnot \u2018the rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 30, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (quoting <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 1005, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991)))). As an armed career criminal, Sutton faced a sentence, as specified by Congress, at or near the statutory maximum, which in this case is life imprisonment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h); <em>United States v. Maloney, </em>466 F.3d 663, 669 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Having carefully considered Sutton\u2019s arguments and the record, we find no abuse of discretion or legal error by the district court. Therefore, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-38\">. The Honorable Rodney W.
