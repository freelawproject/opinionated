On appeal, AMR contends the district court (1) lacked jurisdiction; (2) erred in awarding $649,000 in punitive damages; and (3) erred in denying AMR\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Coyle v. P.T. Garuda Indonesia, </em>363 F.3d 979, 984 n. 7 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Because this case arises under federal law, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d). Whether AMR was a debt collector within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a is not a jurisdictional fact, but rather an element of Bennett\u2019s claim under the FDCPA. <em>See Arbaugh v.Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500,126 S.Ct. 1235, 1244-45, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). Here, Bennett alleged \u201ca colorable claim \u2018arising under\u2019 \u201d the FDCPA <em>see id. </em>at 1244, and therefore the district court properly asserted federal question jurisdiction. Consequently, the district court possessed supplemental jurisdiction over Bennett\u2019s state law negligence and punitive damages claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to award punitive damages for abuse of discretion. <em>See Fair Hous. of Marin v. Combs, </em>285 F.3d 899, 906-07 (9th Cir. 2002). Whether the amount of an award of punitive damages is unconstitutionally excessive, however, is reviewed <em>de novo. See Cooper Indus. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., </em>532 U.S. 424, 435-36, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">Here, the district court awarded $649,000 in punitive damages under Montana Code Annotated section 27-1-221. On appeal, AMR contends: (1) the district court erred because there was no evidence of actual malice within the meaning of Montana Code Annotated section 27-1-221(2); (2) the district court failed to address section \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(b) mandatory statutory factors and failed to articulate evidence in support of the factors; and (3) the award was unconstitutionally excessive. Only AMR\u2019s third contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">Regarding \u201cactual malice,\u201d upon default \u201cthe general rule is that well-pled allegations in the complaint regarding liability are deemed true.\u201d <em>Fair Hous. of Marin, </em>285 F.3d at 906; <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(d) (allegations not denied are deemed admitted). Here, Bennett alleged that \u201cin pursuing their erroneous debt collection efforts against Plaintiff, the Defendants acted with actual malice, as defined by Mont.Code. Ann. \u00a7 27-1-221.\u201d Thus, \u201cactual malice\u201d was deemed true upon AMR\u2019s default and no further evidence of \u201cactual malice\u201d was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">AMR correctly contends that Montana law requires specific findings of fact and conclusions of law be made when awarding punitive damages. <em>See </em>Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 27 \u2014 1\u2014221(7)(b). Contrary to AMR\u2019s position, section 27 \u2014 1\u2014211(7)(b) does not require the district court \u201cto articulate evidence in support of\u2019 its findings of fact. Here, Bennett\u2019s complaint alleged the details of Defendants\u2019 wrongful con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>duct and further alleged that they acted with actual malice. Also, in support of his request for the court to determine a dollar amount of the judgment he was seeking, Bennett submitted additional evidentiary support for his claim that AMR acted with actual malice. On this record, the district court\u2019s finding that AMR\u2019s conduct was malicious within the meaning of Montana Code Section 27-1-221(2) was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, we reject AMR\u2019s challenge to the finding of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">While the punitive damages award was therefore lawful under Montana law, its constitutionality is less clear. The Supreme Court has \u201cinstructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s misconduct; (2) the ratio between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513,155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The Supreme Court has held that the first guidepost, <em>i.e., </em>the degree of reprehensibility of AMR\u2019s misconduct, is the most important factor in assessing the reasonableness of a punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 123 S.Ct. 1513. Here, the reprehensibility of AMR\u2019s conduct is tempered by the fact that AMR\u2019s conduct did not demonstrate \u201can indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As in <em>State Farm, </em>AMR\u2019s conduct primarily risked emotional, as opposed to physical, harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">As to the second guidepost, the Supreme Court has \u201cbeen reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 123 S.Ct. 1513. The Supreme Court, however, has stated \u201cthat, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>State Farm </em>the Supreme Court overturned a $145 million punitive damages award, representing a 145:1 ratio, as unconstitutionally excessive. <em>Id. </em>at 429, 123 S.Ct. 1513.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Like the injury in <em>State Farm, </em>the injury in this case \u201carose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 123 S.Ct. 1513. The district court\u2019s award of $100,000 in compensatory damages is also analogous to the compensatory damages awarded in <em>State Farm </em>in that it was both substantial and represented full compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 123 S.Ct. 1513. Finally, like the damages awarded in <em>State Farm, </em>the award of compensatory damages in this case was based in part on \u201cemotional distress,\u201d a component that was duplicated in the punitive award. <em>Id. </em>at 426,123 S.Ct. 1513.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The third <em>State Farm </em>guidepost also weighs in favor of reducing the punitive damages awarded by the district court. The parties have not identified any civil penalties that have been imposed in comparable Montana cases. AMR notes, however, that under the FDCPA, an award of damages may not exceed $1,000. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(A). Although the FDCPA provides for damages and not penalties, \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(A) does provide some basis for comparison. Here, the $649,000 punitive damages award dwarfs the $1000 in statutory damages authorized by the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Applying the <em>State Farm </em>guideposts to this case, we conclude that the district court\u2019s award of $649,000 in punitive dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ages, a 6.49:1 ratio, was excessive. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s award of $649,000 in punitive damages and remand for consideration of a punitive damages award not exceeding a 4:1 ratio, <em>see State Farm, </em>538 U.S. at 424-25, 123 S.Ct. 1513, punitive damages to compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment. <em>See Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, </em>365 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.2004). Here, our review of the record discloses no legal or factual basis for granting AMR\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s (1) exercise of federal question and supplemental jurisdiction, (2) award of compensatory damages, and (3) denial of AMR\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion. The district court\u2019s award of punitive damages is REVERSED and this case is REMANDED for consideration of punitive damages not to exceed a 4:1 ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
