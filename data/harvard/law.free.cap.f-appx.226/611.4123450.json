SYKES, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b635-17\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b635-18\">Theodore Cavett was charged, along with two codefendants, with four counts of distributing crack in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Cavett pleaded guilty to count four, which charged him with distributing 50 or more grams. Prior to sentencing, the government filed a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce Cavett\u2019s advisory guidelines imprisonment range based on Cavett\u2019s early cooperation and partial role in convincing a codefendant to turn himself in to authorities. The district court denied this motion, stating \u201cI am not persuaded that your assistance is sufficient to warrant a downward departure, although it does warrant giving you a sentence at the lower end of the Guideline range.\u201d The district court proceeded to sentence Cavett to 272 months\u2019 imprisonment (which did in fact fall on the low end of the advisory guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">Cavett appeals his sentence, alleging the district court improperly considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and challenging the district court\u2019s denial of the government\u2019s substantial assistance motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cavett also argues that any presumption of reasonableness is inconsistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">Because Cavett\u2019s sentence falls within a properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumed reasonable under <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir. 2005). We are mindful that the Supreme Court will soon decide whether it is consistent with <em>Booker </em>to afford a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). The resolution of that question, however, would not affect our conclusion that Cavett\u2019s sentence is reasonable (and that any challenge to his sentence would be frivolous).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-25\">After giving due consideration to the arguments made by government and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>fense counsel, <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>429 F.3d 673, 678 (7th Cir.2005), the district court consulted the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and identified those having a significant effect on its choice of sentence. <em>United States v. Nitch, </em>477 F.3d 933, 937 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005). Specifically, the court noted that Cavett had \u201ca very difficult childhood,\u201d experienced \u201csome horrible losses in ... life,\u201d and had difficulties finding employment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). However, after the court considered that Cavett had engaged in criminal conduct for more than fifteen years, had a history of violent crime, and is a gang member and a chronic drug user, <em>id., </em>it concluded that a sentence of 272 months was necessary to \u201cprotect the community from ... [his] violent criminal conduct\u201d and to reflect the seriousness of the conduct. Based on the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and regardless of any presumption, we are unable to say that Cavett\u2019s 272-month sentence is unreasonable. <em>Dean, </em>414 F.3d at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the sentence entered by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-19\">. <em>Post-Booker, </em>we do not review the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial of the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure but, rather, consider whether the overall sentence imposed is reasonable. <em>United States v. Laufle, </em>433 <em>F.3d 981, 987 </em>(7th <em>Cir.2006).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
