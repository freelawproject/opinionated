The Court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b29-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court\u2014 accompanied by its thoughtful opinion \u2014 is affirmed. We add only two points. The first is that the district judge\u2019s opinion, which grants <em>Chevron </em>deference to the FDA\u2019s statutory interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) embodied in FDA approval letters (i.e., informal adjudications), is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>post-Mead </em>decision in <em>Barnhart v. Walton, </em>535 U.S. 212, 222, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002), as well as our own decision in <em>Mylan Laboratories, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>389 F.3d 1272, 1279-80 (D.C.Cir.2004). Moreover, the FDA\u2019s interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) is clearly supported by its regulation, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.107(c)(1), which also warrants <em>Chevron </em>deference under <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
