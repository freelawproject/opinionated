Because Day did not make a jury demand, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Choate v. Lockhart, </em>7 F.3d 1370,1373 n. 1 (8th Cir.1993). Contrary to Day\u2019s suggestions on appeal, the district court was entitled to discount some of his testimony and accept the testimony of others, <em>see Estate of Davis v. Delo, </em>115 F.3d 1388, 1394 (8th Cir.1997) (credibility determinations are uniquely within fact finder\u2019s province); and we conclude the court did not err in rejecting Day\u2019s deliberate-indifference and negligence claims, <em>see Alberson v. Norris, </em>458 F.3d 762, 765 (8th Cir. 2006) (to prevail on Eighth Amendment claim, plaintiff must show more than gross negligence). We further conclude that Day\u2019s evidence fell short of establishing an equal protection violation, <em>see Murphy v. Mo. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>372 F.3d 979, 984 (8th Cir.2004) (to prevail on equal protection claim, inmate had to show that he was treated differently than similarly situated classes of inmates, and that differing treatment burdened one of his fundamental rights and bore no rational relationship to legitimate penal interest), or a breach of contract on the part of Correctional Medical Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-16\">. The Honorable William R. Wilson, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable H. David Young, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
