Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), and its progeny, which have outlined this court\u2019s methodology for reviewing sentences for reasonableness. Lazo also preserves for further review his contention that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry guideline is unduly severe and because the absence of a \u201cfast track\u201d program creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Lazo concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir. 2006), which held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not give sentencing courts the discretion to impose a non-Guideline sentence based on the courts\u2019 disagreement with Congressional and Sentencing Commission policy,\u201d and by <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 13, 2006) (No. 06-7792), which held that the district court\u2019s refusal to factor in, when sentencing a defendant, the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs does not render a sentence unreasonable, respectively. Finally, Lazo raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
