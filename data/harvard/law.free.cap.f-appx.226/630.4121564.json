Albert has also petitioned for a writ of mandamus. We dismiss the two appeals for want of jurisdiction, and we deny mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">The first order appealed is an October 18, 2006 order dismissing claims against three of the five defendants and denying injunctive relief. The dismissal of the defendants is not a final order because the claims against the remaining two defendants were not disposed of in the October 18 order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (defining appellate jurisdiction over final district court decisions); <em>Bullock v. Baptist Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>817 F.2d 58, 59 (8th Cir.1987) (holding an order dismissing complaint as to fewer than all defendants is not final order within meaning of \u00a7 1291). Additionally, the district court neither certified the order for immediate appeal, nor directed entry of a partial final judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (stating a district court may certify a non-final order for appeal when the order involves a controlling ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tion of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b) (stating a district court may expressly direct the entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims or parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Although the October 18 order as a whole is not immediately appealable, we have interlocutory appellate jurisdiction to review that part of the order denying injunctive relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (allowing an appeal from an interlocutory order granting or denying injunctive relief). However, the December 22 notice of appeal from the October 18 order is untimely, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), and we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to reopen the time to file the appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). In particular, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding Albert failed to show he did not receive notice of the October 18 order. <em>See Am. Boat Co. v. Unknown, Sunken Barge, </em>418 F.3d 910, 913 (8th Cir.2005) (reviewing for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination that the appellant received notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The second order appealed, a January 26, 2007 order granting in forma pauperis status and clarifying previous orders, is also not an order over which we have jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Therefore, we dismiss the two appeals for want of jurisdiction. Finally, we deny mandamus relief as unwarranted. <em>See Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309,109 S.Ct. 1814,104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989) (declaring mandamus is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d); <em>In re Lane, </em>801 F.2d 1040,1042 (8th Cir.1986) (stating mandamus standard, which includes petitioner must have no other adequate alternative remedy).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-16\">.
