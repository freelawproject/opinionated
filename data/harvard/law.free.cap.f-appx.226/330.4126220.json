We lack jurisdiction to review this claim, and the petition for review as to this claim is dismissed. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-25\">Maknojia challenges the determination that he is not entitled to withholding of removal based on his Muslim religion or to protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We must defer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The determination that Maknojia is not entitled to withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or to protection under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence, and Maknojia has not shown that the record compels a contrary conclusion. The petition for review is denied as to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
