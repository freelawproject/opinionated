New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court construed the \u00a7 2241 petition as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Coor asserts that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention and contends that his claims should be considered under \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause in \u00a7 2255. Because Coor does not meet the standard set forth in <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir. 2000) for application of the savings clause, we affirm the denial of relief. We deny as unnecessary Coor\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
