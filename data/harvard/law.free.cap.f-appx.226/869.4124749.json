With regard to Samuel Moore, we agree with the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims. We also agree that Moore has failed to state a prima facie case of race discrimination based on failure to promote. We therefore do not reach the district court\u2019s alternative finding that Moore has failed to carry his burden of showing pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-21\">With regard to plaintiffs Barry Jefferson, Chelavonne Singleton, and Kimberly McTyer, we agree with the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>reasons for rejecting their failure to promote, hostile work environment, and disparate treatment claims. As to their retaliation claims, we note that the Supreme Court recently held that application of Title VII\u2019s retaliation provision is not limited to employer\u2019s actions that affect the terms, conditions or status of employment, or even to those that occur at the workplace. <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2411-14, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). That holding calls into question the accuracy of the district court\u2019s statement of the requirements to establish a prima facie case for retaliation, as well as the continued validity of statements in several of this circuit\u2019s opinions. <em>See, e.g. Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, Orange County, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1117 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir.2000). Nonetheless, there is insufficient evidence in the record to justify sending any of the retaliation claims to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">ITT articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for shifting Jefferson to an inside representative position. The company had only three slots for outside representatives but it had four outside representatives and Jefferson was the least senior of the four. If there were evidence in the record that ITT had known for months that it was overstaffed with outside representatives but had waited until the day after Jefferson\u2019s complaint of racial discrimination to redress the problem, an inference of pretext might be appropriate. But plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was unable to point to any such evidence in the record at oral argument, and our own review of the record has not revealed any either.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Singleton has presented a prima facie case of retaliation but identifies no evidence in the record that ITT\u2019s stated reason for her termination \u2014 her violation of work rules by sending an e-mail complaining of workplace conditions from a coworker\u2019s computer \u2014 was pretextual. She argues that \u201cit is the subject of the email which creates a question of fact as to whether or not retaliation motivated this action.\u201d That argument merely restates her prima facie case and is not by itself enough to create a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Likewise, McTyer presents no evidence that ITT\u2019s proffered reason for her termination \u2014 violating the company\u2019s attendance policy \u2014 was pretextual. Although she contends that she had permission to miss the event in question, she concedes that her immediate supervisor, who was not the decision maker about her termination, told the ITT officials who were the decision makers that she did not have his permission. \u201cAn employer who fires an employee under the mistaken but honest impression that the employee violated a work rule is not liable for discriminatory conduct.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1363 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">At oral argument, McTyer\u2019s counsel directed us to a statement by Jerome Ruffin in which Ruffin expressed his feeling that an ITT supervisor had used him to retaliate against Stephen Hobbs and Barry Jefferson. However, Ruffin did not mention McTyer in this statement and Ruffin did not contend there was any specific evidentiary basis for his belief. Instead, he clarified: \u201cThat\u2019s just how I felt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
