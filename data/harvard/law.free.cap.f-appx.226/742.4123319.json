Siler, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b766-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-22\">Christian Lewis Castillo appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. He argues that his constitutional rights were violated because the prosecutor violated the Equal Protection Clause and <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), by striking five jurors on the basis of race. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-23\">Initially, we agree with the district court that Castillo has not proeedurally defaulted his <em>Batson </em>claim even though he did not raise the issue on direct appeal. <em>See King v. Lamarque, </em>464 F.3d 963 (9th Cir.2006). We also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that it was not unreasonable for the trial court to credit the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-24\">As the Supreme Court recently recognized, we \u201ccan only grant [the habeas] petition if it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations for the <em>Batson </em>challenge.\u201d <em>Rice v. Collins, </em>546 U.S. 333, 126 S.Ct. 969, 974, 163 L.Ed.2d 824 (2006). In concluding the <em>Batson </em>analysis, the trial court stated that \u201cthe prosecutor exercised his peremptories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>on grounds that were reasonably relevant to the case here without respect to racial background....\u201d This determination was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Castillo\u2019s comparative challenge analysis is unsupported by the record because the jurors whom he offers as comparators materially differed from the excluded jurors. Moreover, the empaneled jury included two Hispanics. <em>See Turner v. Marshall, </em>121 F.3d 1248, 1254 (9th Cir.1997) (finding that other minorities on the empaneled jury were indicative of nondiscriminatory motive).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">At most, Castillo\u2019s argument supports a conclusion that the trial court could have discredited the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons if it so chose. However, the trial court in this case questioned the prosecutor\u2019s reasons and concluded that the exclusions were not based on race, a determination that we find was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b766-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
