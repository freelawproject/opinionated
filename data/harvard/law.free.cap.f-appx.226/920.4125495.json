For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b944-24\">Petitioners, natives and citizens of Colombia, entered the United States in 2000 on immigrant visas, and they all remained beyond their visas\u2019 expiration periods. The INS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued Notices to Appear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>charging Petitioners with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Rojas applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), alleging that she and her family had been persecuted by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) because of her political opinion. Following hearings conducted on April 4, 2003, and March 31, 2004, the Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denied relief, concluding that the asylum application was untimely and that Rojas had failed to demonstrate that she was eligible for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT because she had not established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Rojas timely appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on November 25, 2005. Rojas filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which the BIA denied on the grounds that Rojas had failed to specify any error of law or fact in the prior decision. On April 26, 2006, Rojas filed a motion to reopen the proceedings, seeking to present evidence that conditions in Colombia had deteriorated and that the FARC still considered her a target. Rojas supported her motion with affidavits from her brother-in-law, father, and the person responsible for maintaining her Colombia apartment. The affidavits stated that Rojas was forced to flee Colombia due to political persecution and that her family in Colombia had continued to receive threats against her. Rojas also attached news articles detailing the FARC\u2019s ongoing guerilla activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen, concluding that the motion was untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s final determination and that Rojas was not entitled to invoke the exception to the 90-day filing requirement because she failed to establish that the information in the supporting affidavits could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. Rojas now petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Rojas argues that the BIA abused its discretion by denying the motion to reopen. She asserts that the supporting news articles and affidavits, which were dated August 2005, January 2006, and March 2006, were not available during the 2003 and 2004 hearings before the IJ. She also argues that these supporting documents established that she had suffered past persecution, demonstrated that she risked future persecution if she returned to Colombia, and would change the outcome of her underlying claims for relief if considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">An alien may file one motion to reopen which \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149 (citation omitted). \u201cA motion to reopen immigration proceedings \u2018must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2)). The time and numerical limitations do not apply, however, to a motion to reopen based on changed conditions in the country of nationality <em>if </em>such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In addition, at any time, the BIA can reopen or reconsider, on its own motion, a case in which it has rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Motions to reopen are disfavored, however, especially in a removal proceeding \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149. As such, a motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Here, although the affidavits Rojas submitted in support of her motion were dated approximately two years after her March 2004 hearing before the IJ, the affidavits merely rehash the general assertion that Rojas fled Colombia due to \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d and contain no new information tending to dispute the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Rojas faded to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground such as, <em>inter alia, </em>religion, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Likewise, although the news articles Rojas submitted in support of her motion detail the FARC\u2019s ongoing acts of violence, the articles provide nothing to connect that violence to Rojas\u2019s politics or her membership in a protected group. Thus, we cannot say that the evidence Rojas submitted in support of her motion to reopen was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at her earlier hearing before the IJ. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Accordingly, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Rojas\u2019s petition and AFFIRM the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-15\">.
