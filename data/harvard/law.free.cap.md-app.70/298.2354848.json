Keane and Catherine Patricia Keane, have standing to recover damages under \u00a7 3-904(e)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for their mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, and loss of solatium, resulting from the death of their son, Gregory Keane, who was killed in an automobile accident caused by the negligence of the appellees. Gregory Keane was born on March 11, 1962 and died on November 7, 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury awarded damages to the Keanes under counts 3 and 5 of the complaint for the mental anguish suffered by each of them because of the loss of their son.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The appellees moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, a partial new trial with respect to that award. They contend that the Keanes lacked standing to recover damages under \u00a7 3-904(e)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article because Gregory was too old at the time of his death to permit them to recover under the statute. The trial court agreed with appellees and granted their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, denied their motion for a new trial, and the Keanes appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Section 3-904(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Damages if unmarried child, who is not a minor, dies.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAA\">\u2014For the death of an unmarried child, who is not a minor child, the damages awarded under subsection (c) are not limited or restricted by the \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d or \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d rule but may include damages for mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, care, attention, advice, counsel, training, or guidance where applicable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">(1) The child is 21 years old or younger; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">(2) A parent contributed 50 percent or more of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">child\u2019s support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">In granting appellees\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict the trial court concluded that subsection (1) precluded recovery by the appellants because Gregory Keane was killed after he had passed his twenty first birthday. We do not agree with that interpretation of the statute for reasons which we shall now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">We begin by reviewing the relevant principles governing statutory construction stated so succinctly by the Court of Appeals in <em>Schweitzer v. Brewer, </em>280 Md. 430, 438-39, 374 A.2d 347 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">We have often said that the cardinal rule of construction of a statute is to effectuate the actual intention of the legislature. The criteria for the determination of this intention have been firmly established, and they were recently summarized in <em>Mazor v. State Department of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360-361, 369 A.2d 82 (1977). The primary source from which we glean the legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. When the intent is expressed in clear and unambiguous language, this Court will carry it out, if no constitutional guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>are impaired. Words are granted their ordinary signification so as to construe the statute according to the natural import of the language used without resorting to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of extending or limiting its operation. If reasonably possible the parts of a statute are to be reconciled and harmonized, the intention as to any one part being found by reading all the parts together, and none of its words, clauses, phrases, or sentences shall be rendered surplusage or meaningless. Results that are unreasonable, illogical or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided whenever possible consistent with the statutory language, (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Appellees correctly argue that the statutes involved in the case <em>sub judice </em>are in derogation of the common law and are to be strictly construed, <em>Cohen v. Rubin, 55 </em>Md. App. 83, 460 A.2d 1046 (1983), but \u201cthat does not mean the plain and obvious language of the legislature is to be overlooked particularly where such a construction would lead to an absurd result,\u201d <em>State v. Rice, </em>24 Md.App. 631, 634-35, 332 A.2d 296, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 755 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">With these basic principles in mind, we look to the language of \u00a7 3-904(e)(l) to ascertain, if we can, the legislature\u2019s intent. Inasmuch as subsection (e)(1) provides for the recovery of damages for the death of an \u201c... unmarried child, <em>who is not a minor </em>...\u201d (emphasis added), and who is \u201c... 21 years old or younger ... \u201d, it is obvious that the legislature intended to permit recovery for the death of certain unmarried adult children. Our inquiry then is what did the legislature mean by the term \u201c21 years old\u201d? We believe the use of the word \u201cor\u201d after the phrase \u201c21 years old\u201d is significant to our inquiry because \u201cor\u201d is \u201c[a] disjunctive conjunction [which] serves to establish a relationship of contrast or opposition,\u201d <em>In Re John R., </em>41 Md.App. 22, 25, 394 A.2d 818 (1978), and does not, therefore, control or affect the meaning of the words \u201c21 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>old.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus we believe the term \u201c21 years old\u201d is unambiguous, and we attribute to it \u201cits ordinary and generally understood meaning.\u201d <em>In Re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976 (1986); <em>accord, Mauzy v. Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 400 A.2d 1091 (1979). We recognize, as a matter of common usage and understanding, that Gregory Keane, having passed his twenty first birthday but not having reached his twenty second birthday at the time of his death, was twenty one years old at the time of his death. <em>Covell v. State, </em>143 Tenn. (16 Thompson) 571, 227 S.W. 41 (1921) (\u201c... in common acceptation one\u2019s age is spoken of as 21 until the arrival of the twenty-second birthday\u2014the year, and not the day, being the unit of measurement.); <em>People v. Cooper, </em>207 Misc. 845, 143 N.Y.S.2d 855, 857 (1955) (\u201cA child becomes ten years old upon reaching his tenth birthday and remains a child of the age of ten until he reaches his eleventh birthday.\u201d) <em>Smith v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>608 F.Supp. 1270, 1271 (D.C.Mass.1985) (Decedent having been born on July 31, 1958 and having died on September 22, 1979 was twenty one years of age at the time of his death.) <em>See also Wilson v. Mid-Continental </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><em>Life Ins. Co. of Oklahoma City, </em>159 Okl. 191, 14 P.2d 945 (1982); <em>Watson v. Loyal Union Life Ass\u2019n of Muskogee, </em>143 Okl. 4, 286 P. 888 (1930). Indeed, we note that both the medical examiner\u2019s certificate of death and the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems\u2019 Discharge Summary list Gregory Keane\u2019s age as 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Since the clear purpose of the statute is to compensate the parents of certain unmarried non-minor children, and the children themselves are given no legal rights, we are unpersuaded by the appellees\u2019 argument that because the legislature has used the attainment of age twenty one to grant rights under other statutes (for example, the alcoholic beverage laws), we are therefore bound to limit recovery under \u00a7 3-904(e) to parents of children under twenty one; particularly when in drafting those other statutes, the legislature employed different terminology. <em>See, </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 400, 400A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, inasmuch as the age of majority is eighteen, there is no reason to limit the age for which recovery may be had, as urged by the appellees, for decedents under what was formerly the age of majority in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We hold that the Keanes are entitled to recover damages under \u00a7 3-904(e)(l) for their emotional pain and suffering. We shall, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict on counts 3 and 5 of the complaint, and order that judgment be entered on the original verdict. Rule 2-532.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In order to protect themselves in the event we reversed the trial court\u2019s granting of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, appellees filed a cross-appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>alleging error in the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for a partial new trial as to counts 3 and 5 of the complaint. <em>See </em>Rule 2-532(f)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to grant a new trial or partial new trial, and the exercise of that discretion will not ordinarily be disturbed on appeal. <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 600, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Appellees contend that Mr. Keane testified falsely concerning his marital status and address. After trial, appellees discovered that the Keanes were experiencing marital difficulties and that around the time of trial Mr. Keane had spent his nights at a place other than the family home, but when asked by the clerk to state his address he responded by giving the address of the family home. Mr. Keane also stated his marital status as married.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Keane\u2019s use of the family home address was not a fraud upon the jury as there was ample evidence that he had not abandoned the family home. We also agree with the lower court\u2019s determination that the Keanes\u2019 marital discord was of doubtful relevance inasmuch as the damage awards were to each of them individually for their own emotional suffering, and no award was made for damage to the \u201cfamily unit.\u201d Indeed it is possible that evidence of marital discord might have been prejudicial to appellees, had the jury thought that Gregory Keane\u2019s death precipitated the Keanes\u2019 marital problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">As there is no evidence of any decree of separation or divorce, nor even any pending action, the Keanes were \u201cmarried\u201d and Mr. Keane\u2019s statement to that effect was not false.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Furthermore, we do not view this as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d simply because it was discovered after trial. Upon our review of the record, we see no reason why the appellees could not have, prior to trial, discovered the information about which they complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We shall therefore affirm the denial of appellees\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT REVERSED AND JUDGMENT ENTERED IN FAVOR OF MICHAEL E. KEANE FOR $105,000 AND C. PATRICIA KEANE FOR $115,000. DENIAL OF MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. Part of the Wrongful Death Act found in Subtitle 9, \u00a7\u00a7 3-901 <em>et. seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">. In his memorandum and order the trial judge stated that \"Gregory was 21 years 8 months old\" at the time of his demise. To be more precise, he was 21 years, 7 months, 28 days old by the common law method of assessing age.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\">. An award was also made in favor of Gregory Keane\u2019s estate to compensate it for the emergency medical and funeral expenses. No issues have been raised with respect to that award on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\">. All future citations to specific sections of statutes will be to the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-4\">. The trial court construed the entire phrase \"21 years old or younger\" \"to exclude anyone who has passed their twenty first birthday,\" relying upon the reasoning in <em>Gibson v. People, </em>44 Colo. 600, 99 P. 333 (1908) and a line of criminal cases which followed <em>Gibson. </em>In light of the availability of relevant civil cases directly on point, we think the trial court erred in relying so heavily on <em>Gibson </em>and its progeny because criminal statutes are always strictly construed in favor of the defendant. <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 617, 224 A.2d 677 (1966); <em>Knott v. Rawlings, </em>250 Iowa 892, 96 N.W.2d 900 (1959). In addition, we find the rationale in <em>Gibson </em>to be neither sound nor persuasive. In construing the phrase \"sixteen years of age or under\u201d, the <em>Gibson </em>court failed to focus on the exact language before it and instead hypothesized as to what the legislature \"would have done\u201d had it meant to define an age group different from the one which the court delineated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-5\">. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>was a case brought under the same Maryland statute as the case <em>sub judice. </em>Although a different question was addressed in <em>Smith, </em>the district court properly permitted recovery by the parents of the decedent who died during the time period between his twenty first and twenty second birthdays.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. We observe that the legislature well knows how to make itself clear. For example, in Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 3-801(c) and (d) an \"adult\u201d is defined as \"... a person who is 18 years old and older ...\u201d and a \"child\" is defined as \"... a person under the age of 18 years.\u201d <em>See, also, Maryland Style Manual for Statutory Law, </em>Revisor of Statutes, General Assembly of Maryland, Department of Legislative Reference, 1985 Edition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
