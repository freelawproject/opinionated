Furst in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. During the jury trial, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>refused to admit into evidence the deposition testimony of one of appellants\u2019 expert medical witnesses, Dr. Adolph L. Sahs. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Furst.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The sole issue that appellants raise is whether the trial court erred when it excluded the deposition testimony of appellants\u2019 expert, Dr. Sahs.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In early November, following a heated argument with her mother-in-law, Iris Shives experienced some blurring of vision along with intense pains across the base of her skull and along her neck and shoulders. Because of these unusual symptoms, on November 16th she consulted her physician, Dr. Furst, who diagnosed her condition as fibromyositis, the chronic inflamation of muscle and connective tissue. Dr. Furst prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, moist heat, and linaments. When Mrs. Shives returned two days later with similar complaints, the doctor administered an injection of demerol for the pain and then cautioned Mrs. Shives that if these problems persisted, more elaborate hospital tests would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">On November 19, 1981, Mrs. Shives entered Southern Medical Hospital, where various tests were performed, including x-rays and two CT-scans. Expert testimony revealed that the CT-scans suggested the possibility of an aneurysm in Mrs. Shives\u2019 brain. An aneurysm is a blood-filled dilation of an artery, resulting from disease of the vessel wall. The failure to diagnose and treat an aneurysm in the brain could prove to be fatal if the involved cerebral blood vessel ruptures. To confirm the existence of such a condition, Dr. Furst ordered a cerebral arteriogram on November 25, 1981. Unfortunately, Mrs. Shives suffered a stroke on November 24th, when the suspected vessel in her brain ruptured. Death swiftly ensued the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Prior to trial, each party, through written interrogatories, identified the expert witnesses on whom they intended to rely during the trial and provided the particulars about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>which they expected their experts to testify. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-402(e)(l)(B), counsel for appellee then sought to take the testimony of Dr. Adolf Sahs, one of appellants\u2019 expert witnesses. At the time of the deposition and before the examination of Dr. Sahs, counsel for both parties addressed the purpose of the deposition. Although appellee\u2019s notice of deposition indicated that the purpose of the deposition was for \u201cdiscovery and/or evidence at the trial,\u201d appellee\u2019s counsel unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a stipulation that the deposition was only for discovery purposes and would not be introduced as evidence during trial. Appellants\u2019 counsel stated that while they presently did not anticipate that appellants would rely on the deposition at trial, counsel insisted that appellant would reserve the right to introduce the deposition into evidence in the event of Dr. Sahs\u2019 unavailability. Appellants\u2019 counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">At this point in time it is not\u2014there is no intention to use this as evidence at trial. That decision could be made later____ I would think that quite likely in the event that it were determined that Dr. Sahs\u2019 videotape deposition would be necessary at trial, it is quite possible that another deposition would be conducted of him. At this point in time we just really haven\u2019t decided what evidence will be used at trial. It\u2019s a little premature to do that. But I don\u2019t think the rules of procedure require that your suggestion be taken as such. The deposition notice indicated that the deposition was being taken for any purpose, including my use of the deposition at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">It is clear from the record before us that the parties never reached an agreement on this issue. After declaring forcefully his intention to object to appellants\u2019 introduction of the deposition at trial, appellee\u2019s counsel simply proceeded with the deposition and questioned the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Due to circumstances beyond the control of appellant, Dr. Sahs, who resides in Iowa City, Iowa, became unavailable to testify at the time of trial. In lieu of his live testimony, appellants attempted to substitute the deposition of Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Sahs. When appellee objected to its introduction, the trial court sustained the objection, ruling the deposition was not admissible on alternate grounds. First, the deposition was not preserved for admission at trial; second, a ten day delay in notifying appellee\u2019s counsel of Dr. Sahs\u2019 unavailability violated the \u201creasonable requirements\u201d of the Maryland Rules; and finally, the deposition was not in compliance with the rules of evidence. In assessing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the deposition, we will address seriatim the merits of each of the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Preservation of Deposition for Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Maryland Rule 2-419 subsection (a)(3) enumerates the circumstances under which a party may introduce a deposition in lieu of live testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose against any other party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">(A) that the witness is dead; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">(B) that the witness is out of the State, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">(C) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, mental incapacity, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">(D) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">(E) upon motion and reasonable notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Md. Rule 2-419(a)(3). A party must satisfy two prerequisites before the rule becomes applicable. First, the deponent must be \u201cunavailable\u201d by reason of such causes as death, sickness, mental incapacity, imprisonment, or absence from the State. Second, the party against whom the deposition is being used must have been present at the deposition or at least have had notice of it. See P. NIEM-EYER &amp; L. RICHARDS, MARYLAND RULES COMMENTARY 223 (1984); 3 H. SACHS, JR., POE\u2019S PLEADING AND PRACTICE \u00a7 133 (1975). <em>Cf. Perlin Packing Company v. Price, </em>247 Md. 475, 489-90, 231 A.2d 702 (1966); <em>Quecedo v. DeVries, </em>22 Md.App. 58, 61-63, 321 A.2d 785 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Although the trial court never ruled on the admissibility of the deposition based on whether there was compliance with the requirements of rule 2-419, it did indicate that the deposition was in technical compliance. Instead of resolving this procedural matter solely on the basis of the requirements under the rule, the court excluded the deposition on the basis of \u201cfair play\u201d and on alternate evidentiary grounds. We hold this constituted an error in procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Speaking metaphorically, a deposition is like a box that contains certain evidence. The court must make two determinations. The first is a procedural one: whether to admit the box itself into the trial. In making this assessment, the court applies Maryland Rule 2-419. Once the court has decided that the deposition meets these procedural requirements, the court then must address the ancillary evidentiary issues such as whether the contents of the box qualifies as admissible evidence. This step is akin to opening the box, assessing its content and then ruling on its admissibility. Logically speaking, this step must be subsequent to the initial step of determining whether there was technical compliance with the procedural requirements. If there was not technical compliance with the rule, there would be no need to reach the second step.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>From our review of the facts in this case, there was compliance with both requirements of the rule. First, Dr. Sahs was \u201cunavailable\u201d at the time of trial: the deponent resides in Iowa City, Iowa and unexpected obligations in his medical practice prevented him from testifying personally before the jury. Appellee neither contests the validity of these facts nor asserts the deponent\u2019s absence was procured through connivance on the part of appellants. Second, appellee obviously had notice of the deposition, since he was the party who requested it. Of course, appellee was present when Dr. Sahs deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Notwithstanding this technical compliance, the trial court ruled that appellant had not preserved the deposition for admission at trial. The court based this conclusion principally upon equitable considerations. Before starting to question Dr. Sahs at the time of the deposition, counsel for Dr. Furst invited appellants\u2019 counsel to conduct a direct examination of the deponent, after which appellee\u2019s counsel would then conduct cross-examination of him. When appellants\u2019 counsel declined to lead off the questioning, appellee\u2019s counsel initiated the examination of Dr. Sahs, but with the following proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">... this deposition is ... for discovery purposes, and there are questions that will be asked of this witness that are not\u2014that are meant for educational purposes on my part, not being totally familiar with the case; but, secondly, with examining the doctor\u2019s breadth of knowledge, which would not be questions asked in a direct or a cross-examination of this witness were he present and testifying at a hearing or a trial of this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Because of the deposition\u2019s exploratory nature, the court concluded that it would be unfair to allow appellant to use that deposition in trial, especially in light of appellants\u2019 refusal to commence the direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Although some equities weigh in favor of appellee, we hold such considerations are not relevant to the court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude Dr. Sahs\u2019 deposition. In their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>stead, the following factors require us to conclude the court\u2019s first ground for excluding the deposition testimony was erroneous. First, Maryland Rules explicitly provide that pretrial depositions are intended to function not only as a discovery mechanism, but also as a method of preserving relevant testimony. For example, Maryland Rule 2-411 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Any party to an action may cause the testimony of a person, whether or not a party, to be taken by deposition for the purpose of discovery or <em>for use as evidence in the action or for both purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">(emphasis added). <em>See also </em>P. NIEMEYER &amp; L. RICHARDS, MARYLAND RULES COMMENTARY 200 (1984). This broad characterization of the purposes for which parties may use depositions is echoed in Rule 2-419(a)(3), which states depositions \u201cmay be used for any purpose.\u201d From this clear language, we conclude that Maryland Rules of Procedure do not, as a general rule, require that a deposition simulate a courtroom interrogation before it becomes admissible as evidence. Rather the rules authorize that a party has a right to use that deposition not only for discovery, but also as evidence if he complies with all the technical prerequisites. If the opposing party had notice of the deposition or was present but chose to conduct an investigatory rather than adversarial interrogation, that alone is not reason for exclusion of the deposition testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Second, appellee explicitly acknowledged the broad purposes for which the deposition could be used. In the notice of deposition, counsel for Dr. Furst indicated that they would take the deposition of \u201cAdolph L. Sahs, M.D., ... for the purpose of discovery and/or evidence at the trial.\u201d Although appellee\u2019s counsel subsequently attempted to restrict the deposition\u2019s use at the time that Dr. Sahs deposed, appellant\u2019s counsel unequivocably refused to agree to any such evidentiary stipulation. Specifically, he reserved the right to rely on the deposition as evidence at trial, as authorized by the Maryland Rules, if Dr. Sahs became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>unavailable for some reason. Without appellants\u2019 agreement, that stipulation was ineffective. <em>See Patapsco Loan Company of Baltimore City v. Hobbs, </em>134 Md. 222, 228-29, 106 A. 619 (1919) (upholding stipulation where counsel for parties entered into a written agreement). <em>See also </em>AMER. JUR.2D, <em>Stipulations </em>\u00a7 2 (1974) (stating that \u201cunless it is clear from the record that the parties assented, there is no stipulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Finally, a number of courts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have refused to distinguish between depositions that may be used only for discovery purposes and those that are also admissible as evidence at trial. Courts have reached this conclusion even when opposing counsel has explicitly characterized the deposition as being solely for discovery purposes and have failed to cross-examine the deponent vigorously or even to question him at all. <em>Gill v. Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>714 F.2d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.1983) (permitting into evidence, over objection based on \u201cexploratory character of pretrial discovery\u201d, deposition of expert witness who died prior to trial); <em>Savoie v. Lafourche Boat Rentals, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 722, 724 (5th Cir.1980) (admitting deposition of unavailable expert witness even though parties had identified the deposition as being only for discovery purposes); <em>Wright Root Beer Company of New Orleans v. Dr. Pepper Company, </em>414 F.2d 887, 890-91 (5th Cir.1969) (holding that even where taken for discovery purposes, \u201cas a matter of right, a party may introduce the deposition of a deceased witness with no strings attached\u201d); <em>Derewecki v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em>36 F.R.D. 195, 198 (W.D.Penn.1964) (holding that deposition was admissible and defendant was not denied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>right to cross-examine deponent, even though deponent died before the completion of deposition), <em>aff'd, </em>353 F.2d 436 (3rd Cir.1965); <em>Rosenthal v. Peoples Cab Company, </em>26 F.R.D. 116, 117 (W.D.Penn.1960) (refusing to exclude a deposition taken only for discovery purposes in which opposing counsel \u201cwas present but engaged in no interrogation of witness\u201d). <em>See also In Re Air Crash Disaster at John F Kennedy International Airport on June 24, 1975, </em>635 F.2d 67, 87-88 (2nd Cir.1980) (arguing it was proper to offer deposition of unavailable witness since party had fulfilled all procedural prerequisites) (Mansfield, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We are cognizant that extenuating circumstances may arise that may militate against admitting a deposition into evidence. <em>See Rogers v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Company, </em>39 Fed.R.Serv.2d (Callaghan) 76, 77-78 (E.D.Mo.1984) (holding that unavailable researcher\u2019s deposition is inadmissible because the research upon which deponent\u2019s opinions are based are so preliminary that not only do they lack probative value but also would be misleading to the jury if admitted). Such circumstances, however, do not exist here. Accordingly, we hold that the Shives had the right to use the deposition as evidence in trial so long as the technical prerequisites had been fulfilled and that the opposing party may not unilaterally restrict its use through a purported evidentiary stipulation to which the other party has refused to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\n<em>Compliance With Reasonable Requirements of Maryland Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">As an alternative ground for excluding the deposition, the trial court stated that appellants\u2019 delay in notifying appellee of Dr. Sahs\u2019 unavailability violated the \u201creasonable requirements\u201d of M\u00e1ryland Rules. This conclusion was based on the fact that appellants knew ten days before trial of Dr. Sahs\u2019 unavailability, but neglected to inform opposing coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sel of this until the day before appellants were to introduce the deposition. We find no merit in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Maryland Rule 2-419 nowhere states that a party must give reasonable notice of its intent to submit a written deposition as evidence at trial. Rather, the rule enumerates only two instances in which a party should reasonably expect advance notice of an opposing party\u2019s intention to use a deposition at trial. First, if a party desires to introduce a videotape deposition of an expert witness, the deposing party must inform opposing counsel when it files its notice of deposition pursuant to Rule 2-412. Md.Rule 2-419(a)(4). <em>See also </em>Md.Rule 2~416(g) (requiring \u201cparty intending to offer a videotape ... deposition ... [t]o notify the court and all parties in writing of that intent and of the parts of the deposition to be offered within sufficient time to allow for objection to be made and acted upon before trial\u201d). Second, a party must give \u201creasonable notice,\u201d when making a motion that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d dictate the admission of a deposition even though the technical requirements of Rule 2-419 have not been fulfilled. Md.Rule 2-419(a)(3)(E). Outside of these two instances, parties are not entitled to advance notice of the intended use of a deposition at trial. Since the only notice that Rule 2-419(a)(3)(B) requires is notice to take the deposition pursuant to Rule 2-412, it was improper for the trial court to infer additional notice of the use of the deposition at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The case law that we presented above clearly supports our interpretation of Rule 2-419 that a party is entitled as a matter of right to use the deposition testimony during trial, if deponent becomes unavailable. Illustrative of this proposition is the case <em>Wright Root Beer Company of New Orleans v. Dr. Pepper Company, </em>414 F.2d 887 (5th Cir.1969), in which the court held not only that a party possesses an unconditional right to introduce into evidence a deposition of an unavailable witness, but that the trial judge has no right to caution the jury that the deposition may be less reliable since opposing party did not conduct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>full and complete cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 890. In that case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">Under Rule 26(d)(3), F.R.Civ.P., as a matter of right, a party may introduce the deposition of a deceased witness with no strings attached. The trial court has no discretion to conditionally admit such a deposition____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">Opposing counsel was admittedly present at the depositions and did cross-examine the deponents. Whether the cross was extended or limited was left to counsel\u2019s judgment, and to the strategy that is inherent in a trial lawyer\u2019s decision. The unexpected is to be expected at the trial of cases, including the necessity for using depositions when the deponent has met an untimely death before trial. Wright\u2019s counsel did not, indeed could not, contend that his cross was limited in any way except his own choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\"><em>Id. See also Derewecki, </em>36 F.R.D. at 198 (stating that \u201c[i]t will be presumed, also, that when the defendant invoked the discovery procedure it also contemplated and agreed to the use of those depositions at trial of the case in the event of [deponent\u2019s unavailability]\u201d). <em>See generally </em>8 C. WRIGHT &amp; R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 2143, at 458 (1970); 4A J. MOORE, W. TAGGART &amp; J. WICKER, MOORE\u2019S FEDERAL PRACTICE \u00a7 32.05, at 458 (2d ed. 1984); 2 E. DEVITT &amp; C. BLACKMAR, FEDERAL JURY PRACTICE AND INSTRUCTIONS \u00a7 73.02, at 617 (1977). Because of appellants\u2019 unconditional right to introduce Dr. Sahs\u2019 deposition at trial if the deponent became unavailable, we hold that the trial court possessed no authority to impose a reasonable notice requirement upon appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\n<em>Expert\u2019s Testimony Based Upon Facts in Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">As a final ground for excluding the deposition testimony, the trial court ruled that Dr. Sahs did not base his opinions in the deposition on facts that the parties had introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>into evidence at trial. In that deposition, Dr. Sahs explained the evidence on which he based his medical opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbJ\">In this particular instance I have referred to a history and hospital record, which came by way of Mr. Swartz. I have several letters from him, each of which is a page and a half long. I have Mr. Swartz\u2019 summary of this situation. It consumes three or four typewritten pages. I have had two short telephone calls with Mr. Swartz. And this morning we spent approximately one hour discussing this particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Later in his deposition, Dr. Sahs supplemented his answer by admitting that he based some of his medical opinions on <em>\u201ca </em>verbal report which is not contained in the record, and which was told to me by Mr. Swartz concerning his information as to the exact onset of this condition.\u201d Concluding that the contents of these discussions and reports had not been introduced into evidence, the court excluded Dr. Sahs\u2019 deposition on evidentiary grounds. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Maryland Rule 2-419(d) provides that the court applies the rules of evidence as though the deponent was present at the trial. <em>See </em>P. NIEMEYER &amp; L. RICHARDS, MARYLAND RULES COMMENTARY 223 (1984). As to the admission of the expert testimony, the witness must base his or her opinion on facts that the parties have adduced into the record. <em>Greenstein v. Meister, </em>279 Md. 275, 285, 368 A.2d 451 (1977); <em>State, Use of Nitza E. Kalives v. Baltimore Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital, Inc., </em>177 Md. 517, 525, 10 A.2d 612 (1940). An expert witness, however, need not testify from personal knowledge so long as the opinion is predicated upon facts established in the record. <em>Consolidated Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. Ball, </em>263 Md. 328, 336-37, 283 A.2d 154 (1971); <em>John McShain, Inc. v. L\u2019Enfant Plaza Properties, Inc., </em>402 A.2d 1222, 1226 (D.C.App.1979); <em>Ohio Valley Construction Company v. Dew, </em>354 A.2d 518, 523 (D.C.App.1976). Illustrative of this proposition is <em>Ball, </em>in which the Court of Appeals recognized that an expert witness may base his opinion \u201con facts or opinions found by others and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>whom they rely in their practice.\u201d <em>Ball, </em>263 Md. at 328, 283 A.2d 154 (citing with approval <em>Vinicky v. Midland Mutual Casualty Insurance Company, </em>35 Wis.2d 246, 151 N.W.2d 77 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Although Dr. Sahs mentions oral reports from and discussions with appellants\u2019 counsel as a basis for reaching his conclusions, with one exception, no dispute exists that the content of these oral representations have been introduced into evidence. Specifically, appellee contends that \u201cno evidence whatsoever had been offered tending to show the exact nature of the onset of Iris Shives\u2019 November 8, 1981 headache, beyond the fact that it occurred after an argument with her mother-in-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The medical records that the court admitted into evidence document the factual conclusion that Mrs. Shives experienced a headache of sudden onset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">[Iris Shives] was enjoying her usual state of excellent health until approximately 2 [two] weeks prior to admission when following an argument with her mother-in-law she noticed pain appearing at the base of the neck radiating across both posterior shoulders and up into the occipital area of the scalp. The pain was rather intense for approximately [one half] hour and was associated with some blurring of vision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Moreover, this precise fact was established by Dr. Furst\u2019s own testimony during direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">Did you ask Mrs. Shives about the nature of the onset\u2014in other words, was it <em>an abrupt onset, </em>did it start slowly in the morning and gradually build up or was it a <em>sudden </em>pain in the neck and pain in the head?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">A. Yes, she developed pain at the base of the right side of the neck that spread across her shoulders and up the back of the neck to the base of the skull.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">Q. Did you ask her specifically whether this was acquired gradually or whether it happened <em>suddenly?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>A. It came\u2014she had apparently had an argument with her mother-in-law over the phone and she slammed the receiver down and noted the symptoms then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">(emphasis added). Although this Court accords a trial court broad discretion in its factual findings, this evidence renders the trial court\u2019s determination on this matter clearly erroneous. Md.Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>Prejudicial Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Court of Appeals has recognized that even if a trial court erroneously admits or excludes evidence, a reviewing court should not disturb the court\u2019s ruling when that error was harmless. <em>E.g., Air Lift, Ltd. v. Board of County Commissioners of Worcester County, Maryland, </em>262 Md. 368, 400-01, 278 A.2d 244 (1971); <em>Wilhelm v. Hadley, </em>218 Md. 152, 158, 146 A.2d 22 (1958). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee relies on this argument to counteract appellants\u2019 contention that exclusion of the deposition was improper. Specifically, Dr. Furst contends that Dr. Sahs\u2019 testimony was cumulative, so that any error in excluding it did not prejudice appellants\u2019 case and was thus harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Review of this issue is contingent upon examination of the testimony of appellants\u2019 other expert witnesses who testified in court. Such testimony, however, was not included in the record extract. This exclusion precludes us from assessing the merits of appellee\u2019s contention. Maryland Rule 1028 provides that a failure to comply with this rule may result in dismissal of the case or issue in question. <em>Spivey v. Harris, </em>64 Md.App. 619, 498 A.2d 281 (1985); <em>Weston International Corporation v. Woodlawn Supermarkets, Inc., </em>44 Md.App. 390, 408 A.2d 781 (1979). Since appellee raises this issue as a response to appellants\u2019 contention that the court should have admitted the deposition, we conclude that appellee bore the responsibility of instructing appellants that the omitted testimony should have been included in the record extract. Because of appellee\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to do so, we decline to address appellee\u2019s arguments that the exclusion of the testimony was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"pAcf\">.
