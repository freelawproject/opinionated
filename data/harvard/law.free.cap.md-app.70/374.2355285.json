We glean from the four questions submitted by appellants that the critical issue on appeal may be succintly stated as whether there is substantial evidence in the record to sustain the District Council\u2019s finding that improvements proposed to be made to a critical intersection were, at the time of rezoning, reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future. We conclude that there is; therefore, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The appellees herein<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> proffer, \u201cas an alternative basis for affirmance of the lower court\u2019s judgment,\u201d the argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">The decision of the County Council was made on the basis of evidence not of record in violation of Section 59-H-6.1 of the Zoning Ordinance and the right to due process of law guaranteed to the appellees by the Fourteenth Article of Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">This argument was presented to and specifically rejected by the lower court. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 1085. Moreover, appellees did not file a cross-appeal from that judgment. A party to a trial court proceeding may obtain direct appellate review of an adverse ruling only if that party has filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>valid and timely order of appeal. <em>Fennell v.

Quinlan, </em>210 Md. 76, 122 A.2d 332 (1956); Maryland Rules 1010 and 1011. Accordingly, we will not consider the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The project at issue is \u201cNottingham Woods\u201d, a proposed residential development situated just northwest of the intersection of Randolph Road and New Hampshire Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland. Because the tract on which the development is planned is zoned R-90 (single family residential units minimum lot size of 9,000 square feet) and applicant desired to construct 150 residential units, it sought rezoning to the PD-7 (planned development, maximum seven dwelling units per acre) zone. The rezoning application, along with the required binding development plan, was filed on May 22, 1982. The development plan proposed the development of 115 townhouses, 15 piggyback townhouses, 20 single family detached homes, open space and play areas, and a commuter parking lot. The development plan was subsequently amended to address the issue of critical significance to the District Council\u2014the capacity of the intersection to accomodate traffic generated by the project. The amended plan required, as \u201can integral portion of the development plan\u201d, the extension, redesign and reconstruction of the Randolph Road/New Hampshire Avenue intersection, to be approved as part of the Montgomery County Capital Improvement Program (CIP) budget and to be undertaken as a developer\u2014participation project. It is then this provision of the amended development plan, which is the major bone of contention on appeal, <em>i.e., </em>whether the improvements proposed by applicant and which were later made a part of the county\u2019s CIP were reasonably certain of fruition in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The hearing examiner commented that applicant \u201chas experienced more ups and downs than Friar Tuck\u201d. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>undoubtedly had reference to the progress of the application for rezoning through the zoning process; at least part of the process, if not all of it, had to be traversed on three separate occasions before final approval by the District Council. Its first trip was taken in an \u201cup\u201d mode, gaining favorable recommendations from the Montgomery County Planning Board technical staff and, after public hearings, from the planning board and the hearing examiner. The District Council, however, remanded the application to the hearing examiner for the development of more information about the traffic capacity of the Randolph Road/New Hampshire Avenue intersection. After further public hearings, the hearing examiner recommended that the application be denied, finding the existing intersection inadequate to handle the traffic to be generated by the project. The application thus came before the District Council for review a second time, this time in a \u201cdown\u201d mode. It gained new life when the District Council once again remanded the application to the hearing examiner, this time \u201cto await the development of circumstances where area road capacity can adequately and efficiently accommodate the proposed development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Subsequent to the second remand, the applicant filed an amended development plan in which the applicant proposed major improvements \u201cin design and construction to the Randolph Road/New Hampshire intersection.\u201d The proposed improvements, which were incorporated as an integral part of the plan, included construction of additional lanes and relocation of median strips on both Randolph Road and New Hampshire Avenue. After reviewing the amended development plan, the technical staff once again recommended approval of the application. Following another public hearing, the planning board did likewise, noting, however, that additional improvements, if found justified later in the process, might be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">After the hearing examiner had conducted further public hearings, but before he made his findings and recommendations, the county\u2019s CIP for 1985-1990 was adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>County Council. The applicant\u2019s proposed improvements to the critical intersection, to be accomplished through developer participation, were included.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The hearing examiner extensively reviewed the history of the application and found the project to be compatible with the PD zone. He, therefore, recommended its approval of the rezoning. Concerning capacity of the critical intersection to accommodate the traffic to be generated by the project, the hearing examiner concluded that the proposed improvements, when completed would render the intersection adequate. He further found that the improvements were reasonably probable of accomplishment within' the foreseeable future:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">The Examiner believes that the applicant\u2019s evidence satisfies the reasonably imminent test for several reasons. The P-D Zones are usually strict zoning requirements that impose many design and performance specifications upon the applicant that are not present in more traditional zoning categories. The P-D Zones include a staging element and require a linkage between the staging element and the CIP. Moreover, before any development can take place under an approved P-D Zone, the Planning Board must approve a site plan and will review extensively the impact of the proposed development on the community. Under this special category, zoning approval is only the first stage in several stages of government regulation and oversight. Further improvements may be required by the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">The reason for the requirement that future improvements be reasonably imminent is a concern by zoning authorities and the courts that premature development could adversely impact existing or planned public facilities to the detriment of the public welfare. Hence, the \u201creasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>probable of fruition\u201d test provides a useful measure in evaluating the issue of prematurity at the zoning stage, especially in those cases where post zoning government controls are absent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">The present Development Plan not only corrolates development to the proposed improvements and the <em>approved </em>CIP, it absolutely requires it. The Development Plan incorporates the necessary improvements as an integral part of the plan. The Planning Board may not authorize development that fails to comply with this requirement. This fact renders the present Development Plan a much more stringent control over premature development than any test that attempts to measure whether the improvements are \u201creasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future.\u201d The plan makes the improvements definite, explicit, and an essential prerequisite to development. Under the \u201creasonably probable\u201d test, a bad guess about future events could still lead to premature development. However, this situation cannot occur under the current Development Plan because any uncertainty has been eliminated. The Examiner concludes that the applicant has not only satisfied the burden of showing that the improvements are reasonably imminent but has, in fact, exceeded it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The District Council agreed with the findings and conclusions of the hearing examiner and, thereupon, approved the application \u201csubject to the specifications and requirements of the amended development plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Appellees appealed to the Circuit Court. In its initial Memorandum Opinion and Order, that court affirmed the decision of the District Council, finding that \u201cthe traffic issue was fairly debatable\u201d. In response to appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration, however, the court filed an Amended Memorandum Opinion and Order, in which it reached the opposite result. The District Council\u2019s decision granting the rezoning was, therefore, reversed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The PD zone is a \u201cfloating zone\u201d. \u201cA floating zone is differentiated from a so-called \u2018Euclidean\u2019 zone, in that while the latter is a specific area defined by boundaries previously determined by the zoning authority, the former has no such defined boundaries and is said to \u2018float\u2019 over the entire area of the district or zone where it may eventually be established.\u201d <em>Bigenho v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 386, 391, 237 A.2d 53 (1968). It is then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akq\">a special use district of undetermined location, a district in which the proposed kind, location, size and form of structures must be preapproved, and which like a special exception use, is legislatively predeemed compatible with the areas in which it may thereafter be located on a particular application, provided specified standards are gratified and incompatibility is not revealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><em>The Chatham Corporation v. Beltram, </em>243 Md. 138, 150, 220 A.2d 589 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Therefore, \u201cthe vital and decisive determination by the District Council is whether the application complies with the expressed purposes for which the accomplishment of this floating zone was established.\u201d <em>Aubinoe v. Lewis, </em>250 Md. 645, 652, 244 A.2d 879 (1968). And \u201cspecial precautions are to be applied to ensure that there will be no discordance with existing uses\u201d. <em>Bigenho, supra. See The Chatham Corporation, supra. </em>Furthermore, there may be no substantial departure from the criteria applied to the establishment of a floating zone in a particular instance except by modification of the approved plan with the approval of the zoning authority, after notice and hearing. <em>See Wier v. Whitney Land Company, </em>257 Md. 600, 622, 263 A.2d 833 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In floating zone cases, as in all other zoning cases, \u201cit is not the function of the reviewing court to zone or rezone, or to substitute its judgment for that of the zoning authority if the action of the zoning authority is based on substantial evidence and the issue is thus fairly debatable.\u201d <em>Northampton v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>273 Md. 93, 101, 327 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>A.2d 774 (1974). <em>See Anne Arundel County v.

Co., </em>41 Md.App. 401, 421, 397 A.2d 250 (1979). There is substantial evidence in the record if there is \u201ca little more than a \u2018scintilla of evidence\u2019 \u201d, <em>Floyd, </em>55 Md.App. at 258, 461 A.2d 76, and the issue is fairly debatable if \u201ca reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the result the [District] Council reached upon a fair consideration of the fact picture painted by the entire record.\u201d <em>Wheaton Moose Lodge, supra. </em>If the issue is fairly debatable, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative body. <em>Eger v. Stone, </em>253 Md. 533, 542, 253 A.2d 372 (1969); <em>Board of County Commissioners of P.G. County v. Farr, </em>242 Md. 315, 218 A.2d 923 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The District Council made the express findings required by \u00a7 59-D-1.6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as a condition precedent to granting the requested rezoning. As to the finding critical to this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>peal, that made pursuant to subsection (c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it found that \u201cThe [applicant\u2019s] Amended Development Plan propose[d] vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems that are safe, adequate, and efficient\u201d and that the proposed improvement to the critical intersection, when viewed in combination with the zoning scheme and their inclusion in the county\u2019s CIP, are reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future. Although agreeing that the District Council made the necessary findings, the trial court disagreed that its decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record. Characterizing the issue as \u201cwhether a conditional mandate rule is substitutable for the reasonably imminent test as its functional equivalent or better; whether \u2018will do\u2019 is both equivalent to and substitutable for \u2018practically done\u2019 \u201d, and the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusions as \u201cproviding] a novel approach to the \u2018reasonably imminent\u2019 test\u201d, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">There was no evidence to support a finding that sufficient improvements were reasonably imminent to create an acceptable traffic condition that could accommodate the increased traffic to be generated. The Maryland State Roads Commission was not a party to these proceedings; there was no evidence as to <em>when, </em>if at all, the substantial road improvements the applicant would like to see accomplished will be both funded and then constructed by the state. \u201cImminent\u201d connotes a sense of time as well as probability____ (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Court then observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">However, it may be noted that a conditional mandate rule, were it to be adopted or permitted, is conceptually a far extension of the floating zone beyond its present boundaries. The floating zone concept may have taken zoning applicants out of Euclidean repair trucks and placed them in floating zones lighter than air hovering craft (not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>necessarily Goodyear since McDonald\u2019s has come on the scene), but it still does not authorize the dropping of a presized development net over just any parcel or parcels of land. Here the net may not be dropped until all the requirements (including traffic compatibility) of the PD-7 zone are either in place or \u201creasonably imminent\u201d of being in place. Permit the substitution of conditions (particularly those beyond the control of the applicant) for requirements and the net may be dropped virtually anywhere. Should this substantial change in the concept of zoning law (which rezones first and then looks to later develoment stages for protection of surrounding properties and the public generally) take place, the change should be accomplished in a manner other than by calling a duck an elephant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">As we have seen, the question squarely presented on this appeal is whether, as the trial court first recognized, the traffic issue is fairly debatable. <em>See, e.g., Montgomery County v. Laughlin, </em>255 Md. 724, 734-35, 259 A.2d 293 (1969); <em>Tauber v. Montgomery County, </em>244 Md. 332, 333-37, 223 A.2d 615 (1966); <em>Wheaton Lodge, </em>41 Md.App. at 422, 397 A.2d 250. The applicable standard of review, however, is whether the improvements proposed to be made in the traffic system are reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future. The trial court interpreted this standard as requiring the improvements to be \u201creasonably imminent\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a more restrictive test, and, in fact, to be \u201cpractically done\u201d if the rezoning sought was to be justified. In so doing, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Of primary concern in the decision to rezone property to a floating zone is that the development undertaken be consistent with the master plan and promote the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>of the zone. Thus, whether substantial evidence exists to support the decision, either to grant or to deny the rezoning, may not be determined in isolation; rather the decision is to be reviewed in light of the zoning scheme and the record as a whole. <em>Bigenho, </em>248 Md. at 396, 237 A.2d 53. Because absolutely essential to a finding that the rezoning will be compatible with the master plan and the purposes of the zone and because it is but one aspect of the overall decision, the question of the adequacy of the vehicular circulation system to accommodate the traffic which the development will generate must be analyzed in the same fashion. Such an analysis requires not only that the existing circulation system be considered but that any changes proposed to be made in it, and their timing, be considered as well. The precautions contained in the zoning ordinance and designed to ensure minimum interference with existing uses and that the development is, indeed, consistent and compatible, are also to be taken into account. <em>See Bigenho, </em>248 Md. at 396, 237 A.2d 53 (In finding substantial evidence to support rezoning, the Court noted: \u201cThere are adequate precautions provided in Montgomery County Code (1965), Sec. 111-16, ... to insure a minimum interference with existing uses,\u201d and that that section, which provided for site plan approval, could be utilized to deny an application for a building permit if the specifications called for a building detrimental to the surrounding area.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">A PD zone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">is in the nature of a special exception, and shall be approved or disapproved upon findings that the application is or is not proper for the comprehensive and systematic development of the county, is or is not capable of accomplishing the purposes of this zone and is or is not in substantial compliance with the duly approved and adopted general plan and master plans. In order to enable the council to evaluate the accomplishment of the purposes set forth herein, a special set of plans is required for each planned development, and the district council and the planning board are empowered to approve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>such plans if they find them to be capable of accomplishing the above purposes and in compliance with the requirements of this zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Montgomery County Code (1984), \u00a7 59-C-7.il.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Under the PD zoning scheme, an applicant for zoning must submit a development plan to the planning board. <em>See </em>generally \u00a7 59-D-l.l. The plan must be reviewed for \u201ccompatibility with the purposes and requirements of the zone,\u201d by the planning board, a hearing examiner, and the District Council. \u00a7 59-D-1.4.-1.6. The development plan, a part of the application for rezoning, \u00a7 59-D-1.2., is required to \u201cclearly indicate how the proposed development would meet the standards and purposes of the zone applied for\u201d and to contain detailed information necessary to facilitate review, including: (1) the physical characteristics of the site; (2) a map detailing the relationship of the site to the adjacent area and its uses; (3) the names and addresses of the adjacent property owners; (4) a land use plan; and (5) the relationship of the proposed development to the county\u2019s capital improvement program. \u00a7 59-D-1.3. Although the development plan may be amended either before or after it has been reviewed by the District Council, any proposed amendment must conform to the requirements of the initial development plan and the review process must afford interested persons an opportunity, through public hearing, to comment on the proposed amendment. \u00a7 59-D-1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Even when rezoning has been granted and a development plan approved, no building or use and occupancy permits may be issued, \u00a7 59-D-3.0., until a proper site plan has been submitted to and approved by the planning board. \u00a7 59-D-1.8.

County Board, </em>234 Md. 259, 199 A.2d 216 (1964); <em>Trustees v. Baltimore County, </em>221 Md. 550, 158 A.2d 637 (1960); <em>Missouri Realty, Inc. v. Ramer, </em>216 Md. 442, 140 A.2d 655 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The \u201creasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u201d test is functionally a mechanism for gauging the likelihood of premature development and, thereby, to avoid it. As such, it necessarily involves assessing the probability that actions required to be done in the future will, in fact, occur. The following cases are illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>Rohde, </em>a critical issue was the adequacy of the traffic system to accommodate the development rezoning would generate. The zoning authority, in granting rezoning, considered the proposed extension of Goucher Boulevard, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>contemplated improvement in the system. The Court affirmed. It relied on the testimony that upon the county\u2019s request, the State Roads Commission would build the proposed extension. Even though the county had not made the request, and \u201cthere was some question as to just how soon the Commission could or would act,\u201d the Court concluded that the testimony \u201cwas sufficient to show that this extension was \u2018reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, was properly considered. <em>Id., </em>234 Md. at 264, 199 A.2d 216. To like effect is <em>Trustees v. Baltimore County. </em>At issue there was classification of property pursuant to a new comprehensive zoning map and the adequacy of the traffic system to accommodate development pursuant to that classification. When the map was adopted, part of the Baltimore Beltway had been constructed and there were plans to construct a Northwest Expressway and to widen McDonough Road. Although the plans for the Northwest Expressway were \u201c... as of the time of trial ... tentative and somewhat uncertain\u201d, <em>id., </em>221 Md. at 569-70, 158 A.2d 637, there was testimony in the record that \u201cthe existing and proposed roadways were sufficient to accommodate any traffic increase engendered by the new classification\u201d. <em>Id., </em>at 570, 158 A.2d 637. Upholding the County Council\u2019s decision on the traffic issue, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">\u201cOf course, the county council was not confined in its deliberations upon the recommended new comprehensive plan exclusively to roadways then in existence. If this were so, it would destroy many of the advantages of zoning. A comprehensive plan ... is specifically designed \u201cto control and direct the use of land and buildings according to present and <em>planned future </em>conditions.\u201d We think the council was entitled to consider any proposed new highways, or proposed improvements to existing highways that were reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future in determining the proper classification for the subject property, (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 570-71, 158 A.2d 637. The Court relied upon <em>Missouri Realty, Inc., </em>in which the construction of a public street was determined to be imminent where funds for the construction had been budgeted, bids were to be shortly advertised, and it was estimated that construction would be completed within two years of the filing of the application for rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The zoning ordinance under consideration here, with its requirement of development in compliance with an approved development plan and its post zoning controls, which permits the development to be phased in conformance with the accomplishment of required improvements or services, is also a mechanism for controlling premature development. It is, however, more flexible, as well as more effective than the \u201creasonably probable of fruition\u201d test. When that test is applied in the context of this ordinance not only is the timing of required improvements controlled, but because no development may be undertaken unless and until the required improvements have been made, the order of their completion vis-vis commencement of the approved development is controlled as well. Thus, under this zoning scheme, improvements that are reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future become reasonably certain of fruition. <em>See Wier, </em>257 Md. at 622, 263 A.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Viewed in context with the zoning scheme and the record as a whole, it is patent that there is substantial evidence that the improvements to the critical intersection were reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future. In the instant case, there was evidence that the critical intersection was insufficient to handle the traffic expected to be generated by the development. In fact, it was this inadequacy that caused the lengthy process which finally culminated in the rezoning issue here. But there was also evidence that the applicant proposed to improve the intersection, that the design of those improvements was approved, and, further, that the proposed improvements, when made, would render the traffic system adequate to accommodate traffic to be generated by the project. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>over, the proposed improvements were included in the county\u2019s CIP, which contemplates that improvements be made as development occurs. Furthermore, the zoning ordinance requires that no building permits may be issued until a site plan, consistent with the development plan approved by the District Council and containing a development schedule, has been submitted to and approved by the planning board, thus permitting a phasing of development consistent with the accomplishment of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Considered in light of the review and approval processes preliminary and necessary to the issuance of required permits, the District Council, by approving the amended development plan mandated, as a precondition to development that the improvements be made. As regards the critical inquiry, therefore, in this case, as in all zoning cases\u2014the timing of the required improvements in relation to development\u2014the evidence supports the conclusion that not only are the improvements reasonably certain of fruition in the foreseeable future, but, given the zoning scheme, they are certain of fruition in whole or in part, prior to commencement of development, and certainly before its completion. In this sense, the hearing examiner is correct: the applicant exceeded its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><em>Gerczak v. Todd, </em>233 Md. 25, 194 A.2d 799 (1963), relied upon by the trial court, is not to the contrary. In that case, in which the adequacy of access to the property for which a special exception was sought was at issue, the petitioner had neither title, claim of title, nor \u201cany reasonable expectation, of obtaining title or easement\u201d in the road providing access to the property and the owner indicated, contrary to the condition placed on the grant of the special exception, that it did not intend to widen the road. It was in this context that the court, reversing the grant of the special exception, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cBut the duty of the board, to make certain that adequate access is provided, is not satisfied by a vague showing of permissive use or indefinite future expectations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>233 Md. at 27, 194 A.2d 799. Neither is <em>Wheaton Moose Lodge </em>inconsistent with the conclusion we reach. There, although a traffic issue was generated, there being ample evidence suggesting that a left turn storage lane would be necessary to avoid traffic problems, \u201c[a]ppellant made no effort to show that such a left storage lane would, in fact, be constructed, and the council was obviously not obliged to assume that it would be.\u201d 41 Md.App. at 422, 397 A.2d 250. Thus, unlike the instant case, the petitioner in <em>Wheaton Moose Lodge </em>made no attempt to show that the necessary improvement was \u201creasonably imminent,\u201d i.e. reasonably probable of fruition in the foreseeable future. <em>Wheaton Moose Lodge </em>then is, in fact, supportive of the view we take of this case. To like effect, <em>see Montgomery County v. Laughlin, </em>255 Md. at 734-35, 259 A.2d 293; <em>Tauber v. Montgomery County, </em>244 Md. at 335-37, 223 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Finally, there is a significant difference between granting an exception on condition that a road be widened when there is no way to ensure that the condition will be met prior to development (the situation in <em>Todd) </em>and rezoning a particular tract to a floating zone in which development must proceed in accordance with a development plan schedule. <em>See Wier, </em>257 Md. at 622, 263 A.2d 833. In the latter situation, there are controls; substantial departure from the development plan may not be made except by modification approved by the planning board. The District Council did not, therefore, rezone by calling \u201ca duck an elephant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\">.
