Casper, Sr. (Casper), was the unfortunate recipient of a chemical breath test the night of September 13-14, 1984. His predicament began when Corporal Andrew Mays, of the Maryland State Police, responded to a call that a blue station-wagon was being driven erratically on southbound Route 91 near Finksburg. Mays located the vehicle, followed it for a short time, and signaled the driver to pull off of the road. That driver was Casper. Standard field tests supported Mays\u2019 suspicion that Casper was not completely sober.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Mays arrested Casper and transported him to the Westminster barrack. At the barrack, Sergeant James Huber, a certified breathalyzer operator, conducted a chemical breath test examination upon Casper. Results from that test indicated Casper\u2019s blood contained .21% alcohol by weight. Casper was then processed, released and driven home by his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">On June 24, 1986, Casper was tried by a jury (Judge H. Chester Goudy presiding) in the Circuit Court for Carroll County upon charges of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated and failing to drive in a single lane. At that trial, the State established Sergeant Huber\u2019s qualifications to administer chemical breath examinations. Through Huber, the State then introduced a written statement, signed by Yale H. Caplan, a toxicologist with the Maryland Department of Post Mortem Examiners, certifying that the breathalyzer used to test Casper was \u201capproved for chemical analysis to determine blood alcohol concentrations.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>statement certified further that the (1) Breath Alcohol Simulator; (2) Certified Breathalyzer Solution; and (3) Ampule Gauge, as manufactured and supplied by the breathalyzer\u2019s maker, were approved for use in conjunction with the machine. Caplan\u2019s statement, dated May 17, 1984, expired by its terms December 14 of that year, three months after Casper\u2019s test.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Sergeant Huber was then permitted to describe the procedures used in administering Casper\u2019s breathalyzer test, which description we now paraphrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">(1) The breathalyzer was turned on and brought to proper operating temperature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">(2) Huber placed a \u201ctest ampule\u201d and a \u201cstandard ampule\u201d containing sulphuric acid, potassium dichromate, silver nitrate and distilled water into holders in the breathalyzer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">(3) Huber purged the breathalyzer with an infusion of alcohol-free air and set gauges used to measure the alcohol content of air in the apparatus to \u201c0\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(4) Casper then blew into the breathalyzer until he had emptied his lungs in a single breath;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">(5) A short time later, the breathalyzer indicated and recorded Casper's blood alcohol content;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>(6) Huber then conducted a \u201csimulator check\u201d in which he again purged the breathalyzer and tested a \u201csimulator fluid\u201d containing .10% alcohol by weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Over objections of counsel, the trial court then admitted Casper\u2019s test results into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The jury convicted Casper of driving while intoxicated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Goudy sentenced appellant to 30 days incarceration (suspended), placed him on 3 years probation and assessed court costs against him. Casper noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The specific issues presented by the appellant are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">1. Whether the failure of the State to produce expert testimony as to the reliability of simulator fluid used to cheek the working condition of the breathalyzer violated appellant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">2. Whether procedures used to assure the reliability of chemical compounds used in appellant\u2019s breathalyzer examination were of such \u201cquestionable accuracy\u201d as to preclude the admissibility of that examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">We shall address these issues in the reverse of the order in which they were presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">\n<em>Chemical Breath Tests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">It is a violation of Maryland\u2019s Transportation Article to drive any vehicle while intoxicated. Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902(a) (1984). In a prosecution for such a violation, the State may administer a chemical test of the accused\u2019s breath for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of his blood. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-302 (1986 Cum.Supp.). If results from the test indicate the driver\u2019s blood contains .13% by weight alcohol, that fact is <em>prima </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>facie </em>evidence that he was driving while intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10-307(e) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The evidentiary use of chemical tests for blood alcohol content is provided for in Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Sections 10-302 through 10-307 (1984). Section 10-307(a) provides that a person\u2019s blood alcohol content \u201cshown in chemical analysis <em>as provided in this subtitle </em>is admissible in evidence____\u201d (Emphasis added). The subtitle provides that a chemical breath test must be conducted within two hours after the driver is apprehended, \u00a7 10-303, and must be administered by a \u201cqualified person with equipment approved by a toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission at the direction of a police officer,\u201d \u00a7 10-304(b). \u201cQualified person\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABF\">a person who has received training in the use of the equipment in a training program approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission and who is either a police officer, a police employee, or an employee of the office of the Chief Medical Examiner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhC\">\u00a7 10-304(a)(3). Thus, before results from a chemical breath test are admissible, the State must establish that the test was conducted within two hours of the driver\u2019s apprehension by a \u201cqualified person\u201d using test equipment approved by the State toxicologist. <em>See </em>68 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 446, 456-57 (1983). To establish this last point, Section 10-304(e) specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">[f]or the purpose of establishing that the test was administered with equipment approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission, a statement signed by the toxicologist certifying that the equipment used in the test has been approved by him shall be prima facie evidence of the approval, and the statement is admissible in evidence without the necessity of the toxicologist personally appearing in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Those, then, are the three elements of the foundation that must be laid before chemical breath test results are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Test results produced by a qualified person using certified equipment in a timely manner are <em>prima facie </em>reliable. <em>See Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 370, 478 A.2d 695 (1984). The assurance of reliability provided by this evidence is particularly important because of the dispositive nature of blood alcohol content evidence. An alcohol level of .13% or more constitutes <em>prima facie </em>proof of intoxication.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-307(e) (1984). Factfinders are likely to attach great weight to the objective, scientific assessment of intoxication presented by this evidence. A cautious insistence that the State produce proof required by the statutes ensures that this weight is not misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">1. <em>Ampules</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Casper argues that his unfavorable breath test results should have been excluded because \u201cthe ampules used were of questionable accuracy.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The premises put forth by Casper to support his challenge to the ampules\u2019 accuracy are these: the ampules were taken from a lot of 2,500 ampules of which only 25 were examined for chemical accuracy; and police received the ampules nine months before Casper\u2019s chemical breath test. Casper contends that the particular ampules used in his test should have been examined and that the State should have demonstrated that the ampules remained effective after nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>We must first determine whether the State has any obligation to demonstrate the chemical accuracy of ampules. If it does, we must then resolve what form that proof must take.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Chemical breath test results are inadmissible absent a showing that the test was administered with equipment approved by the State toxicologist. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-304(b) (1984). The term \u201cequipment\u201d is not defined in statutes controlling the evidentiary use of test results. Thus, we visit the first rule of statutory construction and attribute to \u201cequipment\u201d its ordinary and generally understood meaning. <em>See In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976 (1986). Webster reads equipment to mean implements used in an operation or activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ampules play a central role in the activity of determining a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. <em>See, supra, </em>note 2. There can be no breathalyzer test without an ampule. Improperly constituted ampules produce inaccurate test results. <em>See </em>Watts, <em>Some Observations on Police Administered Tests for Intoxication, </em>45 N.C.L.Rev. 34 n. 92 (1966); Note, <em>Defendant\u2019s Right to Independent Analysis of the Breathalyzer Ampoule: The Probable Virginia Response, </em>21 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 219, 227-228 (1979). Were the toxicologist\u2019s approval not to encompass this very central implement of a breath test, the assurance of reliability provided by that approval would be shallow indeed. We agree with the many states that include ampules among the equipment that must be certified as a condition to admissibility of breath test results. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ghylin, </em>222 N.W.2d 864, 869 (N.D.1974); <em>State, City of St. Louis Park </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>v. Quinn, </em>289 Minn. 184, 182 N.W.2d 843, 845 (1971); <em>State v. Baker, </em>56 Wash.2d 846, 355 P.2d 806, 809-810 (1960). We move now to determine whether methods used in this case to assure the accuracy of Casper\u2019s ampules were sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the case at bar Sergeant Huber testified that Casper\u2019s ampules were taken from lot 92 which, he indicated, contained about 1,200 ampules. The State toxicologist\u2019s certification, introduced through Huber, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">The Certified Breathalyzer Solution as distributed by Smith and Wesson and certified by ... Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. is approved for use in conjunction with the above Breathalyzer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Galbraith\u2019s \u201cCertification of Analysis,\u201d also produced and admitted into evidence, indicated that a chemical analysis conducted on 25 ampules from lot 92 produced results well within the manufacturer\u2019s tolerance range. The certificate, signed by a Galbraith representative and dated December 2, 1983, represented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">The above report indicated that this batch of ampuls complies within established tolerances for Breathalyzer solution as specified by the manufacture, for use in all Breathalyzers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Thus, the State toxicologist relied on Galbraith\u2019s random testing procedure in approving this equipment. Random testing of ampules is widely accepted as reliable <em>prima facie </em>proof that the chemical compound of any one ampule in a lot is the correct kind in proper proportion. <em>See, e.g., Ghylin, supra, </em>222 N.W.2d at 869; <em>Baker, supra, </em>355 P.2d at 811; <em>State v. DeVito, </em>125 N.J.Super. 478, 311 A.2d 753, 754 (1973). Therefore, we hold that the State toxicologist\u2019s approval of ampules certified by an independent laboratory using random testing meets the requirements of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>10-304(b) and constitutes <em>prima facie </em>evidence that any ampule in the lot is chemically accurate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On the basis of this holding, we reject Casper\u2019s assertion that the age of his ampules made his test results unreliable and, therefore, inadmissible. Proof of random testing provides sufficient indicia of an ampule\u2019s chemical integrity. Coupled with the evidence that his test was performed by a qualified person in a timely manner with approved equipment, Casper\u2019s results were <em>prima facie </em>reliable. Casper was free to challenge that reliability with evidence tending to show that the ampules had changed since being certified. Md.Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-304(f) (1984). The fact that his ampules were 9 months old, without more, however, went to the weight, not to the admissibility of Casper\u2019s test results. Consequently, the State was not required to offer further proof of the chemical accuracy of these ampules. <em>See State v. Ghylin, </em>248 N.W.2d 825, 831-832 (N.D.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">2. <em>Simulator Fluid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Sergeant Huber testified that immediately after determining Casper\u2019s blood alcohol content, he ran a \u201csimulator check\u201d on the breathalyzer \u201cto make sure it was operating properly.\u201d Huber explained that the check is conducted with a \u201cknown solution\u201d of .10% alcohol. Huber indicated that he did not mix the simulator fluid. That job was performed by Sergeant Mastrino who, though available to testify, was not called by either party. On the basis of the resulting reading of \u201c.10\u201d Sgt. Huber concluded, \u201cthe breathalyzer instrument that I was using on [the night of appellant\u2019s arrest] was functioning properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Casper argues that Sgt. Huber\u2019s conclusion was based on the hearsay representation of Sgt. Mastrino that the simulator fluid contained .10% alcohol.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 478 A.2d 695, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1207, 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 320 (1985), Casper contends that his constitutionally protected right of confrontation was violated when he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine Mastrino as to simulator checks and the mixing of the fluid used in his test.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Scientific and medical experts are frequently allowed to express an opinion based, in part, on objective data provided by others. <em>See Watts v. State, </em>223 Md. 268, 271-272, 164 A.2d 334 (1960); <em>Swain v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 29, 45-46, 435 A.2d 805 (1981). In <em>Fitzwater v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 274, 469 A.2d 909 (1984), we held that a trial court had not abused its discretion in allowing a police officer, qualified to operate a radar machine, to testify to the accuracy of the radar\u2019s internal calibration, though he had not calibrated the machine. Nevertheless, because Casper raises important constitutional considerations, we shall discuss possible confrontation clause ramifications. <em>See Standifur v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 570, 583, 497 A.2d 1164, <em>cert. granted, </em>305 Md. 175, 501 A.2d 1323 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In <em>Moon, </em>after an exhaustive review of cases construing the Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the 21st Article of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">[t]hese cases make indeliby clear that the essence of the Confrontation Clause is to secure the right of the defendant to have the witness against him produced in court. An exception is noted when the witness is unavailable and has made an otherwise trustworthy out-of-court statement. In such circumstances, unavailability may be established when the State demonstrates a good-faith effort to produce the witness but to no avail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">300 Md. at 368-369, 478 A.2d 695. The court quickly added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7D\">[t]he cases also suggest circumstances where the courts have found no confrontation violation because the evidence to be offered is clothed with substantial indicia of reliability. Such evidence is admitted without the declarant\u2019s testimony when producing the witness would likely prove unavailing or pointless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 369, 478 A.2d 695. This latter point derives in part from <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65, footnote 7, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2538, footnote 7, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), about which the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">[i]n footnote 7, the [U.S. Supreme] Court indicated when \u201cunavailability\u201d might not be required. Citing <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>[400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970)], the Court suggested that if the <em>utility </em>of trial confrontation is \u201cso remote\u201d the prosecution would not be required to produce a seemingly available witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">300 Md. at 368, 478 A.2d 695 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201csuggestion\u201d was raised to an explicit holding in <em>United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Following its constitutional analysis, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Moon </em>that a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was denied when a trial court admitted a facially unreliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>blood-alcohol test report into evidence without the testimony of the technician who performed the test. 300 Md. at 373, 478 A.2d 695. There, the technician was present in the courtroom and available to testify. Instead of calling the technician to testify, the State had a toxicologist interpret the report for the jury. Central to the court\u2019s holding was the toxicologist\u2019s inability to explain substantial indicia of unreliability appearing on the face of the report.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Clearly, then, there would have been obvious utility in allowing Moon to confront the man who performed his blood tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Applying principles articulated in <em>Inadi, supra, </em>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently held that a defendant\u2019s confrontation right was <em>not </em>violated when prosecutors failed to produce a chemist for cross-examination as to the accuracy of information he had provided to a testifying toxicologist. <em>Reardon v. Manson, </em>806 F.2d 39 (2d Cir., 1986). In that case, the court found that the test results bore \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d and that there was \u201clittle potential utility\u201d in producing the chemists for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 41-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We are asked here to determine whether appellant\u2019s confrontation right was violated when results from a chemical breath test were admitted into evidence without testimony from the technician who mixed fluid used to check the accuracy of the instrument which produced those results.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Casper correctly states that the reliability of a simulator check depends upon the accuracy of the simulator fluid mixture. Casper, however, was convicted upon his test results, not upon the simulator check and the reliability of test results depend upon the accuracy of the test equipment, the qualifications of the tester, and the timeliness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the test. The State proved those facts below. While a simulator check offers some indication of the accuracy of a breathalyzer, the Legislature has provided that the State toxicologist\u2019s certification constitutes sufficient proof of this point. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-304(e) (1984). We hasten to add that Casper\u2019s simulator reading of \u201c.10\u201d bolstered the assurance of accuracy offered by the toxicologist\u2019s certificate. In short, Casper\u2019s test results bore substantial indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Further, in light of testimony offered by Sgt. Huber, there was little potential for utility in producing the technician who mixed and maintained the simulator fluid. Huber fully explained simulator check procedures. He testified that the fluid was mixed twice a month and described, at length, the conditions under which the fluid was maintained at the Westminster barrack. Importantly, we note that the State toxicologist has issued detailed regulations concerning personnel and equipment with the purpose of assuring accurate chemical breath test results. <em>See </em>Regs, of the Toxicologist, Office of Chief Med. Exam\u2019r (P.E.C.) Regarding Test of Breath and Blood for Alcohol (1983). While Sergeant Mastrino had no motive to ignore those regulations and to distort the alcoholic content of the simulator fluid, his sense of duty and desire to remain employed provided incentive to refrain from such behavior. We see little utility in requiring the State to produce every technician who touches the chemical breath test process at every prosecution across the State in which alcohol impairment is an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The State is required, upon a proper request, to produce the technician who performed the chemical breath test. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-306(b) (1984). The admissibility of test results in the absence of testimony from other technicians is governed by the standards we now review. If test results contain substantial indicia of unreliability, and defendant demonstrates the utility of a non-testing technician\u2019s testimony, the results are inadmissible with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>out the additional testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Moon, </em>300 Md. at 373, 478 A.2d 695. If the State shows that the technician is unavailable to testify, the test results are admissible without his testimony, if shown to be \u201cotherwise trustworthy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 478 A.2d 695. When, however, test results bear substantial indicia of reliability and the utility of testimony from a second technician would be remote, a defendant\u2019s confrontation right is not violated when the results are admitted without the benefit of that technician\u2019s testimony. In those circumstances, a defendant\u2019s right to subpoena the non-testing technician satisfies the requirements of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387,-, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 1127-29, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Under the facts of this case, the admission of Casper\u2019s chemical breath test results without testimony from the non-testing technician did not violate Casper\u2019s confrontation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Before results from a chemical breath test are admissible into evidence, the State must demonstrate that: (1) the test was administered within two hours of defendant\u2019s apprehension; (2) a qualified person administered the test; and (3) the State toxicologist approved the equipment (including ampules) used to determine defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. Once these three points are proven, the State has demonstrated the <em>prima facie </em>reliability of the results and they may come into evidence subject to the caveats we now review.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Proof of the facts above notwithstanding, a defendant must be given an opportunity to offer competent evidence challenging the reliability of his test results. If this evidence so compromises the reliability of the results that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>admit them would deprive the defendant of a fair trial' or due process, the results must be excluded. Less compelling indicia of unreliability places the admissibility of chemical breath test results within the discretion of the trial judge. While much of this kind of proof goes to the weight to be given to the test results, at some point best discerned by trial courts, indicia of unreliability quickly create an issue of admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Finally, we note that upon a proper request by defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 10-306(b) of the Courts Article, chemical breath test results are inadmissible without the testimony of the testing technician. The right of a defendant to confront other technicians is reviewed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-9\">. Breathalyzer is the brand name of an apparatus used to determine the percentage, by weight, of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood. Like many brand names, \"breathalyzer\" has become a generic term used to describe a variety of blood-alcohol content testers. The specific apparatus used by police in this case was the Breathalyzer model 900, serial number 6444.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-11\">. The chemical process by which this indication is achieved was described in <em>State v. Baker, </em>56 Wash.2d 846, 355 P.2d 806, 809 (1960):</p>\n<p id=\"AZQ\">[The subject\u2019s breath is] forced, by weight of a piston, through [the] test ampoule containing a solution of sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate. This test solution has a yellow hue to it. As the breath sample bubbles through the test solution, the sulphuric acid extracts the alcohol, if any, therefrom, and the potassium dichromate then changes the alcohol to acetic acid, thereby causing the solution to lose some of its original yellow color. The greater the alcoholic content of the breath sample, the greater will be the loss in color of the test solution. By causing a light to pass through the test ampoule and through a standard ampoule containing the same chemical solution as the test ampoule (but through which no breath sample has passed), the amount of the change in color can be measured by photoelectric cells which are connected to a galvanometer. By balancing the galvanometer, a reading can be obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>from a gauge which has been calibrated in terms of percentage of alcohol in the blood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-15\">.

An alcohol level of .08% or more is <em>prima facie </em>proof that the defendant was driving while impaired. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.

Ampules (also spelled ampoule or ampul) are sealed glass containers of a specific chemical compound made by the company that manufactures the breathalyzer apparatus. That chemical compound and the role ampules play in a chemical breath test are described in footnote 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Technically, Casper\u2019s challenge is to the accuracy of the chemical compound contained in the ampule rather than to the ampule itself. Nevertheless, we shall use the term \"ampule\u201d to signify the chemical compound held therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b610-5\">. \u201d[T]he physical resources serving to equip a person or thing ... the implements (as machinery or tools) used in an operation or activity.\u201d Webster\u2019s <em>Third New International Dictionary, </em>768 (1971).

Thus, we reject Casper\u2019s contention that the State must examine every ampule used in a chemical breath test. We note that to examine an ampule, the ampule must be destroyed. To accept Casper\u2019s contention would bring an end to chemical breath testing in short order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Of course, if the State intends to rely on random testing, it must demonstrate that such a test was performed on the lot from which a defendant\u2019s ampules were taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. McCormick\u2019s widely adopted definition of hearsay, appearing in the second edition, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">testimony in court, or written evidence, of a statement made out of court, the statement being offered as an assertion to show the truth of matters asserted therein, and thus resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">E.

That indicia of unreliability included: a three-day lag between the dates on which the blood sample was taken and the tests were conducted; the failure of the report to indicate what type of tests were performed; the absence of Moon\u2019s name on the report; and the fact that the tests were conducted after the treatment for which they were requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">. For example, had Casper\u2019s simulator check indicated that his breathalyzer was not operating properly, and had Sgt.
