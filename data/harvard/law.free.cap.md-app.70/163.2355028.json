Cheney died as a result of receiving a blood transfusion. Unfortunately, the blood contained the dreaded Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome virus (AIDS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His surviving spouse, Theresa M. Cheney, made claim under an accidental death insurance policy issued by Bell National Life Insurance Company (\u201cBell\u201d). Bell refused payment on the ground that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Cheney\u2019s demise was not occasioned by accidental means. Rather, Bell asserted that Mr. Cheney\u2019s death, even if an accident, resulted from a cause that was specifically excluded from policy coverage. Patently dissatisfied with that explanation, Mrs. Cheney filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Bell, which answered and, after obtaining Mrs. Cheney\u2019s response to interrogatories, moved for summary judgment. Judge Elsbeth L. Bothe granted Bell\u2019s motion and entered judgment in its favor. Obviously because of what she views as a suboptimal result, Mrs. Cheney has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Mr. Cheney was a hemophiliac and from July 1980 until the time of his death was under the care of the Hemotology Clinic at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore City. Each month Mr. Cheney \u201creceived transfusions of several vials of factor 8 concentrate, which is a blood product replacement.\u201d Also in 1980 the Cheneys purchased a home. At that time they acquired a mortgage from Standard Federal Savings and Loan Association and a group accident policy from Bell. The policy provided that in the event of the accidental death of either Anthony or Theresa Cheney, Bell would pay the then \u201coutstanding balance\u201d of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On December 11, 1982, Mr. Cheney was admitted to St. Agnes Hospital because of shortness of breath. His condition worsened progressively, and he expired on December 23, 1982. Death was attributed to pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, an infection of the lungs. The infection \u201cdeveloped as a result of Mr. Cheney\u2019s contraction of ... (AIDS)\u201d which in turn developed from \u201cthe medical treatment of his hemophilia with factor 8 concentrate.\u201d In short, the transfusions necessitated by the hemophilia led to Mr. Cheney\u2019s contracting AIDS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The record reveals that Dr. Emile R. Mohler Jr., Chief, Section of Hemotology, St. Agnes Hospital, wrote to appellant\u2019s counsel in January 1985: \u201cAt the time [of the transfusion of Mr. Cheney] it was not possible ... to test or examine blood and blood products such as blood factor concentrate to determine the absence of AIDS causative factor____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Bell\u2019s policy, as issued to the Cheneys, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cThe policy does not apply to any loss, fatal or non-fatal, caused by or resulting from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(2) sickness or disease or medical or surgical treatment therefore except pyogenic infection which shall occur through an accidental cut or wound____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>The Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Despite the manner in which Mrs. Cheney phrases the issue before us, the overriding question is: Was there a genuine dispute of a material fact so as to preclude entry of summary judgment in favor of Bell?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Md. Rule 2-501 permits a judge of a circuit court to direct the entry of judgment \u201cin favor of or against\u201d a movant \u201cif the pleadings, ... answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The purpose of Rule 2-501 is to prevent the unnecessary expenditure of time and money in preparing for trial when there is no genuine dispute of material facts, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>Whitcomb v. Horman, </em>244 Md. 431, 224 A.2d 120 (1966); <em>Robertson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>34 Md.App. 399, 367 A.2d 962 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">With the rule and its purpose in mind, we examine the pleadings, answers to interrogatories, and affidavits in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">It is beyond question that Mr. Cheney died, at least indirectly, as a result of his contracting AIDS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He contracted AIDS from blood transfusions. The transfusions were administered to combat Mr. Cheney\u2019s hemophilia. The transfusions were prescribed medical treatment for hemophilia. Therefore, the treatment for hemophilia led to the disease that ultimately caused Mr. Cheney\u2019s death. Consequently, Mr. Cheney\u2019s tragic demise was not within the ambit of the policy. It was, instead, the result of a cause that was specifically excluded from the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Although Mrs. Cheney recognizes the cause of death, she argues that the death was \u201caccidental\u201d (the \u201caccident\u201d being the drawing of blood from a donor who had AIDS and infusing it into Mr. Cheney). Mrs. Cheney\u2019s argument falls short in that the receiving of the blood from an infected donor was not an accident. It was purposely drawn from the donor and infused into the deceased. No test was then available to the hospital to determine whether evidence of AIDS was present in blood or blood products. AIDS was not even recognized in this country until June 1981, Governor\u2019s Task Force on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, <em>AIDS and Maryland, Policy Guidelines and Recommendations </em>4 (Dee.1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus it was not until approx<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>imately one year after Mr. Cheney began his monthly transfusions of blood \u201cfactor 8 concentrate\u201d that the first case of AIDS in the United States was acknowledged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, the test to determine the presence of AIDS antibodies was not licensed until early 1985, over two years after Mr. Cheney\u2019s demise.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">To circumvent the language of the policy, Mrs. Cheney contends that hemophilia is not a disease but a \u201ccondition.\u201d To bolster her position, she refers us to a single authority: <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary, </em>373, 595 (26th ed. 1981). There it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201chemophilia\u2014a hereditary hemmorrhagic diathesis due to deficiency of coagulation Factor VIII, and characterized by spontaneous or traumatic subcutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhages; bleeding from the mouth, gums, lips, and tongues; hematuria; and hemarthroses. It affects males, being transmitted as an x-linked recessive trait.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUL\">\u201cDiathesis\u201d is defined by Dorland as \u201ca constitution or condition of the body which makes the tissues react in special ways to certain extrinsic stimuli and thus tends to make the person more than usually susceptible to certain diseases.\u201d According to Dorland, \u201chemorrhagic diathesis\u201d is \u201ca predisposition to abnormal hemostasis.\u201d From those three definitions quoted from one medical dictionary, Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Cheney deduces that \u201chemophilia\u201d is not a \u201csickness or disease but ... a genetically transmitted trait____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">We do not propose to enter into a battle of dictionaries, but we observe that <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>636 (24th ed. 1982) refers to hemophilia, among other things, as \u201ca disorder\u201d and as \u201cChristmas disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Irrespective of whether hemophilia is a disorder, disease, sickness, or condition, Mr. Cheney\u2019s death was attributed to pneumonia. That illness was in turn the result of AIDS. Since AIDS and pneumonia are diseases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> death was caused by a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Because we think Mr. Cheney\u2019s death was not accidental within the meaning of the policy, we conclude that there was no genuine dispute of a material fact in the case <em>sub judice </em>and that summary judgment as a matter of law was properly entered in favor of Bell National Life Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-12\">.
