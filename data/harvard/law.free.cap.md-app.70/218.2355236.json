On appeal, Pinder claims five instances of trial court error, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">I. The court below erred by denying a mistrial based on a prospective juror\u2019s statement that she had seen Appellant in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">II. The court below erred by admitting medical records without a proper foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-14\">III. The court below erred by denying motions to suppress improperly obtained statements of a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-15\">IV. The court below erred by excluding testimony of police misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-16\">V. The court below erred by denying a mistrial after the jury heard inflammatory, prejudicial testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>For the reasons set out below, we shall affirm the judgment against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">During voir dire a prospective juror, who was employed by the Sheriff\u2019s Department as a correctional officer, disclosed that Pinder \u201chas been in the jail before.\u201d That remark prompted appellant to move for a mistrial. The court denied the motion and instead instructed the prospective jurors that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">the fact that someone is in the jail, of course, has no bearing whatsoever on the fact of whether that person is guilty or not guilty of an offense with which he is charged. And therefore you should draw no conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the Defendant, Mr. Pinder. So just disregard that, because you will hear me later also explain a couple of other things that the law provides for all of us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Unlike appellant, we do not perceive the court\u2019s failure to grant a mistrial as an abuse of discretion. In our view, the court acted promptly and forcefully to remove the possibility of injury to Pinder. <em>See Myers v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 211, 228, 472 A.2d 1027, 1036, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 484, 479 A.2d 373 (1984). Moreover, after juror selection was completed, both appellant and his counsel noted, without qualification, that the jury as constituted was satisfactory; consequently, appellant withdrew or abandoned his prior objection that prospective jurors had been prejudiced by the correctional officer\u2019s remark. <em>See Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 447-53, 499 A.2d 1236, 1240-43 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Blackiston, the victim, went to Kent and Queen Anne\u2019s Hospital for treatment of the injuries he allegedly sustained at the hands of appellant. Dr. James G. McGettigan attended to Blackiston\u2019s injuries and so testified at trial. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>produced the medical report that is the subject of appellant\u2019s second claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Although appellant concedes that hospital records kept in the ordinary course of business are admissible under the business records exception of the hearsay rule, he challenges the court\u2019s decision to admit those sections of the medical report not authored by Dr. McGettigan, claiming lack of proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Our review of the medical report in question, as well as the trial court\u2019s questions to Dr. McGettigan regarding the report, persuades us that the trial court properly admitted it into evidence. <em>See Watkins v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 349, 355-56, 400 A.2d 464, 468 (1979). In any event, we fail to perceive how admission of the report harmed appellant. (His objections to introduction, both at trial and here, do not address this issue.) Because the medical report merely describes Blackiston\u2019s injuries and the treatment he received, and because Dr. McGettigan and Blackiston had already testified about these matters, there is no evidence that appellant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision to admit the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">After the jury was sworn, the trial judge held a hearing to determine whether statements made by Shelly Blanch-field, appellant\u2019s sister, to Officer Thomas Groce of the Chestertown Police Department and to Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Susanne Schmoldt should be suppressed. Ms. Blanchfield and Ms. Schmoldt testified at the hearing; stated briefly, their testimony revealed the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Somehow, Officer Groce learned that Ms. Blanchfield had information concerning the Blackiston incident. Groce went to Blanchfield\u2019s place of employment and from there took Blanchfield to the police station. At the station, Groce told Blanchfield that she would be arrested as an accessory after the fact in connection with the Blackiston beating if she did not give a statement. Blanchfield, without being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>advised of any constitutional rights she might have, then executed a written statement that incriminated her brother and Vernon Walters. At Groce\u2019s urging, Blanchfield also wrote that she had approached Groce about giving a statement. Groce himself added a clause to the effect that everything contained in Blanchfield\u2019s written statement was the sworn truth; this clause was penned after Blanchfield signed her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Later, Deputy State\u2019s Attorney Schmoldt met with Blanchfield to review Blanchfield\u2019s statement to Groce. The interview between Blanchfield and Schmoldt was taped with Blanchfield\u2019s knowledge. Schmoldt did not advise Blanchfield of any constitutional rights because she did not consider Blanchfield to be a suspect. Schmoldt admitted, however, that, when Blanchfield pressed the issue, Schmoldt told her that the situation sounded like a case of accessory after the fact. As the interview progressed, Schmoldt learned of Groce\u2019s misconduct; Blanchfield again incriminated her brother and Vernon Walters.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Ms. Blanchfield was represented hy counsel at the suppression hearing. He argued that Blanchfield\u2019s statement to Groce should be suppressed because it was the product of coercion and intimidation and was given without Blanch-field being advised of or waiving her constitutional rights. The statement to Schmoldt, he contended, was fruit of the poisonous tree. Counsel also stated that, if called to testify, Blanchfield would invoke her fifth amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Pinder\u2019s attorney also argued for suppression. He too complained about the means by which the statements were obtained. He argued that both Groce and Schmoldt threatened Blanchfield with prosecution. He also focused on the perjury contained in the statement to Groce, contending that the perjury rendered the statement \u201ccompletely unreliable .... \u201d When the court immediately responded that \u201c[tjhat\u2019s up to the jury to decide, if the witness testifies,\u201d defense counsel said: \u201cI totally agree with you as to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>aspect of it.\u201d Later, but before its final ruling on the motion to suppress, the court again indicated that it would allow the statements to be used for impeachment purposes if Ms. Blanchfield testified; Pinder\u2019s counsel responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">I won\u2019t dispute that, and of course to indicate the correctness of the statement or the reliability of the statement and of everything that took place is going to be a question for the jury. The significant point is that she was threatened with imprisonment unless she did something, and not only was that wrong\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The court ultimately denied Ms. Blanchfield\u2019s motion to suppress, saying that the statements could be used for the limited purpose of impeachment if Ms. Blanchfield testified at trial. The court also ruled that if Ms. Blanchfield asserted her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, it, having found that Blanchfield is not in danger of being prosecuted, would instruct her to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">On appeal, Pinder \u201cconcedes that he has no right to raise and litigate Ms. Blanchfield\u2019s 5th Amendment privilege <em>per se </em>on appeal.\u201d He then argues that \u201cthe involuntary nature of both statements <em>[i.e., </em>those made to Groce and Schmoldt,] creates error even apart from any 5th Amendment procedural mandate,\u201d and that, \u201c[w]ith relation to Appellant, if for no other reason, the statements should have been suppressed because of their unreliability.\u201d He concludes by claiming, albeit without citing any authority, that \u201c[t]he suppression of Ms. Blanchfield\u2019s statements at the outset of the trial was necessary to insure a fair trial, and the court below erred by denying suppression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">It is far from pellucid that Pinder\u2019s appellate contentions are properly before us. During trial there were a number of lengthy discussions regarding Blanchfield\u2019s statements to Groce and Schmoldt. Appellant initially tried in limine to prohibit Blanchfield from being asked any questions concerning statements in which Blanchfield related what may have been said to her by Vernon Walters. Later, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>counsel suggested that the State and the defense stipulate to certain portions of Blanchfield\u2019s prior statements and have the court read them to the jury. When counsel finally reached agreement on a stipulation, appellant noted a number of reasons why the stipulated portions of Blanchfield\u2019s statements should not be admitted; several of these objections were retracted after further discussion between defense counsel and the trial judge. Later, when the court finally read the stipulation to the jury, no objection was forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Whether appellant\u2019s various objections at trial constituted a retraction of his earlier concessions that reliability was an issue for the jury is doubtful. Whether appellant ever clearly articulated that use of Blanchfield\u2019s out-of-court statements would result in an unfair trial is also unclear. Because, however, the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of the statements was an issue the trial court considered time and time again, we shall assume arguendo that appellant\u2019s instant complaints have been preserved for our review. We also shall assume that appellant\u2019s concluding remark in his appellate brief concerning the unfairness engendered by the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress Blanchfield\u2019s statements is intended as a claim that he was denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">A number of courts have considered the issue of whether a defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated when a witness\u2019s involuntary statement was admitted into evidence. <em>E.g., United States v. Merkt, </em>764 F.2d 266 (5th Cir.1985) (Recognizing that admission at trial of a witness\u2019s coerced out-of-court statement may violate a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the due process clause of the fifth amendment, the court nevertheless found that, even if law enforcement agents had improperly intimidated and coerced witnesses, the conduct was improper but not so egregious as to require exclusion of the witnesses\u2019 statements as a prophylactic measure); <em>United States v. Chiavola, </em>744 F.2d 1271 (7th Cir.1984) (Recognizing that due process is implicated when the government seeks a conviction through the use of evidence obtained by extreme coer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>cion or torture, the court found that defendant\u2019s trial was not fundamentally unfair, since all defendant could claim was that he made incriminating statements during a telephone conversation that had been involuntarily initiated by another); <em>United States v. Fredericks, </em>586 F.2d 470 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 962, 99 S.Ct. 1507, 59 L.Ed.2d 776 (1979) (Defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not prejudiced by introduction of witness\u2019s statement since the reliability of that statement was not suspect and since the actions of the DEA officers were a far cry from the sort of third-degree physical or psychological coercion that might prompt the court to disregard the societal interest of law enforcement by excluding probative testimony); <em>LaFrance v. Bohlinger, </em>499 F.2d 29 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1080, 95 S.Ct. 669, 42 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (Where witness at trial had recanted statements in earlier confession saying that the confession was the product of coercion, the court held that a hearing to determine the voluntariness of the confession was required); <em>Bradford v. Johnson, </em>354 F.Supp. 1331 (E.D.Mich.1972), <em>aff'd, </em>476 F.2d 66 (7th Cir. 1973) (per curiam) (Recognizing that under normal circumstances the issue of credibility is one which the jury can weigh as a matter of fact, the court found that the testimony of witness given at trial of defendant should not have been admitted because it was a product of torture and thus untrustworthy under due process standards); <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>219 N.C. 235, 229 S.E.2d 904 (1976) (Where jury was fully informed of alleged coercive action by police and where each witness steadfastly asserted the truth of the material facts obtained through the alleged coercion, defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to due process by introduction of witnesses\u2019 allegedly coerced statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Maryland state courts, in turn, appear only tangentially to have touched upon this same issue. This Court has recently posited that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is a personal one which may only be invoked by the witness and his counsel. ... Even if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>witness makes a claim of privilege and is improperly disallowed by the trial court, it is not reversible error on behalf of the defendant.\u201d <em>Rowe v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 486, 499, 490 A.2d 278, 284, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 684, 496 A.2d 683 (1985) (citations omitted). Furthermore, in <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 246 A.2d 608 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 948, 89 S.Ct. 1284, 22 L.Ed.2d 482 (1969), the Court of Appeals found that the fact that the prosecutor had indicated that he might be disposed to drop indictments against certain witnesses did not affect the admissibility of those witnesses\u2019 testimony at defendant Earl Yeney\u2019s trial. Later, in a post-conviction proceeding involving Samuel Veney, the Court of Appeals, noting that petitioner was not claiming that coercion of a witness resulted in her giving perjured testimony, stated that \u201c[wjhere testimony is not freely given, its probity is subject to evaluation by the trier of fact, but is certainly not reviewable on a post-conviction proceeding.\u201d <em>Veney v. Warden, </em>259 Md. 437, 448, 271 A.2d 133, 140 (1970) (citations omitted). More recently, in <em>Ball v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 338, 470 A.2d 361 (1984),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court, with little discussion, found that the voluntariness of coappellant Coley\u2019s confession was a personal constitutional concern of Coley and thus appellant Ball had no standing to raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We distill the following general principles from the above-cited cases. First, a defendant has no standing to assert the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination on behalf of a witness; nor can he take advantage of a court\u2019s erroneous decision to disallow a witness\u2019s claim of privilege. Second, under normal circumstances, the voluntariness of a witness\u2019s statement affects its weight and credibility, not its admissibility. Third, although a defendant has no constitutional right to be free from incrimination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>under certain circumstances the violation of another\u2019s fifth amendment rights may rise to the level of a violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The question we must ultimately answer in the instant case is whether introduction of Blanchfield\u2019s statements to Groce and Schmoldt deprived appellant of a fair trial. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">First, although the court questioned whether the State would be permitted to use Blanchfield\u2019s out-of-court statements in a prosecution against Blanchfield, it further found, based on the facts before it, that the police did not overreach \u201cto the point the Court should therefore deny the State the opportunity to present what they think is relevant material evidence\u201d in the State\u2019s case against Pinder. The trial court essentially made a determination that the violation of Blanchfield\u2019s constitutional rights, if any, did not rise to the level of a violation of appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Second, the threats of prosecution attributed to Groce and Schmoldt are far less egregious than the torture to which the witness who incriminated Bradford, <em>supra, </em>was subjected. That witness was beaten, kicked, and otherwise physically abused; he was interrogated by the police for at least twenty-four hours during which time he was deprived of food, drink, and sleep; he was told that his wife and children would be prosecuted if he did not confess. These indignities were suffered before and after the witness made statements incriminating Bradford. In addition, when the witness appeared before a magistrate for arraignment, the injuries he had sustained were visible. The magistrate also knew that the witness had been threatened by an assistant state prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Third, (here we focus on Officer\u2019s Groce\u2019s conduct insofar as suborning perjury is concerned) we note that in questioning Blanchfield, who was called as the court\u2019s witness, the State did not lay a foundation for the introduction of the witness's prior inconsistent statements to Groce. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>over, the defense\u2019s questions to Blanchfield elicited which portions of the statement to Groce were untrustworthy. Later, the court apprised the jury that Officer Groce had been disciplined for causing Blanchfield to falsify a portion of her statement and for asking Blanchfield for a date. Thus, the jury had before it all the facts necessary to determine whether Blanchfield\u2019s trial testimony was credible. Finally, only two excerpts from the statement to Groce were read to the jury by the court. One of the excerpts was the oath penned by Officer Groce. The jury was told that the oath was not in Blanchfield\u2019s handwriting. Additionally, defense counsel, after noting the reasons why the stipulated portions of Blanchfield\u2019s statements should not be introduced, agreed that the oath would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Under these circumstances, we find that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Blanchfield\u2019s statements for the limited purpose of impeaching her credibility did not deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Our finding of lack of unfairness is further bolstered by the fact that Blanchfield\u2019s testimony at trial in and of itself incriminated appellant. In response to questions posed by the court, Blanchfield disclosed that she received a telephone call from her brother around 4:00 a.m. on 18 January 1985. Her brother asked her for a ride from Millington. She further related that during the trip from Millington to Chestertown \u201cI had asked him what happened to him, because his hand was swelled up, and he just said that he had got in a fight.\u201d She also said that her brother asked her \u201cto drive through Dixon Valve <em>\\i.e., </em>the place where, according to Blackiston\u2019s earlier testimony, he had been beaten,] to see if this guy was still out there so that he could call an ambulance.\u201d On cross-examination by the State, Blanchfield admitted, among other things, that when her brother got in the car \u201c[h]e had a little blood on his coat.\u201d Her cross-examination testimony also reveals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Q You stated when the Court asked you questions, I believe, that you drove through KRM [ie., Dixon Valve,] parking lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">Q What were you looking for? Do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">A To see if the guy was in the ditch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">Q And you knew you were looking for a black guy, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">Q How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">A I just assumed it was a black guy, when Vernon said on the phone that he had either hurt a nigger or killed a nigger I figured it was a black man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Finally, our review of the record persuades us that the trial court went to great lengths to determine that the statements made to Groce and Schmoldt were, except as discussed above, reliable. Blanchfield\u2019s responses to the numerous questions asked in this regard reveal that, since giving the statements, Blanchfield had had misgivings about making them and that she now remembered things differently or not at all. We also suspect that, since giving her statements, Blanchfield had learned a few things about \u201chearsay\u201d information. The following testimony at the suppression hearing is illustrative of Blanchfield\u2019s change in recall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">Q Other than what you stated about the officer tell you to place something in there about meeting you in Kent Plaza, is the statement otherwise true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">Q What\u2019s false about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">A It\u2019s true of what people told me, but it\u2019s not actually true of what I did. That\u2019s just what people have told me, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the truth or it\u2019s not the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-17\">Q Is it true about what your brother told you? The statements on there as to what your brother told you\u2014 are those true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-18\">A To a point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Q How far to a point? What\u2019s not true about the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">A There\u2019s a lot of things I thought he said that he didn\u2019t say that Vernon said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In sum, although we do not condone Officer Groce\u2019s misconduct, we do not believe that his treatment of Ms. Blanchfield or Blanchfield\u2019s subsequent treatment at the hands of the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney was so opprobrious as to require the exclusion of Blanchfield\u2019s statements at appellant\u2019s trial. We reiterate that appellant was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Blanch-field, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">Q [By Defense Counsel]: Did you ever see the officer again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">A Yes, it was a while after that I stopped him down here by the bridge and asked him when would I have to go to court and he asked me to meet him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to this line of questioning unless it has something to do with the statement that she already gave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">Q [Defense Counsel]: Absolutely, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">Court: No, I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\">Q [By Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, may we approach the Bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\">BEFORE THE BENCH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-16\">[Defense Counsel]: The conduct of Officer Groce occurred, if I\u2019m not mistaken, after the statement given by her but before the statement given to Mrs. Schmoldt, and I think it would be very important for the jury to understand the durress [sic] that she was under. And all of this flows\u2014we go from Officer Groce and all of his actions and conduct directly to Mrs. Schmoldt, the Deputy State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Court: No, I don\u2019t think so. Your objection is noted. Sustain the objection. I\u2019ll stick with my ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Appellant now complains that the court erred when it \u201crefused to allow Ms. Blanchfield to testify about the officer\u2019s improper conduct toward her during the period of time between the two statements,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the statement to Groce and the statement to Schmoldt. Absent a more specific proffer as to what Blanchfield would have said, appellant\u2019s fourth claim of error is not properly before us. <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 603-04, 479 A.2d 1344, 1353-54 (1984). In other words, without a particularized proffer we have no way of knowing that Blanchfield\u2019s answers would have, as appellant suggests, described further misconduct on Groce\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In all probability the misconduct which appellant sought to question Blanchfield about concerned Officer Groce\u2019s subsequent solicitation of a date and we note that the jury learned of that conduct when the court read the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding the disciplinary action to which Groce was subjected. Consequently, we fail to see how appellant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">State\u2019s witness Terrance Murray testified that he saw Blackiston, Pinder, and Walters at a tavern called Newt\u2019s on the night Blackiston was beaten. Specifically, Murray testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">Q [State\u2019s Attorney]: What happened? Did anything unusual happen after Linwood Blackiston left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">A Yeah\u2014well, when Iwas <em>\\sic </em>] about to leave Newt\u2019s at the time, some dude named Vernon\u2014I seen\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">Q Named who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">A Vernon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-13\">Q Vernon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-14\">A I guess that\u2019s his name. Vernon. That\u2019s what I know him by. He came in the bar and said\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-15\">Q You can\u2019t say anything he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>A Well, I didn\u2019t hear anybody talk but Vernon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">Q Okay, but you still can\u2019t say what\u2014I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t say anything Vernon may have said. Did you observe anything about Vernon? What his appearance was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">A Yeah. <em>His appearance was like he actually stood there in front of other people saying, \u201cYeah, we got that nigger. We got that nigger.\u201d </em>That\u2019s when I left Newt\u2019s. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">Court: Yes, you can\u2019t repeat anything he said. Only how he appeared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">A He appeared like he had just got done\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">Court: Now wait a minute. I haven\u2019t finished. I will have to ask the jury to disregard, and I will strike from the record what he said that Vernon said. That\u2019s not evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, may we approach the Bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">BEFORE THE BENCH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">[Defense Counsel]: The evidence will show that there will be no method by which the State can produce any statement that he did anything to a nigger. I believe what he has just done now is very harmful and I move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">Court: I gave a correcting instruction and I will deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">END OF BENCH CONFERENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-16\">Q [State\u2019s Attorney]: Mr. Murrayf,] was there anyone with this person called Vernon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-17\">A Yeah, Kelly Pinder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-18\">Q And is Kelly Pinder in court today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-19\">A Yeah. Setting right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Q Your Honor, we would ask the record to reflect that he pointed to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">Court: Alright <em>[sic </em>].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">Q What if anything\u2014did you look at Kelly Pinder that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">A Yeah, I seen Kelly Pinder that night. I didn\u2019t say anything to Kelly Pinder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">Q What if anything, at this time you mentioned you saw Vernon, what if anything did you observe about Kelly Pinder\u2019s appearance? The way he looked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">A <em>Well his appearance was the same as Vernon\u2019s. In other words, like something was done that wasn\u2019t supposed to have been done. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">Court: You can\u2019t draw your own conclusions. You can describe him, how he was dressed, what his clothes looked like, whether he had a hat on or not, his hair or something, but you can\u2019t draw conclusions as to what you think has happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">Appellant now complains that the emphasized portions of Murray\u2019s testimony required the court to grant a mistrial. We do not agree. Appellant did not request a mistrial in connection with the statement describing appellant\u2019s appearance; he merely objected. The judge in turn instructed the witness about the inappropriateness of his response, even though no such instruction was requested. Under these circumstances, there is nothing for us to review. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 115, 122-23, 516 A.2d 985, 989-90 (1986). As to the witness\u2019s statement regarding Vernon, we believe the court\u2019s cautionary instructions removed the possibility of injury to appellant. <em>See Myers v. State, </em>58 Md.App. at 228, 472 A.2d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\">.
