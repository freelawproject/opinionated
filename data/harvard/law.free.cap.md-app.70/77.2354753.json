Cheese\u201d restaurants. The appellant also decided to deny claims for refunds for certain admissions and amusement taxes to L.D.C.A. Inc. of Maryland, another corporate appellee who owns a restaurant known as \u201cGadgets.\u201d Appellant based its decisions on its interpretation of \u00a7 402(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Article 81 of the Md.Ann. Code. Appellant interprets the word \u201cperformance\u201d in that section to include the preprogrammed, mechanical puppet shows that are automaticaly run every few minutes in appellees\u2019 restaurants. If appellant is correct, appellees would owe admission and amusement taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">When the appellees appealed to the Maryland Tax Court, that agency disagreed with the Comptroller\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The Comptroller consolidated appellees\u2019 separate cases and appealed the Tax Court\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. When the circuit court affirmed the Tax Court, the Comptroller appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Appellant presents these questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>1. Was admissions and amusement tax properly assessed (and refund properly denied), pursuant to \u00a7 402(a), on the gross receipts from amounts charged for refreshments where performances by mechanical characters are provided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\">2. Was Family Entertainment Centers properly assessed admissions and amusement tax on its gross receipts from its video games and rides?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>1. Can Pre-programmed Mechanical Puppets \u201cPerform\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">This case requires a decision on whether the life-sized, mechanical puppets displayed in restaurants like appellees\u2019 are actually \u201cperforming\u201d so that any receipts from the sale of refreshments or from admission fees are properly taxable under \u00a7 402(a). (All references will be to Article 81 unless otherwise noted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Section 402(a) gives counties authority to tax entities on gross receipts that the entities collect from admission fees or food and beverage sales under certain circumstances. The circumstance that applies to this case is found in \u00a7 402(a)(4), which says that a county may levy tax on fees derived from amounts charged for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">refreshment, service or merchandise at any roof garden, cabaret or similar place where there is furnished a performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">* s)s s)s * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">The term \u201croof garden or other similar place\u201d shall include any room in any hotel, restaurant, hall or other place where music or dancing privileges or other entertainment, except mechanical music, radio or television, alone, and where no dancing is permitted, are afforded the members, guests, or patrons in connection with the serving of selling of food, refreshment or merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Applying \u00a7 402(a), the Tax Court decided that the life-sized electronic puppets do not \u201cperform\u201d and that those machines are not unlike complex jukeboxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The circuit court affirmed pursuant to \u00a7 229(o) as well as the standards of review set out in <em>Ramsay, Scarlett and Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985). The task is to decide whether the decision of the circuit court was clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">This Court addressed the word \u201cperformance\u201d as used in \u00a7 402(a) in <em>Comptroller v. Citizens for Hoyer, </em>51 Md.App. 33, 440 A.2d 429 (1982). In that case this Court said that the Legislature has not defined the term. This Court further determined that a band of seven musicians (who played background music at a political-fundraising cocktail party, at which there was no dancing, and at which the presence of the band was unadvertized) was not \u201cperforming\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In the <em>Hoyer </em>decision this Court relied on <em>Comptroller v. Mandel, Lee, Goldstein, Burch Re-election Committee, </em>280 Md. 575, 374 A.2d 1130 (1977), in which the Court of Appeals held that an organist playing tunes in the background at a fundraising cocktail party was not a performance under \u00a7 402(a). The Court of Appeals said that \u201cperformance\u201d was to be defined by using the \u201cordinary and accepted\u201d meaning of the word. <em>Id. </em>at 581, 374 A.2d 1130. The Court said that the Legislature meant the term to be defined \u201cas the public thinks of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 374 A.2d 1130. The Court turned to Webster\u2019s dictionaries for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">According to Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (2d edition, 1983), one definition of the word \u201cperformance,\u201d among others clearly less applicable, is \u201c(4) a formal exhibition of skill or talent as a play, musical program, etc.; a show.\u201d We recognize that \u201cperformance,\u201d as used in \u00a7 402(a), has connotations of inherent human input that leaves room for spontaneous imperfections during the exhibition of skill or talent. A \u201cperformance\u201d is a method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>to measure human skill or talent. In other words, a preprogrammed robot can perform a menial task but, because a pre-programmed robot has no \u201cskill\u201d and therefore leaves no room for spontaneous human flaw in an exhibition, it cannot \u201cperform\u201d a piece of music anymore than can a jukebox. Just as a wind-up toy does not perform for purposes of \u00a7 402(a), neither does a pre-programmed mechanical robot.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Appellees\u2019 mechanical puppets are designed to give the impression that they are performing; however, because there is no human skill necessary in their control, there is no \u201cperformance.\u201d We perceive no clear error on the part of the circuit court in its decision to agree with the Tax Court that the displays at the restaurants are not unlike embellished jukeboxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Appellant further argues that the Tax Court\u2019s decision was not based on sufficient evidence. In reviewing the record, we disagree. Those facts, which were believed by the Tax Court, are sufficient to determine whether a mechanical puppet display was a \u201cperformance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\n<em>2. Are Tokens Like Tickets Under \u00a7 402(A)?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Appellant also contends that Family Entertainment Centers were underassessed for the amusement taxes on their gross receipts from video games because Family Entertainment Centers improperly calculated their gross receipts using the \u201ctax included\u201d method. <em>See </em>COMAR 03.-01.01.01 B.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Appellant argues that \u201cadmissions\u201d in the Comptroller\u2019s regulation refers only to actual admission tickets and does not include tokens for video games. Without a definition of \u201cadmissions\u201d in the regulations to guide the Tax Court, we find no fault with the Tax Court\u2019s construction of the term to include game tokens. A \u201ctax included\u201d method of calculation can be employed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Appellant further argues that even if the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation was proper, Family Entertainment Centers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>did not comply with the notice provisions of the regulation because the Comptroller\u2019s witness stated that he never saw one of the required notices. The Tax Court pointed out that there was conflicting testimony concerning signs posted on the video machines. That body further indicated that it believed the required notices were posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">We agree with the circuit court that the orders of the Tax Court \u201creflect no error as a matter of law and that the decision and Orders are supported by substantial evidence appearing in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\">. While the Acts of 1983 made certain paragraph and style changes in \u00a7 402, that does not affect the statute for the purposes of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
