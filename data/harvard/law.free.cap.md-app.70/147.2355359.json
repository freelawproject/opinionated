Md.Code (1974, 1984 RepLVol., 1986 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 to 3-2A-09 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following an arbitration award of $150,000 in favor of the appellee, Shelia D. Nagle Spivey, against the appellant, David D. Golub, M.D., Dr. Golub took steps to reject the award in compliance with procedures delineated in \u00a7 3-2A-06 and Rule BY2. Mrs. Spivey then filed a declaration in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to Rule BY4. The case was tried before a jury whose verdict agreed with the award of the arbitration panel. Dr. Golub appeals from the judgment entered pursuant to that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">On July 25, 1979, Mrs. Spivey (Ms. Nagle at that time) was sent by her personal physician to Dr. Golub, a radiologist, for an intravenous pyelogram, a procedure permitting study of a patient\u2019s kidney function. Although the pyelogram administered by Dr. Golub revealed inflammation and dysfunction of the left kidney, Dr. Golub erroneously reported a negative finding, <em>i.e., </em>a normal pyelogram. In reliance on Dr. Golub\u2019s inaccurate report, Mrs. Spivey\u2019s treating physicians failed to provide the immediate care required by her condition. The condition went untreated until the spring of 1980 when Mrs. Spivey visited a urologist. The urologist conducted tests which disclosed that Mrs. Spivey had suffered permanent damage to her left kidney due to an untreated infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Mrs. Spivey filed a claim with the Director of the HCAO in August 1980. In addition to Dr. Golub, other health care providers named as defendants in the statement of claim were Richard Berkowitz, M.D., and George N. Karkar, M.D. An arbitration panel consisting of an attorney, a health care provider, and a lay person was appointed pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-04(c) to (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">On September 9, 1983, three days before the scheduled start of the arbitration hearing, Mrs. Spivey filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude Dr. Golub from presenting expert testimony at the hearing. Previously, on February 17, 1983, the panel chairman had issued an order requiring all counsel in the case to provide the names of experts to each other by July 15, 1983. The other two defendant health care providers each provided the names of two experts by that date, but Dr. Golub did not identify any experts. The panel granted Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion in limine over Dr. Golub\u2019s objection that he intended to call the experts named by the other defendant health care providers. The panel also denied Dr. Golub\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A hearing was conducted before the arbitration panel on September 15 and 16, 1983. At the beginning of the hearing, Mrs. Spivey voluntarily dismissed Dr. Berkowitz and Dr. Karkar as defendants. Dr. Golub admitted liability at the hearing, and at its conclusion on September 16, the arbitration panel rendered an award against Dr. Golub in the amount of $150,000. In accordance with \u00a7 3-2A-05(g), written notice of the award was delivered to the Director of the HCAO, who mailed copies of it to counsel for all parties on October 24, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">On November 18, 1983, Dr. Golub filed a Notice of Rejection with the Director of the HCAO pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-06(a). At the same time he also filed a Notice of Action to Nullify Award in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, in compliance with \u00a7 3-2A-06(b)(l) and Rule BY2. Copies of both notices were mailed to counsel for Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Spivey on November 17, 1983, according to the attached certificates of service. The attorneys for Mrs. Spivey did not receive either notice and did not learn of their filing until December 22, 1983, when one of them checked the docket at HCAO after Mrs. Spivey had inquired of him as to when she could expect payment of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">On December 23, 1983, 35 days after Dr. Golub\u2019s Notice of Action to Nullify Award was filed, Mrs. Spivey filed a declaration in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In response to that declaration, Dr. Golub filed a Motion Raising Preliminary Objection and a Motion Ne Recipiatur or to Strike. The basis for both motions was Mrs. Spivey\u2019s failure to file her declaration within 30 days after the filing of Dr. Golub\u2019s Notice of Action to Nullify Award, as required by Rule BY4 a.l. Dr. Golub also filed a Motion to Vacate Award in which he challenged the propriety of the panel\u2019s decisions granting Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion in limine prior to the arbitration hearing and refusing to grant Dr. Golub\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Although the certificates of service attached to each of the three motions filed by Dr. Golub indicate that they were mailed to counsel for Mrs. Spivey on January 9, 1984, those documents, like the previously filed notices, were not received. It was not until February 10, 1984, when Mrs. Spivey\u2019s attorneys received a copy of Judge Thomas Ward\u2019s order granting Dr. Golub\u2019s motions, that they became aware of the filing of those motions. Mrs. Spivey immediately filed a motion to set aside Judge Ward\u2019s order, citing a lack of notice as to the filing of the three motions. Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion was supported by an affidavit by two of her attorneys attesting to their lack of notice of the three motions granted by Judge Ward as well as of Dr. Golub\u2019s Notice of Rejection and Notice of Action to Nullify Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On September 7, 1984, Judge Ward conducted a hearing concerning Mrs. Spivey's motion to set aside his earlier order granting Dr. Golub\u2019s three preliminary motions. In a memorandum opinion filed November 14, 1984, Judge Ward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>vacated his order. Judge Ward found that Dr. Golub was not prejudiced by Mrs. Spivey\u2019s filing of her declaration five days late, thereby rejecting the basis for Dr. Golub\u2019s Motion Raising Preliminary Objection and Motion Ne Recipiatur. In a separate order filed the same day, Judge Ward denied Dr. Golub\u2019s Motion to Vacate Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">A jury trial was conducted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (John N. Maguire, J., presiding) on November 4 and 5, 1985. Dr. Golub again admitted liability at the trial, but he presented an expert who testified on the issues of causation and damages. The jury returned a verdict of $150,000 in favor of Mrs. Spivey.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Dr. Golub presents three questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred in denying Dr. Golub\u2019s preliminary defenses to the declaration when the declaration was not timely filed in accordance with the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act and the Maryland Rules of Procedure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred in denying Dr. Golub\u2019s Motion to Vacate Award in the face of improprieties in the arbitration proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">III. Whether the Circuit Court erred in permitting prejudicial cross-examination of Dr. Golub\u2019s expert witness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Under the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act, a party who is dissatisfied with an arbitration panel\u2019s award may reject the award and institute an action in court. In order to do so, the rejecting party must comply with certain procedures set forth in \u00a7 3-2A-06. The first requirement, which must be completed within 30 days after the award has been served upon the rejecting party (or within 10 days after disposition of an application to modify the award, whichever is greater), is the filing of a notice of rejection of the award with the Director of the HCAO and the arbitration panel. \u00a7 3-2A-06(a). At or before the time specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>for filing of the notice of rejection, the rejecting party must also file notice of an action to nullify the award with the clerk of a circuit court. \u00a7 3-2A-06(b)(l); Rule BY2 a. That notice should \u201cidentify the award and state that it is being rejected by the party filing the notice.\u201d Rule BY2 a. Copies of the notice of rejection and the notice of an action to nullify must be mailed to the other parties to the arbitration proceeding or their counsel. \u00a7 3-2A-06(a); Rule BY2 b.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Both the Court of Appeals and this Court have recognized the mandatory nature of the statutory procedures for instituting a court action to review a health claims arbitration award. <em>E.g., Cherry v. Brothers, </em>306 Md. 84, 88, 507 A.2d 613 (1986); <em>Tranen v. Aziz, </em>304 Md. 605, 614, 500 A.2d 636 (1985); <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, </em>62 Md.App. 519, 524-25, 490 A.2d 720, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 163, 497 A.2d 1163 (1985); <em>Tranen v. Aziz, </em>59 Md.App. 528, 534-35, 476 A.2d 1170 (1984), <em>aff'd, </em>304 Md. 605, 500 A.2d 636 (1985). Compliance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 3-2A-06 has been held to be a condition precedent to maintenance of a court action. <em>Tranen v. Aziz, supra, </em>304 Md. at 614, 500 A.2d 636; <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, supra, </em>62 Md.App. at 525, 490 A.2d 720. The Court of Appeals discussed those procedures in <em>Tranen v. Aziz, supra, </em>304 Md. at 612, 500 A.2d 636:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Both the notice of rejection provision (\u201cnotice of rejection <em>must </em>be filed,\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) (emphasis supplied)) as well as the action to nullify provision (\u201cthe party rejecting the award <em>shall </em>file an action in court to nullify the award,\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06(b) (emphasis supplied)) are posed in imperative terms. More important, the statutory context of these directives plainly shows that compliance with them is mandatory and that noncompliance mandates dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">The purpose of the legislative scheme is clear upon careful analysis. The notice of rejection serves as the final step in the arbitration procedure by which the award may be held non-binding and the claim held open for judicial resolution. The action to nullify, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>hand, is the exclusive step by which the aggrieved party may initiate proceedings in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Once the aggrieved party files notice of an action to nullify in a circuit court, subsequent proceedings are governed by the Maryland Rules. \u00a7 3-2A-06(b)(l); <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, supra, </em>62 Md.App. at 523, 490 A.2d 720. Rule BY4 a.l. states that \u201cthe plaintiff shall file and serve a declaration\u201d within 30 days after notice of the action to nullify is filed. Rule BY3 designates the parties: \u201cThe party making the claim against the health care provider shall be the plaintiff in the action and the health care provider shall be the defendant.\u201d Thus, in this case Mrs. Spivey was responsible for filing a declaration in court even though Dr. Golub rejected the arbitration award and sought to have it nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Dr. Golub maintains that Mrs. Spivey\u2019s failure to file her declaration within the 30-day period prescribed by Rule BY4 a.l. requires dismissal of the court action and automatic nullification of the arbitration award regardless of the circumstances. We disagree. We believe that where a claimant who is not the aggrieved party fails to file a declaration in a timely manner, the trial judge is vested with discretion to excuse that violation of the rule if the circumstances surrounding the claimant\u2019s noncompliance with the time limit justify that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The 30-day limit for filing a declaration does not appear in the provisions of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act; rather, it appears in Rule BY4, which comes into play only after notice of an action to nullify has been filed in a circuit court. This Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">[T]he statute is strictly construed so as to effectuate the legislative purpose of screening malpractice claims <em>before </em>they reach the courts. Upon completion of the arbitration process and the filing of the correct and timely notice of rejection with the parties and court, the statutory screening process is terminated. All further proceedings are conducted in court and regulated, as are all other civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>cases, by the Maryland Rules. Although judicial review of the HCAO actions might be regarded as a continuation of the arbitration proceeding, it is not. Rather, it is a new, separate, and distinct proceeding. It is litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af0\"><em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, supra, </em>62 Md.App. at 525, 490 A.2d 720 (emphasis in original), <em>quoted in Wyndham v. Haines, </em>305 Md. 269, 276, 503 A.2d 719 (1986). Thus, we will be guided in our analysis of the effect of the rule violation in the instant case by the construction previously placed upon noncompliance with other rules prescribing time limits for the litigation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">First, we note that Rule BY4 a.l., even though couched in mandatory language (\u201cWithin 30 days ... the plaintiff shall file ... a declaration.\u201d), does not indicate what sanction is to be applied in the event of noncompliance. A similar problem was presented in <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. 715, 451 A.2d 945 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>295 Md. 441 (1983), where the People\u2019s Counsel failed to file a memorandum of law within the 30-day period prescribed by Rule B12, governing appeals from administrative agencies. We there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">In some instances, the applicable rules either require or expressly permit an extreme sanction for violation of the procedural requirements which they or other rules establish. <em>See, for example, </em>Maryland Rules 835, 1035, B5. In other cases, the rules provide either no specific sanction or offer a range of alternative sanctions, in which event the courts have tended to balance the purpose and importance of the requirement against the circumstances of its violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 720, 451 A.2d 945. We went on to rule that dismissal of an administrative appeal is not a mandatory sanction for failure to comply with Rule B12 and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to dismiss the People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 720-21, 451 A.2d 945. We believe our reasoning in <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>is applicable here. Such an approach is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>consistent with the general philosophy of the Maryland Rules expressed in Rule l-201(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">These rules shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay. When a rule, by the word \u201cshall\u201d or otherwise, mandates or prohibits conduct, the consequences of noncompliance are those prescribed by these rules or by statute. If no consequences are prescribed, the court may compel compliance with the rule or may determine the consequences of the noncompliance in light of the totality of the circumstances and the purpose of the rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Because Rule BY4 prescribes no consequences for noncompliance with its time limit, the trial judge was entitled to determine the consequences of Mrs. Spivey\u2019s noncompliance \u201cin light of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d In cases involving noncompliance with other rule-prescribed time limits, it has been held that consideration of such matters is within the discretion of the trial judge, whose decision should not be disturbed unless that discretion was abused. <em>E.g., Faulkner v. Town of Chestertown, </em>290 Md. 214, 220, 428 A.2d 879 (1981) (no abuse of discretion in permitting late filing of cross-claim); <em>Toomey v. Gomeringer, </em>235 Md. 456, 459-60, 201 A.2d 842 (1964) (no abuse of discretion in permitting late filing of answer to zoning appeal); <em>Easter v. Dundalk Holding Cory., </em>233 Md. 174, 179-80, 195 A.2d 682 (1963) (rulings as to time for filing pleas will not be disturbed absent showing of prejudice or abuse of discretion); <em>Kramer v. Emche, </em>64 Md.App. 27, 43, 494 A.2d 225, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 297, 498 A.2d 1184 (1985) (granting of right to file a cross-claim or counterclaim after time for doing so has expired rests in sound discretion of lower court). <em>Cf. Evans v. Howard, </em>256 Md. 155, 161, 259 A.2d 528 (1969); <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>32 Md.App. 685, 691, 363 A.2d 598 (1976) (sanctions for failure to comply with discovery rules are within discretion of trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Judge Ward exercised his discretion in this case when he reconsidered his order granting Dr. Golub\u2019s Motion Raising Preliminary Objection, Motion Ne Recipiatur, and Motion to Vacate Award. At the hearing on Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion to set aside that order, Judge Ward accepted the explanation offered by Mrs. Spivey\u2019s attorneys as to why the declaration was filed five days late and concluded that &lt; Dr. Golub \u201cwas not prejudiced in any way by the delay, as he was well apprised of the cause of action.\u201d In light of those circumstances, Judge Ward elected to vacate his earlier order granting Dr. Golub\u2019s preliminary motions. We find no abuse of discretion in Judge Ward\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Dr. Golub places great reliance on the words of this Court in <em>Tranen v. Aziz, supra, </em>59 Md.App. at 533-34, 476 A.2d 1170, where various ways of not complying with the procedures for judicial review of an arbitration award were discussed hypothetically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">If the award is in favor of the claimant and the health care provider rejects the award and files a notice of action to nullify, and thereafter the claimant fails to file a complaint within the allotted time, the arbitral award is nullified and the case is concluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">To the extent that <em>dicta </em>supports Dr. Golub\u2019s argument in favor of mandatory dismissal under the circumstances presented in this case, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Dr. Golub further argues that even accepting the assertions of Mrs. Spivey\u2019s attorneys that they did not receive copies of either the Notice of Rejection or the Notice of Action to Nullify Award,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> non-receipt of those notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>does not excuse the late filing of the declaration. In Dr. Golub\u2019s view, Mrs. Spivey\u2019s attorneys were charged with a continuing responsibility to keep abreast of developments at HCAO in Mrs. Spivey\u2019s case. We decline to impose such a duty. Once the health claims arbitration award was issued, Mrs. Spivey\u2019s attorneys were not required to check the HCAO docket to see whether a notice of rejection was filed. Nor could they be expected to check whether notice of an action to nullify had been filed in one of Maryland\u2019s circuit courts. Absent any such duty on the part of counsel, Mrs. Spivey\u2019s lack of notice as to Dr. Golub\u2019s action to nullify was properly considered by Judge Ward in excusing the late filing of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The second issue raised by Dr. Golub concerns the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Vacate Award. Unless it is vacated by the court, an award rendered by a health claims arbitration panel is admissible as evidence in a subsequent court action to nullify the award. If admissible, the award is presumed correct, and the burden is on the party rejecting it to prove that it is not correct. \u00a7 3-2A-06(d); Rule BY5. Section 3-2A-06(d) states that an arbitration award is admissible \u201c[ujnless vacated by the court pursuant to subsection (c).\u201d Subsection (c) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">An allegation that an award is improper because of any ground stated in \u00a7 3-223(b) or \u00a7 3-224(b)(l), (2), (3), or (4) of this article shall be made by preliminary motion, and shall be determined by the court without a jury prior to trial____ If the court finds that a condition stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00a7 3-224(b)(l), (2), (3), or (4) exists, it shall vacate the award, and trial of the case shall proceed as if there had been no award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In his motion to vacate, Dr. Golub relied on \u00a7 3-224(b)(4), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">The court shall vacate an award if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown for the postponement, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 3-213, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Dr. Golub contends that the arbitration panel, in granting Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion in limine precluding Dr. Golub from presenting expert testimony at the arbitration hearing, \u201crefused to hear evidence material to the controversy.\u201d Furthermore, Dr. Golub posits that the surprise caused by the granting of the motion in limine just prior to the scheduled start of the hearing constituted \u201csufficient cause\u201d for granting his requested postponement. We think the court was correct in denying Dr. Golub\u2019s Motion to Vacate Award. Dr. Golub\u2019s argument overlooks the arbitration panel\u2019s basis for granting Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion in limine. A deadline for naming experts had been established by the panel chairman in a scheduling order issued on February 17, 1983. That deadline was July 15, 1983. Dr. Golub not only failed to name any experts by that date, but he did not provide any names until the motion in limine was filed on September 9, 1983, at which point he sought to claim as his own the experts identified by the other two defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The panel chairman in a health claims arbitration proceeding has the authority to decide all prehearing procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>including issues relating to discovery. \u00a7 3-2A-05(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We believe exclusion of expert testimony on Dr. Golub\u2019s behalf was an appropriate sanction for Dr. Golub\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery deadline in the panel chairman\u2019s scheduling order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in denying Dr. Golub\u2019s Motion to Vacate Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Finally, we consider Dr. Golub\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in permitting prejudicial cross-examination of an expert witness called by Dr. Golub. Dr. Golub admitted at trial that he breached the standard of care in his treatment of Mrs. Spivey. Nevertheless, he disputed that this breach was the cause of any permanent damage to Mrs. Spivey. In support of that position, Dr. Golub offered the testimony of John H. Sadler, M.D., a nephrologist, who opined on direct examination that Mrs. Spivey suffered no deterioration in kidney function between the time of her visit to Dr. Golub in July 1979 and the discovery of her kidney infection in May 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Counsel for Mrs. Spivey commenced his cross-examination of Dr. Sadler by asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Could you explain to this jury why Dr. Golub has admitted that he violated acceptable standards of care in his interpretation of the x-rays of July 1979 that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>absolutely nothing wrong with that left kidney and everything was normal? Why did the Defendant admit he violated acceptable standards of care, could you possibly explain that to the jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Over objection, Dr. Sadler was permitted to respond to that question and subsequent questions concerning Dr. Golub\u2019s admission of liability in the case. Dr. Golub argues that allowing such testimony was prejudicial because Dr. Sadler was called to testify on the issue of causation rather than on the issue of liability, which Dr. Golub had already admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Traditionally, rulings concerning the scope of cross-examination have been left to the discretion of the trial court, to be disturbed only upon a showing of prejudicial abuse of that discretion. <em>Comm\u2019n on Medical Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 422, 435 A.2d 747 (1981); <em>Nottingham Village, Inc. v. Baltimore County, </em>266 Md. 339, 356, 292 A.2d 680 (1972). Following the objection by counsel for Dr. Golub to opposing counsel\u2019s first question to Dr. Sadler, the following colloquy occurred among the court, counsel for Mrs. Spivey (Mr. Ellin), and counsel for Dr. Golub (Mr. Mullin):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">MR. ELLIN: Your Honor, it would be absolutely prejudicial to permit this man to come up here and say everything is peachy and that means nothing is wrong, but at the same time, the Defendant having admitted liability, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. I mean, he in effect, has said Dr. Golub has not done anything Incorrect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">THE COURT: What you are asking the witness, as a result of an admission of liability about your client, you are asking the witness his opinion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">MR. ELLIN: To reconcile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">THE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">MR. MULLIN: He\u2019s already said that that is not a negative I.V.P. If he wanted to ask about that, that\u2019s fine, but to ask why Dr. Golub admitted liability is getting way beyond\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>MR. ELLIN: If Fm blocked, I would move that the so-called plea of liability is a farce to avoid getting into it. Now, either they are admitting liability or they are not. To admit liability and at the same time have somebody come in and imply there is no violation is skirting around\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">MR. MULLIN: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">MR. ELLIN: Well, you are doing that in objecting. I\u2019d like him to reconcile his testimony with Dr. Golub\u2019s stand in the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">MR. MULLIN: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">THE COURT: I think it is proper cross-examination, and your objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in that ruling by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\">.

Dr. Golub points out that the affidavit accompanying Mrs. Spivey\u2019s motion to set aside the order granting Dr. Golub's preliminary motions was not under oath, in noncompliance with Rule 1-304. No other affidavit was filed in support of counsel\u2019s contention that Dr. Golub's Notice of Rejection and Notice of Action to Nullify Award were not received. Relying on <em>Murnan v. Joseph J. Hock, Inc., </em>274 Md. 528, 531-32, 335 A.2d 104 (1975), Dr. Golub contends that absent a proper affidavit, counsel\u2019s mere assertion that the notices were not received was insufficient to rebut the presumption of service estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>lished by the certificates of service attached to the notices. <em>See </em>Rule 1-323. We disagree. We think the <em>Muman </em>holding is limited to its facts, which are distinguishable, and that under the circumstances here, it was within Judge Ward\u2019s discretion to accept the oral assertions of Mrs. Spivey\u2019s attorneys at the hearing before him that Dr. Golub\u2019s notices were not received. Therefore, any defect in counsel\u2019s affidavit is immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\">.
