The caller stated that the boys carried the equipment in a black leather bag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>and that they had a large radio with them. Police responded to the neighborhood of the store, located the youths and observed them for a short time. One of the four, later identified as appellant, Owen F. (Owen), carried a black leather bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">When approached by police officers, the youths ran. In short order, three of the four were stopped, patted down, and asked for identification. None of the boys had identification, and the goods had disappeared. When asked by Officer Troup to locate the bag, Owen pointed to a garage doorway a short distance away. An officer retrieved the bag and radio from that spot. Owen was then asked where he got the goods he had been carrying, but apparently made no response. Police handcuffed and transported the four boys to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Owen was taken to a room where an inventory was made of his personal possessions. Among the property inventoried was a University of New Mexico, class of 1943, ring. An officer placed the ring with the radio and camera equipment on the assumption that it might be stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Owen was handcuffed again and asked about his physical condition and educational background. It was established that he appeared sober, had a sixth grade education, could write, but had problems reading. The interrogating officer read Owen\u2019s Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights to him \u201cverbatim\u201d from a police form. The officer later testified what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxcN\">I said you don\u2019t have to tell me anything is what [the form] says. If you don\u2019t want to tell me anything, you don\u2019t have to tell me anything. I would like you to tell me. I think it is better that you tell me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The officer then asked Owen if he was willing to answer questions. Owen said yes, indicated that he did not want a lawyer and signed a form indicating that he' had been advised of and understood his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>When asked again where the goods had come from, Owen stated that they had been taken during a break-in committed by another boy. An officer expressed doubt. Owen recanted and admitted he had participated in the burglaries. Owen stated that the radio had been taken a few days before his arrest; the other items, the day of that arrest. He then agreed to take police to the burglarized houses. This interrogation was conducted by two officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">On the drive to the houses, Owen admitted he took the camera equipment, ring and other jewelry from one house and the radio from another. Police were sent to take fingerprints from both locations. Upon returning to the police station, Owen gave an inculpatory statement which an officer wrote down and Owen signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Owen\u2019s gesture to police (indicating the location of the stolen property), the stolen property, and Owen\u2019s statement at police headquarters were admitted into evidence against him during a hearing in the District Court of Maryland for Montgomery County, sitting as a juvenile court. The court found Owen delinquent and committed him to the Charles Hickey, Jr. School \u201cwith consideration for the Glen Mill School.\u201d This appeal followed; these issues are raised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">1. Whether evidence obtained on the day of Owen\u2019s arrest was acquired illegally and thus was inadmissible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">2. Whether the judge improperly excluded testimony from a victim concerning her ability to distinguish a photograph of her property from similar property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">3. Whether the judge erred in permitting a victim to testify that her husband had previously identified property found on Owen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">4. Whether Owen\u2019s disposition was illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">We shall address these issues in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">1. <em>Owen\u2019s Statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Appellant contends that his streetside gesture, which led to the discovery of the radio and camera equipment, and his stationhouse confession, were obtained illegally. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>basis of that contention, appellant argues that the court erred in admitting the gesture, the stolen goods, and the confession into evidence against him. The questions presented by this argument involve fundamental constitutional rights. Consequently, we are called to make an independent constitutional appraisal of the record. <em>See Davis v. North Carolina, </em>384 U.S. 737, 741-42, 86 S.Ct. 1761, 1764, 16 L.Ed.2d 895 (1966); <em>Parker v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 1, 10-11, 502 A.2d 510, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 70, 507 A.2d 184 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">(a) <em>Streetside Gesture (pointing to the bag)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Owen attacks on Fifth Amendment self-incrimination<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> grounds the admissibility of his gesture to Officer Troup indicating the location of the bag. Specifically, Owen argues that the gesture was obtained without the benefit of a <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We must first determine whether Owen was \u201cin custody\u201d when he signalled the location of the bag. While a mere investigatory stop will generally not constitute custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, if a suspect\u2019s freedom of action is curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest, the \u201cfull panoply of protections prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>\u201d must be afforded. <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984). We note that, in the case of a juvenile, courts are called to apply \u201ca wider definition of custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes.\u201d <em>In re Lucas F., </em>68 Md.App. 97, 103, 510 A.2d 270 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">In the case at bar, Owen got to the place of questioning by being caught during a police chase. That is, Officer Troup terminated Owen\u2019s briefly exercised freedom of movement. Once stopped, appellant was ordered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201cstand still.\u201d He and his friends were surrounded by at least four and perhaps six officers and asked for identification. Evidence offered later demonstrated that Owen had moved to America from Trinidad when he was approximately 10 years old. He was fourteen or fifteen at the time of this incident, spoke with an accent, had a sixth grade education, and a verbal I.Q. in the borderline range of 70. His educational skills were compared to those of a first or second grader. A psychologist opined at Owen\u2019s hearing that the boy would be \u201camenable, workable\u201d and \u201cimpressionable\u201d with an adult or authority figure. After being asked to locate the goods, Owen was handcuffed and driven to police headquarters. Applying the wider definition of custody afforded to juvenile cases, we conclude that a reasonable person under the circumstances outlined would not feel free to break off the questioning and that Owen\u2019s freedom of action was curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest. In short, Owen was in custody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Once Owen was in custody, police were obliged to inform him of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda. </em>Their failure to do so made his gesture <em>qua </em>admission inadmissible at the subsequent hearing. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 86 S.Ct. at 1628. Nevertheless, Officer Troup recounted the gesture, over counsel\u2019s objection, at Owen\u2019s hearing. The introduction of Owen\u2019s tainted body language, however, is not automatic grounds for reversal. If the introduction of that evidence is found to be harmless error, the conviction will stand. <em>See Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). That is, if the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of Owen\u2019s gesture in no way influenced the court\u2019s delinquency finding, the error in allowing the officer\u2019s testimony will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>be deemed harmless. <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665. Evidence obtained independently of the gesture and recounted by the court in announcing its finding shows that Owen was in possession of a University of New Mexico ring when taken into custody. .Ms. Sonia Stein testified at Owen\u2019s hearing that the ring had been stolen from her house the night before Owen\u2019s arrest. Appellant\u2019s possession of the ring the next day, then, would support the court\u2019s determination that he had participated in that burglary. <em>See Samuels v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 486, 493, 459 A.2d 213 (1983). Further, after his arrest, Owen admitted that he participated in both burglaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Fingerprints were taken and indicated that Owen had indeed been inside the burglared houses. The stationhouse admission and fingerprints were introduced at the hearing and were relied upon by the court in its finding. This evidence supports the court\u2019s delinquency determination and is not related to the tainted gesture. Therefore, the admission of Owen\u2019s gesture, though error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">We move now to consider whether evidence derived from the tainted gesture was improperly admitted against Owen.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">(b) <em>Camera Equipment and Radio</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Owen argues that the court erred in allowing the camera equipment and radio located by police into evidence. In addition to reasserting his Fifth Amendment challenge, Owen also contends that the introduction of this evidence violated his Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>We have indicated that Owen\u2019s streetside gesture was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>but that the admission of the gesture into evidence constituted harmless error. We must now ask whether the admission of evidence derived from the unwarned gesture violated Fifth Amendment guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Evidence derived from a confession obtained without the benefit of a <em>Miranda </em>warning is excluded, if at all, under a relatively narrow interpretation of the \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under that interpretation, a failure to provide the <em>Miranda </em>warning does not necessarily preclude the introduction of derivative evidence. Rather, that evidence is inadmissible only if the confession from which it was derived was coerced in violation of defendant\u2019s right to due process. <em>See Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). A confession is coerced for purposes of this inquiry if it results from \u201cphysical violence or other deliberate means calculated to break the suspect's will____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 105 S.Ct. at 1295. Clearly, then, obtaining a confession in violation of the <em>Miranda </em>rule does not automatically destroy the admissibility of evidence discovered by using the unwarned confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">In <em>Elstad, </em>the court considered the admissibility of a <em>second statement </em>by defendant derived from an earlier, unwarned, confession. Between statements, Elstad was read the <em>Miranda </em>litany. In holding the subsequent statement was admissible, the court relied, in part, on the interceding <em>Miranda </em>warning that allowed Elstad to exercise his free will. 470 U.S. at 308-309, 105 S.Ct. at 1293. Elstad\u2019s exercise of volition, then, washed part of the taint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>out of his later statement. In the case at bar, the derivative evidence consisted of inanimate objects. Therefore, no <em>Miranda </em>warning or act of free will preceded its discovery. The Supreme Court\u2019s partial reliance on the interceding act of free-will notwithstanding, we believe the holding in <em>Elstad </em>applies with equal force to cases in which an unwarned statement leads directly to the discovery of tangible, real evidence. This belief springs from the fact that the exclusionary rule, when enforced in the <em>Miranda </em>setting, is intended to avoid unreliable evidence borne of coercion and to deter police misconduct. In the case of tangible derivative evidence, the potential for untrustworthiness does not inhere in the article uncovered. Further, misconduct remains deterred with the knowledge that, if acquired through actual coercion, the derivative evidence is tainted. At least one decision has applied the <em>Elstad </em>rule to tangible derivative evidence. <em>See U.S. v. Cherry, </em>794 F.2d 201, 208 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Applying the rule in <em>Elstad, </em>we perceive no error in the court\u2019s allowing the camera equipment and radio into evidence against Owen. That evidence, derived from the un<em>Mirandized </em>gesture, was admissible absent some coercion, by police in obtaining the gesture. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 309, 105 S.Ct. at 1293. There is no indication that police applied any deliberate means calculated to break Owen\u2019s will in asking him to locate the bag. The gesture was surrendered upon a casual inquiry. Consequently, the presence of the derivative evidence among the proof against appellant violated no Fifth Amendment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Next, Owen argues that, when asked by police to locate the bag, he was under arrest without probable cause. Without probable cause, he continues, his warrantless arrest was illegal and evidence seized thereafter (the camera equipment and radio) was inadmissible. While searches and seizures incident to an illegal arrest are necessarily unreasonable, <em>Stanley v. State, </em>230 Md. 188, 192-93, 186 A.2d 478 (1962), and no evidence secured from'such a search and seizure may be introduced into evidence, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), this rule of exclusion offers no solace to appellant. Owen abandoned the radio and camera equipment while being chased. With that abandonment, appellant left behind whatever Fourth Amendment protection he may have had against the seizure of those goods. <em>See Wynn v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 536, 541-42, 518 A.2d 1072 (1987). The record simply fails to support Owen\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The camera equipment and radio were properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">(c) <em>Stationhouse Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Owen also argues that statements he made to police at the station were not knowingly or voluntarily made and thus were inadmissible. Appellant supports his assertion of involuntariness on three legs: expert testimony demonstrated that he was incapable of making a valid waiver; he was never told that he had a right to wait until his parents arrived to speak to police; and the police offered improper inducements to get him to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Dr. Poireer, a psychologist, was permitted to testify as an expert as to Owen\u2019s ability to comprehend the <em>Miranda </em>warnings read to him at the stationhouse. Appellant points to the following testimony in arguing that he was incapable of comprehending <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">[Dr. Poireer]: If you ask me did Owen understand each and every aspect of what was being said to him when he was Mirandized I would have to say that there is a question in my mind if he understood each and every aspect of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Later, however, the witness testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">Q. But is it in your opinion does Owen have intellectual capacity if someone asks him, Owen you don\u2019t have to talk to me, would he have the intellectual capacity to understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">A. I would say yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Dr. Poireer\u2019s opinion that Owen would understand someone who told him, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to talk to me,\u201d was enough to overcome the probative value of the question he raised but did not answer to any degree of certainty, about whether Owen understood \u201ceach and every aspect of [his <em>Miranda </em>warning].\u201d Appellant exaggerates the import of Poireer\u2019s reservations. The totality of Dr. Poireer\u2019s testimony was enough \u201cto demonstrate to the trial judge that [Owen] had the mental capacity to comprehend the significance of <em>Miranda </em>and the rights waived____\u201d <em>In re Lucas F., </em>68 Md.App. at 104, 510 A.2d 270. The State, having established Owen\u2019s capacity to comprehend <em>Miranda </em>and the rights waived, was not also required to demonstrate that Owen received counseling and guidance from his parents in order to establish the validity of his waiver. <em>See Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Officer McFee testifed that he told Owen, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell me anything, you don\u2019t have to tell me anything. I would like you to tell me. I think it is better that you tell me.\u201d The rule articulated in <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), is unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">[U]nder Maryland criminal law, independent of any federal constitutional requirement, if an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declaration will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7E\">286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d 415. Unfortunately, appellant never raised the issue of inducement at the hearing in his efforts to exclude his stationhouse statements from evidence. The issue, therefore, has not been preserved for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>review. Rule 1085; <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>279 Md. 255, 368 A.2d 468 (1977). Even had the issue been preserved, we do not believe Officer McFee\u2019s statement, \u201cIt is better that you tell me\u201d implied that it would be to Owen\u2019s advantage to make an inculpatory statement, in that Owen would be given help or some special advantage. McFee did not say in what way or for what reason it would be better for Owen to talk. <em>Cf., In re Lucas F., supra </em>(suspect told, \u201cnow was the time to tell me [about the assault] <em>so that there would be no problem later </em>if [victim] recalled a different account of the incident\u201d) (emphasis added). Nor did appellant establish that his inculpatory statements were made in reliance on McFee's words. Indeed, after recounting those words, McFee testified, <em>\u201cafter a while in talking to [Owen], </em>he did tell a story.\u201d (Emphasis added). Owen\u2019s inculpatory statements, then, were made without compelling proximity to McFee\u2019s relatively innocuous comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Appellant\u2019s stationhouse statements were properly admitted against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">2. <em>Victim\u2019s Photographic Identification of Stolen Property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">At the hearing Sonia Stein identified camera equipment and jewelry portrayed in several photographs as property belonging to her and her husband. Stein testified that the property had been stolen from her on March 19, 1986. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Ms. Stein \u201cif I showed you another camera just like that, you wouldn\u2019t know if it was your husband\u2019s or not would you?\u201d <em>Sua sponte, </em>the court ruled, \u201csustained,\u201d though no objection was before it. The witness then admitted she could not distinguish a photograph of her property from one of similar property. The State did not move to strike this response. The witness went on to testify again that the photographs portrayed her stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">On appeal, appellant argues that \u201ccounsel should have been allowed to ask Sonia Stein if she could distinguish between photographs of her own and similar property.\u201d The transcript clearly shows that counsel was permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ask and the witness to answer that question. Indeed, Stein\u2019s answer was beneficial to the appellant. Thus, if the <em>sua sponte </em>ruling was erroneous, it was harmless error. Appellant overstated the value of his query when he argued that the question would \u201craise the possibility of a misidentification ... [and] might have raised a question as to appellant\u2019s possession of the fruits of a crime.\u201d On direct examination and without objection, the witness positively identified the property in the photograph. This, she repeated on cross-examination. Her admission during cross-examination that, <em>if shown a photograph of similar property, </em>she would be unable to distinguish it from a photograph of her own property, went merely to the weight of her earlier and later testimony that the photographed property belonged to her. The court was apparently satisfied with the reliability of Ms. Stein\u2019s photographic identification. Counsel\u2019s cross-examination did not have the effect desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">3. <em>Victim\u2019s Testimony that Husband Identified Stolen Property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Appellant next asserts that the trial court erred in permitting Sonia Stein to testify that her husband had identified the stolen property before the hearing. Owen argues that this testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj1\">Ms. Stein testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">COURT: And that the ring that you have and the bracelet that happens to be here together with the picture is your property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">A: Yes. I mean my husband went to the police station to identify and he had the paperworks and different cameras____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">MS. HARVEY: Objection Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">COURT: You may continue ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">A: And different cameras and lenses that had the ... the paperwork for it to prove that it was ours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">COURT: That is pretty nice to do. You had (unclear word) do that. Any other questions of this witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>MS. HARVEY: No sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Hearsay testimony is an out-of-court statement offered in court as an assertion to show the truth of matters asserted therein. <em>See Casper v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 576, 587 n. 9, 521 A.2d 1281 (1987). Appellant\u2019s objection interrupted the statement assigned as hearsay. The court instructed the witness to continue, thereby denying the objection. Ms. Stein finished her statement but appellant did not reassert his objection or move to strike the response. Thus, appellant\u2019s hearsay objection was waived. <em>See </em>E. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 52 (3rd ed. 1984) at 131-132. In any event, Stein\u2019s testimony merely indicated that her husband went to the station to identify the goods. Assuming, arguendo, that her husband\u2019s actions amounted to an out-of-court assertion of ownership, this testimony was merely cumulative to the witness\u2019s own, in-court, identification of the property. Under those circumstances, its admission, if error, was harmless error. <em>See Dorsey v. State, supra, </em>276 Md. at 652-53, 350 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">4. <em>Disposition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Finally, appellant contends that, because his disposition occurred before July 1, 1986, the court was without authority to commit him to a particular institution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Juvenile courts are authorized to make a disposition after a child has been found delinquent. Md.Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud.Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 3-820 (1984 Repl.Vol.). The law in effect at the time of Owen\u2019s disposition provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">In making a disposition on a petition, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Commit the child to the custody or under the guardianship of the Juvenile Services Administration, a local department of social services, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, <em>or a public or licensed private </em>agency____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-820(c)(2) (emphasis added). Clearly, then, the court below was authorized to commit Owen to a particular agency. Here, the court committed him to the Charles Hickey, Jr. School with consideration for the Glen Mill School. Appellant does not contend that either of those institutions is not a public or licensed private agency as contemplated by the statute. We have observed that section 3-820 empowers the court to commit a child to such an agency but does not confer upon the court authority to control the commitment or to mandate the specific terms of the commitment. <em>In re George G., </em>64 Md.App. 70, 82, 494 A.2d 247 (1985). <em>But see </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-820(c)(1)(ii) (1986 Cum.Supp.). In the commitment <em>sub judice, </em>the court neither kept control nor mandated the terms of Owen\u2019s commitment. Therefore, we perceive no illegality in appellant\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), guarantees that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. We are aware that, in considering Owen\u2019s education, age, nationality, intelligence and psychological traits, we have introduced subjective elements into the custody inquiry. We believe such considerations are proper under the \"wider definition\u2019\u2019 to be afforded that term in juvenile cases. <em>See In re Lucas F., supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">. This confession survives Owen\u2019s constitutional challenge <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b712-9\">. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), reads in pertinent part, \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">. The fruits doctrine maintains that \"evidence derived from information acquired by police officials through unlawful means is not admissible in a criminal prosecution\u201d and is an extension of the exclusionary rule mentioned, <em>supra, </em>in assessing appellant\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of his gesture to Officer Troup. Whitebread and Slobogin, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 2.04 (2d. ed.) at 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">. We also reject the suggestion that the police were required to inform Owen that he was entitled to wait until his parents arrived before making a statement. While the absence of parental guidance goes to the question of voluntariness of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver in juvenile cases, <em>see In re Lucas F., </em>68 Md.App. at 104, 510 A.2d 270, police are not required to inform a juvenile that he has a right to speak to his parents as part of the <em>Miranda </em>litany.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b719-10\">. An amendment to the juvenile commitment statute, effective July 1, 1986, gives the court authority to commit a juvenile \"on terms that the court considers appropriate to meet the priorities [set forth in the statute]\u201d Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3\u2014820(c)(1)(ii) (1986 Cum. Supp.). Though not articulated in appellant\u2019s brief, we assume that the significance of July 1, 1986 derives from this amendment. We express no opinion on the effect of this amendment on the commitment powers of juvenile courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
