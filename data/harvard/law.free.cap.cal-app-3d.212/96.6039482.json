In affirming a summary judgment and two trial court sanction orders, we write what should be the final chapter of the unsuccessful efforts of a disbarred lawyer to avoid paying fees for valuable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>legal services rendered to him. As two of the five appeals were frivolous and were clearly motivated by an intent to delay and harass the respondent and, in the process, imposed a significant burden on this court, we impose substantial sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Defendant/appellant Jerome B. Rosenthal (Rosenthal) appeals from a summary judgment entered on February 16, 1988, awarding $167,238.14, plus $37,066.03 interest and costs to plaintiff/respondent J.M. Young, the assignee of the law firm Cooper, Epstein &amp; Hurewitz (CEH).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Case No. B033315.) Rosenthal also appeals from the orders of November 20, 1986 (November 20 Order) and December 16, 1986 (December 16 Order) awarding monetary sanctions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Case No. B025896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Three other appeals, which also relate to the same discovery dispute which is the subject of Case No. B025896, have been filed by Rosenthal\u2019s former attorneys, Oring, Margolese &amp; Schulte (OMS). (Consolidated Case No. B024983.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Case Nos. B024983<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and B026834, OMS appeals from the November 20 Order and the December 16 Order which imposed the sanctions which are also the subject of Rosenthal\u2019s appeal in Case No. B025896. In the third appeal, Case No. B026937, OMS appeals from the order of March 9, 1987, in which the trial court refused to require Rosenthal to reimburse OMS for any attorneys\u2019 fees sanctions they may have paid pursuant to the trial court orders which are the subject of Case Nos. B024983 and B026834.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Finally, in Case Nos. B033315 and B025896, CEH has requested that attorneys\u2019 fees plus costs be awarded to them as sanctions against Rosenthal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>and his attorney on appeal for bringing \u201cfrivolous, meritless and completely unsupported\u201d appeals. In consolidated Case No. B024983, CEH has also requested that OMS pay CEH\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees for \u201cfrivolous appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Because all of these appeals share the same factual background we have determined, in the interest of judicial economy, to dispose of them in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The facts upon which these appeals turn are either undisputed or unchallenged on appeal (see fn. 15, post) and were, in any event, determined in three different trial court proceedings upon conflicting declarations. (See <em>Kroopf </em>v. <em>Guffey </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1351, 1356 [228 Cal.Rptr. 807].)  In accordance with the usual rules on appeal, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the respondent. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 278, pp. 289-291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">In November 1983, Rosenthal, a former attorney,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> retained CEH to represent him in a number of actions, all of which related to his law practice. By January of 1986 Rosenthal owed CEH $164,343.35 for services rendered on his behalf. Rosenthal refused to pay and on January 22, 1986, CEH filed a complaint for money ((1) open book account; (2) account stated; (3) work, labor and services; and (4) breach of contract). Rosenthal hired the law firm of OMS to represent him, and on February 21, 1986, filed (but did not serve) a cross-complaint against CEH<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seeking recovery of approximately $70,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees paid CEH, as well as general damages of $6 million and punitive damages of $30 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">On February 12, 1986, CEH served a request for identification and production of documents. Rosenthal was asked to produce the original docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ments (or, if unavailable, then legible copies) at CEH\u2019s office. However, Rosenthal instead produced copies which in large measure were illegible. In addition, the copies were cropped off portions of the original documents, they were not properly identified, and documents known to be in Rosenthal\u2019s possession were not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On February 18, 1986, a second request for identification and production of documents was served upon Rosenthal. In addition, CEH served interrogatories and a set of requests for admission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On February 28, 1986, Rosenthal was served with a third request for identification and production of documents, together with a second set of interrogatories and a second set of requests for admission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Rosenthal refused to answer the interrogatories, objecting to the form of the questions. He also objected to the request for documents. All of CEH\u2019s attempts to resolve the matter out of court were unsuccessful. On March 6, 1986, CEH served another document request for identification and production of all documents which Rosenthal received from, or made in, the offices of CEH. These documents were neither identified nor produced. Finally in a letter dated March 19, 1986, Margolese (she and Schulte were the OMS partners who represented Rosenthal in this matter) stated that she would be \u201chappy to produce all the documents in both mine or Mr. Rosenthal\u2019s possession\u201d at Rosenthal\u2019s deposition which had been set for March 27. This echoed a similar promise made in a letter written by Margolese on March 10, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">On March 20 and 24, 1986, Rosenthal served unverified supplemental responses to the various requests for documents. The response on the 24th contained no identification but stated that, \u201cas indicated in attorney\u2019s letter of March 10, 1986 . . . [Rosenthal] is willing and will provide ALL documents in his possession and will bring them to [his] deposition and/or will make them available for photocopyong [sic] in their entirety prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>deposition.\u201d However, no arrangements were made for copying before the deposition and nothing was produced at Rosenthal\u2019s deposition on the morning of March 27. It was first promised that they would be delivered that afternoon; however, Schulte later telephoned CEH and said he would not produce the documents until the following Monday. On Monday he called and said he was \u201creneging\u201d and would not deliver the documents to CEH\u2019s offices \u201cever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Rosenthal\u2019s deposition, which was to begin on March 27 and continue from day to day, was adjourned after only two hours because Rosenthal claimed he had a dental appointment. He also stated that he would not return for the resumption of his deposition the next day or even the next week.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Because of Rosenthal\u2019s refusals to produce the requested documents or return for his deposition, CEH was placed in a position of losing its priority in discovery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, on April 10, 1986, CEH telephoned Schulte and notified him that they were going to make an ex parte application seeking various relief regarding the priority of discovery. To avoid the ex parte hearing, Schulte agreed to extend CEH\u2019s time to respond until 10 days after the completion of Rosenthal\u2019s deposition. Schulte also promised to produce the requested documents at Rosenthal\u2019s deposition. On April 16, 1986, this agreement was repudiated and CEH then sought a protective order. In addition, due to Rosenthal\u2019s continual discovery violations, CEH filed a number of discovery motions, including (1) a motion to compel further responses to the combined first set of interrogatories and requests for admission, (2) a motion to compel further responses to the second set of interrogatories and requests for admission, and (3) a request for sanctions against Rosenthal and his attorneys for their \u201cwillful and deliberate refusal to cooperate in discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">On May 29, 1986, Judge Cardenas ordered all counsel to meet and confer in an effort to resolve their discovery disputes and deferred his ruling on CEH\u2019s motions until June 4, 1986. This date was continued at the request of the parties and, on June 5, 1986, the parties presented to the court a Stipulation to Resolve Discovery Disputes and Order (Stipulation). The Stipulation was signed by Schulte, as attorney for Rosenthal. It provided that (1) CEH would revise its interrogatories and requests for admission, (2) Rosenthal would comply with the different requests by certain dates, and (3) Rosenthal would appear for his deposition on July 8, 1986. It also provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that it would become effective when the court signed the order attached to the Stipulation. The court signed that order on June 5, 1986 (June 5 Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Pursuant to the Stipulation and the June 5 Order, CEH served Rosenthal with the revised interrogatories and requests for admission. In response, and in apparent recognition of his obligations under the June 5 Order, Rosenthal submitted numerous papers to CEH and to the court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, Rosenthal refused to answer all the interrogatories by July 2nd, the date specified in the June 5 Order. He further refused to recognize CEH\u2019s continued priority even though his deposition was delayed, and CEH was forced to obtain an additional order on July 3d maintaining discovery priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In response to Rosenthal\u2019s failure to answer the interrogatories as required by the June 5 Order, CEH sent a letter on June 25, 1986, to Margolese which stated in part: \u201cOn June 6 I went to the trouble of alerting you of the deadlines, and the urgency of meeting those deadlines. Not until this week did you express any difficulty in complying, [fl] When we met. . . two days ago, Mr. Schulte and you told me that Mr. Rosenthal had been dictating responses . . . . I do not accept that there is any good cause why partial responses could not be given before the end of this week; nonetheless, I have conditionally relented that position as the enclosed Stipulation shows. [H] If I am to receive inadequate responses, I should be in a position to move forward with respect thereto as soon as possible rather than delaying the ultimate. Delay is prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys rejected the proposed stipulation that CEH had enclosed with their letter and refused to discuss it. Instead they unsuccessfully sought a court order to extend the deadline, expressly representing that the first set of answers had been completed in draft form on June 25. However, by August 1, 1986, Rosenthal still had not answered any of the interrogatories which had been originally served the previous February.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As to Rosenthal\u2019s deposition, the June 5 Order provided that he was to appear on July 8, 1986, at CEH\u2019s offices and the deposition was to continue from day to day until finished. Although Rosenthal appeared during the morning of July 8, he never reappeared after the lunch hour, claiming illness. Thereafter, he further refused to appear on any subsequent day.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Rosenthal also failed to produce the requested documents as required by the June 5 Order. At his deposition on July 8, Rosenthal at first misrepresented the fact that a group of papers consisted of \u201coriginals\u201d when in fact all of the papers to which he referred were \u201cphotocopies.\u201d When he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>acknowledge that the papers presented were not originals he then refused to allow them to be marked as exhibits. After much discussion on the record, Rosenthal finally produced the originals of the requested documents but still refused to allow them or the copies to be attached as exhibits to his deposition. CEH advised him numerous times of his violations and requested that he cure the various defects. This Rosenthal continually refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Due to the repeated violations of the June 5 Order by Rosenthal, CEH, on August 14, 1986, served and filed a Notice of Motion to Strike Answer, Render Judgment for Plaintiff, Dismiss Cross-Complaint, and for other relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034 and for attorneys\u2019 fees against both Rosenthal and his attorneys. In the alternative, CEH asked \u201cfor orders set forth in the Proposed Alternative Order separately filed and served concurrently herewith.\u201d Rosenthal opposed the motion and served answers to the first set of interrogatories.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On August 29, 1986, the court refused to strike Rosenthal\u2019s answer but decided on lesser sanctions. The court then signed the alternative order (August 29 Order), with modifications, specifically finding that Rosenthal had willfully failed to answer interrogatories, appear for his deposition and identify or produce documents and permit documents to be marked as exhibits at his deposition. The court further found that Rosenthal and his attorneys were guilty of \u201cbad faith action and tactics that [were] frivolous and solely intended to cause unnecessary delay\u201d and awarded attorneys\u2019 fees of $23,030 to CEH. The court also found that Rosenthal failed to comply with the June 5 Order which it held was an order made under section 2034, subdivision (a). Finally, and most significantly, the August 29 Order (1) provided that certain facts be deemed established in accordance with the claims of CEH and (2) placed severe evidentiary limitations at trial on Rosenthal. In short, it was directly responsive to the discovery violations which Rosenthal had committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On September 8, 1986, Rosenthal served and filed a motion for reconsideration of the August 29 Order. On October 15, 1986, he filed a motion to vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order. These motions reargued everything that had been raised in Rosenthal\u2019s opposition to the August 29 Order and, in addition, falsely accused counsel for CEH of fraud and deceit in connection with the execution of the Stipulation (see fn. 24, <em>post). </em>On November 20, 1986, Judge Cardenas found that the motion to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Stipulation and the June 5 Order was \u201cbrought in bad faith\u201d and was \u201ctotally and completely without merit.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court then awarded CEH fees in the amount of $14,500 to be paid by Rosenthal and Schulte \u201cjointly and severally.\u201d Thereafter, Rosenthal took off calendar the motion for reconsideration filed on September 8, 1986. However, CEH did not withdraw its request for sanctions. That request came before Judge Ross on December 16, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"As_p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>On that date, Judge Ross found that the moving papers seeking reconsideration filed by Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys were \u201cfalse,\u201d were known to be false at the time of filing, were made in bad faith \u201cwithout substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>justification\u201d and that their actions were \u201cfrivolous,\u201d in \u201cbad faith,\u201d and \u201csolely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court awarded CEH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>fees of $13,401 against Rosenthal, OMS, and the individual partners, Oring, Margolese, and Schulte.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Thereafter, Rosenthal filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to set aside the August 29 Order. This motion was summarily denied and his petition for review in the Supreme Court was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">On January 6, 1987, OMS\u2019s motion to withdraw as Rosenthal\u2019s counsel was granted. Thereafter, OMS moved for contribution from Rosenthal with respect to the sanctions which had been imposed on November 20 and December 16, 1986 (see fn. <em>25, post). </em>This motion was denied on March 9, 1987. On October 15, 1987, CEH filed a motion for summary judgment based on declarations and the evidentiary limitations imposed on Rosenthal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>by the August 29 Order. The motion was granted on December 21, 1987, and judgment was entered on February 16, 1988, awarding CEH $167,238.14 plus $37,066.03 in interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">1. <em>Summary Judgment (Case No. B033315) : </em>Rosenthal contends that (1) the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the August 29 Order; therefore the summary judgment which was based upon that order should be reversed; (2) the Stipulation and the June 5 Order (and hence, the August 29 Order and the summary judgment which were based thereon) should be set aside because (a) the Stipulation was improper in that his then attorney had no authority to agree to issuance of a court order requiring performance of the Stipulation and (b) the resulting June 5 Order ultimately led to severe penalties following its violation, effectively amounting to a judgment against him; thus, his substantial rights were impaired \u201cwithout his knowledge or consent\u201d; and (3) the court erred in imposing $23,030 monetary sanctions against him as part of the August 29 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">2. <em>Post-August 29 Sanctions Against Rosenthal (Case No. B025896) : </em>Rosenthal contends that the trial court erred in imposing sanctions against him for bringing the motion to vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order and the motion to reconsider the August 29 Order. He argues that (1) if the August 29 Order and the Stipulation and the June 5 Order fall, then so must the sanctions; (2) even if sanctions were justified, they should have been imposed <em>solely </em>against his counsel, Schulte; and (3) even if sanctions were proper against him, the court (Judge Cardenas), in its award of sanctions included in the November 20 Order, failed to comply with the statutory requirement of detailing in writing the conduct or circumstances on which the sanctions were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">3. <em>Sanctions Against OMS (Consolidated Case No. B024983) </em>: OMS contends, with respect to Case Nos. B024983 and B026834, that (1) \u201cCounsel should not be placed in the position of making a decision to forego an obligation to a client to pursue diligently any possible meritorious motions on a unilateral decision that a particular motion may be considered by the judicial system to be \u2018frivolous\u2019 \u201d; (2) Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 denies counsel the opportunity to be heard when the attomey/client privilege prevents counsel from exonerating themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">With respect to Case No. B026937, OMS further contends that Code of Civil Procedure sections 882 and 883 apply to all joint and several money judgments including those awarded against an attorney and his client under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We commence our consideration of these issues by noting that all parties agree that the standard of review is abuse of discretion. Rosenthal complains that discovery sanctions imposed by the August 29 Order were improper. The validity of those sanctions, which ultimately led to the entry of a summary judgment against Rosenthal on February 16, 1988, was at the heart of the dispute in the trial court and is critical to four of the five appeals before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">It is settled that \u201cThe power to impose discovery sanctions is a broad discretion subject to reversal only for arbitrary, capricious or whimsical action. [Citations.] Only two facts are absolutely prerequisite to imposition of the sanction: (1) there must be a failure to comply [with a valid discovery order] . . . and (2) the failure must be wilful (Code of Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034, subd. (d)).\u201d <em>(Calvert Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cropper </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 901, 904 [190 Cal.Rptr. 593].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Where those facts are found by the trial court to be true, such findings are entitled to deference on appeal. <em>(Flynn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 491, 496 [152 Cal.Rptr. 796]; <em>Cornwall </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Diary Co. </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253 [135 Cal.Rptr. 761].) The rule is the same even though the facts are established, as they were here, by declarations in support of a motion. <em>(Kroopf v. Guffey, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d at p. 1356.)  This is particularly true where, as in this case, such findings are not even challenged by the appellants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In any event, in \u201cthe final analysis, the test on appeal is whether the lower court abused its discretion, and each case must be decided on its own facts, with the appellant having the burden of showing an abuse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Scherrer </em>v. <em>Plaza Marina Coml. Corp. </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 520, 524 [94 Cal.Rptr. 85].) \u201cA trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will be upheld if it is based on a \u2018reasoned judgment\u2019 and complies with the \u2018. . . legal principles and policies appropriate to the particular matter at issue.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bull\u00eds </em>v. <em>Security Pac. Nat. Bank </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 801, 815 [148 Cal.Rptr. 22, 582 P.2d 109, 7 A.L.R.4th 642].) The same standards, of course, also apply to the appeals by Rosenthal and OMS from the sanctions imposed by the November 20 Order and the December 16 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">1. <em>Summary Judgment (Case No. B033315)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Rosenthal, in his appeal from the summary judgment, limits his attack on that judgment to three rulings by the trial court which he contends constituted an abuse of discretion. First, the issuance of the August 29 Order; second, the issuance of the June 5 Order (pursuant to the Stipulation); and, third, the award of sanctions as part of the August 29 Order. We discuss them in chronological order and find each to be without merit. Thus, we affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">a. <em>June 5, 1986, Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Rosenthal asserts that the Stipulation and the June 5 Order (and the August 29 Order and summary judgment which ultimately followed and were based thereon) should be set aside \u201cbecause it was an improper stipulation\u201d by his attorney which impaired his \u201csubstantial rights without his knowledge or consent.\u201d He argues that he \u201cnever saw the Stipulation prior to its entry and neither knew nor consented to making the Stipulation into an order which could (and did) impair his right to defend the action on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">However the record shows, as expressly found by both Judge Cardenas in his November 20 Order (see fn. 13, <em>ante) </em>and Judge Ross in his December 16 Order (see fn. 14, <em>ante), </em>that Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys had the actual and apparent authority on his behalf to enter into stipulations to resolve discovery disputes and that Schulte was acting within his authority as Rosenthal\u2019s attorney of record when he executed the Stipulation. At the time that Judge Cardenas ordered counsel to meet and confer on May 29, 1986, Rosenthal\u2019s attorney, apparently in order to avoid subjecting Rosenthal to a substantial risk of sanctions, decided to conclude the best terms he could reach with opposing counsel by entering into the Stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">In <em>Linsk </em>v. <em>Linsk </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 272, 276-278 [74 Cal.Rptr. 544, 449 P.2d 760], the court held that an attorney has the \u201c \u2018authority to enter into stipulations and agreements in all matters of procedure during the progress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>of the trial.\u2019 . . . [1[] If counsel merely employs his best discretion in protecting the client\u2019s rights and achieving the client\u2019s fundamental goals, his authority to proceed in any appropriate manner has been unquestioned. On the other hand, if counsel abdicates a substantial right of the client contrary to express instructions, he exceeds his authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Here, Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys, in agreeing to the Stipulation, did not \u201crelinquish a substantive right\u201d and were acting well within their authority as his attorneys of record. They had an obligation to the court to resolve, on their own if possible, the discovery differences and they had an obligation to Rosenthal to prevent the imposition against him of costly sanctions. Certainly, the record does not suggest that Schulte signed the Stipulation \u201ccontrary to express instructions.\u201d Indeed, there is no claim that any term of the Stipulation was improper or unfair to Rosenthal. In fact, his only objection to the Stipulation is its acceptance of the very reasonable condition insisted on by CEH that it be approved and enforced by a court order. By the agreement that the Stipulation could be so enforced, Rosenthal\u2019s counsel did nothing more than agree to a routine and commonly accepted matter of procedure which was necessary or incidental to the management of the suit. This, Schulte clearly had the authority to do. <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1936) 12 Cal.App.2d 22, 28 [54 P.2d 1118].) That the resulting June 5 Order ultimately led to \u201cdeath knell\u201d sanctions and entry of a summary judgment against Rosenthal was due to his willful violations of its terms, not the fact that an order was agreed to or made.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Rosenthal does not cite one relevant authority to support his contentions on this issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If we were to give any credence to his argument, trial courts would no longer have the ability to resolve discovery disputes by any means other than formal, fully contested motions. The whole process of issuing \u201cmeet and confer\u201d orders<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and requiring the parties to resolve their discovery differences by agreement rather than by expensive and time-consuming motions would be undermined. Every dispute would have to be fully litigated. We can think of no reason whatever why such a result would be desirable. The negotiated resolution of such disputes is critical to the efficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>management of crowded law and motion calendars. Of necessity, both the court and the opposing litigants must be able to rely upon the validity of stipulated resolutions of discovery disputes and to have them enforceable by order.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Finally, the record shows that Rosenthal himself ratified the Stipulation by his subsequent conduct. <em>(See Navrides </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 698 [97 Cal.Rptr. 309, 488 P.2d 637, 49 A.L.R.3d 828].) At no time did he attempt to discharge his attorneys on the basis that their execution of the Stipulation was beyond their authority, and he did not communicate any objections to it during the months of June, July, or August of 1986. In addition, he submitted numerous papers to CEH and to the court acknowledging the Stipulation and the June 5 Order,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and he did not attempt to vacate that order until <em>after </em>Judge Ross had issued the August 29 Order. It is apparent that Rosenthal\u2019s conduct was such that CEH was entitled to and did rely on both the Stipulation and the June 5 Order. Consequently, Rosenthal is in no position to even claim that his counsel did not have the authority to enter into the Stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The June 5 Order was issued pursuant to the Stipulation. Having agreed to comply with the discovery commitments set forth in that order, Rosenthal cannot now complain as to its terms or be heard to argue that CEH\u2019s discovery was \u201cmassive and complex\u201d and \u201cdemanding\u201d and \u201cdetailed.\u201d Nor can he now argue that the June 5 Order was made without subjecting the discovery commitments contained in the Stipulation to \u201cjudicial scrutiny.\u201d The very purpose of an order to meet and confer is to obtain a negotiated resolution of a discovery dispute without having to expend judicial time to sort out which party is correct and what relief should be granted. What the court seeks is an agreement by the parties which resolves the dispute. There is no requirement that the court thereafter conduct any in depth review of such agreement or make any independent inquiry into its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We conclude that Rosenthal is bound by the Stipulation, and the June 5 Order was properly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>b. <em>August 29, 1986, Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Rosenthal contends that the trial court abused its discretion in \u201ccondoning and in fact rewarding\u201d CEH\u2019s actions in pursuing \u201cdiscovery not as a fact-finding device, but as a short-cut to a judgment other than on the merits\u201d by issuing the August 29 Order which ultimately resulted in the summary judgment. Again, Rosenthal is attempting to relitigate the merits of CEH\u2019s methods of discovery by arguing that its volume and complexity was \u201ctotally unnecessary\u201d and \u201cout of all proportion\u201d to a \u201clegitimate fact-finding objective.\u201d As already explained, this argument is substantially undercut by the Stipulation and the June 5 Order in which Rosenthal, by and through his counsel, expressly agreed to all such discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In addition, the record clearly establishes that Rosenthal violated the June 5 Order not only by refusing to cooperate with the taking of his deposition but also by repeatedly failing to answer interrogatories or produce requested documents. In response to these numerous violations, CEH filed the August 14 motion seeking relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivisions (b)(2) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In his August 29 Order, after the hearing on CEH\u2019s motion, Judge Ross made a number of important findings of fact, none of which is here disputed by Rosenthal. Judge Ross expressly found that \u201cRosenthal refused to obey the Order of this Court dated June 5, 1986 made under \u00a7 2034 (a) in that he violated 1\u00a1]\u00a1 2, 2.3, 3 and 4 of said Order in refusing to identify documents and produce documents in the manner therein called for, in refusing to permit documents to be marked as exhibits at his deposition, in refusing to attend his deposition, and in refusing to answer interrogatories, respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Judge Ross also found \u201cthat Rosenthal willfully failed to appear for the taking of his deposition and willfully failed to answer interrogatories.\u201d He finally concluded \u201cthat the above-stated conduct and Rosenthal\u2019s and Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys\u2019 attempt to avoid the requirements of the June 5, 1986 Order by making an improper ex parte application and a motion (filed herein June, 1986) and [their] forcing Plaintiff to obtain ex parte Order of July 3, 1986 in order to maintain discovery priority granted under June 5, 1986 Order, each constitute bad faith action and tactics that are frivolous and solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, and the positions taken . . . in such regards are totally without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Discovery sanctions \u201cshould be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.\u201d <em>(Deyo </em>v. <em>Kilbourne </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>771, 793 [149 Cal.Rptr. 499].)  Here, the Court granted relief which was specifically related to each violation by Rosenthal of the June 5 Order. For example, since Rosenthal had willfully failed to answer interrogatories, the facts solicited by those interrogatories were deemed established against Rosenthal. He had refused to properly identify and produce documents, therefore, the court ordered that he was precluded from using the requested documents. He had refused to allow his deposition to go forward, therefore, it was specifically ordered that Rosenthal could not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Considering Rosenthal\u2019s repeated and flagrant violations of the June 5 Order, it cannot be said the sanctions imposed by the court were unwarranted or too harsh. Rosenthal was aware of the potential consequences of his violations of that order and clearly, \u201crepeated warnings would have been futile.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (See <em>County of El Dorado </em>v. <em>Schneider </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1263, 1277 [237 Cal.Rptr. 51].) However severe their ultimate consequences, these sanctions were an appropriate response to Rosenthal\u2019s repeated and willful violations of a valid court order. A trial court in circumstances such as these, is not required to further tolerate such behavior. There was clearly no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">c. <em>Monetary Sanctions Imposed on August 29, 1986</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Rosenthal contends that the award of $23,030 attorney fee sanctions was an abuse of discretion and \u201cexcessive.\u201d He argues that his discovery violations were neither substantial nor willful; therefore, it was error to impose such sanctions against him. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>Rosenthal\u2019s violations were both numerous and substantial, as well as willful. The court specifically found that Rosenthal \u2019\u2019willfully failed to appear for the taking of his deposition and willfully failed to answer interrogatories\u201d; that he and his attorneys attempted to avoid the requirements of the June 5 Order by making \u201can improper ex parte application and a motion\u201d and he and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>attorney forced CEH to obtain an ex parte order to maintain discovery priority; and that each of these constituted \u201cbad faith action and tactics that [were] frivolous and solely intended to cause unnecessary delay . . . .\u201d As already noted, Rosenthal does not even claim that these findings are not supported by the evidence. Clearly, the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was proper under Code of Civil Procedure section 2034. An innocent litigant should never be forced to bear alone the financial burden of seeking legal redress for repeated willful violations of valid court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Rosenthal also argues that the trial court erroneously included in the amount awarded the sum of $7,370 for the discovery motions which preceded the Stipulation and $3,006 for conferring and drafting the Stipulation and June 5 Order. In awarding the $23,030 as attorneys\u2019 fees the court gave no explanation as to how it arrived at this particular figure. It appears, however, that this is the amount requested in CEH\u2019s motion to strike Rosenthal\u2019s answer, and is clearly supported by the record.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Contrary to Rosenthal\u2019s argument, the language of the Stipulation<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> implying a waiver of sanctions did not apply in the event of a <em>subsequent </em>failure to perform the discovery commitments set out in the Stipulation. The language used was obviously meant to be only a waiver of sanctions as to all discovery violations that occurred before the Stipulation was signed, not to those violations occurring afterwards. Clearly, Rosenthal\u2019s conduct justified an award of substantial sanctions. The amount awarded ($23,030) was reasonable. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">2. <em>Post-August 29 Sanctions Against Rosenthal (Case No. B025896)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">On November 20, 1986, the trial court denied Rosenthal\u2019s motion to vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order and imposed sanctions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>$14,580 upon Rosenthal, and his attorney, Schulte, \u201cjointly and severally.\u201d On December 16, 1986, after Rosenthal had taken off calendar his motion for reconsideration of the August 29 Order, the trial court imposed sanctions of $13,401 upon Rosenthal, OMS, and the individual partners, Oring, Margolese and Schulte for filing that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In this appeal Rosenthal seeks reversal of that portion of the November 20 Order and the December 16 Order which imposed sanctions against him under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As we have already mentioned, he makes three arguments: (1) if the August 29 Order and the June 5 Order fall, so do the sanctions for seeking to have those orders set aside; (2) even if the sanctions were justified, they should not have been imposed on him since the acts for which the sanctions were imposed were the acts of Schulte, not himself; and (3) even if the $14,500 in sanctions imposed by Judge Cardenas\u2019s November 20 Order were proper, the trial court failed to detail in writing the conduct or circumstances justifying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The first argument need not detain us. We have already concluded that the Stipulation and the June 5 Order were valid and enforceable and the August 29 Order was properly issued by the trial court. Nothing further need be said on this issue. Similarly, there is no merit to Rosenthal\u2019s second argument that the sanctions should have been imposed only upon Schulte, and not upon him. The imposition of sanctions on Rosenthal was entirely justified. The record before us demonstrates very active involvement by Rosenthal in the various acts of misconduct which caused the court to impose those sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">After the August 29 Order was issued, OMS advised Rosenthal that it would not be able to prepare a motion for reconsideration in a timely fashion and asked if he could obtain the assistance of another attorney. Rosenthal agreed and retained Andrew J. Velcoff to assist OMS. According to VelcofF\u2019s declaration, he met with attorneys Margolese and Schulte, as well as Rosenthal, to discuss the case and to learn what needed to be done. They \u201ceach\u201d explained to him their version of the facts, indicating that the August 29 Order had been made as a result of the trickery and deceit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>opposing counsel and as a result of their own mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On September 8, 1986, the moving papers supporting the motion to reconsider and revoke the August 29 Order, which Velcoff had prepared, were filed. On October 15, 1986, Rosenthal filed his moving papers in support of motions to vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Most of the grounds and bases for these motions were in the declarations which listed numerous excuses for Rosenthal\u2019s violations of the June 5 Order and which by August 29, <em>had already been expressly rejected, determined to be false or </em>both.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In fact, affixed to these motions was the same declaration Rosenthal had filed in opposition to the original motion heard by Judge Ross on August 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">With respect to the motion to vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order, Judge Cardenas, on November 20, 1986, found that \u201ceven if Rosenthal were to succeed in showing that there was no express authority for Mr. Schulte to enter into this Stipulation, there certainly was implied authority, as a stipulation resolving discovery disputes is clearly within an attorney\u2019s general authority to bind his client in procedural matters arising during the course of the action. . . . Rosenthal clearly ratified his attorney\u2019s conduct. According to (2) of Rosenthal\u2019s own declaration, he read the June 5 Stipulation and Order on June 17, 1986. . . [he] never objected to Plaintiff, doesn\u2019t even pretend that he ever claimed that his attorneys lacked authority to sign the Stipulation, and neither Rosenthal nor his attorneys ever attempted to have the Stipulation vacated until after Judge Ross sanctioned his [violations] of it. Instead, Rosenthal (so he swears) spent over 100 hours in preparing answers to interrogatories in accordance with the Stipulation. . . . Rosenthal also prepared and served a Response to Notice to Produce Pursuant to Stipulation and Order (Exh. 46) and served responses to requests for admission (Exh. 50) by the deadline . . . established in that very Stipulation (asserting service was pursuant to June 5, 1986 Order).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">As already noted, the motion to reconsider the August 29 Order was taken off calendar by Rosenthal shortly after November 20, 1986, but CEH\u2019s sanction request, in response to said motion, remained on calendar and was considered by Judge Ross on December 3 and December 16, 1986. He determined that \u201cThe accusations against Richard Agay made by Rosenthal and his attorneys in the moving papers . . . are false, were known by Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys to be false at the time of filing Rosenthal\u2019s moving papers, and were made in bad faith . . . without substantial justification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>and constitute bad faith actions and tactics that are frivolous and solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, and the positions taken by Rosenthal and his attorneys in such regard are totally and completely without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u201cIn accordance with the usual rule on appeal, the judgment or order of the trial court is presumed correct. All intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters to which the record is silent, and error must be affirmatively shown. [Citation.] Where the evidence is in conflict, the appellate court will not disturb the findings of the trial court.\u201d <em>(Ellis </em>v. <em>Roshei Corp. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 642, 645, fn. 2 [192 Cal.Rptr. 57].)  Here, as the trial court found, Rosenthal\u2019s attempts to overturn the Stipulation and the June 5 Order, and the August 29 Order based thereon, were clearly frivolous and were brought in bad faith. From the record, there can be no doubt that, either alone or with attorney Velcoff, Rosenthal made the decisions and directed the preparation of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">This conclusion is reinforced in the record by several subsequent disclosures. In papers served December 17, 1986, OMS moved to withdraw as attorney of record. In a declaration attached thereto, Margolese stated that the motion to reconsider (the August 29 Order) was made \u201cupon grounds which [she] felt were so meritless and frivolous that [she] refused to file the Motion. . . . Rosenthal being an attorney himself chose to go ahead with the Motion for Reconsideration nevertheless and hired independent counsel (Andrew Velcoff) . . . .\u201d On January 5, 1987, she filed a declaration stating that Rosenthal had \u201crefus[ed] to cooperate in discovery . . . refus[ed] to follow legal advise [s/c] and insisted] time after time that this firm [assist] in his efforts to abuse the legal system. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Later, on February 27, 1987, during oral argument at the hearing on the motion for partial reconsideration of the December 16 order, Margolese acknowledged that when the motion to reconsider was filed she \u201cfelt that the motion was frivolous . . . [and] not only . . . meritless but. . . ridiculous</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Rosenthal\u2019s third and final contention with respect to the post-August 29 sanctions is that Judge Cardenas erred in adopting and incorporating, as the court\u2019s specification of reasons for the award of fees in the November 20 Order, plaintiff\u2019s Memorandum of Points and Authorities filed November 19, 1986. Rosenthal argues that by doing so, the court violated the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (c) which states, \u201cAn order imposing expenses shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The November 20 Order did expressly incorporate the specification of reasons set forth in CEH\u2019s opposing papers filed on November 19, 1986. In so doing, Judge Cardenas stated, \u201cThe conduct, circumstances and legal arguments so meticulously set forth therein provides the basis for the Court\u2019s conclusion (finding) that the instant motions were brought in bad faith and were totally and completely without merit.\u201d (See fn. 13, <em>ante.) </em> Although section 128.5, subdivision (c) requires the court to set forth, the specific circumstances giving rise to an award of sanctions, there is no prohibition against the court incorporating by reference papers which adequately set forth the conduct, circumstances and legal arguments which provide the bases for the court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u201cThe purpose of section 128.5\u2019s provision for a recitation of the facts justifying a sanctions order is to fulfill the \u2018rudiments\u2019 of due process required for governmental imposition of a penalty upon an attorney or party\u2014both for due process\u2019 own, constitutional sake and to ensure that the power conferred by the statute will not be abused. [Citations.] Moreover, in some cases the court\u2019s recitation will be an invaluable aid to a reviewing court determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lavine </em>v. <em>Hospital of the Good Samaritan </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1029 [215 Cal.Rptr. 708].) This purpose is equally served whether the court itself prepares the order, directs counsel to do so or simply incorporates, as the court did here, some specific portion(s) of a party\u2019s papers. Had the Legislature intended to require the court to directly prepare its own order when imposing a sanction under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, it certainly knew how to do so (see, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In any event, the court also stated that it found \u201cThe Court\u2019s order of June 5, 1986 was signed pursuant to a stipulation\u2014entered into between the parties acting through their respective <em>counsel\u2014for such an Order, </em>[fl] The Court concludes and finds that <em>all fourteen </em>pages<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> of the \u2018Stipulation to Resolve Discovery Disputes and Order\u2019 were reviewed by counsel for defendant, Victor A. Schulte, before he signed it, thus binding his client. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Therefore, it appears that Judge Cardenas\u2019s order itself, aside from expressly incorporating statements from another document, included independent reasons showing the motion to vacate to be frivolous and made in bad faith. There was no error in the imposition of these sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">3. <em>Sanctions Against OMS (Consolidated Case No. B024983)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In these consolidated cases OMS has brought three separate appeals from three different judicial decisions on related matters. The first order appealed from is Judge Cardenas\u2019s November 20 Order which imposed sanctions of $14,500. The second is Judge Ross\u2019s imposition of sanctions ($13,401) in the December 16 Order. The third is Judge Lewin\u2019s order of March 9, 1987, in which he denied OMS\u2019s motion for contribution from Rosenthal for the attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions imposed by the previous orders of Judges Cardenas and Ross and which OMS had paid in their entirety. (See fn. 25, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">According to Margolese, OMS initially had refused Rosenthal\u2019s request to file the motion for reconsideration of the August 29 Order. Rosenthal then retained Velcoff to prepare the motion and requested Schulte and herself to cooperate with Velcoff. Later, independent of OMS, Velcoff and Rosenthal determined that there would not only be a motion for reconsideration but also a motion to vacate under section 473. When she noticed that the law firm\u2019s name was on the pleadings along with Velcoff\u2019s name, she protested to Rosenthal. Because of a time problem, it was agreed that OMS would file the motions unchanged and Rosenthal and Velcoff would correct the record before the Court within the next day or two. After the motions were filed, Velcoff reneged on this promise and refused to execute the appropriate substitution of attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Velcoff maintains that he was not retained to represent Rosenthal as independent counsel, but only as a \u201cghost writer.\u201d Velcoff, in his declaration, states that his role was \u201cministerial in doing research (along with Vana Margolese), drafting and putting together documents\u201d; that at no time did Schulte or Margolese indicate that they opposed the filing of the motion; that Margolese\u2019s statement that he agreed to substitute in as counsel is \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d; that Velcoff later entered into a letter agreement with OMS limiting his participation in the motions retrospectively; and that Rosenthal refused to sign any agreement regarding Velcoff\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The monetary sanctions imposed by these two orders were promptly paid to CEH.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On January 6, 1987, the court granted OMS the right to withdraw as attorney of record. On February 27, 1987, a motion for partial reconsideration of the sanctions and the issue of joint and several liability was heard and denied. The court concluded that OMS\u2019s primary duty was to the legal system and that the motions should not have been filed despite the client\u2019s insistence. Within 10 days after payment to CEH, OMS filed 2 motions for contribution pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 882 and 883. These motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">OMS asserts two principal arguments in support of its position in these consolidated appeals. The first addresses itself to the two sanction orders; the second responds to the denial of the contribution motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">a. <em>The Attorney\u2019s Ethical Dilemma</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">OMS contends that there is a \u201cConstitutional flaw\u201d in Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 since it allows sanctions to be awarded against an attorney in those \u201crare but not unusual\u201d situations where an attorney cannot exonerate himself without breaching his ethical obligations to his client. OMS argues that when the sanctions were awarded against them they could not have withdrawn from the case without adversely affecting Rosenthal\u2019s position, and that the attorney/client privilege prevented them from being able to exonerate themselves. They assert that \u201ccounsel should not be placed in the position of making a decision to forego an obligation to a client to pursue diligently any possible meritorious motions on a unilateral decision that a particular motion may be considered by the judicial system to be \u2018frivolous.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Under Business and Professions section 6068, \u201cIt is the duty of an attorney: ... [H] (c) To counsel or maintain such actions, proceedings, or defenses only as appear to him or her legal or just, except the defense of a person charged with a public offense. [|] (d) To employ, for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided to him or her such means only as are <em>consistent with truth, </em>and never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or <em>false statement of fact or law. \u201d </em>(Italics added.) (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Attorneys, \u00a7 400, at pp. 452-453.)</p>\n<p id=\"ARQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Rule 7-105 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in part provided that \u201cIn presenting a matter to a tribunal, a member of the State Bar shall: fll] (1) Employ . . . such means only as are consistent with truth, and shall not seek to mislead the judge, judicial officer or jury by an artifice or false statement of fact or law. . . .\u2019\u2019As OMS now apparently recognizes, it is clear that an attorney must withdraw from a case when his client demands tactics that the attorney concludes are frivolous or breach the attorney\u2019s obligation to the legal system. (Rules of Prof. Conduct, rule 2-1 ll;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a76068, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">On November 20, 1986, after hearing the motion to vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order, Judge Cardenas, by his express adoption and incorporation of CEH\u2019s moving papers and supporting points and authorities, found that \u201call fourteen pages of the Stipulation were reviewed by Schulte before he signed it\u201d; that Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys\u2019 story that when they signed the Stipulation it was not stapled together or that the Order page was missing \u201cis a total prevarication\u201d; that Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys\u2019 story is a \u201crecent fabrication\u201d; that Rosenthal\u2019s entire motion is premised upon the charge of fraud by CEH in supposedly \u201csneaking an additional page into the Stipulation after it had been signed. . . . That premise is a pernicious prevarication\u201d; and that the basis for the claim is \u201cpure fabrication.\u201d The record shows that there were at least <em>eleven </em>separate factual bases supporting these findings of falsehoods relied on by CEH and expressly adopted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">It does not end there. After considering CEH\u2019s request for sanctions arising from Rosenthal\u2019s motion to reconsider the August 29 Order, Judge Ross, on December 16, 1986, stated that the primary basis for the motion was \u201can out-and-out lie.\u201d Specifically, he found that \u201cThe accusations against Richard Agay made by Rosenthal and his attorneys in the moving papers in support of the Rosenthal Motions are false, were known by Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys to be false at the time of filing Rosenthal\u2019s Moving Papers, and were made in bad faith . . . the accusations and claims . . . are without substantial justification, and constitute bad faith actions and tactics that are frivolous and solely intended to cause unnecessary delay . . . the positions taken . . . are totally and completely without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Contrary to QMS\u2019s arguments, they did not face an ethical dilemma. An attorney does not have an ethical obligation to his client to perjure himself or to file a knowingly frivolous or bad faith motion. Schulte and Margolese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>did not have an ethical obligation to Rosenthal to sign or file false declarations. To the contrary, OMS had an affirmative duty to refuse to falsely accuse CEH of committing fraud. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 231, 239-240 [188 Cal.Rptr. 441, 655 P.2d 1276]; <em>Reznik </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 198, 205 [81 Cal.Rptr. 769, 460 P.2d 969, 40 A.L.R.3d 161]; <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 367, 370 [246 P.2d 931].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">This conduct goes far beyond maintaining client confidences or refraining from jeopardizing a client\u2019s position. Here, OMS willfully and knowingly made false declarations and statements in an attempt to deceive the court. They cannot excuse such behavior by claiming that their client had \u201cinsisted\u201d upon it. If Rosenthal demanded such action, OMS had no choice but to immediately withdraw from the case. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rules 2-111 (B) and (C)(1)(a); <em>Cosenza </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1100, 1103 [200 Cal.Rptr. 18]; <em>Metzger </em>v. <em>Silverman </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d Supp. 30, 39 [133 Cal.Rptr. 355].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In this situation, the sanctions against OMS and the individual attorneys were not based upon any speculation or conjecture by the trial court. Both judges specifically found that the OMS\u2019s claim of fraud against CEH was blatantly false. This is not a case where their client misled OMS but one where they themselves knowingly lied to the court, acquiesced in their client\u2019s demands, and actively supported frivolous motions. An award of sanctions against the attorneys in this situation was absolutely mandatory. This is an example of one of the \u201cclearest of cases.\u201d The arguments made here by OMS to justify their conduct, and thus defeat the sanctions ordered by the trial court, rest upon a lamentably incorrect understanding of a lawyer\u2019s legal and ethical responsibilities. The flaw does not, as OMS asserts, lie in Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, but rather in the behavior of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">b. <em>Right to Judgment Debtor Contribution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">OMS also contends that Code of Civil Procedure sections 882<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and 883<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> apply to all joint and several money judgments including those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>awarded against an attorney and his client under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. Consequently, the court erred in denying their motion to force Rosenthal to reimburse OMS, in whole or in part, for the attorney fee sanctions awarded against them. With this contention, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Rosenthal argues that persons upon whom sanctions are imposed under section 128.5 are not \u201cjudgment debtors\u201d within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure sections 882 and 883, and, therefore, are not subject to contribution. In deciding whether or not these sections are applicable to orders as well as formal judgments, the key determination is whether the award of sanctions is final and appealable. If it is, then, contrary to Rosenthal\u2019s argument, the rules regarding contribution apply and the label \u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201corder\u201d is not material. Where a court has imposed a monetary sanction by an order which is final and appealable, no good reason exists not to treat that order as though it were a judgment for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure sections 882 and 883. Such an order has all the indicia of a judgment except that it relates to a collateral matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">It is true that generally, \u201can order is not a final determination of the cause but an intermediate ruling of some kind, usually a decision on a motion.\u201d (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Judgment, \u00a7 3, p.454.) However, that portion of the order imposing monetary sanctions pursuant to section 128.5 does constitute \u201c \u2018a <em>final </em>order on a collateral matter directing the payment of money.\u2019 \u201d <em>(I. J. Weinrot &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 327, 331, italics added); see also <em>Bauguess </em>v. <em>Paine </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 626, 634, fn. 3 [150 Cal.Rptr. 461, 586 P.2d 942]; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Roshei Corp., supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 642, 645, fn. 3; <em>Wisniewski </em>v. <em>Clary </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 499, 502 [120 Cal.Rptr. 176]).  Therefore, OMS, and the named partners, were \u201cjudgment\u201d debtors within the meaning of sections 882 and 883 and the court erred in denying OMS\u2019s motion for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">According to the Law Revision Commission comment, 1982 Addition, \u201cSection 882 . . . permits contribution where a joint judgment debtor satisfies a disproportionate share of a money judgment, or satisfies the judgment as a surety, whether by voluntary payment or involuntarily through levy upon and sale of property, wage garnishment, examination proceedings, or some other procedure. This section does not determine the proportionate shares of the obligation on a judgment; the joint judgment debtor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>share depends on the circumstances of the case.\u201d We construe this comment to support our view that where there is no apportionment of joint liability made by the judgment or order itself, or dictated by the terms of some underlying instrument, such as a partnership agreement (see, e.g., <em>Woolley </em>v. <em>Seijo </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 615, 621-622 [36 Cal.Rptr. 762]), then the \u201cdue proportion\u201d of the liability of the several judgment debtors shall be calculated on a pro rata basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">On November 20, 1986, the trial court imposed sanctions of $14,500 upon Schulte and Rosenthal, \u201cjointly and severally.\u201d There are clearly only two persons subject to the order and, absent a different apportionment by the court, they should, <em>as between themselves, </em>share the burden equally. No factual issue as to apportionment arises. Schulte is entitled to a one-half contribution from Rosenthal of $7,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On December 16, 1986, the trial court imposed sanctions of $13,401 upon Rosenthal, OMS, and the individual partners, Oring, Margolese and Schulte. Since all three partners were named in addition to the law firm, it is unclear to us whether the trial court intended that all the \u201clawyers\u201d should constitute one entity and Rosenthal the other, or whether it intended that each named individual or entity be considered separately as a different debtor. This issue must therefore be remanded to the trial court for a determination of such intent. The matter can be resolved at the hearing on QMS\u2019s motion for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Sanctions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">1. <em>Sanctions Payable to CEH</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Sanctions for a frivolous appeal are being sought by CEH in connection with Case Nos. B033315 and B025896 against both Rosenthal and his counsel on appeal, Ronald P. Kaplan (Kaplan). In consolidated Case No. B024983, CEH, as real party in interest, is also seeking sanctions against OMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 907, \u201cWhen it appears to the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous or taken solely for delay, it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as may be just.\u201d California Rules of Court, rule 26(a) provides in pertinent part, \u201cWhere the appeal is frivolous or taken solely for the purpose of delay . . . the reviewing court may impose upon offending attorneys or parties such penalties, including the withholding or imposing of costs, as the circumstances of the case and the discouragement of like conduct in the future may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The twin standards for determining when an appeal is frivolous were considered by the Supreme Court in <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179]. That opinion guides and controls our resolution of CEH\u2019s request for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u201cThe California cases discussing frivolous appeals provide a starting point for the development of a definition of frivolous. Those cases apply standards that fall into two general categories: subjective and objective. [Citation.] The subjective standard looks to the motives of the appellant and his or her counsel. Thus, in <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Bemis Bros. Bag Co. </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 378, 382 [280 P.2d 528], the court rejected a claim that an appeal was frivolous, noting that counsel presented his argument in a \u2018courteous and gracious manner\u2019 and seemed to believe \u2018fervently\u2019 that he might succeed on the merits. Similarly, the courts have frequently looked at the \u2018good faith\u2019 of the appellant and have penalized appellants where the only purpose of the appeal was delay. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cThe objective standard looks at the merits of the appeal from a reasonable person\u2019s perspective. \u2018The problem involved in determining whether the appeal is or is not frivolous is not whether [the attorney] acted in the honest belief he had grounds for appeal, but whether any reasonable person would agree that the point is totally and completely devoid of merit, and, therefore, frivolous.\u2019 [Citations.] fl[] The two standards are often used together, with one providing evidence of the other. Thus, the total lack of merit of an appeal is viewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay. [Citations.] [fl] Both strands of this definition are relevant to the determination that an appeal is frivolous. An appeal taken for an improper motive represents a time-consuming and disruptive use of the judicial process. Similarly, an appeal taken despite the fact that no reasonable attorney could have thought it meritorious ties up judicial resources and diverts attention from the already burdensome volume of work at the appellate courts. <em>Thus, an appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper motive\u2014to harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse judgment\u2014or when it indisputably has no merit\u2014when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 649-650.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Here, we have no trouble concluding that Rosenthal has prosecuted these appeals for no other reason than to harass and delay CEH. That conclusion is amply supported by the total lack of merit which we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>found in the arguments advanced here by Rosenthal,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> as well as the conduct in which he engaged in the trial court which he seeks, by such arguments, to here justify and which led two different trial judges to conclude that harassment and delay were his only motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We are not at all impressed by the argument that since Rosenthal had paid the judgment (and OMS had paid the sanctions), Rosenthal\u2019s motive could not be delay as there was nothing to delay. While it is true that CEH has received full payment, an appellant may not insulate himself from frivolous appeal sanctions by the mere act of satisfying the judgment. Delay, as that term is used in this context, does not simply refer to delay in <em>collection </em>of the judgment, but rather to delay in its <em>finality. </em>Until a judgment is final the respondent is not entitled to <em>retain </em>the judgment proceeds nor may the judgment be asserted as a basis for res judicata or collateral estoppel in any other litigation which may exist or arise between the parties. In addition, a respondent, even though in receipt of the judgment proceeds, must still expend time and treasure in defense of the judgment. It is the appellant\u2019s act of prosecuting an appeal for the improper motives of harassment (of the respondent) or delay (of judgment finality) which supports the conclusion that the appeal is frivolous. That appellant may have paid the judgment, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We are, of course, mindful of <em>Flaherty's </em>caution that \u201cany definition [of a frivolous appeal] must be read so as to avoid a serious chilling effect on the assertion of litigants\u2019 rights on appeal. Counsel and their clients have a right to present issues that are arguably correct, even if it is extremely unlikely that they will win on appeal. An appeal that is simply without merit is <em>not </em>by definition frivolous and should not incur sanctions.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 650.)  However, that limitation has no application here. Under no legal analysis can we conclude that any of Rosenthal\u2019s contentions are \u201carguably correct.\u201d As we have exhaustively explained, they lack merit and simply are part and parcel of Rosenthal\u2019s efforts to obfuscate the issues and extend the process of resolution. (See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Willard </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1006, 1009-1010 [255 Cal Rptr. 165]; <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 1418, 1439-1440 [240 Cal.Rptr. 297]; <em>Maple Properties </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 997, 1009-1010 [205 Cal.Rptr. 532].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Finally, we also note that because of due process considerations, \u201cPenalties for prosecuting frivolous appeals should not be imposed without giving fair warning,[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>]affording the attorney an opportunity to respond to the charge, and holding a hearing. Further, when imposing sanctions, the court should provide the attorney with a written statement of the reasons for the penalty.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal. 3d at p. 654.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">With respect to Case Nos. B033315 and B025896, we therefore conclude that the appeals filed therein by Kaplan for his client, Rosenthal, are without merit and were brought for no other purpose than to harass CEH and to delay the finality of the judgment awarded. The only apparent effect or purpose of these tactics by Rosenthal has been to force CEH to exhaust a substantial portion of whatever assets they may have now recovered under the judgment in the effort to collect and retain such proceeds. This, in our view, constitutes the harassment condemned by <em>Flaherty </em>and is intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As we recently explained in a case where litigation was forced and extended by a defendant in order to avoid or delay the enforcement of a legitimate creditor\u2019s claim, \u201cIt is perhaps time that the courts, both trial and appellate, begin to speak and react more forcefully with respect to cases such as this one. Such an abuse of the legal system for no other purpose than to avoid paying a legitimate claim simply can no longer be tolerated. It is not fair to the opposing litigant who is victimized by such tactics and it is not fair to the greatly overworked judicial system itself and those citizens with legitimate disputes waiting patiently to use it. In those cases where such abuse is present, an award of substantial sanctions is proper.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(National Secretarial Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Froehlich </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 510, 526 [258 Cal.Rptr. 506].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Kaplan, as counsel for Rosenthal, necessarily bears some responsibility in this matter as well. The briefs which Kaplan filed on Rosenthal\u2019s behalf in these appeals contain numerous misleading, incomplete and false statements of fact<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and inexplicably, totally ignore the specific trial court findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>which are dispositive of the arguments raised in the appeals. The appellate attack on the orders of June 5 and August 29, 1986, was based on issues that had been resolved by the Stipulation and the June 5 Order and is totally frivolous. As noted, <em>supra, </em>the trial court has repeatedly rejected Rosenthal\u2019s factual claims, and yet Kaplan, without any showing whatever that the trial court\u2019s factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence, simply attempted to relitigate them on appeal. Thus, while we hold Rosenthal almost entirely responsible in this matter, Kaplan, by acquiescing in Rosenthal\u2019s demands, made his wasteful and frivolous appeals possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">As the court stated in <em>Cosenza </em>v. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 1100, 1103, \u201cAn attorney in a civil case is not a hired gun required to carry out every direction given by the client. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (c).) As a professional, counsel has a professional responsibility not to pursue an appeal that is frivolous or taken for the purpose of delay, just because the client instructs him or her to do so. (Rule 2-110C, Rules Prof. Conduct.) Under such circumstances, the high ethical and professional standards of a member of the bar and an officer of the court require the attorney ... to withdraw from the representation of the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In determining the appropriate relief, the underlying policy of Code of Civil Procedure section 907 should control. \u201cThe object of imposing a penalty for frivolous appeal is twofold\u2014to discourage the same, as well as to compensate to some extent for the loss which results from the delay. . . . [1f] In determining the amount ... in this case for a frivolous appeal we should consider the facts with relation thereto and the effect of the delay.\u201d <em>(Huber </em>v. <em>Shedoudy </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 311, 316-317 [181 P. 63]; see also <em>Kim </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 375, 384-385 [256 Cal.Rptr. 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In this case, such sanctions are most properly measured by the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by CEH in responding to Rosenthal\u2019s appeals. We have determined from our review of the record and an examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>briefs filed (including the declarations which describe the time spent and the applicable hourly rates), the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by CEH in Case No. B033315 to be $91,866 and in Case No. B025896 to be $27,043.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> These fees, totaling $118,909, are to be paid $113,909 by Rosenthal and $5,000 by Kaplan. This apportionment, in our view, represents a fair and proper distribution of the responsibility for these appeals.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">With regard to QMS\u2019s appeals in consolidated Case No. B024983,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we reach an entirely different result. Whatever the effect of QMS\u2019s act of appealing these sanction orders, they raised only a very limited argument on a specific point, which did not call for the massive responsive brief filed by CEH. We have found that point to be without merit, but we do not agree that QMS\u2019s appeals meet either the subjective or objective tests of <em>Flaherty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">While we certainly can not condone or excuse QMS\u2019s trial court behavior in this matter we do not find their efforts in these appeals, in which they sought a more favorable judicial reaction to their claimed \u201cethical dilemma,\u201d to be frivolous. They were wrong and grossly misguided but, in these circumstances, they are not deserving of sanctions beyond those already imposed by the trial court. We will therefore deny CEH\u2019s request for sanctions against QMS in case Nos. B024983 and B026834.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">2. <em>Sanctions Payable to the Clerk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Finally, it must be said that the handling of this case has imposed an enormous burden on this court. The record on appeal alone exceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>7,500 pages. The parties have filed a substantial number of extensive briefs. In addition, the court had to review and consider, in the eight months preceding oral argument, a number of procedural motions, each of which was vigorously contested. This should not be understood as a criticism of CEH, however. In our view, these respondents, apart from a bit of overkill in the consolidated appeals of OMS, had little choice but to make the thorough and detailed presentation which they did. Because of the labyrinth of confusing detail arising from months of discovery and related motion activity, CEH had to make a full exposition of the conduct, positions and arguments of Rosenthal, as well as the context in which they occurred, in order to demonstrate why the trial court\u2019s rulings were so clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">For all of the reasons already discussed, the fault for the imposition of this burden on the judicial system must be laid at Rosenthal\u2019s door. For far too long in this case his actions have resulted in confrontation, dispute and acrimony, all of which has only multiplied the litigation demands and need for judicial involvement. Thus, we properly assign blame to Rosenthal for the imposition upon this court of a costly, time-consuming and frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In <em>Finnie </em>v. <em>Town of Tiburon </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1, 17 [244 Cal.Rptr. 581], the court correctly observed that respondents are not the only parties damaged when an appellant pursues a frivolous claim. Others with bona fide disputes, as well as the taxpayers, are prejudiced by the wasteful diversion of an appellate court\u2019s limited resources. For all of the reasons already noted, we have determined that the imposition of such additional sanctions is appropriate in this case.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In <em>Finnie, </em>the court held that an appropriate measure of sanctions should also compensate the State for its expense in processing, reviewing and deciding a frivolous appeal. That court \u201cconservative[ly]\u201d estimated the cost of processing an average civil appeal and imposed that amount as a sanction. We have independently determined that the cost for such an average appeal in this District is the sum of $3,995.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>However, this is far from the average case. As we have noted, this case, with a voluminous record and the need to consider and resolve multiple issues, imposed a substantially greater burden. After a careful consideration of all of the facts of this case, which we have already discussed in such detail, we have determined that a proper total cost to the State assignable to this case is the sum of $25,000.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Of this total sum, only the amounts chargeable to Rosenthal\u2019s appeals (Case Nos. B033315 and B025986) should be considered (i.e., $20,000). Therefore, Rosenthal shall be directed to pay the sum of $20,000 to the clerk of this court as additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\"><em>Case No. B033315: </em>The judgment is affirmed.

Margolese has no standing to appeal from the November 20 Order which made an award in favor of CEH and against Schulte and Rosenthal. That order was not directed in favor of or against Margolese. However, from other papers filed by Margolese, it also appears that she is the attorney of record for the law firm of OMS as well as Oring, herself and Schulte, as individuals. Therefore, for purposes of this appeal, we deem the notice of appeal to have been filed by Margolese on behalf of Schulte and that the error in the wording of the notice of appeal was inadvertent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\"> Rosenthal, an attorney for approximately 54 years, was licensed to practice in California until his disbarment in 1987 <em>(Rosenthal </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 612 [238 Cal.Rptr. 377, 738 P.2d 723]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> The cross-complaint for damages alleged (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) deceit, (4) malpractice, (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress and (6) negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b110-12\"> It appears that Rosenthal also is or has been involved in numerous lawsuits against other attorneys who previously represented him or represented parties who opposed him or were his former partners or with whom he otherwise was associated in the practice of law.

We concur with CEH\u2019s brief that certain portions are particularly relevant and those are set out below. By his incorporation order, Judge Cardenas specifically found the following to be established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-14\">1. \u201cRosenthal argues that the June 5 Stipulation was not binding on him because Mr. Schulte was not authorized to enter into this Stipulation on Rosenthal\u2019s behalf. . . . Were this contention valid, then this Court would have to rule that <em>Rule 319 </em>and \u2018meet and confer orders\u2019 in general are void; if after meeting the attorneys cannot enter into a stipulation to resolve disputes, then of what purpose is their meeting?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-15\">2. \u201cRosenthal argues that the June 5 Stipulation signed by Mr. Schulte impairs Rosenthal\u2019s substantial rights and his cause of action. Rosenthal\u2019s position is without merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-16\">3. \u201cMr. Schulte was acting well within his authority as Rosenthal\u2019s attorney of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-17\">4. \u201cIn the face of a motion to compel answers and in response to an order to try to resolve the disputes Mr. Schulte certainly had authority to agree, as he did agree, to provide answers, rather than having the Court decide on the merits each of Mr. Schulte\u2019s objections and subjecting his client to the risk of sanctions. Hardly could that be deemed to be outside of an attorney\u2019s authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-18\">5. \u201cMr. Schulte\u2019s stipulation that Rosenthal would be produced for deposition does not constitute a waiver of either procedural or substantive rights. Rosenthal was already under a statutory duty to appear for his duly noticed deposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-19\">6. \u201cMr. Schulte further agreed on Rosenthal\u2019s behalf to produce documents, but these were simply documents which had been previously requested under \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2019 </em>and <em>2031, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Rosenthal\u2019s attorney, by stipulating to produce the documents which had been duly requested, in no way impaired Rosenthal\u2019s substantial rights or his cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">7. \u201cBy signing the Stipulation, Mr. Schulte did recognize Plaintiff\u2019s discovery priority. \u2018However, Rosenthal agreed to Plaintiff\u2019s discovery priority all along\u2019 . . . and thus it appears that no right whatsoever was being given up by Mr. Schulte.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">8. \u201cMr. Schulte\u2019s act of executing the June 5 Stipulation and Order was embraced as ancillary or incidental to his general authority as Rosenthal\u2019s attorney of record, one well within his authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">9. \u201cOn June 6, 1986 Rosenthal was faced with a potentially disastrous court order, in light of his numerous discovery violations and the motions to compel which had been (and were being) brought against him. As of June 5, 1986 it was clearly within [szc] Rosenthal\u2019s best interests to resolve the discovery disputes without having a law and motion judge review Rosenthal\u2019s blatantly bad faith conduct. Mr. Schulte simply applied his best discretion to protect his client\u2019s rights and achieve his client\u2019s fundamental goal, of defending the instant lawsuit (and possibly of prosecuting his cross-complaint).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">10. \u201cMr. Schulte\u2019s act in entering the June 5 Stipulation did not in any way impair his client\u2019s case. The prejudice which Rosenthal has suffered, if any, did not take place in the June 5 Stipulation and Order, but took place by reason of his blatant repeated violations of the Discovery Act and June 5 Stipulation and Order and the resulting August 29, 1986 order of Judge Ross in response to a wholly separate motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">11. \u201cThe mere fact that Mr. Schulte purported to enter into the Stipulation on behalf of his client gives rise to a (rebuttal) [szc] presumption that Mr. Schulte was authorized to enter into the Stipulation on Rosenthal\u2019s behalf. . . . Rosenthal has not met his burden of rebutting this presumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">12. \u201c[E]ven if Rosenthal were to succeed in showing that there was no express authority for Mr. Schulte to enter into this Stipulation, there certainly was implied authority, as a stipulation resolving discovery disputes is clearly within an attorney\u2019s general authority to bind his client in procedural matters arising during the course of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">13. \u201cRosenthal clearly ratified his attorney\u2019s conduct. According to jl(2) of Rosenthal\u2019s own declaration, he read the June 5 Stipulation and Order on June 17, 1986. Although he claims he expressed his objection to the Stipulation and Order to his attorneys, Rosenthal never objected to Plaintiff, doesn\u2019t even pretend that he ever claimed that his attorneys lacked authority to sign the Stipulation, and neither Rosenthal nor his attorneys ever attempted to have the Stipulation vacated until after Judge Ross sanctioned his [violations] of it. Instead, Rosenthal (so he swears) spent over 100 hours in preparing answers to interrogatories in accordance with the Stipulation. fl]8 August 22, 1986 Declaration.) Rosenthal also prepared and served a Response to Notice to Produce Pursuant to Stipulation and Order (Exh. 46) and served responses to requests for admission (Exh. 50) by the deadline, July 2, established in that very Stipulation, asserting service was pursuant to June 5, 1986 Order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">14. \u201cIf this Court were to permit a stipulation to resolve discovery disputes to be vacated on the grounds that the attorney lacked authorization, it would herald the death knell for meet and confer orders. Who would want to confer if the results would be meaningless?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">15. \u201c[T]he Stipulation arose by reason of the fact that Plaintiff had on calendar two motions filed pursuant to \u00a7 <em>2034(a) </em>and [was] seeking orders under that section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-15\">16. \u201cMuch of Rosenthal\u2019s moving papers are devoted to a rehash of the motions before this Court on May 29 which were resolved by the June 5 Stipulation and Order and to a rehash of Rosenthal\u2019s arguments made before Judge Ross which Judge Ross rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-16\">17. The \u201cclaim [of] Ms. Margolese\u2019s family problems as an excuse for Rosenthal\u2019s conduct [is the] same position [that] was put before Judge Ross and rejected by him as an excuse for the discovery violations by Rosenthal, and it should receive no greater weight here. More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>than that, while [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel has] repeatedly expressed . . . sympathy to Ms. Margolese, the facts are that she fully and actively participated in this case from not later than May 14, and in particular, during the discussions from May 29 through June 5 during which the terms of the June 5 Stipulation were negotiated, and immediately thereafter as well. Thus, this excuse is without merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">18. The \u201ccomplain[t] that the Interrogatories \u2018were riddled with overlapping subparts\u2019. . . and were \u2018voluminous and convoluted\u2019 . . . are the very same contentions made to Judge Ross without success.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">19. The \u201ccomplainft] that [Rosenthal] couldn\u2019t get an extension of time to answer the Interrogatories ... is the exact same argument which Judge Ross rejected on August 29, 1986.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">20. The \u201cclaim[s] that the sanctions imposed on August 29 were too harsh, that [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel] acted improperly in [previously] representing Rosenthal and that Rosenthal is ill . . . [were each] raised before Judge Ross, [and] each of them was rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> The relevant findings made by Judge Ross in the December 16 Order are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201c1.

They are thus binding on appeal. (See <em>Pick </em>v. <em>Santa Ana-Tustin Community Hospital </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 970, 978-979 [182 Cal.Rptr. 85].) While it is true that Rosenthal, in his reply brief, makes the conclusionary argument that \u201cThe evidence of [his] discovery violations was insufficient to support the finding in the August 29 . . .

As this court observed in <em>Day </em>v. <em>Rosenthal </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1167, 1172-1173 [217 Cal.Rptr. 89], \u201cRosenthal\u2019s performance was, basically, the same in each case. His replies were essentially nonresponsive or uninformative. He was ordered to provide further answers. Again, many of his answers were inadequate or nonresponsive. After what Rosenthal euphemistically calls \u2018some initial fencing over interrogatories\u2019 the trial court concluded that Rosenthal\u2019s failure to answer was willful. . . . The storm of demands for discovery made by Rosenthal after five years of thumbing his nose at efforts to get him to respond to discovery requests alerted the trial court to take a hard look at what was happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Again, in <em>Doanbuy Lease and Co. </em>v. <em>Melcher </em>(1971) 83 N.M. 82 [488 P.2d 339], the New Mexico Supreme Court stated, \u201cHow many times do Doanbuy and its president [Rosenthal] need to be told to submit to depositions? We are much too concerned with the orderly and expeditious flow of cases through our trial courts to condone, even indirectly or by implication, Mr. Rosenthal\u2019s conduct. The courts of New Mexico have neither the time nor the inclination to indulge such querulous and petulant antics by civil litigants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\"> In the declaration of Richard Agay, a member of the CEH law firm, a breakdown of expenses was given as follows: Preparation of Motion to compel answers to the First Set of Interrogatories ($1,620); Motion seeking protective order and stay of Rosenthal\u2019s discovery order ($5,805); Motions to compel answers to the second set of interrogatories ($945); These three separate motions which ultimately led to the Stipulation and the June 5 order total <em>$8,370 </em>(in his declaration Mr. Agay only claimed $7,370 for this category, apparently due to a mathematical error in Rosenthal\u2019s favor); Conference and draft of June 5 Stipulation: <em>$3,006; </em>Correspondence and preparation of proposed stipulation after Rosenthal\u2019s attorneys threatened not to comply with the June 5 Order: $1,224; Preparation of opposition to Rosenthal\u2019s motion to obtain ex parte order modifying the June 5 Stipulation and Order: $7,962; Preparation of ex parte application to retain discovery priority: <em>$1,944; </em>General research: <em>$270; </em>and Preparation of motion to strike answers, etc.: <em>$7,254. </em>This totals $24,030 (the $1,000 difference from the amount actually claimed and awarded is due to the mathematical error described above).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b126-10\"> In paragraph 9.3, the Stipulation provided that \u201cExcept as otherwise herein provided, all pending motions are disposed of and no sanctions shall be awarded to either party.\u201d There was no other provision in the Stipulation mentioning either the disposition of pending motions or sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201c(a) Every trial court may order a party, the party\u2019s attorney, or both to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201c(b) For purposes of this section: (1) \u2018Actions or tactics\u2019 include, but are not limited to, the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of a complaint or cross-complaint. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201c(2) \u2018Frivolous\u2019 means (A) totally and completely without merit or (B) for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\"> See footnotes 13 and 14, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> In the Motion to Vacate the Stipulation and the June 5 Order, it was asserted that of the \u201c14-page Stipulation, only 13 pages were seen, approved and initialed by both counsel. . . .

Defense counsel had no reason to believe that any additions were added. . . .\u201d As we discuss below, it was this claim which Judge Cardenas found, on November 20, 1986, to be \u201ca pernicious prevarication\u201d and a \u201cpure fabrication.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> On December 22, 1986, Schulte paid CEH $14,673.18, and on December 23, 1986, OMS paid CEH $13,446.64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> With respect to this argument, it is important to remember, and we here again emphasize, that Margolese, one of the partners of OMS so actively involved in this matter, has admitted in declarations filed with the trial court that the motion to reconsider the August 29 Order was frivolous and without merit; and that Rosenthal had refused to cooperate in discovery or follow OMS\u2019s legal advice but rather had insisted (apparently successfully) that OMS \u201c[assist] in his efforts to abuse the legal system.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> This was the way the rule read on the dates relevant to this matter.

Indeed, CEH did more than simply request sanctions as part of the regular briefing process. Specific separate written requests were submitted to the court and served on Rosenthal and OMS and were addressed by them in responsive memoranda. The issue was also discussed in some detail at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\"> It is our intention that this opinion shall constitute such statement of reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\"> For example, Kaplan argued that (1) <em>Rosenthal appeared for \u201cseveral\u201d </em>depositions; in fact, he appeared for two morning sessions, one in March 1986 and one in July 1986 and departed each without notice or an offer to return; (2) <em>Rosenthal responded timely to interrogatories in response to the Stipulation and the June 5 Order; </em>in fact, Rosenthal did not at any time respond in a timely manner and the tardy responses he did make consisted of objections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>and evasion, all contrary to the express terms of the Stipulation and the June 5 Order; (3) <em>Rosenthal had done his best, had engaged in \u201cyeoman efforts\u201d to comply with all discovery requests and had \u201cproduced virtually every document\u201d in his possession-, </em>in fact, Rosenthal repeatedly refused to produce original documents in his possession, failed to produce identified documents, served unverified responses and produced only illegible copies of some of the originals and also produced only a small portion of the documents requested and refused for no good reason to let any documents be marked in the abbreviated deposition sessions which he did attend; (4) <em>Rosenthal did not know the Stipulation was to become an order-, </em>in fact, as we have explained, the evidence before the trial court was overwhelming that Rosenthal was well aware of both the Stipulation and the June 5 Order and repeatedly acted in a manner which ratified it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> We reject CEH\u2019s request to impose sanctions based on a \u201clodestar\u201d method of calculation which would result in an award equal to four times their regular hourly rates. In our view, if CEH receives recompense at its regular rates for the reasonable time spent on these appeals, that is all that fairness and justice require. The additional sums described in the CEH declarations as costs incurred for copying and brief preparation appear to be part of the costs allowable on appeal and are therefore not recognized here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\"> Due to the special circumstances of this case, we have determined that the great majority of these sanctions should be assessed against Rosenthal. As a former attorney, he is well aware of the professional standards of a member of the bar and his conduct has constituted a flagrant and intentional misuse of the appellate process. Due to his prior experience and also due to the fact he is the beneficiary of the delay and disruption, he must be held to have the greatest responsibility for pressing this appeal and exacerbating an already appalling situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\"> As we previously explained, in Case No. B024983 OMS appeals from the sanctions, imposed by Judge Cardenas in the November 20 Order, against Rosenthal and Schulte. Case No. B026834 is the OMS appeal from Judge Ross\u2019s December 16 Order which imposed sanctions against Rosenthal and OMS, as well as each of the three name partners. The third case included in this court\u2019s consolidation order of August 12, 1988 (Case No. B026957) is a meritorious appeal from Judge Lewin\u2019s refusal to grant QMS\u2019s motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 882 and 883. This latter case does not involve CEH and is not the subject of CEH\u2019s sanction request or our discussion of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\"> Prior to oral argument we directed the clerk of this court to give written notice to all counsel that we were considering an award of sanctions under <em>Finnie </em>v. <em>Town of Tiburon, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at page 17. Thereafter, the parties submitted written letter briefs addressing the issue and it was discussed at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\"> In <em>Finnie, </em>the court accepted a calculation of $2,324 as the cost for \u201cprocessing] an average civil appeal.\u201d However, our independent review of a cost analysis prepared by the Administrative Office of the Courts in July of 1987 reflects a higher figure. When <em>all </em>costs (total annual cost of operations = $40,376,000) are considered, together with the average annual time spent by judicial officers on all matters (1562.3 judge hours per year), a cost per judge hour of $335.63 results. When this is multiplied by the average annual time spent on <em>case-related matters </em>(1249.86 judge hours per year) an annual average cost per justice for <em>all </em>cases is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>determined to be $419,492.72. We divided this sum by 105 (the average number of all appeals, including criminal, decided annually per justice in the Second District). This resulted in an average cost per appeal of $3,995. While we recognize that the average civil appeal takes longer to process than the average criminal appeal, and thus would justify a higher average number, we have conservatively determined to use this lower number for purposes of determining the appropriate sanctions in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\"> Of this total amount, $15,000 is allocated to Case No. B033315 and $5,000 to Case No. B025896.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
