J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aar\">One of the limited number of special circumstance crimes for which the death penalty is authorized is intentional murder \u201ccarried out for financial gain.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The primary issue presented on these appeals is whether persons who kill in order to prevent discovery of embezzlement committed by one of those persons can be convicted of murder for financial gain even if a bystander is killed but the intended victim survives. Our answer is that both of the persons can be properly convicted of committing murder for financial gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Procedure and Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Sometime between 11 p.m. and midnight on the evening of October 19, 1979, two bullets were fired into the brain of Yvette Nance while she was seated in an automobile parked near Jack London Square in Oakland. Her companion, Albert Del Masso, suffered serious multiple gunshot wounds but survived. Defendant David Russell Silberman was arrested at the scene. Defendant Gino Tomasso Bengiovanni was arrested several days later at his home in San Bruno.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">As a result of this incident, the District Attorney of Alameda County filed a consolidated information against both defendants. In count I of the information, defendants were jointly charged with the murder of Ms. Nance. (\u00a7 187.) Included in this count were special circumstance allegations that the murder was \u201cintentional and carried out for . . . financial gain.\u201d (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(1).) Defendants were jointly charged in count II (as subsequently amended) with having assaulted Mr. Del Masso with the intent to commit murder. (Former \u00a7 217.) Counts I and II included allegations that during the commission of the respective offenses each defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>had been armed with a firearm (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)) and each had personally used a firearm. (\u00a7 12022.5.) Count II included the further allegation that during the commission of the assault upon Del Masso great bodily injury had intentionally and personally been inflicted by each defendant. (\u00a7 12022.7.) It was also alleged in count II that Bengiovanni had suffered four prior felonies within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). Bengiovanni subsequently admitted the priors. Bengiovanni alone was charged in count III with being a past-convicted felon in possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon his person. (\u00a7 12021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">As pertinent to the issues raised on these appeals, the record of defendants\u2019 month-long trial (which we will judicially notice) supports the following recitals:</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Albert Del Masso is the owner of a wholesale grocery firm located in downtown Oakland. He testified that he and Silberman have been \u201cfriends and business associates\u201d for eight to ten years. Silberman had helped to \u201cget money out of my corporations\u201d and avoid taxes. Silberman had also been purchasing shares in Canadian and South African gold-producing corporations for Del Masso since 1973. The shares were purchased in the name of several corporations owned by Silberman in order to reduce taxes and because Del Masso \u201cwanted to remain anonymous.\u201d In 1974 Del Masso deposited the shares in a Zurich bank. In 1975 Del Masso sent Silberman to Switzerland to \u201cliquidate those assets\u201d worth about $40,000 and use the proceeds to buy 300 ounces of gold, which Silberman was to place in a different \u201cSwiss bank deposit box.\u201d Silberman told Del Masso that \u201che had done that.\u201d Silberman provided Del Masso with \u201cdocumentation\u201d in the form of a \u201clease agreement\u201d with the bank and a \u201cpower of attorney\u201d to gain access to the box.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Del Masso further testified that starting about 1974 Silberman had also purchased gold (apparently in the form of coins and bullion) for Del Masso. Del Masso \u201cput up the money\u201d and Silberman \u201cacted as a broker.\u201d Silberman was paid a commission, shared in the profits, and was reimbursed for his expenses incurred in connection with these transactions on Del Masso\u2019s behalf. Silberman was always given cash, never checks, to make these transactions. Del Masso was never given receipts, nor did he keep any records or \u201cbooks\u201d concerning his dealings with Silberman. Del Masso estimated that the total amount of money he furnished to Silberman \u201cto buy both stocks and bonds and all the transactions\u201d was approximately $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">As of October 1979 Del Masso was expecting Silberman to deliver approximately $50,000 worth of \u201cgold stocks.\u201d Del Masso had advised Silberman that he (Del Masso) was planning to go to Zurich on October 22d, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>then to Paris and Kenya \u201cwith my companion, Yvette.\u201d Silberman had agreed to buy approximately $1,200 of Swiss and French currency for Del Masso. Sometime before he was ready to leave on this trip, Del Masso learned that Silberman was \u201ckeeping assets\u201d of his own in the same Swiss deposit box that he had \u201copened\u201d for Del Masso. Del Masso had loaned Silberman $18,500 during the five months prior to October. Silberman received $5,500 of this total about one week before Del Masso was scheduled to leave on the trip. Silberman told Del Masso that \u201che [Silberman] had gold in the box and . . . that I could recover this money from his gold.\u201d Del Masso told Silberman the date on which he and Ms. Nance were leaving for Switzerland in order to go to the Zurich bank and \u201ctransfer that box [szc] into a box solely of my own\u201d; that he wanted the stocks delivered before he left; and that \u201cit would be nice to have all of our business transactions concluded\u201d by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Del Masso testified that on October 19 th he was in his apartment near Jack London Square when he received a telephone call from Silberman sometime around 7 p.m. Silberman stated that he would be arriving at the Oakland airport from Montreal that night and that he \u201cwould be bringing everything down,\u201d including the gold stocks he had purchased for Del Masso. He asked Del Masso to \u201cpick him up\u201d at the airport around 10:15. Later that night Del Masso and Ms. Nance drove to the airport in Del Masso\u2019s Lincoln Continental. There they met Silberman, who introduced them to \u201cGino,\u201d a friend of Silberman who \u201ccame down from Montreal with him.\u201d Del Masso made positive in-court identifications of Silberman and of Bengiovanni, who was the person introduced as \u201cGino.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The four then entered Del Masso\u2019s automobile: Del Masso was in the driver\u2019s seat, Nance beside him in the front passenger seat, Silberman behind Del Masso, and Bengiovanni behind Nance. Del Masso drove to the area near Jack London Square to get Bengiovanni\u2019s vehicle. Most of the conversation during the trip was between Del Masso and Silberman, who exchanged \u201cpleasantries.\u201d As they neared Del Masso\u2019s office looking for Bengiovanni\u2019s automobile, Del Masso saw \u201ca car which resembled David\u2019s.\u201d Del Masso, thinking that \u201cwe had this business to conduct and there would be no better place than to go to my office,\u201d asked Silberman \u201cwould you like to go to my office?\u201d Silberman replied \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Del Masso parked his vehicle and, thinking that Silberman might be \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the presence of Bengiovanni and Ms. Nance, then \u201cturned completely around in my seat\u201d and asked Silberman if he would \u201clike to go for a walk.\u201d Silberman replied \u201cNo,\u201d looked at Bengiovanni, and told him \u201cDo it. I said do it now.\u201d Realizing that Silberman and Bengiovanni were now \u201csitting right up next to each other,\u201d Del Masso found himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>\u201clooking down the barrel of a gun\u201d held by Bengiovanni. Del Masso heard a \u201cpop,\u201d saw \u201ca little round flame,\u201d and then \u201cI became stunned.\u201d There were two more \u201cpops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Del Masso \u201clunged\u201d for the gun, could not reach it, and then \u201cspun around\u201d and rolled out of his automobile on to the ground. As he lay on the ground, Del Masso implored Silberman \u201cDavid, David. Don\u2019t do this,\u201d but Silberman made no response. Del Masso spoke to Silberman because \u201c[h]e gave the orders. ... He was in charge.\u201d Bengiovanni \u201cpointed a gun at me to shoot me as I lay on the ground.\u201d Before he could do so, the driver\u2019s door swung closed, whereupon Del Masso got up and ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Del Masso ran to a loading area where there were a number of \u201cpallets\u201d used for loading with lift trucks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Del Masso saw Silberman with a gun and believed \u201che was going to shoot me.\u201d Bengiovanni was \u201ca little bit further away,\u201d and \u201cthey had me trapped.\u201d After Del Masso picked up one of the pallets and made \u201ca defensive motion\u201d toward Silberman \u201cto deflect the gun, ... I saw the gun go oif.\u201d Del Masso threw the pallet at Bengiovanni, who then \u201cdisappeared.\u201d Del Masso resumed running. He remembered lying on the ground being kicked by Silberman, at which point \u201cI just figured it was over . . . I couldn\u2019t defend myself so . . . I just gave up.\u201d Del Masso recalled nothing which happened thereafter except \u201c[bjeing in the hospital\u201d and a man \u201cgiving me the last rites.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Del Masso went to Switzerland the following month \u201c[t]o find out if my assets were there.\u201d He apparently presented the \u201cpower of attorney\u201d form Silberman had given him to bank officials, but they would not allow Del Masso access to the deposit box.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to October, Del Masso had no idea that his money had been \u201cmisappropriated\u201d by Silberman.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Numerous eyewitnesses were able to corroborate Del Masso\u2019s testimony and fill in the details which Del Masso was unable to remember. They testified seeing Silberman shoot at the fleeing Del Masso once the pair had left Del Masso\u2019s automobile. When Del Masso apparently collapsed in front of a restaurant in Jack London Square, Silberman was observed kicking Del Masso in the head and repeatedly firing at him from point-blank range. The onlookers provided four positive in-court identifications of Silberman. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>witness made a positive identification of Bengiovanni, although one did observe a man flee after Del Masso threw the pallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">When police reached Del Masso\u2019s Lincoln, Ms. Nance\u2019s body was found lying on the front seat. The physician who performed the autopsy on the body noted that two bullets had lodged in Ms. Nance\u2019s brain and caused her death. One bullet entered through the right cheek, the other through \u201cthe back of the head to the right side.\u201d The surgeon who treated Del Masso the night of the shooting observed gunshot wounds to his left hand and arm, shoulder, chest, abdomen, back, and head and neck area. Del Masso remained in critical condition after undergoing six to seven hours of surgery. Del Masso stayed in the hospital for approximately two weeks. He had additional chest surgery in March of 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Chester Young, a criminalist employed by the Oakland Police Department, testified that the gun recovered by one of the eyewitnesses could hold up to 13 cartridges. All of the shell casings recovered from the scene had been fired from this weapon. After test-firing the gun, Young was of the opinion that the bullet fired into Ms. Nance\u2019s cheek and one of the bullets recovered from Del Masso had been fired from that gun. Young\u2019s testimony would support inferences that the bullet which entered Ms. Nance\u2019s cheek was fired from a distance of about six inches, and the one which had entered the back of her head was fired from less than four and one-half feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">David Silberman testified as follows: He has been a \u201cgold dealer\u201d since 1968. His business dealings with Del Masso began five years later when he began buying first gold bullion and then gold coins for Del Masso.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1975, Silberman \u201cliquidated\u201d some of Del Masso\u2019s assets; opened a deposit box for Del Masso in a Swiss bank; and put nine kilograms of gold in the box. The box \u201cwas in my [Silberman\u2019s] name.\u201d Gold was worth \u201caround $140 an ounce\u201d at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">As of October of 1979, Silberman had borrowed between $70,000 to $80,000 from Del Masso. Del Masso had given Silberman $50,000 to purchase gold stocks, but Silberman had used some of this money for \u201cpersonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>expenses.\u201d Without Del Masso\u2019s permission, Silberman in 1976 had taken the nine kilograms of gold from the Swiss deposit box because he \u201cneeded the money for something.\u201d The gold was then worth about $125 per ounce, but in October of 1979 the value had increased to about $380 per ounce. Silberman was not \u201cable to replace\u201d the gold as of the latter date. Silberman intended to replace \u201ceverything that had been borrowed\u201d from Del Masso, which amounted to between $200,000 and $250,000. Silberman had not told Del Masso about the \u201cmissing\u201d gold which Silberman admitted having \u201cremoved.\u201d Silberman had \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d which started in 1975 and which \u201cnever really did\u201d end.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Silberman testified that when he telephoned Del Masso on October 19th he was in Oakland, but he told Del Masso that he was in Vancouver. Silberman knew that Del Masso was going to Europe later that month and that Del Masso \u201cintended to go into the bank . . . into the [safe deposit] box.\u201d Silberman told Del Masso that \u201cI was just leaving Vancouver and could he pick me up at the airport.\u201d Del Masso asked if he could bring \u201chis lady friend . . . along with him,\u201d and Silberman replied \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Bengiovanni was \u201ca very close friend\u201d whom Silberman had known since 1971. Silberman had met Bengiovanni earlier on the 19th, and Bengiovanni had agreed to go with Silberman to meet Del Masso. Silberman was \u201capprehensive\u201d about the meeting because he had some but not all of the securities Del Masso wanted before he left for Switzerland. Silberman \u201cwanted to buy . . . some time.\u201d Silberman wanted Bengiovanni present \u201cas a buffer\u201d because Silberman thought \u201cDel Masso would be upset if he did not get all the stocks\u201d and \u201cif I went there by myself, there could be a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Silberman further testified that after he and Bengiovanni met Del Masso and Yvette Nance at the airport, they left in Del Masso\u2019s Lincoln with Bengiovanni sitting behind Del Masso and Silberman seated behind Ms. Nance. After they had driven to the area of Jack London Square and spotted Silberman\u2019s automobile, Del Masso parked his Lincoln. Bengiovanni \u201cappeared to be sleeping.\u201d Del Masso stated to Silberman: \u201cWe have some business to talk over. Do you want to go up to the office?\u201d Silberman replied \u201cNo,\u201d and stated in effect that it \u201cwould be tough\u201d for him to meet with Del Masso the following day. Del Masso then \u201cturned around ... in his seat,\u201d pointed a gun at Silberman, and stated, \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Silberman \u201cgrabbed at the gun,\u201d which \u201cwent off\u2019 more than once. Silberman and Del Masso struggled for the gun. Silberman \u201cgot the gun away from him\u201d and shot Del Masso. As Del Masso \u201cstarted to open the car [door],\u201d Silberman \u201cpointed the gun at him and shot.\u201d In a daze, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Silberman started pursuing Del Masso. Silberman chased Del Masso to Jack London Square, where \u201cI just kept shooting him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Silberman testified that he never saw Bengiovanni with a gun that night. Bengiovanni did not shoot Del Masso. Neither Silberman nor Bengiovanni shot Ms. Nance.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Defendant Gino Bengiovanni testified as follows: David Silberman is a good friend whom he has known for about eight years. Bengiovanni spoke to Silberman on the morning of October 19th and agreed to \u201cmeet a friend\u201d of Silberman. Silberman stated that he owed Del Masso about $120,000, consisting of \u201cmonies that he had borrowed and . . . gold that he had taken.\u201d Silberman wanted Bengiovanni to accompany him because \u201cDel Masso wouldn\u2019t talk about business if I was there,\u201d and that otherwise Del Masso \u201cmight have intimidated\u201d Silberman. Bengiovanni was told that Silberman \u201cdidn\u2019t have whatever it was that he was supposed to have\u201d for Del Masso. Silberman and Bengiovanni \u201cplanned\u201d to \u201cact as though we had come in on a plane together\u201d when they met Del Masso.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Bengiovanni and Silberman met at a restaurant at about 7 p.m. that day. After dining at separate tables, they drove in Bengiovanni\u2019s van to the airport, arriving there between 8:30 and 9. They waited in the terminal until they met Del Masso and Ms. Nance. When they entered Del Masso\u2019s Lincoln, Bengiovanni sat behind Del Masso and Silberman sat \u201con my right.\u201d As Del Masso drove, he and Silberman talked about gold prices. Bengiovanni was \u201cdozing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Bengiovanni testified that while he was \u201calmost asleep still,\u201d he heard \u201ckind of a popping sound.\u201d He did not open his eyes but \u201cjust laid there, and then I heard it again.\u201d Bengiovanni \u201cdid not attach . . . much significance\u201d to the noises. He did eventually open his eyes \u201cbecause of the smell.\u201d Bengiovanni saw Silberman \u201ckind of sitting forward in his seat,\u201d with Del Masso \u201ctrying to get out the driver\u2019s door.\u201d Del Masso had blood on his back and \u201ca bullet hole ... in his back.\u201d Silberman \u201cseemed kind of wild looking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">According to Bengiovanni, Silberman then got out of the vehicle and pursued Del Masso. Bengiovanni saw that Ms. Nance was \u201clying over like she was sleeping.\u201d Bengiovanni \u201cgot out of the car and looked over toward my left and saw a figure there. I couldn\u2019t describe it. . . [a]nd I just ran the other way.\u201d He ran several blocks and \u201cI still saw that figure.\u201d Bengiovanni then went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Bengiovanni denied having a gun on the night of October 19th. He did not shoot either Del Masso or Nance. He did not \u201cmake any plans with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>. . . Silberman or do anything of an illegal nature regarding Mr. Del Mas-so, including killing him.\u201d Silberman did not ask him to \u201ccome along as muscle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The prosecution presented rebuttal evidence in the form of statements made by each defendant following his respective arrest. Lieutenant Patrick Regan testified that two days after the shooting Silberman told him that Ms. Nance\u2019s presence was \u201cunexpected\u201d; that it was \u201cGino\u201d who stated \u201cDo it now\u201d and had then produced a gun and started firing; and that he (Silberman) had thereupon \u201cjumped out of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Sergeant Frank Mellott testified that during the course of an interview on October 23d Bengiovanni told him that Silberman had asked him to go and \u201clook like muscle\u201d when Silberman met a man to whom Silberman \u201cowed . . . a lot of money . . . that he was supposed to reimburse,\u201d and that the man \u201cwanted it back.\u201d According to Bengiovanni, after he and Silberman met \u201cMr. D.\u201d at the airport and \u201cdrove down to the produce area in Oakland[,] . . . Mr. D. . . . started to get out of the car, and when Mr. D. turned around, . . . Silberman pulled a gun and started shooting. ... At that point Mr. Bengiovanni said that he split, he left the scene.\u201d Sergeant Richard Randall corroborated Mellott\u2019s testimony that during the interview Bengiovanni had stated that Silberman asked him to \u201ccome along and look like muscle\u201d and that it was Silberman who \u201cpulled out a gun and started shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Silberman took the stand to deny having told Lieutenant Regan that he saw Bengiovanni produce the gun and start shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">After three days of deliberations, the jury returned verdicts finding that (1) both defendants were guilty as charged on all counts; (2) the special circumstance allegations were true as to both Silberman and Bengiovanni; (3) all other enhancement allegations against Bengiovanni were likewise true; and (4) the enhancement allegations against Silberman in count II were true but those in count I were not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">With respect to the murder count, the jury was unable to return verdicts during the penalty phase of the trial. After the prosecution announced its intention not to seek a retrial, all parties and counsel stipulated that the court could fix and impose the penalty of life imprisonment without possibility of parole on the murder count in accordance with section 190.4, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Each defendant appealed from the ensuing judgment of conviction. In an unpublished opinion filed March 25, 1985, Division Five of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>concluded that the only substantive charge which had to be reversed was Bengiovanni\u2019s conviction for violating section 12021. The causes were remanded for resentencing in order to allow the trial court an opportunity to correct minor sentencing errors and to consider whether to exercise its discretionary power pursuant to section 1385 to dismiss the special circumstance findings in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 470 [637 P.2d 1029].</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">When proceedings were resumed in the trial court, defendants presented evidence and argument in support of their motions to dismiss the special circumstance findings. Those motions were denied, whereupon the trial court resentenced defendants.  These timely appeals followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Both Silberman and Bengiovanni contend that there is an absence of substantial evidence supporting the special circumstance findings. Our function in evaluating these claims, which does not extend to deciding whether this court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendants\u2019 guilt, is governed by fixed and familiar principles.  \u201c \u2018When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence\u2014i.e., evidence that is credible and of solid value\u2014from which a[ny] rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citations.] In applying this test, we must \u2018presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 578 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144]; accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 273, 284 [248 Cal.Rptr. 678]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dominick </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1174, 1207 [227 Cal.Rptr. 849].) These principles apply regardless of \u201c[w]hether the evidence presented at trial is direct or circumstantial[\u2014]the relevant inquiry on appeal remains whether <em>any </em>reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Towler </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 105, 118 [181 Cal.Rptr. 391, 641 P.2d 1253] [original italics]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 589, 611 [244 Cal.Rptr. 200, 749 P.2d 854]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333, 346-347 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802].) We must bear in mind that circumstantial evidence by itself suffices to establish proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd, supra, </em>at p. 347; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 210 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reilly </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 421, 424 [90 Cal.Rptr. 417, 475 P.2d 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Because much of the evidence was circumstantial and conflicting, we deem it appropriate to preface our discussion of defendants\u2019 claims by establishing what the record\u2014viewed most favorably to the judgments\u2014 shows happened at the time Ms. Nance was killed. We take the following as proven: When Mr. Del Masso halted his Lincoln near his office, he was in the driver\u2019s seat, Nance was beside him in the front passenger seat, Silberman sat in the rear seat behind Del Masso, and Bengiovanni was seated behind Ms. Nance. Once the Lincoln was parked, it was an awake Bengiovanni who, at Silberman\u2019s direction, produced the weapon and fired the first bullet into Del Masso. While all concerned were still in the vehicle, Bengiovanni then fired the fatal shots (the two \u201cpops\u201d heard by Mr. Del Masso) into Ms. Nance\u2019s skull. Silberman did not get his hands on the pistol and did not use it until he commenced his pursuit of Mr. Del Masso. Bengiovanni then left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">With these preliminaries concluded, we now turn to the particular arguments raised by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">\n<em>Silberman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">The prosecution argued that defendant Silberman was guilty of murder for financial gain because he set out to have Mr. Del Masso killed in order to prevent Del Masso from discovering Silberman\u2019s \u201cmisappropriations\u201d and demanding repayment. Silberman contends that the special circumstance finding returned by the jury is defective as a matter of law because there is a total absence of evidence showing that he had a pecuniary motive for killing Ms. Nance or that he obtained any financial gain from her death. He further argues that even if he had a monetary motive to kill Mr. Del Masso, and even if Del Masso had died, \u201cthere was no future financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>gain whatsoever that would or could directly result\u201d to Silberman as the result of Del Masso\u2019s death. Citing the limiting construction adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 731, 751 [209 Cal.Rptr. 328, 691 P.2d 994, 64 A.L.R.4th 723], that \u201cthe financial gain special circumstance applies only when the victim\u2019s death is the consideration for, or an essential prerequisite to, the financial gain sought by the defendant,\u201d Silberman submits that he had already realized all possible financial gain from Del Masso; because he could not benefit further from Del Masso\u2019s death, Silberman contends that it could not qualify as \u201can essential prerequisite to[] the financial gain sought.\u201d These arguments possess a superficial allure, but they do not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Contrary to Silberman\u2019s arguments, we do not read the <em>Bigelow </em>construction as stating an inflexible sine qua non for all murder for financial gain prosecutions. The problem confronted by the <em>Bigelow </em>court was that the language of subdivision (a)(1), if \u201c[r]ead broadly, . . . would create a large area of overlap between this special circumstance and that of felony murder (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)), since most robberies, as well as many burglaries, kidnapings and arsons, are committed for financial gain.\u201d (37 Cal.3d 731 at p. 750.) The court adopted the limiting construction quoted above in order \u201cto minimize those cases in which multiple circumstances will apply to the same conduct, thereby reducing the risk that multiple findings on special circumstances will prejudice the defendant. Such a limiting construction will not prejudice the prosecution, since there will remain at least one special circumstance\u2014either financial gain or felony murder\u2014 applicable in virtually all cases in which the defendant killed to obtain money or other property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 751.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">It is crucial to place <em>Bigelow </em>in its proper context. The court\u2019s concern was directed to the harmful overlap between statutes making the same conduct criminal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1025 [254 Cal.Rptr. 586, 766 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 375, 409-410 [243 Cal.Rptr. 842, 749 P.2d 279]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 337, 339 [238 Cal.Rptr. 257]; cf. \u00a7 654.) The limiting construction protects the defendant in those situations where both felony murder and murder for financial gain may be charged. But the court has subsequently concluded that <em>\u201cBigelow\u2019s </em>formulation should be applied when it is important to serve the purposes underlying that decision, but that it is not intended to restrict construction of \u2018for financial gain\u2019 when overlap is <em>not </em>a concern.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>at p. 410 [original italics]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1142, 1178 [259 Cal.Rptr. 701, 774 P.2d 730] [\u201cOur recent decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard . . . </em>endorsed a broader interpretation of the statute for cases ... in which felony murder is not charged\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>at p. 1027.) This common sense approach has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>not been difficult to implement. Murder for financial gain is inapplicable in cases where the killing obviously constitutes felony murder. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Adcox </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 207, 246 [253 Cal.Rptr. 55, 763 P.2d 906]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 604, 638 [247 Cal.Rptr. 573, 754 P.2d 1070]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montiel </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 910, 927-928 [218 Cal.Rptr. 572 [705 P.2d 1248]; <em>Newberry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 238, 242 [213 Cal.Rptr. 129].) The special circumstance of murder for financial gain has been properly found where a person kills to obtain insurance proceeds <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra; People </em>v. <em>Roehler </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 353 [213 Cal.Rptr. 353]) or hires another to commit the killing <em>(People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 337) or the person hired to \u201crough up\u201d someone who ends up committing homicide <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra) </em>or one who kills to avoid having to repay a debt <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The last-mentioned and most recent decision by our Supreme Court is especially instructive. The defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983, murdered his former wife, whom he had been ordered to pay money for child support and division of their community property. He was convicted of murder for financial gain and sentenced to death.  In the course of affirming the guilt phase aspect of that judgment, the Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the death of his former wife \u201cdid not result directly in any financial benefit to him\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">\u201cProof of actual pecuniary benefit to the defendant from the victim\u2019s death is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish the financial-gain special circumstance. As we recently explained, \u2018the relevant inquiry is whether the defendant committed the murder in the expectation that he would thereby obtain the desired financial gain.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal. 3d at p. 409.) . . . [ft] Defendant argues . . . that the term \u2018gain\u2019 means a profit or increase and does not include the mere avoidance or cancellation of a financial obligation. The proposed construction is artificially restrictive and does not accord with the ordinary meaning of the statutory term. In common usage, the cancellation of a debt or the avoidance of a loss constitutes a financial benefit or gain. The construction urged by defendant would result in an arbitrary and irrational distinction, moreover since a killing to avoid a loss is as basely motivated and repugnant as a killing for a positive reward or profit. We conclude that a murder for the purpose of avoiding a debt is a murder for financial gain within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivision (a)(1).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1025.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number><em>Edelbacher </em>leaves no room for doubting that Silberman had a pecuniary motive for seeking Mr. Del Masso\u2019s death or that he would profit thereby. The exact value of the embezzled gold, unpaid loans, and outstanding uncompleted gold stock transactions owing to Del Masso from Silberman is not established with total precision. According to Silberman\u2019s own testimony, the total sum was at least $200,000, which was more than four times the amount owed by Edelbacher. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1026.) As will be shown, there is no principled basis for placing Silberman\u2019s defalcatory commitments on a different footing from Edelbacher\u2019s judicially ordered obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The contention that Silberman may have already achieved his gain from Mr. Del Masso prior to October 19th is only partially correct, and thus falls short of demonstrating an insuperable legal defect in the special circumstance finding. It is true that Del Masso\u2019s death would not put additional money in Silberman\u2019s pockets. But Del Masso\u2019s death was \u201can essential prerequisite\u201d to Silberman preserving the gain he had already realized. Killing Mr. Del Masso would relieve Silberman of the necessity of restoring the assets he had, to use the prosecutor\u2019s gentle term, \u201cmisappropriated.\u201d If, as appeared inevitable, Del Masso would discover Silberman\u2019s misappropriations, only Del Masso\u2019s death would prevent that discovery and the equally inevitable demand for restitution. Averting that demand would amount to a financial benefit for Silberman, who would be spared the necessity of making repayment. Given his extremely precarious financial state, Silberman could only view the prospect of repayment with a dismay that was the midwife to a homicidal panic intended to effect a unilateral cancellation of his debt to Del Masso. \u201c[T]he cancellation of [that] debt or the avoidance of [that] loss constitutes a financial . . . gain . . . within the meaning of section 190.2, subdivision (a)(1).\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">We have it from the Supreme Court that \u201c[p]roof of actual pecuniary benefit to the defendant from the victim\u2019s death is n[ot] necessary ... to establish the financial-gain special circumstance.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal. 3d 983 at p. 1025; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal. 3d 375 at p. 409, fn. 9.) The fact that the prosecution was unable to trace a pecuniary benefit to Silberman is therefore without consequence. His subjective motivations are more important. \u201cThe special circumstance focuses on the defendant\u2019s intention <em>at the time the murder was committed. . . . . </em>[T]he relevant inquiry is whether the defendant committed the murder in the expectation that he would thereby obtain the desired financial gain.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>at p. 409 [original italics].) \u201cWhat is relevant is the particular defendant\u2019s purpose, whether or not achievable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 410, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Silberman\u2019s debt might technically survive Del Masso\u2019s death (see Prob. Code, \u00a7 573), but this legal possibility does not preclude a finding that Silberman acted with the expectation of financial gain previously explained. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1026.) Silberman could well have been motivated by the belief that all trace of these unrecorded transactions would be obliterated by killing Del Masso. We take as proven Mr. Del Masso\u2019s testimony that he was first shot by Bengiovanni after Silberman told Bengiovanni \u201cDo it. I said do it now.\u201d This sequence is pregnant with inferences. The first is that because Bengiovanni acted as he did in response to Silberman\u2019s seemingly innocuous command, Silberman\u2019s words had a special meaning for both men. It could further be inferred that knowledge of that meaning demonstrates a preexisting understanding between Silberman and Bengiovanni, an understanding reached during the lengthy period they were together prior to meeting Del Masso and Vance at the airport. The fact that Bengiovanni did not hesitate, did not merely brandish the weapon, but fired it point-blank at Del Masso could lead one to conclude that the preexisting understanding amounted to an agreement that Bengiovanni would kill Del Masso when ordered to do so by Silberman. Indeed, this is the only possible interpretation of the circumstantial evidence compatible with our duties to \u201c \u2018review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment\u2019 \u201d and to \u201c \u2018presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier [of fact] could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 572 at p. 578.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">There remains only to link Silberman\u2019s motive to kill Del Masso with Ms. Nance\u2019s death. Whether or not either Silberman or Bengiovanni anticipated that Del Masso would be accompanied by Ms. Nance is irrelevant. Once she did appear, she inescapably came to be included within the lethal plan against her consort. If (as we explain hereafter) Bengiovanni was hired by Silberman to kill Del Masso, both Silberman and Bengiovanni would naturally believe that their respective financial gains could only be preserved and enjoyed if they were not suspected of causing Del Masso\u2019s death. It should be remembered that \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether the defendant committed the murder in the expectation that he would thereby obtain the desired financial gain.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 375 at p. 409; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1025.) The fact that their plan was frustrated by Del Masso\u2019s survival is irrelevant. \u201cWhat is relevant is the particular defendant\u2019s purpose, whether or not achievable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>at p. 410, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The bottom line is that although Silberman had the financial incentive for Del Masso\u2019s death, he was an aider and abettor to Bengiovanni, who fired the actual rounds into Ms. Nance\u2019s skull. As the aider and abettor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>actual killer, Silberman could be convicted of murder for financial gain. (See \u00a7 190.2, subd. (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 731 at p. 750, fn. 11; <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 337 at pp. 339-340.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the instigator of the lethal events of October 19th, Silberman is no less guilty or culpable than the actual triggerman. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>at p. 340.) The record of the trial has ample substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Silberman committed murder for financial gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">\n<em>Bengiovanni</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The prosecution argued that defendant Bengiovanni was guilty of murder for financial gain because he was hired by Silberman to kill Mr. Del Masso, and that he was paid in part with the $5,000 Silberman had borrowed from Del Masso less than a week before the shooting. Bengiovanni contends that the special circumstance finding must be overturned because there is no evidence that he \u201cwas promised, received, or intended to obtain anything of financial value.\u201d As Bengiovanni sees it, even if he had been hired to kill Del Masso, \u201cit was Nance who was killed. There was no evidence of financial dealings between appellant and the victim, nor was there any suggestion that appellant was paid more to kill Nance or that payment was contingent on this additional killing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Evidence of Bengiovanni\u2019s financial motive is admittedly circumstantial, but substantial nevertheless. Our starting point, as mentioned above, is that Bengiovanni was the original shooter. Why would he shoot Del Masso and kill Nance? Simple friendship for Silberman is a highly dubious motive, and one implicitly rejected by the jury. There is nothing suggesting that Bengiovanni acted in self-defense. Unlike Silberman, Bengiovanni had no debt to Del Masso that he thought would disappear with the debtor\u2019s death. Once these possible explanations are excluded, a contract killing looms with increasing plausibility. What other motivation fits Bengiovanni\u2019s conduct? Even if it is believed that Silberman brought Bengiovanni along to cow Del Masso, Bengiovanni\u2019s murder of Ms. Nance remains utterly inexplicable. But if Bengiovanni was engaged to kill Del Masso, Ms. Nance\u2019s death became a tragic inevitability. If Bengiovanni was hired to kill Del Masso, Ms. Nance\u2019s unexpected appearance sealed her fate and spelled her doom. As we have seen, the pertinent focus is upon Bengiovanni\u2019s subjective intent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1025; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 375 at pp. 409-410 [text &amp; fn. 10].) Thinking his first shot would take care of Del Masso, Bengiovanni immediately fired two shots to dispatch Ms. Nance. If Bengiovanni was to be paid for Del Masso\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>death, he would not unreasonably decide that his future receipt and enjoyment of his remuneration required Ms. Nance\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\"> The fact that at the trial and at the <em>Williams </em>hearing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the prosecution was unable to trace the transmission of the $5,000 from Silberman to Del Masso does not exonerate Bengiovanni. \u201cProof of actual pecuniary benefit to the defendant from the victim\u2019s death is n[ot] necessary ... to establish the financial-gain special circumstance.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 983 at p. 1025; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d 337 at pp. 339-340.) The expectation of financial benefit will suffice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal. 3d 375 at p. 409, fn. 9, 412-413.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even if the prosecution was incorrect in arguing that Bengiovanni had in fact received some payment, it defies logic in the circumstances shown by the record to maintain that Bengiovanni was acting from altruism. The expectation of future payment (regardless of whether some money had already changed hands) is a perfectly sensible inference, one we must presume the jury accepted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 572 at p. 578.) The circumstantial evidence supports the jury deciding that Bengiovanni was guilty of committing murder for financial gain in the form of remuneration from Silberman. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Bloyd, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 333 at pp. 346-347; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra; People </em>v. <em>Reilly, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 421 at pp. 424-425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">There is a separate and independent basis for our conclusion. Even if Bengiovanni acted without the reality or expectation of payment from Silberman, he would be equally liable because he was an aider and abettor of Silberman\u2019s scheme to obtain financial gain from Del Masso\u2019s death. (See \u00a7 190.2, subd.

The purported appeal from the order denying the motion to dismiss the special circumstance finding is dismissed. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>The clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment showing that the one-year term of imprisonment imposed on count II pursuant to section 12022 is stayed, said stay is to become permanent upon completion of the two-year term of imprisonment imposed on the same count pursuant to section 12022.5.

Order No. 11825, 40 Fed.Reg. 1003 (Dec. 31, 1974).)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">A total and uncompromising divergence exists in the testimony of Del Masso and Silberman concerning certain of their alleged dealings. The details of these transactions, which may have involved massive sums and fraud on a staggering scale, might be of interest to the Internal Revenue Service or the Franchise Tax Board, but they are not relevant to these appeals. The evidence narrated in the text has therefore been confined to those incidents with respect to which Silberman and Del Masso were in substantial agreement and which are germane to resolution of the issues presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b946-10\"> In his notice of appeal Silberman purports to appeal \u201cfrom the judgment and sentence\u201d as well as the trial court\u2019s order denying his \u201cmotion to strike the special circumstance finding.\u201d An appeal from both the judgment and the sentence is redundant: \u201cThe judgment is the sentence and appealing from both is tautological. The affirmance of the judgment carries with it the affirmance of the sentence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sweeney </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 27, 33, fn. 1 [9 Cal.Rptr. 793, 357 P.2d 1049].) This duplication does not, however, work to Silberman\u2019s disadvantage, because either designation in a notice of appeal suffices to authorize review of the judgment or its functional equivalent (see \u00a7 1237, subd. (a)) and all orders which preceded entry of that judgment. Because the order denying Silberman\u2019s motion to dismiss the special circumstance finding was made prior to the resentencing which constitutes the judgment (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 85, 93, fn. 6 [115 Cal.Rptr. 225, 524 P.2d 353]), it may be reviewed on appeal from the judgment. That order not being appealable, the purported appeal from it will be dismissed. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Succop </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 483, 486, 490 [55 Cal.Rptr. 397, 421 P.2d 405]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valenti </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 199, 204, 209 [316 P.2d 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Bengiovanni\u2019s appeal is correctly taken from the judgment alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\"> Justice Kaufman\u2019s lead opinion in <em>Edelbacher </em>was not joined by any other member of the court. An examination of the concurring and dissenting opinions, however, establishes that the court was in fact unanimous on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\"> The prosecutor argued to the jury that Silberman and Bengiovanni \u201cwere aiding and abetting each other as principals in a planned murder.\u201d The trial court thereafter instructed the jury on aiding and abetting liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\"> The prosecution\u2019s theory at trial was that the $5,000 borrowed by Silberman from Del Masso shortly before the shooting was earmarked as partial payment for Bengiovanni killing Del Masso. Defendants presented evidence at the <em>Williams </em>hearing that none of this money went to Bengiovanni but was in fact used by Silberman for other purposes. Both Silberman and Bengiovanni see this as conclusive proof that they had no agreement for Del Masso\u2019s murder. On this direct review of the special circumstance findings returned by the jury it is inappropriate to extend our review beyond the evidence heard by the jury. (See <em>In re Rogers </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 429, 437, fn. 6 [169 Cal.Rptr. 222, 619 P.2d 415]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Merriam </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 390, 396-397 [58 Cal.Rptr. 1, 426 P.2d 161].) Defendants\u2019 posttrial evidence will, however, be examined in connection with their claim that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their respective motions to set aside the special circumstance findings. (See part II, <em>post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\"> The court used this hypothetical: \u201c[I]f a man murders his wife intending to benefit from life insurance proceeds, but it turns out that the policies have been cancelled, the special circumstance could still apply.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 375 at p. 412.) A variation of this hypothetical would allow the conviction of a person who killed for insurance proceeds, even if those proceeds are never realized, as was the case in <em>People </em>v. <em>Roehler, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.3d 353. No authority can be found for the proposition that prompt and effective police work should work a windfall for a killer who is caught before getting or spending money stained with the victim\u2019s blood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b954-8\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1099.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
