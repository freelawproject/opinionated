Skov contends (1) the trial court improperly took judicial notice of various recorded documents and (2) the second amended complaint sufficiently pleaded her causes of action for wrongful foreclosure, unlawful business practices, and declaratory relief. We conclude that the second amended complaint sufficiently pleaded a violation of Civil Code section 2923.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">In December 2003, Skov obtained a loan of $1.5 million, which was secured by a deed of trust on her residential property in Saratoga. The deed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>trust identified Skov as the \u201cBorrower,\u201d Gateway as the \u201cLender,\u201d Financial Title Company as \u201cTrustee,\u201d and MERS as \u201cacting solely as a nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns.\u201d MERS is also identified as \u201cthe beneficiary under this Security Instrument.\u201d The deed of trust further stated that \u201cBorrower understands and agrees that MERS holds only legal title to the interests granted by the Borrower in this Security Instrument, but, if necessary to comply with law or custom, MERS (as nominee for Lender and Lender\u2019s successors and assigns) has the right; to exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">After Skov stopped making payments pursuant to the terms of the promissory note, NDEx, which identified itself as an agent for MERS, served Skov with a notice of default on June 10, 2009. A declaration of compliance with section 2923.5 was recorded with the notice of default. On July 16, 2009, MERS assigned all beneficial interest in the deed of trust to U.S. Bank. On July 20, 2009, U.S. Bank substituted NDEx as trustee for Financial Title Company. On September 18, 2009, NDEx recorded a notice of trustee\u2019s sale, which had been sent to Skov.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">On June 10, 2010, Skov filed her second amended complaint and alleged nine causes of action, only three of which are the subject of the present appeal. The first cause of action for wrongful disclosure alleged that there were several improprieties in the assignment, transfer and exercise of the power of sale in the deed of trust. More specifically, Skov alleged that since U.S. Bank and MERS were not assignees of the original note identified in the deed of trust, they did not have the right to exercise the power of sale contained in the deed of trust, and thus U.S. Bank was not entitled to any debt on the property. It was also alleged that U.S. Bank failed to comply with section 2923.5 \u201cuntil on or about July 10, 2009.\u201d The eighth cause of action for unlawful business practices (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) alleged that U.S. Bank failed to comply with section 2923.5 because it did not contact or attempt to contact her to discuss her options to avoid foreclosure prior to filing the notice of default. The ninth cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief sought a determination of the parties\u2019 legal rights and duties and that the foreclosure of the property be permanently enjoined. Skov also sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">U.S. Bank filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint. In support of its demurrer, U.S. Bank requested judicial notice of the deed of trust, the notice of default, the notice of default declaration, the assignment of the deed of trust from MERS to U.S. Bank, the substitution of trustee, and the notice of trustee\u2019s sale. The trial court granted the request for judicial notice, sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, and dismissed the action with prejudice. Skov filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AW3\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer, \u201c \u2018we examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory, such facts being assumed true for this purpose. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. (2001) 25 </em>Cal.4th 412, 415 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d 1189].) We may also consider matters that have been judicially noticed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Committee for Green Foothills </em>v. <em>Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 32, 42 [105 Cal.Rptr.3d 181, 224 P.3d 920].) \u201cGenerally it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cooper v. Leslie Salt Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 627, 636 [75 Cal.Rptr. 766, 451 P.2d 406].)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">D. Section 2923.5</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Skov also contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the declaration of compliance with section 2923.5 conclusively proved such compliance. U.S. Bank argues (1) the second amended complaint does not allege facts showing noncompliance with section 2923.5; (2) section 2923.5 does not create a private claim of action; and (3) the National Bank Act (June 3, 1864, ch. 106, 13 Stat. 99) preempts section 2923.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">1. Statutory Compliance</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Section 2923.5, subdivision (a)(2), provides that a mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent must contact the borrower \u201cin person or by telephone in order to assess the borrower\u2019s financial situation and explore options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure\u201d or satisfy due diligence requirements before a notice of default is filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 2923.5 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>require the lender to modify the loan. <em>(Mabry v. Superior Court </em>(2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 208, 214 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 201] <em>(Mabry).) </em>The only remedy for noncompliance with the statute is the postponement of the foreclosure sale. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Whether a defendant has complied with a statute is a question of fact. (See <em>Daum v. SpineCare Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1306 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 260].) Here, the second amended complaint alleged in relevant part: Skov \u201cwas fully available to meet with U.S. Bank\u201d to explore foreclosure options; she hired attorneys or other representatives, who telephoned and sent letters to U.S. Bank which were unanswered; U.S. Bank failed and refused to evaluate her finances, to advise her of her right to meet with U.S. Bank to discuss foreclosure avoidance options, and to give her a HUD (United States Department of Housing and Urban Development) telephone number; and U.S. Bank did not comply with the requirements of section 2923.5 because it did not contact her until \u201con or about July 10, 2009,\u201d which was after it had recorded the notice of default on June 12, 2009. In response, U.S. Bank requested judicial notice of the notice of default declaration that stated that the requirements of section 2923.5 had been met on June 9, 2009. However, whether U.S. Bank complied with section 2923.5 is the type of fact that is reasonably subject to dispute, and thus, not a proper subject of judicial notice. (See <em>Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. </em>(2011 )198 Cal.App.4th 256, 266 [129 Cal.Rptr.3d 467].)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">U.S. Bank also argues that Skov has failed to allege any facts to support her claim. U.S. Bank asserts that her allegation that she was \u201cfully available\u201d to meet with U.S. Bank does not establish noncompliance with section 2923.5, claiming that \u201cdespite Skov\u2019s supposed \u2018full availability,\u2019 U.S. Bank <em>may have complied </em>with section 2923.5 by attempting, unsuccessfully but in good faith, to contact Skov.\u201d (Italics added.) However, as U.S. Bank\u2019s argument recognizes, it may not have complied with the statutory requirements. Assuming the truth of Skov\u2019s allegations, the issue of compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>cannot be resolved at this stage of the litigation. <em>(McCall </em>v. <em>PacifiCare of Cal., Inc., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">2. Private Right of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">U.S. Bank next contends that there is no private right of action for noncompliance with section 2923.5. Relying on <em>Lu v. Hawaiian Gardens Casino, Inc. </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 592 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 498, 236 P.3d 346] <em>(Lu), </em>U.S. Bank asserts that <em>Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 208, which held to the contrary, was wrongly decided.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>Lu, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th 592 considered whether Labor Code section 351, which provides that a gratuity is the sole property of the employee to whom it was given, contains a private right to sue. Relying on <em>Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman's Fund Ins. Companies </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287, 305 [250 Cal.Rptr. 116, 758 P.2d 58], <em>Lu </em>stated that \u201cwhether a party has a right to sue depends on whether the Legislature has \u2018manifested an intent to create such a private cause of action\u2019 under the statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lu, </em>at p. 596.) However, when the statutory language does not \u201cstrongly and directly indicate that the Legislature intended to create a private cause of action [citation,]\u201d then courts must examine the legislative history. <em>(Lu, </em>at p. 597.) Turning to the language of Labor Code section 351, <em>Lu </em>noted that it did not expressly state that an employee had a right to bring an action for any violation of the statute. <em>(Lu, </em>at p. 598.) <em>Lu </em>also observed that related statutes provided that an employer that violated Labor Code section 351 was guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine and/or imprisonment, and that the Department of Industrial Relations was charged with enforcement of the statute. <em>(Lu, </em>at p. 598.) After reviewing the legislative history, <em>Lu </em>concluded that there was \u201cno clear indication\u201d that the Legislature intended to create a private right to sue under Labor Code section 351. <em>(Lu, </em>at pp. 598-601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Relying on the Restatement Second of Torts test for determining tort liability for a statutory violation, the plaintiff in <em>Lu </em>argued that a private action was implied from the statute. <em>(Lu, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at pp. 601-602.) \u201cThe \u2018Restatement approach allows the court itself to create a new private right to sue, even if the Legislature never considered creation of such a right, if the court is of the opinion that a private right to sue is \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cneeded.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602.) The plaintiff further argued that this approach was confirmed in <em>Katzberg </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 300 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 58 P.3d 339], <em>(Lu, </em>at p. 602.) <em>Lu </em>rejected the plaintiff\u2019s arguments and distinguished <em>Katzberg </em>on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>that it involved a private action to remedy a constitutional violation. <em>(Lu, </em>at pp. 602-603.) <em>Lu </em>also noted that there was no language \u201c \u2018expressly entitling] individuals to a refund or any other type of payment for violation of the statute.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lu, </em>at p. 603, fn. 8.) In response to the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that the Department of Industrial Relations had no authority to recover misappropriated gratuities, <em>Lu </em>stated that there were other remedies available to the plaintiff, such as an action for conversion. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 603-604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Here, as in Lu, section 2923.5 does not expressly provide for a private right of action. However, unlike in <em>Lu, </em>there are no statutes which provide either a penalty for noncompliance with section 2923.5 or designate any administrative agency with enforcement of the statute. Moreover, unlike in <em>Lu, </em>there are no other remedies available to a borrower if there is a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><em>Mabry </em>recognized that \u201ccourts ... do not favor constructions of statutes that render them advisory only, or a dead letter. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 218-219.) <em>Mabry </em>next noted that \u201cstatutes on the same subject matter or of the same subject should be construed together so that all the parts of the statutory scheme are given effect. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 219.) <em>Mabry </em>then examined section 2924g, subdivision (c)(1), which outlines the grounds for postponing a foreclosure sale, in conjunction with section 2923.5.  \u201cSection 2923.5 and section 2924g, subdivision (c)(1)(A), when read together, establish a natural, logical whole, and one wholly consonant with the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting 2923.5 to have individual borrowers and lenders \u2018assess\u2019 and \u2018explore\u2019 alternatives to foreclosure: If section 2923.5 is not complied with, then there is no valid notice of default and, without a valid notice of default, a foreclosure sale cannot proceed. The available, existing remedy is found in the ability of a court in section 2924g, subdivision (c)(1)(A), to postpone the sale until there has been compliance with section 2923.5. Reading section 2923.5 together with section 2924g, subdivision (c)(1)(A) gives section 2923.5 real effect. The alternative would mean that the Legislature conferred a right on <em>individual </em>borrowers in section 2923.5 without any means of enforcing that right.\u201d <em>(Mabry, </em>at pp. 223-224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\"><em>Mabry </em>also considered the legislative history of section 2923.5. <em>(Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 219-220.) <em>Mabry </em>recognized that an early version of section 2923.5 expressly provided for a private right of action, which was not included in the final version, thus suggesting that \u201cthe Legislature may not have wanted to have section 2923.5 enforced privately.\u201d <em>(Mabry, </em>at pp. 219-220.) However, <em>Mabry </em>stated that this factor was not dispositive, reasoning that \u201csilence is consonant with the idea that section 2923.5 was the result of a legislative compromise, with each side content to let the courts struggle with the issue.\u201d <em>(Mabry, </em>at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Mabry </em>also observed that \u201ccompliance with section 2923.5 is necessarily an individualized process. After all, the details of a borrower\u2019s financial situation and the options open to a particular borrower to avoid foreclosure are going to vary, sometimes widely, from borrower to borrower. . . .[\u00b6] . . . [I]n order to have its obvious goal of forcing parties to <em>communicate </em>(the statutory words are \u2018assess\u2019 and \u2018explore\u2019) about a borrower\u2019s situation and the options to avoid foreclosure, section 2923.5 necessarily confers an individual right.\u201d <em>(Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at p. 224.) Thus, <em>Mabry </em>noted that <em>Moradi-Shalal </em>was distinguishable on the ground that the statute in that case \u201ccontemplates a frequent or general business <em>practice, </em>and thus its very text is necessarily directed at those who regulate the insurance industry.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\"><em>Mabry </em>concluded that two factors outweighed the Legislature\u2019s dropping of an express provision for a private right of action. <em>(Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at p. 225.) \u201cFirst, the very structure of section 2923.5 is inherently individual. That fact strongly suggests a legislative intention to allow individual enforcement of the statute. The statute would become a meaningless dead letter if no individual enforcement were allowed: It would mean that the Legislature created an inherently individual right and decided there was no remedy at all. [\u00b6] Second, when section 2923.5 was enacted as an urgency measure, there already was an existing enforcement mechanism at hand\u2014section 2924g. There was no need to write a provision into section 2923.5 allowing a borrower to obtain a postponement of a foreclosure sale, since such a remedy was already present in section 2924g.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Given that <em>Lu </em>is distinguishable from the present case, we find the analysis in <em>Mabry </em>persuasive. Accordingly, we conclude that the Legislature intended to allow a private right of action under section 2923.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">3. Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">U.S. Bank also contends that the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 21 et seq.) preempts section 2923.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The National Bank Act \u201cvests national banks . . . with authority to exercise \u2018all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.\u2019 (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Seventh).) Real estate lending is expressly designated as part of the business of banking. [(12 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a).)] [\u00b6] As the agency charged with administering the [National Bank] Act, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u2018OCC\u2019) has the primary responsibility for the surveillance of the \u2018business of banking\u2019 authorized by the Act. [Citation.] To carry out this responsibility, the OCC has the power to promulgate regulations and to use its rulemaking authority to define the \u2018incidental powers\u2019 of national banks beyond those specifically enumerated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the statute. [Citations.] OCC regulations possess the same preemptive effect as the Act itself. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Martinez v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2010) 598 F.3d 549, 554-555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) regulations, which outline the powers of national banks, include 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 34.4(a). In 2009, it provided that \u201cstate laws that obstruct, impair, or condition a national bank\u2019s ability to fully exercise its Federally authorized real estate lending powers do not apply to national banks.\u201d More specifically, \u201ca national bank may make real estate loans . . . without regard to state law limitations concerning ... [\u00b6].. . [\u00b6] . . . [processing, origination, servicing, sale or purchase of, or investment or participation in, mortgages . . . .\u201d (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.4(a)(10) (2009).) However, \u201c[s]tate laws on the following subjects are not inconsistent with the real estate lending powers of national banks and apply to national banks to the extent that they only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks\u2019 real estate lending powers: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . Acquisition and transfer of real property.\u201d (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.4(b)(6) (2009) .)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em>Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th 208 held that 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 560.2(b)(10) (2010), which is the Office of Thrift Supervision\u2019s parallel regulation under the Home Owners' Loan Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461 et seq.), did not preempt Civil Code section 2923.5. As does 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 34.4 (2012), this regulation sets forth which matters are regulated by federal law and which matters are left to state regulation. <em>(Mabry, </em>at pp. 228-229.) State laws, including \u201c[r]eal property law,\u201d are not preempted \u201cto the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of Federal savings associations . . . .\u201d (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(c)(2) (2012).) <em>Mabry </em>reasoned: \u201c[T]he <em>process of foreclosure </em>has traditionally been a matter of state real property law, a point noted both by the United States Supreme Court in <em>BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 531, 541-542 [128 L.Ed.2d 556, 114 S.Ct. 1757], and academic commentators (e.g., Alexander, <em>Federal Intervention in Real Estate Finance: Preemption and Federal Common Law </em>(1993) 71 N.C. L.Rev. 293 [\u2018Historically, real property law has been the exclusive domain of the states.\u2019 (italics omitted)]), including at least one law professor who laments that diverse state foreclosure laws tend to hinder efforts to achieve banking stability at the national level. (See Nelson, <em>Confronting the Mortgage Meltdown: A Brief for the Federalization of State Mortgage Foreclosure Law </em>(2010) 37 Pepp. L.Rev. 583, 588-590 [noting that mortgage foreclosure law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>varies from state to state, and advocating federalization of mortgage foreclosure law].) By contrast, we have not been cited to anything in the federal regulations that governs such things as initiation of foreclosure, notice of foreclosure sales, allowable times until foreclosure, or redemption periods. (Though there are commentators, like Professor Nelson, who argue there should be.) [\u00b6] Given the traditional state control over mortgage foreclosure laws, it is logical to conclude that if the Office of Thrift Supervision wanted to include foreclosure as within the preempted category of <em>loan servicing, </em>it would have been explicit. Nothing prevented the office from simply adding the words \u2018foreclosure of\u2019 to Regs, section 560.2(b)(10).\u201d <em>(Mabry, </em>at pp. 230-231, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">U.S. Bank argues that \u201c[w]hile a state law governing foreclosure procedure may not be preempted, section 2923.5 is not such a law.\u201d As <em>Mabry </em>noted, however, \u201c <em>\u2018the States have created diverse networks of judicially and legislatively crafted rules governing the foreclosure process, to achieve what each of them considers the proper balance between the needs of lenders and borrowers. . . . </em>[A]bout half of the States also permit foreclosure by exercising a private power of sale provided in the mortgage documents. . . . Foreclosure laws typically require notice to the defaulting borrower, a substantial lead time before the commencement of foreclosure proceedings, publication of a notice of sale, and strict adherence to prescribed bidding rules and auction procedures. . . . <em>(BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, supra, </em>511 U.S. at pp. 541-542)\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 230-231, fn. 17.) By requiring a lender to contact a borrower prior to filing a notice of default to \u201cassess\u201d his financial situation and to \u201cexplore\u201d options to avoid foreclosure, section 2923.5 merely sets forth one of the steps in foreclosure proceedings. Moreover, given that section 2923.5 does not require the lender to modify the loan and a lender\u2019s failure to comply with the statute is limited to providing borrowers with more time, it only incidentally affects the lending operations of a bank.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>U.S. Bank claims that section 2923.5 \u201cseeks to compel loan modifications as a means of avoiding foreclosures and curbing high foreclosure rates, mandates specific disclosures to borrowers, and requires burdensome reviews of borrower financials and proposed loan modifications\u201d thus regulating \u201cloan servicing and processing ....\u201d As <em>Mabry </em>pointed out, however, section 2923.5 must be very narrowly construed to avoid federal preemption. <em>(Mabry, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 231-232.)  Section 2923.5 does not require the lender \u201cto consider a whole new loan application or take detailed loan application information\u201d from the borrower. <em>(Mabry, </em>at p. 232.) Moreover, the exploration of options to avoid foreclosure \u201cmust necessarily be limited to merely telling the borrower the traditional ways that foreclosure can be avoided (e.g., deeds \u2018in lieu,\u2019 workouts, or short sales), as distinct from requiring the lender to engage in a process that would be functionally indistinguishable from taking a loan application in the first place.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We find <em>Mabry\u2019s </em>analysis convincing. Thus, since the federal regulation of national banks is essentially the same as that of federal savings associations, we conclude that section 2923.5 is not preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In sum, there is a factual issue as to whether there was compliance with the requirements of section 2923.5 prior to the filing of the notice of default.
