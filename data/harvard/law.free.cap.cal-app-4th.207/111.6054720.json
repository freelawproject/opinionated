Iboa told firefighters and deputies trying to put out a fire in his backyard to, among other things, \u201cget the fuck\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>off his property. He combined his belligerent words with aggressive conduct, albeit stopping short of threatening to \u201ckill\u201d the officers and of physical violence. Iboa was charged and convicted, under Penal Code section 69,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of seven counts of deterring or preventing, by means of any threat or violence, an executive officer from performing a duty imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Iboa contends on appeal that his convictions on those counts must be reversed because the First Amendment protected his speech and because the jury was not instructed his threat must have been \u201ca serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm.\u201d In the published portion of this opinion, we find that where, as here, there is sufficient evidence a defendant combined threatening language with threatening physical behavior, he may be convicted, under section 69, of threatening unlawful violence without running afoul of the First Amendment. We also conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury that a threat under section 69 must be \u201ca serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm,\u201d because that is not an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Although we conclude that there is no ground to reverse Iboa\u2019s convictions under section 69, we find, in the unpublished portion of this opinion, that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s true findings on the gang allegations as to five of the seven counts. We also find that Iboa\u2019s convictions on three counts of felony child endangerment must be reduced to misdemeanors. We reject the remaining contentions and reverse and remand this matter for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">I. <em>Factual background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">(A) <em>December 28, 2009: Iboa refuses to submit to a lawful detention (count 12).</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>(B) <em>January 26, 2010: Iboa attempts by threats to deter executive officers from performing their duties (counts 1\u20147).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On January 26, 2010, at 2:00 a.m., about 12 firefighters (including Michael Peterson, Joseph Carvalho, Jason Swan, Christopher Brown, and Fire Captain Jim De\u2019Evelyn) went to Iboa\u2019s house after receiving reports of a fire. A 10- to 12-foot pile of debris was on fire in Iboa\u2019s backyard, and 10-foot flames could be seen from the street. Asleep, Iboa was off to the side of the fire. Firefighter Carvalho woke Iboa, who grabbed a hose to help put out the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">When Fire Captain De\u2019Evelyn tried to talk to Iboa about the fire, an argument erupted. Concerned that Iboa was going to assault the captain, because Iboa \u201cwas kind of puffed-chest\u201d and \u201ccussing,\u201d firefighter Carvalho stepped between De\u2019Evelyn and Iboa. Firefighter Brown also thought that Iboa approached the captain aggressively, with \u201cjust maybe kind <em>of </em>a little physical threat, kind of a little body force.\u201d Iboa turned to go back to the house, and Carvalho, thinking that Iboa was getting a gun or knife, told the other firefighters to leave, even though they were not done putting out the fire. When Iboa ran past firefighter Swan, he heard Iboa say, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll take care of you guys\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018You\u2019ll see what happens.\u2019 \u201d Firefighter Brown thought Iboa said something like, \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to show you\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018We\u2019ll see about that.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Iboa came out of the backyard and threw out the firehose. He yelled at the firefighters to \u201cget the fuck off his property\u201d and asked \u201cwho the fuck [they] thought [they] were.\u201d He said they did not know \u201cwho the fuck\u201d he was, and he would \u201cshow [them] who\u201d he was. The fire chief instructed the firefighters to wait for sheriffs to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriffs Ryan Valento and Gabriel Frias soon arrived at the house, where the fire was still burning. Deputy Frias asked Iboa to talk to him, but Iboa said, \u201c \u2018Fuck you guys. You need a warrant. I can bum whatever I want.\u2019 \u201d Iboa lifted his shirt, exposing his Mid Town Criminals (MTC) gang tattoos, and yelled that they could not come in without a warrant, that \u201c \u2018You can\u2019t fuck with me. I\u2019m from fuckin\u2019 M-T-C,\u2019 \u201d which was tattooed on his stomach. Deputy Valento thought that Iboa, whose fists were clenched, wanted to fight. Yelling, Iboa, while lifting his shirt and acting wild, walked back and forth towards the deputies until he was eight to 10 feet from them. Deputy Valento judged it unsafe to go onto Iboa\u2019s property to take care of the fire until more deputies arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">When more deputies arrived, they jumped over the fence, and Iboa ran into the house. With their guns out, the deputies told the firefighters to put out the fire, which they quickly did. Iboa did not come back outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>(C) <em>January 27, 2010: The search of Iboa\u2019s home (counts 8-10).</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">(D) <em>Gang evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Detective Richard Cartmill at the Lancaster sheriff\u2019s station was assigned to the gang unit in Antelope Valley. He was familiar with the MTC gang in Antelope Valley and had testified approximately 10 times as an expert on the gang, which had about 120 documented members. MTC engaged \u201cin crimes such as assaults, up to and including attempted murder, weapons possession, possession for sales of drugs, vandalism, [and] robbery.\u201d It was known for selling methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Iboa had been MTC\u2019s leader for close to a decade. His home on Gadsen was a well-known MTC house. He had \u201cMTC\u201d tattooed on his stomach, \u201cMid Town Criminals\u201d tattooed on his neck, a teardrop tattoo on his face, and \u201cHeffe de Heffe\u201d on his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">According to Detective Cartmill, a gang member displays and references his gang tattoos to law enforcement to intimidate law enforcement and the general public and to enhance the gang\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">II. <em>Procedural background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">On October 22, 2010, a jury found Iboa guilty of counts 1 to 7, attempting by threat or violence to deter an executive officer from performing his or her duty (\u00a7 69);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> counts 8 to 10, felony child endangerment (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a)); count 11, possession of methamphetamine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11378); and count 12, resisting, obstructing or delaying a peace officer (\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1)). As to counts 1 to 7 and 11, the jury found true gang allegations under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1)(A). As to count 12, the jury found true a gang allegation under section 186.22, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">On January 18, 2011, the trial court sentenced Iboa to the midterm of two years on count 1 plus three years on the gang enhancement, to one year four months on count 8, to one year eight months on count 11, and to eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>months on count 12, for a total of eight years eight months in prison. The court imposed concurrent sentences on the remaining counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">III. <em>Counts 1 to 7, preventing an executive officer from performing an official duty under section 69</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">(A) <em>Sufficiency of the evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Iboa contends that his convictions under section 69 violate his First Amendment right to free speech because there was insufficient evidence anything he said was a \u201cserious expression of an intention to commit an act which would result in bodily harm\u201d to the firefighters and deputies. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u201cIn assessing a claim of insufficiency of evidence, the reviewing court\u2019s task is to review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] The federal standard of review is to the same effect: Under principles of federal due process, review for sufficiency of evidence entails not the determination whether the reviewing court itself believes the evidence at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but, instead, whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] The standard of review is the same in cases in which the prosecution relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cAlthough it is the duty of the jury to acquit a defendant if it finds that circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other innocence [citations], it is the jury, not the appellate court[,] which must be convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u2018 \u201cIf the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618]; see also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Section 69 provides: \u201cEvery person who attempts, by means of any threat or violence, to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>any duty imposed upon such officer by law, or who knowingly resists, by the use of force or violence, such officer, in the performance of his duty\u201d shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment. (See <em>In re Manuel G. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 805, 814 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 701, 941 P.2d 880].) The section prohibits two distinct types of activity\u2014\u201cthreats and violent conduct\u2014when <em>either </em>activity constitutes an attempt \u2018to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1061-1062 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388] <em>(Hines); </em>see <em>In re Manuel G., </em>at p. 814.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Where, as here, physical violence does not accompany the threat, we must be mindful of the risk of punishing First Amendment speech. The First Amendment protects expression that engages, in some fashion, public dialogue. <em>(In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 710 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365].) But where speech strays from \u201cthe values of persuasion, dialogue and free exchange of ideas, and moves toward willful threats to perform illegal acts, the state has greater latitude to regulate expression.\u201d <em>(In re </em>M.S., at p. 710.) The state may thus punish threats falling outside the purview of the First Amendment, even if the threat is pure speech. <em>(In re M.S., </em>at p. 710; <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Black </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 343, 359 [155 L.Ed.2d 535, 123 S.Ct. 1536] [a \u201c \u2018true threat\u2019 \u201d encompasses \u201cthose statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence\u201d to an individual or group].) To avoid the risk of punishing protected First Amendment speech, the \u201cthreat\u201d section 69 refers to is therefore a threat of unlawful violence in an attempt to deter the officer. <em>(In re Manuel G., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 815 [\u201cThe central requirement of the first type of offense under section 69 is an attempt to deter an executive officer from performing his or her duties imposed by law; unlawful violence, or a threat of unlawful violence, is merely the means by which the attempt is made.\u201d]; <em>People v. Superior Court (Anderson) </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 893, 895-898 [199 Cal.Rptr. 150] <em>(Anderson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Although section 69 prohibits a threat of \u201cunlawful violence,\u201d Iboa argues that section 69 instead requires a showing his threat was a \u201c \u2018serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hines, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1061.) Iboa bases this argument on <em>Hines, </em>which rejected a custodial defendant\u2019s argument that section 69 was unconstitutionally overbroad because he did not have the immediate ability to carry out his threat to kill prison guards. <em>Hines </em>said: \u201c \u2018As long as the threat reasonably appears to be a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm [citation] and its circumstances are such that there is a reasonable tendency to produce in the victim a fear that the threat will be carried out\u2019 \u201d (15 Cal.4th at p. 1061, quoting <em>In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 714), \u201cthe fact the threat may be contingent on some future event . . . does not cloak it in constitutional protection\u201d <em>(In re M.S., </em>at p. 714). <em>Hines </em>concerned constitutional challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>to statutes proscribing threats and concluded that such a statute, like section 69, will not run afoul of the First Amendment because it lacks an immediacy element. <em>(Hines, </em>at p. 1061.) In other words, threats may be prohibited even when there is no immediate danger they will be carried out, and section 69 \u201c \u2018is not unconstitutional for lacking a requirement of immediacy or imminence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hines, </em>at p. 1061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Hines\u2019s observation that the threat must be a serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm was therefore made in the context of rejecting a constitutional challenge to section 69 on overbreadth grounds. This is apparent when the entire <em>Hines </em>quote is cited and not the truncated one Iboa uses; specifically, Iboa notes that <em>Hines </em>said the threat must reasonably appear to be a \u201c \u2018serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d He ignores that the court went on to say that the threat\u2019s \u201c \u2018circumstances are such that there is a reasonable tendency to produce in the victim a fear that the threat will be carried out ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Hines, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1061.) The omitted language confirms that the court was addressing only the constitutional argument and refuting the notion that the consequence threatened must be immediately forthcoming. The court did not discuss the elements of the crime under section 69 or otherwise suggest that a \u201c \u2018serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm\u2019 \u201d is an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Rather, to sustain Iboa\u2019s conviction under section 69, there must be sufficient evidence he threatened unlawful violence. <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 895-898.) It is true that Iboa did not utter the word \u201ckill\u201d or directly and unambiguously threaten to inflict bodily harm on the firefighters or the deputies. (Cf. <em>In re Manuel G., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 811 [\u201c \u2018Me and my home boys are going to start killing you and your friends.\u2019 \u201d; \u201c \u2018Hey, you better be watching your back. And we\u2019re going to start knocking you guys off. You guys aren\u2019t so bad. I\u2019m not afraid of dying. You guys are the ones that should be afraid of dying.\u2019 \u201d]; see <em>id. </em>at p. 812 [\u201c \u2018I\u2019m tired of you guys fucking with us, and you better watch out, we\u2019re going to start knocking you guys off.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Hines, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 1060, 1059 [the defendant said Deputy Warren \u201c \u2018would be sorry [he] ever saw\u2019 defendant\u201d; he would throw bars of soap at Warren; \u201c I am going to kill you. This is a threat. You\u2019re dead.\u2019 \u201d; \u201c \u2018Stop going through my stuff or I will kick you in the face.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Anderson, </em>at p. 893 [the defendant wrote a letter to the mayor threatening to kill her if she did not resign].) Although these cases involve an unequivocal threat to \u201ckill\u201d the executive officer, threats must be placed and understood in their context, otherwise the line between, for example, heated but protected political hyperbole and an unprotected threat of unlawful violence will not easily be drawn. (See, e.g., <em>Anderson, </em>at p. 896; <em>Watts v. United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 705 [22 L.Ed.2d 664, 89 S.Ct. 1399] [taken in the context of a political rally, a threat to shoot the president was political hyperbole]; <em>Beck v. City of Upland </em>(9th Cir. 2008) 527 F.3d 853, 858 [placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>in the context of a heated discussion over zoning violations, Beck\u2019s statement that the officer \u201c \u2018[did not] know who [he was] dealing with\u2019 \u201d could not have been understood to threaten violence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Iboa\u2019s words were not mere \u201cpolitical hyperbole.\u201d They were threats of unlawful violence. Iboa swore at the firefighters to \u201cget the fuck off his property,\u201d asked \u201cwho the fuck [they] thought [they] were,\u201d told them they did not know \u201cwho the fuck\u201d he was, and he would \u201cshow [them] who\u201d he was. Violently, he threw the firehose out of his backyard. Heatedly, he argued with Captain De\u2019Evelyn, causing other firefighters to become concerned that Iboa, who \u201cwas kind of puffed-chest,\u201d cursing and aggressive, would assault the captain. Believing that violence was imminent, firefighter Carvalho stepped between Captain De\u2019Evelyn and Iboa. Then, when Iboa started back to the house, firefighters heard Iboa say something to the effect of, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ll take care of you guys\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018You\u2019ll see what happens\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to show you\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018We\u2019ll see about that.\u2019 \u201d Believing that Iboa was getting a weapon, the firefighters left Iboa\u2019s property, even though the fire had not been completely extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">When Deputies Valento and Frias arrived, Iboa continued to behave belligerently, saying, \u201c \u2018Fuck you guys. You need a warrant. I can bum whatever I want.\u2019 \u201d While such harsh words alone might not constitute a threat of unlawful violence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Iboa then underscored his words with action; he lifted his shirt to expose gang tattoos. He told the deputies they could not \u201c \u2018fuck\u2019 \u201d with him because he was \u201c \u2018from fuckin\u2019 M-T-C.\u2019 \u201d During this time, Iboa\u2019s fists were clenched and he paced back and forth towards the deputies, causing the deputies to wait for backup before venturing onto Iboa\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Iboa\u2019s threatening statements, combined with his physical conduct of pacing, clenching his fists, showing off his gang tattoos, and aggressively approaching Captain De\u2019Evelyn, constituted the type of threat of unlawful violence section 69 prohibits. His conduct gave context to his threatening speech, which was intended to and did deter the firefighters and deputies from performing their official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">(B) <em>Instructional error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Based on his misreading of <em>Hines, </em>Iboa also contends that the trial court, sua sponte, should have instructed the jury that his threat had to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201cserious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A trial court must instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the general principles of law that are closely and openly connected to the facts and that are necessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the case. <em>(People v. Moye </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 537, 548 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 113, 213 P.3d 652]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 154 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].) But if \u201cthe original instructions are themselves full and complete . . . ,\u201d whether additional explanation is required \u201cto satisfy the jury\u2019s request for information\u201d is a matter left to the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>(People v. Gonzalez </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1213 [275 Cal.Rptr. 729, 800 P.2d 1159], superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>In re Steele </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 682 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 536, 85 P.3d 444].) When an instruction is potentially ambiguous or misleading, the instruction is not reversible error unless there is a reasonable likelihood that the jurors misunderstood or misapplied the pertinent instruction. (Ibid.; <em>People v. Avena </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 394, 416-417 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000].)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">As we have said, the full, not truncated, quote from <em>Hines </em>is the threat must reasonably appear to be a \u201c \u2018serious expression of intention to inflict bodily harm\u2019 \u201d <em>and </em>\u201c \u2018its circumstances are such that there is a reasonable tendency to produce in the victim a fear that the threat will be carried out....\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hines, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1061.) Although Iboa argues that the jury should have been instructed with the first part of the quote, he gives no explanation why the second part of it should be ignored. To instruct the jury with either the partial or full quote would, in any event, potentially confuse the jury by suggesting a requirement that the victim in fact believed that the threat would be carried out. The victim, however, need not believe there is an immediate danger the threat will be carried out. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court therefore properly did not instruct the jury with Iboa\u2019s proposed language from <em>Hines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The jury was instead properly instructed: \u201cEvery person who willfully [and unlawfully] attempts, by means of any threat or violence, to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon that officer by law, or who knowingly resists, by the use of force or violence, an executive officer in the performance of his or her duty, is guilty of a violation of Penal Code section 69, a crime. ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] In order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [\u00b6] [1.] A person willfully [and unlawfully] attempted to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing . . . any duty imposed upon that officer by law; and [\u00b6] [2.] The attempt was accomplished by means of any threat or violence.\u201d (CALJIC No. 7.50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>This informed the jury that the attempt to deter the executive officer from performing an official duty had to be accomplished by <em>\u201cthreat or </em>violence.\u201d This language strongly suggests that the threat must rise to a level of unlawful violence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is especially clear when considered in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s argument. The prosecutor told the jury: \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that those [section] 69 charges are not assaults on executive officers. . . . [\u00b6] It\u2019s the threatening, violent behavior that causes an executive officer not to be able to perform the duty . . . .\u201d He also argued: \u201cAnd violence, again, isn\u2019t contact. Violence is behavior. The threat is the behavior. T\u2019m MTC, motherfucker. Get off my block.\u2019 [\u00b6] That\u2019s the threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Defense counsel similarly argued that the jury had to decide whether Iboa\u2019s threats were threats of violence: \u201cViolence and a threat can be verbal, threaten to shoot someone. I\u2019m going to shoot you. I\u2019m going to punch you. Those are obviously threats. [\u00b6] Now, violence can also be interpreted based on the circumstances. You can look at someone\u2019s conduct and words and judge whether or not it\u2019s violent, [\u00b6] For instance, if you say\u2014if you\u2019re acting crazy, you\u2019re acting belligerent, you say, \u2018I\u2019ll show you. You point your hand out like a gun gesture.\u2019 Verbally you\u2019re not threatening them, but that could be interpreted as a threat. That makes sense. [\u00b6] But when you say, \u2018Oh. I\u2019ll show you,\u2019 if you\u2019re just yelling, you know, acting crazy and belligerent, that doesn\u2019t rise to the level of violence, [\u00b6] Yeah, he\u2019s acting stupid, he\u2019s being a jerk, but that isn\u2019t necessarily violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The prosecutor and defense counsel thus clearly conveyed to the jury that the \u201cthreat\u201d section 69 prohibits is one of violence. There was no suggestion that a threat unrelated to unlawful violence would violate section 69.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">IV.-VII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Because we have found that the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury that a violation of section 69 requires a showing of a serious expression of an intention to commit an act which would result in bodily harm, Iboa\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
