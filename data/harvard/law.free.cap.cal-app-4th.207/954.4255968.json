He also argues that the conviction is not supported by the evidence, and objects to the imposition of a probation condition that directs him to undergo a psychological evaluation and take medication as directed by a physician. In a supplemental brief, defendant claims instructional error and improper denial of his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>self-representation. We conclude that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched, and was not denied the right to testify at trial. The evidence supports the conviction and defendant\u2019s motion for self-representation was untimely. No instructional error occurred. The medication condition of probation is both reasonably related to deterring future criminality, and neither vague nor overbroad. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The United States Air Force Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Office of the Department of Defense received an e-mail signed by Charles Nishi, who referred to himself as \u201cThe Shepherd,\u201d dated March 27, 2010, which was designated as an \u201cEMERGENCY COMMUNICATION.\u201d In the e-mail Nishi stated he had been located after numerous California Highway Patrol helicopter flights, and complained that California\u2019s Department of Fish and Game had been repeatedly and unlawfully shooting at protected mountain lions in the \u201cOpen Space\u201d to \u201cPROVOKE AN ATTACK which endangers the public.\u201d Nishi petitioned for an immediate \u201cshut down\u201d of \u201cMarin County Sheriffs and Fish &amp; Games operations,\u201d and asked the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice to \u201ctake control of all wild life activities\u201d in the Marin County Indian Valley Open Space Preserve to prevent further slaughter of mountain lions. He also declared: \u201cI am armed and will now fire on all Sheriff and Fish &amp; Game after this email so either shut them down or put some boots on the ground to join the battle, remember that if they kill me what is going to happen to the human race by APOLLO or the same beings on Codex Dresden.\u201d Defendant further pointed out he had informed California\u2019s Department of Fish and Game that the United States Air Force was \u201cmonitoring their activities\u201d through air support.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The Department of Defense forwarded the e-mail to the Marin County Sheriff\u2019s Department on March 29, 2010. Deputy Sheriff Christopher Henderson, an officer who had often investigated cases of \u201ccriminal threats\u201d to law enforcement, was given the e-mail with directions to \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Deputy Henderson reviewed the e-mail and was alarmed by its nature, detail, length and content. He decided the message represented a \u201ccredible threat\u201d and \u201csafety issue,\u201d so he issued a computer-generated \u201cOfficer SafetyAVelfare Check\u201d bulletin, which he sent to regional law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Fish and Game. In the bulletin the deputy identified defendant Charles Nishi of Novato as the author of an angry, confrontational e-mail sent to military officials, and included a description and photograph of him. The bulletin also mentioned a warning from defendant in the e-mail that he \u201cis armed and will \u2018fire on\u2019 Sheriff and Fish and Game personnel if confronted.\u201d Deputy Henderson\u2019s primary objective in issuing the bulletin was to effectuate a medical evaluation of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Brian Sanford, superintendant in charge of operations for the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve, received the e-mail and Deputy Henderson\u2019s bulletin. As a result, he posted the e-mail and directed his staff \u201cnot to go into that preserve\u201d until contact was made with defendant. Charles Armor, regional manager for the Bay Delta region of California\u2019s Department of Fish and Game, became concerned for the safety of his staff after learning of the contents of defendant\u2019s e-mail. He advised his staff \u201cnot to wear their uniforms,\u201d and be \u201ca little more vigilant\u201d while working in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Marin County Deputy Sheriff Brenndon Bosse, who has patrol responsibilities in the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve, also received defendant\u2019s e-mail and the associated bulletin from Deputy Henderson. He was delegated the duty to proceed to the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve to contact defendant. Deputy Bosse was acquainted with defendant due to prior contacts: his prior infractions in 2009 for camping in the preserve without a permit, and unsubstantiated reports made by defendant of the shooting of mountain lions. Defendant had been cooperative and nonthreatening with Deputy Bosse in the past. Nevertheless, \u201cbecause of the threatening statement\u201d in the e-mail that he \u201cwould fire upon Sheriff\u2019s deputies or Fish and Game officers,\u201d Bosse stayed near cover as he hiked in the preserve searching for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">About 6:00 p.m. on March 31, 2010, Deputy Bosse located defendant at a fire road in the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve. Defendant affirmed he sent the e-mail, but did not acknowledge he wrote the paragraph that threatened to \u201cfire upon Sheriff\u2019s deputies or Fish and Game officers.\u201d Defendant consented to a search for weapons, and exclaimed that the e-mail \u201cworked\u201d by keeping the officers \u201coff the preserve.\u201d He was then arrested and transported to the psychiatric facility at Marin General Hospital. During a subsequent search of defendant\u2019s campsite Bosse discovered boxes of new shotgun shells under a tarp next to a tent, although no firearm was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">I. <em>The Denial of the Motion to Suppress Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Defendant complains of the warrantless search of his campsite, and specifically the seizure of the boxes of shotgun shells from a tarp \u201cimmediately surrounding\u201d his tent. Defendant argues that his \u201cexpectation of privacy in the campsite was subjectively as well as objectively reasonable, given his homeless status and the presumed willingness of society to recognize an expectation of privacy for a homeless camper on secluded public land.\u201d Defendant\u2019s position is that the tarp was within the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of his campsite, and thus \u201centitled to Fourth Amendment protections.\u201d The Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>General responds that defendant \u201chad no reasonable expectation of privacy in the location where the ammunition was found,\u201d so no Fourth Amendment violation occurred as a result of the warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we view the record in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling, deferring to those express or implied findings of fact supported by substantial evidence. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 182 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365]; <em>People v. Miranda </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 917, 922 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 785].) We independently review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts. <em>(People v. Alvarez, supra, </em>at p. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The threshold issue before us is \u201c \u2018whether the challenged action by the officer \u201chas infringed an interest of the defendant which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.\u201d [Citations.] . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shepherd </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 825, 828 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 458].) \u201c \u2018An illegal search or seizure violates the federal constitutional rights only of those who have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place or seized thing. [Citation.] The legitimate expectation of privacy must exist in the particular area searched or thing seized in order to bring a Fourth Amendment challenge.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. McPeters </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1148, 1171 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 832 P.2d 146], italics omitted; see <em>People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 971 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roybal </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 481, 507 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 966 P.2d 521].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\u201cA defendant has the burden at trial of establishing a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized.\u201d <em>(People v. Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 900, 972.) \u201cA person seeking to invoke the protection of the Fourth Amendment must demonstrate both that he harbored a subjective expectation of privacy and that the expectation was objectively reasonable. [Citation.] An objectively reasonable expectation of privacy is \u2018one society is willing to recognize as reasonable.\u2019 [Citation.] Stated differently, it is an expectation that has \u2018 \u201c \u2018a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hughston </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1068 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 890] <em>(Hughston); </em>see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 735, 740 [61 L.Ed.2d 220, 99 S.Ct. 2577]; <em>U.S. v. Dodds </em>(10th Cir. 1991) 946 F.2d 726, 728 <em>(Dodds).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">\u201c \u2018A \u201creasonable\u201d expectation of privacy is an objective entitlement founded on broadly based and widely accepted community norms. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rains v. Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 157, 173 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 185].) \u201cThere is no set formula for determining whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched, but the totality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>circumstances are considered. [Citation.] Among the factors sometimes considered in making the determination are whether the defendant has a possessory interest in the thing seized or place searched [citation], \u2018whether he has the right to exclude others from that place; whether he has exhibited a subjective expectation that it would remain free from governmental invasion; whether he took normal precautions to maintain his privacy and whether he was legitimately on the premises.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Rudy F. </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1132 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 483].)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The most significant, and ultimately controlling, factor in the case before us is that defendant was not lawfully or legitimately on the premises where the search was conducted. The uncontradicted evidence reveals that camping on the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve was prohibited without a permit. Defendant had no authorization to camp within or otherwise occupy the public land. On at least four or five recent occasions he had been cited by officers for \u201cillegal camping\u201d and evicted from other campsites in the preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Thus, both the illegality, and defendant\u2019s awareness that he was illicitly occupying the premises without consent or permission, are undisputed. \u201cLegitimation of expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u201d <em>(Rakas v. Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 143, fn. 12 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421].) Defendant was not in a position to legitimately consider the campsite\u2014or the belongings kept there\u2014as a place society recognized as private to him. <em>(Dodds, supra, </em>946 F.2d 726, 728-729.) Nor did he have the right to exclude others from that place. He had no ownership, lawful possession, or lawful control of the premises searched. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Gale </em>(D.C. Cir. 1998) 329 U.S. App.D.C. 49 [136 F.3d 192, 195-196]; <em>U.S. v. Carr </em>(10th Cir. 1991) 939 F.2d 1442, 1446.) A \u201cperson can have no reasonable expectation of privacy in premises on which they are wrongfully <em>present....\u201d (U.S. v. Gutierrez-Casada </em>(D.Kan. 2008) 553 F.Supp.2d 1259, 1270; see <em>U.S. v. McRae </em>(6th Cir. 1998) 156 F.3d 708, 711; <em>Dodds, supra, </em>at pp. 728-729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Defendant\u2019s unlawful temporary occupation of the campsite distinguishes the present case from <em>U.S. v. Gooch </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 6 F.3d 673, 676-677, in which the court concluded that the defendant had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in a tent pitched for several days in a public campground where he was \u201clegally permitted to camp.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677; see <em>U.S. v. Basher </em>(9th Cir. 2011) 629 F.3d 1161, 1167-1168.) In <em>U.S. v. Sandoval </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 200 F.3d 659, 660-661 <em>(Sandoval), </em>the court extended the holding in <em>Gooch </em>to find a legitimate expectation of privacy associated with the seizure of a medicine bottle discovered during a search of a \u201cmakeshift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>tent\u201d \u201clocated on Bureau of Land Management\u201d property <em>(id. </em>at p. 660), where it was \u201cunclear whether Sandoval had permission to be there.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 661.) The defendant\u2019s tent in <em>Sandoval </em>was located in an area that was heavily covered by vegetation and virtually impenetrable. In addition, the tent was closed on all four sides, and the medicine bottle was not visible from outside. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 660.) The court in <em>Sandoval </em>concluded: \u201c[W]e do not believe the reasonableness of Sandoval\u2019s expectation of privacy turns on whether he had permission to camp on public land. Such a distinction would mean that a camper who overstayed his permit in a public campground would lose his Fourth Amendment rights, while his neighbor, whose permit had not expired, would retain those rights.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 661, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Similarly, in <em>Hughston, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1068-1069, 1071, the defendant was found to have \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes in an aluminum frame covered with tarps that was erected within a designated site on land specifically set aside for camping during a music festival. The court in <em>Hughston </em>declared: \u201c \u2018One should be free to depart the campsite for the day\u2019s adventure without fear of this expectation of privacy being violated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hughston, </em>at p. 1070, quoting <em>People v. Schafer </em>(Colo. 1997) 946 P.2d 938, 944.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Here, in contrast to <em>Sandoval </em>and <em>Hughston, </em>not only was defendant clearly camped in a prohibited location, the shotgun shells were seized from <em>outside </em>his tent, in a pile of debris under a loose tarp. While a tent located in a public campground may be considered a private area where people sleep and keep valuables, functionally somewhat comparable to a house, apartment, or hotel room, the remainder of defendant\u2019s unauthorized, undeveloped campsite was a dispersed, ill-defined site, exposed and open to public view. The area around the tent was not within a defined residential curtilage in which defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>(U.S. v. Basher, supra, </em>629 F.3d 1161, 1169.) Also, after his repeated removal by officers from campsites he had occupied in the same preserve in the recent past, defendant was conscious of the illegality, which further tends to negate his legitimate expectation of privacy in that location. <em>(People v. Thomas </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1333-1334 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 610] (Thomas).)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">We find the decision in <em>U.S. v. Ruckman </em>(10th Cir. 1986) 806 F.2d 1471, persuasive in the present case. In <em>Ruckman, </em>the defendant lived in a natural cave located in a remote area of southern Utah on land owned by the United States and controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. He attempted to enclose the cave by \u201cfashioning a crude entrance wall from boards and other materials which surrounded a so-called \u2018door.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1472.) A warrantless search of the cave resulted in seizure of firearms and \u201canti-personnel booby traps.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As in the case before us, the evidence established that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>\u201cRuckman was admittedly a trespasser on federal lands and subject to immediate ejectment\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>by authorities \u201cat any time\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1473). The court pointed out that \u201c \u2018whether the occupancy and construction were in bad faith,\u2019 \u201d and the \u201c \u2018legal right to occupy the land and build structures on it,\u2019 \u201d were factors \u201c \u2018highly relevant\u2019 \u201d to the issue of the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1474, quoting <em>Amezquita v. Hernandez-Colon </em>(1st Cir. 1975) 518 F.2d 8, 12.) The court determined \u201cthat Ruckman\u2019s cave is not subject to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Ruckman, supra, </em>at p. 1472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Here, as in <em>Ruckman, </em>defendant was a trespasser on public land, and occupied the campsite without authority in bad faith. \u201cWhere, as here, an individual \u2018resides\u2019 in a temporary shelter on public property without a permit or permission and in violation of a law which expressly prohibits what he is doing, he does <em>not </em>have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Ruckman[, supra,] </em>806 F.2d 1471, 1474 [rejecting a claim of privacy in a cave on federal property because the determination whether a place constitutes a person\u2019s \u2018home\u2019 must take into account the means by which it was acquired and whether it is occupied without any legal right]; <em>Amezquita </em>v. <em>Hernandez-Colon[, supra,] </em>518 F.2d 8, 11-12 [no privacy right in a squatter\u2019s community on public property]; <em>State v.

Defendant contends that his e-mail neither \u201cdirectly threatened the sheriff or Fish &amp; Game department,\u201d nor \u201cshowed any intent that the federal government convey\u201d his threat to those officers. He also argues that his \u201cthreat did not have as its requisite purpose the deterrence of local officials from performing their duties,\u201d but rather was \u201cintended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>convince the federal agencies\u201d to intervene to halt actions defendant considered unlawful\u2014that is, the unauthorized shooting of mountain lions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">A. <em>The Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">We first consider the nature of our review of the evidence.

The first is attempting by threats or violence to deter or prevent an officer from performing a duty imposed by law; the second is resisting by force or violence an officer in the performance of his or her duty.\u201d <em>(In re Manuel G. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 805, 814 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 701, 941 P.2d 880].) The first form of a violation of section 69 \u201cencompasses attempts to deter either an officer\u2019s immediate performance of a duty imposed by law or the officer\u2019s performance of such a duty at some time in the future.\u201d <em>(In re Manuel G., supra, </em>at p. 817, italics omitted.) The second form of violating section 69 \u201cassumes that the officer is engaged in such duty when resistance is offered,\u201d and \u201cthe officers must have been acting lawfully when the defendant resisted arrest.\u201d <em>(In re Manuel G., supra, </em>at p. 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>The case against defendant proceeded exclusively on the first form of a violation of section 69, which has \u201cbeen called \u2018 \u201cattempting to deter\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Carrasco </em>(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 978, 984 [77 Cal.Rptr.3d 912]), and is \u201cestablished by ' \u201c[a] threat, unaccompanied by any physical force\u201d \u2019 and may involve either an officer\u2019s immediate or future performance of his duty. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 985.) To avoid infringement on protected First Amendment speech, \u201cthe term \u2018threat\u2019 has been limited to mean a threat of unlawful violence used in an attempt to deter the officer. [Citations.] The central requirement of the first type of offense under section 69 is an attempt to deter an executive officer from performing his or her duties imposed by law; unlawful violence, or a threat of unlawful violence, is merely the means by which the attempt is made.\u201d <em>(In re Manuel G., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 805, 814-815; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Anderson) </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 893, 896-897 [199 Cal.Rptr. 150].) \u201c[A] violation of section 69 requires a specific intent to interfere with the executive officer\u2019s performance of his duties . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Gutierrez </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1083, 1153 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 373, 52 P.3d 572]; see <em>People v. Patino </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 11, 27 [156 Cal.Rptr. 815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We find substantial evidence in the record to support the conviction. While defendant submits that the purpose of his e-mail was merely to dissuade the Fish and Game and sheriffs departments from continuing to proceed with a program of unlawfully eradicating mountain lions or \u201chis cats,\u201d either directly or through the assistance of federal authorities, the evidence also convincingly demonstrates an intent to deter officials from patrolling or otherwise performing duties in the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve by threatening to \u201cfire on\u201d them if they appeared there. Attempts to deter either an officer\u2019s immediate performance of a duty or the performance of such a duty at some time in the future constitute a violation of the statute. <em>(In re Manuel G., supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 805, 817.) Defendant essentially acknowledged as much when he was encountered by Deputy Bosse, and remarked that the e-mail \u201cworked\u201d by keeping the officers \u201coff the preserve.\u201d Moreover, the message had the contemplated effect. The superintendant in charge of operations for the Indian Valley Open Space Preserve directed his staff \u201cnot to go into that preserve\u201d until contact was made with defendant. The regional manager for the Bay Delta region of the Department of Fish and Game advised his staff \u201cnot to wear their uniforms,\u201d and be \u201ca little more vigilant when they\u2019re working in the fields.\u201d Deputy Bosse testified that in light of the e-mail, he patrolled with greater care during his search for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">That the e-mail was not separately or directly sent to the intended victims fails to negate proof of either an attempt to deter or prevent an officer from performing a duty or the requisite specific intent to interfere with the executive officer\u2019s performance of duties. The statute does not require that a threat be personally communicated to the victim by the person who makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>the threat. <em>(In re Ryan D. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 854, 861 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 193]; <em>In re David L. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1655, 1659 [286 Cal.Rptr. 398].) The inference may be drawn from the evidence that defendant intended, and expected or at least foresaw, a message with an unequivocal threat to shoot Fish and Game and sheriff\u2019s department officers would be conveyed from the Department of Defense to the intended law enforcement targets of the threat. <em>(People v. Hamilton </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 863, 936 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 286, 200 P.3d 898].) Section 69 also does not require a showing that defendant had the present ability to carry out the threats; evidence that the letter contained the threats was sufficient to support a finding that defendant violated section 69. <em>(Hamilton, supra, </em>at p. 936; <em>People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1060 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388].)
