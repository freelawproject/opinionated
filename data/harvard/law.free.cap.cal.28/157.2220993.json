The rule under the civil or Mexican law was, as we understand it, that a power executed by the attorney in his own name binds the principal when the agent acts in the business intrusted to him and within the scope of his power; the liability of the principal under that system depended on the act done, and not up.on the form in which it had been executed; in this case there is no question as to the sufficiency of the power under which Chase acted, hence the execution is good.

S. 64, and Story on Agency, Note 3 to Section 162.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"A5Wc\">Currey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">This is an action of ejectment, commenced in December, 1863, to recover a lot of land in the City of San Jos\u00e9. The defendant\u2019s answer is a traverse of each and every material allegation of the complaint. The action was tried before the Court without a jury and a finding was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant moved to set aside the conclusions of law stated in the finding, and instead to substitute that \u201cthe defendant is entitled to judgment for costs.\u201d The motion was denied and the defendant excepted. The defendant then moved the Court, upon the pleadings and facts found, to render judgment for the defendant. This motion was also denied and the defendant excepted, and thereupon judgment was entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">From the finding of facts it appears that both parties claim to derive title to the premises from a common source\u2014Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>L. Sheldon. The Court find that in 1849 Henry L. Sheldon made, executed, acknowledged and delivered to Henry P. Chase a full power of attorney for the sale of said land, which was duly recorded in the records of the Pueblo of San Jos\u00e9 id that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201c That in the year 1849 the said Henry P. Chase, as attorney of Henry L. Sheldon, for a valuable consideration made, executed, acknowledged and delivered a deed of the premises to Richard Harmer, of all the right, title and interest of said Sheldon to said preipises, which said deed was duly recorded in the year 1849, in the records of said Pueblo, at San Jos\u00e9, which deed bears date 1849, and is hereby referred to and made a part hereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">That in June, 1862, Richard Harmer, for a valuable consideration, conveyed by deed his right, title and interest in the premises to the plaintiff, which deed was duly acknowledged and recorded in the same month.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">That in October, 1862, Henry L. Sheldon, for a valuable consideration made, executed, acknowledged and delivered his deed of said land\" and premises to Davis Devine, the defendant\u2019s landlord, which deed was duly recorded before this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In the transcript is found a copy of a deed, which is the one referred to by the Court, purporting to have been executed on the 2d of November, 1849, \u201c between Henry P. Chase, attorney for Henry L. Sheldon, of the Sandwich Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, of the first part, and Richard M. Harmer, of the Pueblo of San Jos\u00e9, of the'second part,\u201d by which the \u201c party of the first part, in consideration of the sum of three hundred dollars, jn hand duly paid, hath sold and by these presents doth grant and convey unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns, forever,\u201d the premises in controversy. The <em>testatum </em>clause of the deed is as follows: \u201cIn witness whereof T have hereunto set my hand and seal the day and year first above written.\u201d It is signed \u201c Henry P. Chase, attorney for Henry L. Sheldon,\u201d and opposite the name of Chase is affixed a seal. The deed is acknowledged by him as the person who executed it, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>was recorded in Book Five of <em>Solars, </em>in the Recorder\u2019s office of the County of Santa Clara. The Court finds that the deed executed by Chase was a deed of all Sheldon\u2019s right, title and interest in the premises, and was executed by him as the attorney of Sheldon. This finding was not sustained by the deed referred to by the Court. The deed does not purport to have been executed by Chase as Sheldon\u2019s attorney, nor to convey any right, title or interest of Sheldon in the premises described.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">It is not pretended on the part of the respondent that the deed executed by Chase would be effectual to transfer and convey the title and interest of Sheldon in the premises according to the rules of the common law, but it is contended on his behalf that at the date of the deed the law of Mexico was the law of the land, and that by the Mexican law the power which Chase, the attorney for Sheldon, possessed, might be lawfully executed by the attorney in his ow;n name so as to bind his principal, and that it was so executed in this instance. Escribir\u00e9 defines a letter of attorney <em>(procuraci\u00f3n) </em>to be a deed by which one person empowers another to do some particular thing in the name of the constituent, and the same authority defines an attorney in fact <em>[procurador) to </em>be one who, by virtue of power derived from another, is authorized to perform some specified act in the name of the constituent of the power. By reference to the deed executed by Chase it will be seen that he did not profess to act for or iff the name of Sheldon, nor to convey the premises in dispute as the property of Sheldon. The addition to his name of the words \u201c Attorney of Henry L. Sheldon \u201d was a mere <em>descriptio personae. </em>The fact that in truth he was the attorney or <em>procurador </em>of Sheldon cannot, by the most liberal rule of interpretation, impart to the instrument executed by Chase the character of a conveyance by Sheldon. Chase might as well have described himself as of any other professon or occupation belonging to Mm as that of \u2018 \u2018 Attorney of Sheldon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
