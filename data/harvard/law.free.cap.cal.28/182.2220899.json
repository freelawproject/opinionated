The answer denied that the former executors duly resigned or were discharged from their trust as executors, and also denied that letters were duly issued to plaintiff, or that he qualified, or that Black and Miller delivered the bond sued on to plaintiff, of that he was entitled to'collect or receive the money due on the bond. The answer set up as new matter, that it appeared from tlje report of \u2018the executors that the bond was of the value of eight thousand dollars, and that when plaintiff was appointed no showing was made of the value of the bond, and that the administrator was required to give a bond in the sum of four thousand dollars only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Plaintiff had judgment in the Court below, and defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-9\"><em>S. F. &amp; J. Reynolds, </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-10\">The demurrer was well taken, and should have been sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-11\">Black and Miller were never legally discharged from their office and trust as executors, and were, at the time of the attempt to grant letters to Lucas, the executors of the will, and the only persons entitled to the possession of the estate, and to administer it and execute the trusts of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-12\">Section one \"hundred of the Probate Act (Wood\u2019s Dig. p. 400) authorizes an executor, by writing filed in the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Court, to resign his appointment, <em>\u201c provided he shall first settle his accounts and deliver up all the estate to such person as may he appointed hy the Court\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">It is very clear that before an executor dan resign his trust, aiid before the Probate Court can accept the resignation, so as to relieve him from his duties and responsibilities as such executor, two things must plainly appear to have been done. First\u2014A full settlement of the executor\u2019s accounts, showing the true condition of the estate, and how much and what part of it is unadministered. Second\u2014That the Court has appointed some other person competent and qualified to receive the estate and finish the administration and execute the trusts. Without these the Court has no power or jurisdiction to discharge the executor, and any attempt to do so by the Probate Court would be void, and confer no power upon the appointee.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">The complaint shows that the executors were'discharged, if at all, in September, 1856. That discharge only appears as the result of the acceptance of the resignation on that day. The complaint does not show that they had rendered any account of their doings as such executors, or that any action was ever taken by the Probate Court as to their accounting; nor does it appear from this complaint how much, if any, property was in the hands of the executors at the time they undertook to resign, or when Lucas claims to have been appointed. This is manifestly necessary; for after they are discharged, the Court has no further power over them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-8\"><em>Watkins &amp; Wise, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AEAH\">Sawyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">More than a year elapsed after the entry of the judgment appealed from before the appeal was taken. The appeal from the judgment,, therefore, was not in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">On the appeal from the order denying a new trial, the appellant relies, substantially, upon the insufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>evidence to show that Lucas is the administrator of Murphy. The question is raised in various forms, as upon rulings of the Court admitting portions of proceedings in the Probate Court, and as to the effect of the evidence when admitted, but the substantial question is, as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Letters testamentary had been issued to James Miller and James Black upon the same estate. Miller filed his resignation September 13, 1856, and Black his, August 26, 1856. The resignation of the former was formally accepted by an order to that effect entered by the Probate Court, September 22,1856, and of the latter, August 27,' 1856. Both the resignations and the orders of acceptance are in proper form. It is insisted, however, that these orders are void, because it does not appear that the executors had settled their accounts, and delivered up all the estate to some person appointed by the Court. It does not appear that they had not performed these acts, and it is not shown that the entire proceedings of the Probate Court are in evidence. The Probate Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and even conceding that the proceeding can be collaterally questioned, it is not to be presumed that the orders accepting the resignations of the executors were improperly made. All intendments must be in favor of the action of the Court, the same as in other Courts of record. (Wood\u2019s Dig. 912; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Scriber, </em>18 Cal. 503.) But there is in the record a decree of final settlement of the accounts of Miller and Black as executors, entered July 30, 1856, in which it is adjudged that the debts of the estate and expenses of the administration have all been paid, and the property all distributed, except the bond and mortgage now in suit, and that there is a considerable sum due the executors for over payments. And there is other testimony that, on the resignation of the executors, Black delivered the bond and mortgage and all other papers to the Probate Court, and it is now found in the possession of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The petition of plaintiff for letters of administration <em>de bonis non </em>states all the jurisdictional facts and gave the Court juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>diction of the case. The duty of ascertaining the value of the property of the estate, and fixing the amount of the administrator\u2019s bonds with reference thereto, is devolved upon the Probate Court, and we must presume that the Court discharged that duty properly, at least till the contrary is shown. We have no evidence that the value of the bond and mortgage in suit was more than half the amount of the bond fixed by the Probate Court. It may have been worthless. It is at least doubtful whether we can collaterally review the action of the Probate Court in this respect. The amount and value of the estate are not jurisdictional facts. We think the evidence shows that the plaintiff is the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Murphy, and as such entitled to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">By the Court,</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"AzF\">Sawyer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbC\">on petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The complaint is sufficient. We supposed our opinion was sufficiently indicated on this point in discussing, substantially, the same questions raised by counsel on the rulings made upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The petition of Lucas for letters states, that the applicant is a nephew of the deceased, and a nephew is one of the persons entitled to letters. There may be others having preference, and if so, on application of a nephew for letters, the persons entitled to be preferred may appear, under section sixty-one of the Probate Act, and contest the application or assert their own rights on that ground. Even other persons, \u201c not entitled,\u201d may be \u201c competent,\u201d and letters may be granted to such person on \u201c the request of the person entitled.\u201d \u201c The request shall be in writing and shall be filed in the Court.\u201d (Sec. 66.) The Act does not say that the request shall be stated in the petition. It would be well to state in the petition all the facts upon which petitioner relies to entitle him to letters in preference to other parties. But we think the petition of Lucas states \u201c all the facts essential to give the Court jurisdiction of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>It is unnecessary to determine, whether the Probate Court was the proper custodian of the bond from the time of the acceptance of the resignation of the former executors till the appointment of plaintiff, or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The resignations of the executors respectively were accepted by the Court, and there is nothing to affirmatively show that these proceedings are invalid. When Lucas was appointed administrator <em>de honis </em>non, he became entitled, as such administrator, to the possession of the assets of the estate, wherever they might be, and he has obtained possession'\u2014no matter from whom\u2014of the instrument in suit. He is now the proper custodian, and entitled to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">This is not an appeal from an order, or judgment of the Probate Court, and it is not our province to collaterally determine in this case whether the Probate Court erred in ascertaining the value of the estate and fixing the amount of the administrator\u2019s bond. The Probate Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter, and it determined the question of the value of the property and fixed the amount of the administrator\u2019s bond upon the evidence before it. If the Court erred, its action must be reviewed in some other mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
