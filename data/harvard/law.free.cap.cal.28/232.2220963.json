Words must be regarded in the sense in which they are used by the Legislature rather than by their abstract meaning. \u201cIf he or she shall leave no issue, or husband, or wife, the estate shall go to his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>father.\u201d (Descents and Distributions, Statutes 1861, p. 570, latter part of second section.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-4\">If such bad been here the state of facts, would not the estate have fallen to the father, and would he not have then, O as to the estate, been the descendant of the husband ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-7\">By the rule of estates held under strict feudal tenure, where from the nature of things the father could not have done military service, the estate might, at a very early period in the history of our laws, have even escheated for the want of a \u201c descendantbut, even at common law, the strict rule that descents (using the word in its technical sense) must always be downward, has been disregarded, and in tracing descents we must necessarily ascend in very many cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afna\">The word \u201cdescendant\u201d means in the statute one who could properly take by descent, and in that sbnse is constantly used in the books. \u201c Property of lands by descent is,\u201d says Lord Bacon, \u201c where a man hath lands of inheritance, and dieth, not disposing of them, but leaving it to go (as the law casteth it) upon the heir. This is called a descent of law.\u201d (2 Wash-burn on Real Property, 401.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-9\">\u201c The rules of <em>descent </em>prescribed by the statutes of the several United States are as follows : In Alabama the real estate of an estate descends. * * * In California, I. * * * II. If there be no issue, then to the surviving husband or wife, and to the intestate\u2019s father in <em>equal </em>shares.\u201d (2 Washburn on Real Property. Note\u2014Statute Rules of Descent, pp. 417,418.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayc\">\u201cBut in default of such brothers and sisters and their issue, the estate <em>descends to the father in fee </em>simple.\u201d (4 Kent Com. 393<em>.)</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-13\"><em>E. </em>D. Colton, for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af-\">A brief examination of the statutes (Sec. 11 of the \u201cAct defining the rights of husband and wife,\u201d Statutes 1862, p.' 211, and Sec. 1 of the \u201cAct to regulate descents and distributions,\u201d Statutes 1862, p. 569) will show that appellant\u2019s definition of the word \u201cdescendants\u201d used in section 11 is incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>rect, and that the word \u201c descendants\u201d is not synonymous with \u201ckindred\u201d and does not include father, etc. If we substitute the word <em>kindred </em>in the place of the word <em>descendants </em>in section 11, it will read as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-6\">\u201cSec. 11. Upon the dissolution of the community by the death of the husband, one half of the common property shall go to the surviving wife, and the other half to the <em>kindred </em>of the deceased husband, the whole being subject to the payment of his debts. Upon the dissolution of the community by the death of the wife, the entire common property shall go to the surviving husband. In case of the death of the husband, if there be no <em>kindred </em>of the husband, one half of the common property may be subject to his testamentary disposition, and in the absence of any such disposition, shall be subject to distribution <em>in the same manner as the separate property of the </em>husband.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-7\">Now the separate property of the husband (Statutes 1862, pp. 569, 570) is distributed to the kindred, (and husband and wife,) and in default of kindred (and husband and wife) it escheats to the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-8\">Putting these two statutes together, they would read in effect: <em>\u201cIf there are no kindred of the </em>husband, <em>then one half of the common property shall be distributed among the kindred of the </em>husband,\u201d which makes them absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-10\">Again: by one statute, if there are no kindred, the property would be distributed; by the other, if there are no kindred, it would escheat to the State. There is no pretence that the one Act was intended to or did repeal the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-11\">Taking section 11 alone as a full disposition of the whole common property, and appellant\u2019s definition of the word <em>descendants </em>would make the section absurd. It would provide : 1st. That the wife takes half and the <em>kindred </em>half. 2d. If no kindred, one half is to be distributed. Distributed to whom? To the world generally? But to get this other half of the common property into the father, appellants are compelled to resort to section one, subdivision second, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201cAct to regulate descents and distributions,\u201d Statutes 1862, p. 570, and that provides that it shall go, one half to the surviving wife and one half to the father.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-5\">If the word. <em>descendants </em>in section eleven means kindred, then appellants have got too much already. Their ground is that they take by virtue of the first part of section eleven, that the husband died, leaving a surviving wife and descendants, that is, <em>Jcindred, </em>viz: a father, etc., and that therefore the surviving wife takes one half and the <em>descendants </em>take the other half. The word \u201c kindred \u201d includes all kin to the remotest degree\u2014it would not be the <em>next of Jcin </em>who would take by virtue of section eleven, but <em>all Jcindred, </em>to the remotest degree. There are undoubtedly ten thousand persons who are kin to the intestate in some degree. By section eleven they would all take <em>equally, </em>and hence the judgment would give the appellants too much.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"A4Rk\">Rhodes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">George C. Jewell died intestate March 27th, 1863, leaving a widow (the respondent) and a father, but neither a child, nor the issue of a deceased child. The estate of the intestate was common property of the deceased husband and his wife. The father of the deceased conveyed his interest in the estate to seven of his children\u2014the petitioners being two of the number. Upon their petition to the Probate Court for the distribution of the estate, it was ordered that one half of the estate be distributed to the widow, for her interest in the common property, as the survivor of the community, and that of the remaining half of the estate, one half thereof should go to the widow and the other half to purchasers from the father of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"A2x\">The petitioners appeal. For convenience of designation one half of the. common property may be called the husband\u2019s half, and the other the wife\u2019s half. It is not doubted that the widow, as the survivor of the community, is entitled to her half of the community property, and the only question pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sentecl on the appeal, is whether she takes any portion of the husband\u2019s half, under the Statute of Descents and Distributions, as amended in 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The eleventh section of the Act of 1850, defining the right of husband and wife, as amended in 1861 (Statutes of 1861, p. 310) is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201c Section 11. TJpon the dissolution of the community by the death of the husband, one half of the common property shall go to the surviving wife and the other half to the descendants of the deceased husband, the whole being subject to the payment of his detjts; upon the dissolution of the community by the death of the wife, the entire common property shall go to the surviving husband. In case of the death of the husband, if there be no descendants of the husband, one half of the common property may be subject to his testamentary disposition, and in the absence of any such disposition, shall be subject to distribution in the same manner as the separate property of the husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The question is to be solved by ascertaining the meaning of the word \u201c descendants \u201d as employed in that section. Bouvier defines descendants as \u201c those who have issued from an individual, and includes his children, grandchildren and their children to the remotest degree. The descendants form what is called the direct descending line. The term is opposed to that of ascendants.\u201d Those who are denominated descendants do not comprise all of those who come to the title by descent. It is apparent, upon inspection of section eleven, above cited, that the term descendants does not include the ascending line. It is provided in the last clause of the section, that the husband\u2019s testamentary disposition of his half of the common property, shall be valid, if the husband shall die leaving no descendants, and that if such testamentary disposition shall not have been made, then it shall be distributed in the same manner as the separate property of the husband ; that is to say, according to the Statute of Descents and Distributions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Previous to the amendment of 1861, it was provided, that upon the dissolution of the community by the death of the husband or the wife, one half of the common property should go to the survivor and the other half to the descendants of the deceased, and if there were no descendants of the deceased, then to the survivor. The amendment of 1861, not only gave the whole common property to the husband upon the death of the wife, whether she left descendants or not, but it limited the right of the surviving wife, growing out of the community relation,- to her half, without regard to whether or not the deceased husband left descendants, and the husband\u2019s half, which would go to his descendants under the Act of 1850, would still go to them under the amendatory Act of 1861, but the amendatory Act, instead of giving the husband\u2019s half to the surviving wife upon the failure of descendants of the deceased husband, has in-effect converted it into the separate estate of the husband, and as such has made it subject to his disposal by will, and in the absence of such disposition, directed it to be distributed according to the Statute of Descents and Distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">By adopting the construction of the appellants, that \u201c descendants\u201d are all those who may properly take by descent, we are led into this absurd construction of the section just cited. The husband would be authorized to make a testamentary disposition of his half of the common property, only in case there was no one entitled to take by descent; and if the husband has not made a testamentary disposition of it, and has left no descendants\u2014that is, no persons entitled to take by descent\u2014then it shall be distributed among his descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We are clearly of the opinion that the husband\u2019s half of the common property, it not being disposed of by his will, and he leaving no descendants, must be distributed according to the provisions of the second clause of section one, of the Act to regulate descents and distributions, as amended in 1862, and that according to the rule in that clause, the surviving wife and the father df the deceased were each entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>one half of the husband\u2019s half of the common property! The purchasers from the father are of course entitled to his share.</p>\n<p id=\"ABt\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
