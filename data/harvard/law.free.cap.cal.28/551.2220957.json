J. Caldwell, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-6\">Blackstone defines an estate at sufferance to be \u201c when one comes into possession .of lands by lawful title, but keeps it afterwards without any title at - all.\u201d \u201cAs if a man takes a lease for a year, and after a year expires continues to hold the premises without any fresh leave from the owner of the estate.\u201d (See 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com. 150.) The statutes of California provide that in such cases the defendant must have thirty days\u2019 notice. (See the Statutes of Cal. 1861, p. 514\u2014An Act relating to the duties and rights of landlords and tenants, May 18th, 1861.) Section first of said Act provides, that \u201cwhenever there is a tenancy at will or by sufferance, created by the tenant\u2019s holding over his term or otherwise, the same may be terminated by thp landlord\u2019s giving one month\u2019s notice in writing to the tenant, requiring him to remove from the premises.\u201d'</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahh\">This we believe is the only law i\u00f1 this State now in force or at the date of the suit brought regulating the rights and duties of landlord and tenant. The defendant, appellant in this case, had been the /tenant from year to year for three years before the bringing- this suit, and at the date of the notice was tenant at sufferance, and by law entitled to one month\u2019s notice before plaintiff c.ould recover in an action in ejectment. Respondent commenced this action within six days after notice served. We hold the notice was insufficient in law to jus'tify the judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-9\"><em>A. A. Sargent, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-10\">Appellant entered under a written lease for one year. Such a lease does not create a tenancy from year to year. (1 Kernan, 494.) \", The Court finds that there was no extension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the lease. There were no <em>loches </em>on the part of the landlord to enlarge the term. Notice of the landlord\u2019s desire to enter and a demand for. possession were immediately given. The circumstances utterly rebut the idea of permission or sufferance. The tenant became simply a trespasser. The right to notice never arises where a lease expires by its own limitation. (So held in 21 Wend. 628.) Especially is this the case where all the acts of the landlord rebut any presumption that he consented to the continuance of the holding. 1 The tenant, by the construction contended for by appellant, could avail himself of his own wrong to extend his term.. We hold that the statutory provision requiring thirty days\u2019 notice to a tenant by sufferance does not apply to this case, where no such tenancy exists. The original entry of the tenant was lawful, it being under a written lease for one year, and if he had held over under such circumstances or for such length of time as to create a presumption of acquiesence of the landlord, he would be a tenant by sufferance. The necessity of reasonable notice to quit exists in cases of uncertain tenancy, to prevent the mischievous effects of a capricious and unreasable determination of the estate. (2 Pick. 71; 4 Kent Com. 113.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b553-5\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AcE2\">Shafter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">This is an action to recover the possession of real estate. The complaint states a case within the Act relating to forcible entry, etc., but by the consent of parties the action was turned into an action of ejectment in the Court below. The appeal is taken from an order overruling defendant\u2019s motion for- a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">First\u2014It is insisted by the appellant that the judgment should be reversed, for the reason that there was no evidence tending to prove that the plaintiff made a written demand upon the defendant to surrender the possession of the premises thirty days before the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AVE\">The defendant held under a lease from the plaintiff for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>year. The term ended July 28th, 1864, and a demand in writing for a surrender of the premises was duly served by the plaintiff on the defendant the next day. The service was on the premises\u2014the plaintiff having entered thereon for that purpose. The action was commenced on the 3d of August following.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">When a tenant held over after the expiration of his lease, he was regarded at common law as a tenant at sufferance; but the estate might be destroyed by an entry on the part of the landlord, and he might thereupon proceed in ejectment. <em>(Uridias </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>25 Cal. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The Act of 1861 (Statutes of 1861, p. 514) relates to tenancies at will and by sufferance, and the first section provides that \u201cthe same maybe terminated by the landlord\u2019s giving one month\u2019s notice in writing to the tenant, requiring him to remove from the premises.\u201d It is further provided by the third section that \u201c at the expiration of one month from the service of such notice, the landlord may re-enter, or maintain ejectment, or proceed in the manner prescribed by law to remove such tenant, without any other or further notice to quitand section five gives the landlord a right to double damages in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AEE8\">A tenancy by sufferance is not by the consent, but by the <em>loches </em>of the owner (2 Black Com. 150), and it follows that where the owner has been guilty of no <em>loches </em>there can be.no tenancy by sufferance to which the provision of the statute as to notice can apply. In this case the defendant never became tenant by sufferance, for the indispensable condition of <em>loches </em>on the part of the plaintiff is not only not found, but is shown affirmatively never to have existed. In view of the principle that the law rejects fractions of days, we consider the record as showing that the plaintiff entered upon the premises on the instant the defendant\u2019s term expired, and for the avowed purpose of asserting his rights as owner. Instead of <em>loches </em>then, we have a singular exhibition of diligence in the conduct of tho plaintiff which forestalled the possibility of a tenancy by sufferance arising in the defendant\u2019s favor. It was held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number><em>Rowan </em>v. <em>Little, </em>11 Wend. 616, under a statute of New York from which our Act. of 1861 appears to have been copied (see note in Adams on Ejectment, 145,) that there could be no tenancy by sufferance where there were no <em>loches </em>by the landlord, and that the burden of proving some degree&gt;of negligence at least, on his part, was on the party asserting the tenancy. In that case the landlord delayed proceedings for three months after the expiration of the lease; but it was held that, under the circumstances of the case, the delay did not amount to <em>loches, </em>and therefore that the tenant was not entitled to notice to quit as a prerequisite to an action of ejectment against him. In the case at bar, the question is not upon the sufficiency of delay for any given period, for there was no delay. The plaintiff entered not for the purpose of recovering from the consequences of neglect, but with a view to prevent the consequences by practising diligence, instead of its opposite, from the start.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The plaintiff filed his petition in insolvency prior to the bringing of this action, and the Sheriff was appointed assignee before the trial. The appropriate evidence of these facts was offered at the trial, but inasmuch as it appeared by the record that the plaintiff had a perfected title to the premises as a homestead when he filed his petition, which title was recognized and established by the decree in pursuance of the prayer of the applicant, the evidence was rejected by the Court; and we consider that there was no error in the ruling. <em>\u00a1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
