That these answers are inartificial is clear, but they state distinctly that the defense is failure of consideration as between maker and payee of the notes, the suits being between those parties. It cannot be said that these defenses are clearly frivolous, and that a mere inspection of the answers shows it. The plaintiff is fully apprised of what the defenses are, and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>not at all clear that the answers would be bad on demurrer; failure of consideration is a fact and not altogether a conclusion to be drawn from facts. At all events the subject is fairly open to discussion, and, therefore, these motions must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">No costs in either of the motions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
