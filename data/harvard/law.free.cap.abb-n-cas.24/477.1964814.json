G. Welling, a resident and taxpayer of the city of Xew York, obtained an order directing the respondents, the commissioners of excise, to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue com-' manding them forthwith to render decision upon a complaint against one Schenplein, lodged with -them by the relator under section 8, of chapter 175, of the Laws of 1870, as amended by chapter 549, of the Laws of 1873. The complaint was one of a number of like complaints seeking the revocation of liquor licenses, and brought before the commissioners on behalf of the City Reform Club, a voluntary association of citizens. It set forth that Scheuplein\u2019s saloon was situated within one quarter of a mile of a polling place on election day, 1889, and was open on that day, in violation of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">- The moving papers showed that, at a final hearing before the commissioners on this complaint, February 28, 1890, the relator\u2019s witnesses had testified that the saloon was open as alleged, that liquor was sold over the bar, and that the saloon was 229 feet distant from a polling place ; the papers further showed that this testimony had been uncontradicted, and the licensee had admitted under oath that his saloon was not closed on the day in question ; that the commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>had unreasonably neglected to render any decision, although often requested so to do, and although more than five weeks had elapsed since the hearing;. that the license of the saloon would expire by limitation April 25, 1890 ; and that, in the case of eighteen other and similar complaints brought by the relator, the commissioners, after final hearing thereon, had allowed the licenses to expire without rendering any decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\">In their counter-affidavits, the commissioners denied that their delay iu rendering a decision had been negligent or unreasonable; and set up the press of their official duties, and alleged that there were complicated points of law involved in these complaints. The decision below is reported in this volume, p. 379.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-5\"><em>Edward </em>Browne, attorney for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEP\">I. The power to revoke licenses is a purely discretionary power, lodged in the commissioners of excise, and therefore mandamus will not lie to compel them to exercise, or to refuse to exercise, such discretion (People <em>ex rel. </em>Hammond <em>v. </em>Leonard, 74 N. <em>Y. </em>443; People <em>ex rel. </em>Saunders <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Erie, 1 <em>Buff. Super. Ct. [Shelden] </em>517). A license is a present right and not a vested one. It can be taken away by the same power that conferred it, on the board becoming satisfied that the license was improperly bestowed. The board cannot be coerced by mandamus or otherwise (People <em>ex rel. </em>Belber <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 <em>Hun, </em>306 ; People <em>ex rel. </em>Funk <em>v. </em>Board of Excise, 24 <em>Id. </em>195; <em>Ex parte </em>Persons, 1 <em>Hill, </em>655 ; People <em>v. </em>Norton, 7 <em>Barb. </em>477 ; People <em>v. </em>Jones, 54 <em>Id. </em>311; People <em>v. </em>Common Council, 78 <em>N.

There must be a legal right, not merely to a decision in respect to the thing sought, but to the thing itself (People <em>ex rel. </em>Belden <em>v. </em>Contracting Board, 27 N. <em>Y. </em>378; People <em>ex rel. </em>Duff <em>v. </em>Booth, 49 <em>Barb. </em>31; People <em>ex rel. </em>Livingston <em>v. </em>Taylor, 1 <em>Abb.

Mo right existed in the relator, either individually or as a citizen, to a judicial administration of any question by the Commissioners of Excise (People <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Columbia, 10 <em>Wend. </em>363 ; Hull <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Oneida, 19 <em>Johns. </em>263; People <em>v. </em>Judges of Dutchess, 10 <em>Wend. </em>658 ; People <em>ex rel. v. </em>Supervisors, 64 <em>N.

The allegation of wilful and corrupt neglect of duty by defendants, being controverted by defendants, a peremptory writ of mandamus could not properly issue (People <em>ex rel. v. </em>Hawkins, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>9 ; People <em>ex rel. </em>Mott <em>v. </em>Board, 64 <em>N. Y. </em>604; People <em>v. </em>Manhattan R. R. Co., 8 <em>Abb. N.

It was the duty of the excise commissioners to decide the Scheuplin case. It is not open to the commissioners to claim that their silence was in fact a decision in favor of the license. The only question before the court is whether, as matter of law, the statute requires that the commissioners shall make some decision in this class of cases. The precise question was passed upon in People <em>ex rel. </em>Sickels <em>v. </em>Becker, 3 <em>State Rep. </em>202. When questions arise calling for the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature will control the action of the court. In arriving at such intention, the court will consider not only the language of the act itself, but also the object which it seeks to subserve (Matter of Breslin, 45 <em>Hun, </em>at 212). Having discovered the intention of the legislature, the courts will give it full effect, and even if the language is ambiguous, they will not permit the intention to be evaded (People <em>ex rel. </em>Wood <em>v. </em>Lacombe, 99 <em>N. Y. </em>43; People <em>ex rel. v. </em>Commissioners of Taxes, 95 <em>N. Y. </em>at 558; Holmes <em>v. </em>Carley, 31 <em>N. Y. </em>289; People <em>ex rel. </em>Tucker <em>v. </em>D\u2019Oench, 44 <em>Hun, </em>at 33 ; Mead <em>v. </em>Stratton, 87 <em>N. Y. </em>493). The obvious intention of the statute was to confer upon the excise commissioners the quasi-judicial power of trying and deciding against licensees for violations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>law. The proceedings for such revocation are in the nature of a trial (People <em>v. </em>Schewe, 29 <em>Hun, </em>122; People <em>ex rel. </em>Kimball <em>v. </em>Haughton, 41 <em>Hun, </em>558). The law compels the commissioners, after hearing the evidence, to ask themselves the question, \u201c are we satisfied that the charges are true ? \u201d Whatever the answer is, it is a decision. Where a public officer is clothed with power to do a judicial act, the execution of the power may be insisted upon as a duty (City of Galena v. Amy, 5 <em>Wall. </em>705; Riley\u2019s Case, 12 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>481; People <em>v. </em>Brooks, 1 <em>Den. </em>457; People <em>ex rel. v. </em>Connolly, 4 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>376; Hines <em>v. </em>Lockport, 60 <em>Barb. </em>378; 50 <em>N. Y. </em>236; Mayor <em>v. </em>Bailey, 2 <em>Den. </em>458).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-5\">II. The failure of the board to take action for forty-five days after the case was closed was unreasonable. An unreasonable delay is tantamount to a refusal to act (People <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 2 <em>Keyes, </em>291; People <em>v. </em>Supervisors, 20 <em>N. Y. </em>252; Queen <em>v. </em>Vestrymen, 8 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell. </em>889; Queen <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Navigation, 8 <em>Id. </em>901).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">III. Respondent was clearly entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the board to take action upon his complaint (Howland <em>v. </em>Eldredge, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>457; People <em>ex rel. v. </em>Common Council, 78 <em>Id. </em>33; Judges <em>v. </em>People, 18 Wend. 79; Life and Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Adams, 9 <em>Peters, </em>604; <em>Ex parte </em>Crane, 5 <em>Pet. </em>192; <em>Ex parte </em>Newman, 14 <em>Wall. </em>169).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-7\">Van Bkunt, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvD\">This is an appeal from an order granting a peremptory mandamus against the commissioners of excise of this county directing them to decide a certain complaint presented to them by the relator against one Scheuplein.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The relator presented this complaint on the 27th of last January. It was for keeping open a saloon upon election day in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Notice was given to Scheuplein and the matter was set down for hearing upon the 12th of the following February, Upon the latter date the board adjourned the hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>although the relator was ready to proceed, to the 21st of February, when it was again adjourned (the relator being still prepared to proceed) to the 28th of February. On the 28th of February the hearing took place. Two witnesses testified that Scheuplein\u2019s saloon, which was but 229 feet from a neighboring polling place, was open on the last general election day, and that beer was then and there sold. This was not denied, though Scheuplein was examined and testified that he knew nothing'about this violation of law and that he left orders not to sell anything over the bar that \u25a0day. Upon these very simple facts, the case was closed and left with the board for decision. Subsequently the commissioners were repeatedly called upon for a decision, but without avail. And as late as the 8th of April they informed a person who applied to them upon behalf of the City Reform Club, of which the relator is treasurer, that \u201c there was no decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Upon this state of facts the mandamus was granted simply to set the board in motion. The appeal was submitted, and the first point which we find in the appellant\u2019s brief is that \u201c the power to revoke licenses is a purely discretionary power lodged in the commissioners of excise, and therefore mandamus will not lie to compel them to exercise or to refuse to exercise such discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">This point, although elaborately considered and enforced by the citation of numerous authorities, seems to us to have no bearing upon the real question presented by this appeal, and for the sufficient reason that there was no attempt on the part of the Special Term to interfere with the discretion or judgment of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The mandamus required the board to exercise its discretion and judgment and required nothing else. The rules on this subject are well settled. Where the duty is peremptory or absolute, the writ may require the doing of a specific act. Where, however, official discretion and judgment are involved, the writ can only command the board to act. It will not direct the board to act in a specific manner nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>attempt to control its judgment. Even in the case of inferior courts, mandamus lies to compel them to proceed with the trial of causes which they have delayed without sufficient reason <em>(High on Extraordinary </em>Remedies, \u00a7 250), and the author adds (\u00a7 251, citing numerous cases) that the rule may now be regarded as well established that mandamus lies in all cases to compel an inferior court to proceed to the trial of a cause and to set it in motion where it has unreasonably delayed the proceedings, or where its refusal to proceed amounts to a denial of justice (See also \u00a7\u00a7 147, 148; and 3 <em>Black. </em>Com., 111). The cases in this and other States are numerous where ministerial officers clothed with quasi-judicial powers have thus been set in motion, although the courts have scrupulously avoided interfering with the manner in which the discretionary duty should be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The learned counsel for the appellant evidently misapprehends the language of Emott, J., in People <em>ex rel. </em>Belden <em>v. </em>Contracting Board, 27 <em>N. Y. </em>378 (quoted and followed in People <em>ex rel. </em>Duff <em>v. </em>Booth, 49 <em>Barb. </em>31, and People <em>ex rel. </em>Livingston <em>v. </em>Taylor, 1 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>200). The learned judge there observed that to entitle the relator to a mandamus \u201c there must be a legal right, not merely to a decision in respect to the thing sought, but to the thing itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">That language had reference to a case where the mandamus was granted to compel the thing sought, not merely to compel a decision. Plainly what wras meant was that the mere right to a decision did not involve the right to a decision in a particular way. The language does not convey the idea that where there is a right to a decision of some kind, a mandamus will not lie to compel such decision. Such a doctrine would be contrary to the entire current of authority in this country and in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The appellant\u2019s second point is that no right existed in the relator \u201ceither individually or as a citizen\u201d to a judicial determination of any question by the commissioners of excise. This proposition overlooks the fact that it is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>public duty which is sought to bo here enforced and that, as was observed by Mr. Justice Daniels, in People <em>ex rel. </em>Boltzer <em>v. </em>Daly (37 <em>Hun, </em>461), \u201call citizens are equally concerned in securing its performance \u201d (see the cases and treatises cited in that opinion). It also overlooks the fact that under the statute the board is required to act \u201cupon the complaint of any resident\u201d of the city, and that the present relator, as such resident, was the complainant in the case charged to have been unreasonably delayed. The precise point was decided by Mr. Justice Lewis in People <em>ex rel. </em>Sickles <em>v. </em>Becker (3 <em>N. Y. State Rep. </em>202), and we concur in his conclusion on that head.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">It. is also urged that the board was not bound to act upon the complaint further than to examine the witnesses on both sides; that is, if we understand the learned counsel, to hear the case and not decide it. This is a strange proposition, and if correct it would lead to a strange perversion of the legislative intent. The act reads as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u201c The board of excise of any city, town or village, may, at any time, and upon the complaint of any resident of said city, town or village, shall summon before them any person or persons licensed as aforesaid ; and if they shall became satisfied that any such person or persons, has or have violated any of the provisions of this act, or of the acts hereby amended, they shall revoke, cancel and annul the license of such person or persons, which they are hereby empowered to do, and where necessary to enter upon the premises and take possession of and cancel such license. Upon an inquiry the said board, or the party complained of, may summon, and the said board may compel, the attendance of witnesses before them, and examine them under oath \u201d <em>(Laws </em>1870, ch. 175, \u00a7 8, as am\u2019d, <em>L. </em>1873, ch. 540, \u00a7 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Taking this literally, the appellants contend that they are only bound to act when \u201c they shall have become satisfied \u201d that the accused person has violated the act, and that their non-action is proof conclusive that they have not become satisfied. The difficulty with this position\u2014and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>is not the only difficulty\u2014is that the statute contemplates the satisfaction of the board and that the absence of such satisfaction on the part of the board cannot be predicated of non-action. Otherwise, the law could be evaded by the failure of the board to meet. Whether the board is satisfied or dissatisfied, can only be known after a consideration of the case by the board, and the taking, at a meeting thereof, of the sense of its members. But the entire provision plainly contemplates a summary trial (People <em>ex rel. </em>Kimball <em>v. </em>Haughton, 41 <em>Hun, </em>560; People <em>v. </em>Schewe, 29 <em>Hun, </em>122 ; People <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>96).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Upon the complaint of the resident a summons must be issued and served upon the accused. The board or the accused may thereupon summon or compel the attendance of witnesses and examine them under oath; and the proceeding is styled \u201can inquiry.\u201d Such an inquiry must have a definite result. It would be the height of absurdity to go through all the machinery of a trial and then and there let the whole niatter rest without any consideration by the board, the complaint being treated as thus fully disposed of and the case decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Such a construction would be as dangerous to the accused as it would be injurious to the. public. The non-action of the board could be continuously and indefinitely held over the head of the accused. He would never know the day or the hour when the rod of affirmatively expressed satisfaction as to his guilt might be laid upon him. He would be completely in the power of the board, and the grossest oppression, personal or political, might be practised upon him. Upon the other hand, of what avail to the people would be the complaints of public-spirited citizens\u2014residents of the city\u2014 seeking to enforce the law for the benefit of all, if such complaints are doomed to be legally passed upon by contemptuous silence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In our judgment it was the plain intent of the legislature, as expressed in this act, that after hearing all the testimony the board as a board should consider such testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>thereupon decide by a vote of the commissioners whether the accused person has or has not violated any of the provisions of the Act. If such accused person has so violated any of the provisions of the Act, the duty to revoke the license is imperative. In that case, to quote the language of the Act, <em>\u201c </em>they shall revoke, cancel and annul the license.\u201d And this duty cannot be evaded or the rights of the people trifled with by non-action or silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In People <em>v. </em>Board of Excise (24 Hun, 195), the court held that the duty of revoking licenses was dependent upon the boards\u2019 becoming satisfied that <em>\u201c </em>the licensee had violated some provision of the statute.\u201d The language used in that case involved the concession that the statute is <em>mandatory, </em>and casts upon the board the duty of revoking licenses when so satisfied of a violation of some provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In People <em>ex rel. </em>Belden <em>v. </em>Wright (3 <em>Hun, </em>309), Hardin, J., said <em>\u201c </em>that the commissioners were simply to become satisfied in their judgment, and then this right as well as duty to revoke the permit which had been given to the relator was clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">And in People <em>ex rel. </em>Pressmeyer <em>v. </em>Comr\u2019s of Police (59 <em>N. Y. </em>96), Grover, J., says that the statute authorizes \u201c an inquiry into and determination of the question whether the party licensed continues to be a suitable and proper person to sell intoxicating liquors.\u201d That there must be an affirmative \u201c determination\u201d has in fact never been doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The remaining question is as to whether a peremptory writ should have been granted. The appellants insist that an issue of fact on the question of unreasonable neglect was raised by the opposing affidavits and that consequently the relator was only entitled to an alternative writ. It is un. doubtedly true that a peremptory writ can issue only when, upon the conceded or undisputed facts, the right is dependent upon questions of law. In the present case, none of the facts stated in the moving affidavits are denied, nor is new matter stated in justification, explanation or extenuation of the neglect of the board to consider this particular case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>commissioners deny that they have <em>\u201c </em>unreasonably delayed or neglected and refused to decide or take any action upon the complaints so made as aforesaid by the City Reform Club \u201d\u2014referring not to this particular case of Scheuplein, but to numerous <em>\u201c </em>complaints for violation of the excise law made since the 1st of January, 1890, by the said City Reform Club, against persons licensed in the City of New York.\u201d As to this particular case, the commissioners were charged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u201c X. That in violation of the provisions of law in such case made and provided, the said commissioners have unreasonably delayed, have wholly neglected, and have refused to decide or take any action upon the deponent\u2019s said complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The only answer to this charge is a denial of what is not directly averred, namely : <em>\u201c </em>That the said board or any of the commissioners thereof, are unwilling or have refused to revoke the license of said Scheuplein or any other licensee, for a violatien of the law, as is alleged in said affidavit. On the contrary, deponent alleges that the board of excise and the commissioners thereof are entirely willing to decide the said matter of Scheuplein, and all other matters brought before them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">This is clearly an admission of (by failure to specifically deny) the charge that the commissioners have <em>\u201c </em>unreasonably delayed, have wholly neglected and have refused to decide or take any action upon \u201d the relator\u2019s complaint. It is simply an expression of present willingness\u2014at the time when the affidavit was verified\u2014to decide the case. That is, of willingness under the stress of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">But even if the commissioners had denied the charge of unreasonable delay, they have not attempted to deny any of the facts upon which that charge was predicated. It appears without dispute that Scheuplein\u2019s license was to expire on the 25th of April, 1890. Yet, on the 8th of April, the case had not even been considered, although the commissioners had \u201c often been requested so to do.\u201d Thus it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>appears that when the case was closed and submitted for decision on the 28th of February, the license had fifty-eight days to run. Forty of these fifty-eight days were permitted to pass without the slightest action, and thus when these proceedings were commenced but eighteen days were left of the term of the license. Under such circumstances a denial of unreasonable neglect would simply be a denial of the self-evident conclusion that there was gross neglect, and that the commissioners, by their willful non-action were permitting the accused to enjoy with impunity the remainder of his term.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We agree with the respondent that the f\u00e1ets fully justified the legal inference that the commissioners did not intend to take any action in the matter, that their delay was unreasonable as a matter of law, and equivalent to a refusal to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In People <em>v. </em>Supervisors of Richmond Co. (20 <em>N. Y. </em>252), a judgment refusing a peremptory mandamus was reversed although the claim under consideration was \u201cnot allowed nor disallowed by any formal action of the board.\u201d Johnson, C. J., speaking of this claim, said: \u201cIt was laid aside without other action when the duty of the board was to proceed and act upon the claim . . and we must hold their conduct to be equivalent to a rejection of the claim or else leave it in the power of the board of supervisors to postpone action in all cases till such time as they think fit to proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">This case was followed in People <em>ex rel. </em>Wetmore <em>v. </em>Supervisors of N. Y. (2 Keyes, 288), where Porter, J., observed that it was quite evident \u201c from the inaction and delay of the board of supervisors, as well as from the grounds on which the application for a mandamus was resisted, that the board did not recognize its obligations to raise the moneys in question under the Act of 1860. There was, it is true, no formal refusal, but we think the court below was right in holding that under the circumstances disclosed in the affidavit the neglect of the board was equivalent to a refusal to comply with the requisition.\u201d (See also Queen <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Vestrymen, 8 <em>Ad. &amp; Ell. </em>387, and Queen <em>v. </em>Comm\u2019rs, reported as note, 8 <em>Id. </em>901).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The ease of People <em>ex rel. </em>Hammond <em>v. </em>Leonard (74 <em>N. Y. </em>445), does not conflict with these cases. There the mandamus was not merely to set the officer in motion and to require him to act upon his judgment, but it directed him to do the specific thing as to which he was clothed with discretion. But even there Church, C. J., said it was not a case of refusal to act at all; \u201c delay is alleged, and this is explained by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Where the facts are undisputed, the question of what is a reasonable time is ordinarily one of law (Roth <em>v. </em>Buff. <em>&amp; </em>State Line R. R. Co., 34 <em>N. Y. </em>553, and cases there cited ; Hodges <em>v. </em>H. R. R. Co., 49 <em>Id. </em>225 ; Davis <em>v. </em>Gwynne, 57 <em>Id. </em>677). Whether that doctrine is strictly applicable here need not be definitely decided, as not only are the facts undisputed, but also the conclusion directly charged against the commissioners with regard to this particular complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Upon both the facts and the law we think the order appealed from was right and should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Brady and-DAHiELS, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
