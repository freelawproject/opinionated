The floor-walker told the policeman to fetch her up-stairs, and she was taken there and searched by them. The superintendent of the store testified that it was the floor-walker\u2019s duty, when a person was caught shop-lifting, to report to the superintendent; but he also testified that he and his subordinates never apprehended on <em>suspicion.\u2014Held, </em>sufficient to sustain a finding that the floorwalker was authorized as part of his employment to arrest persons caught in the act of shop-lifting; and that the employers were liable if he arrested upon insufficient evidence or made a mistake in his inference from what he saw or heard.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-11\">3. <em>Action against store-keeper for arrest of customer.] </em>Inasmuch as a store-keeper invites the public to enter his premises, and subject themselves to the custody and control of his subordinates like a carrier of passengers, he should be held responsible, like a carrier, for all the acts of the subordinates toward one who accordingly enters, even when such acts are not committed within the strict line of employment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-13\">Appeal by defendants from a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-14\">This is an action to recover damages for false and illegal imprisonment of plaintiff tiy persons in the employ of defendants. The defendants were proprietors of a retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>dry-goods establishment, and employed a large number of persons. The facts out of which the cause of action arose are as follows. Plaintiff, on February 27, 1880, entered 'defendants\u2019 store, and made sundry small purchases. After she had left the store, and while on the street, she was accosted by a policeman who had previously been informed by the floor-walker that plaintiff had been detected stealing a corset, and he requested her to return to the store. Plaintiff did so voluntarily, not being under restraint or supposing herself to be. The policeman was told hy the floor-walker to bring her up-stairs, where she was accused of stealing the article, and ordered to take off all her clothing, which was then thoroughly searched ; but the corset was not found\u00bb Nobody had seen plaintiff take the article, and her arrest detention and search, were sought to be justified by the floorwalker of defendants\u2019 store on the ground that the actions of plaintiff in leaving the store, aroused in his mind a suspicion of her guilt. The evidence showed that the floor-walker\u2019s duties were to look out for thieves and pickpockets, and to arrest persons caught in shop-lifting. The superintendent of the establishment swore positively that a person was never apprehended on suspicion of having stolen anything, and that it was the duty of the floor-walker, when a person was caught shop-lifting, to report to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">It was not contended that the defendants, proprietors of the store, had any personal connection with the transaction. They sought to relieve themselves from liability on the grounds that the arrest and detention of plaintiff were entirely unauthorized ; that the floor-walker had no authority to cause the arrest of a person on suspicion, and that his acts were entirely outside the scope of his employment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">The case has been four times tried; first, before Judge Pratt and a jury, resulting in a verdict for plaintiff for $800 ; second before Judge Donohue and a jury, resulting in a verdict for plaintiff for $5000 ; third before Judge Beach, and a jury, resulting in a non-suit. All these judgments having been reversed and new trials ordered, the case came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>on for the fourth time before Judge Ingraham and a jury, and resulted in a verdict for $250, on which was entered the judgment now appealed from.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">The justice presiding at the first trial simply directed the jury to assess the damages. The General Term in reversing the judgment, while characterizing the arrest, etc. as illegal, held that the question as to whether the defendants authorized the arrest, and whether the same was within the scope of the powers and duties which they had conferred upon the employee, should have been left to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">On the second trial the judge charged the jury that if, in what the floor-walker supposed to be the exercise of his duty in protecting the goods, he did an act which entailed a loss or damage upon the plaintiff, the defendants were responsible; and further, that if he was mistaken in his judgment in the matter, the defendants were liable. The General Term on appeal held that the court erred in charging the jury that the bare fact that the floor-walker was employed to protect the goods, authorized him to arrest the plaintiff on suspicion, and cause her to be searched to ascertain whether she had stolen goods about her person; that this was, in effect, making the mere supposition of the employee as to the extent of his duty in protecting the goods of the defendants, the measure of his authority to act as defendants\u2019 agents, and make them liable for any or all excesses that he might commit based on his own suppositions of duty. The court cited the case of Mali <em>v. </em>Lord as embodying the rule governing the liability of an employer fur the acts of an employee in such cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">The court in the third trial, would not allow the case to go to the jury, and dismissed the complaint. The General Term in reversing the judgment of non-suit, held that there was enough in plaintiff\u2019s case to entitle her to go to the jury, assuming that the rule laid down by the court of appeals in Mali <em>v. </em>Lord, still prevails ; that it was for the jury to say whether or not the looking out for thieves and pickpockets did not imply instructions as to suspected persons, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>they should not be permitted to go away, but that they should be detained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-5\"><em>Edward P. Wilder, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1l\">I. The case is utterly destitute of evidence to submit to a jury. If the defendants can be held liable for what occurred to her on this evidence, they could, with equal propriety, be mulcted in damages had the floor-walker chosen to commit rape or mayhem on her person. The action is for damages for false imprisonment pure and simple. So held by this court upon a former appeal (Mallach <em>v. </em>Ridley, 43 <em>Hun, </em>337). As such it should be disposed of by the case of Burns <em>v. </em>Erben, 40 <em>N. Y. </em>463. Any person, whether master or servant, has a right to communicate to an officer, in good faith, any fact or suspicion concerning another, and if the officer arrests such third person, it is the act of the officer and not of the person who instigates the arrest. The defendants did nothing which they might not lawfully do (Burns <em>v. </em>Erben <em>[supra] ; </em>Farnam <em>v. </em>Feeley, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>451).</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-6\">II. If the case of Mali <em>v. </em>Lord, 39 <em>N. Y. </em>381, is still law, this action cannot be maintained. \u201c While assuming that the master confers upon the servant the right to do all necessary and proper acts for the protection of his property, it cannot be presumed that a master authorizes his servant to do any act for its protection that he could not himself lawfully do, if present. The master would not, if present, be justified in arresting and searching a person on suspicion, and therefore the authority to the employee to do so cannot be implied \u201d (Mali <em>v. </em>Lord, 39 <em>N. Y. </em>384, 385).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">III. It did not appear that the floor-walker had authority to look out for thieves, etc., and it was error to admit the declarations of floor-walker to police officer, directing him to \u201c fetch her in,\u201d and also to admit evidence of the indignities perpetrated upon the plaintiff subsequent to her arrest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-8\">IY. It cannot be pretended that defendants ratified the misconduct of the floor-walker and the policeman, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>fact that it was done upon their premises, and that the general superintendent came into the room after it was. done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">V. All the cases cited as indicating a departure from the doctrine of Mali <em>v. </em>Lord, except one, are plainly distinguishable from it in the facts involved. The single exception isGeraty <em>v. </em>Stern, 30 <em>Hun, </em>426, which case is not law. Here the court assumed the sufficiency of the instructions and begged the whole question of authority. In each of the following cases, while defendant was held liable for acts contended to be against authority, the court of appeals distinguished the application of Mali <em>v. </em>Lord to the facts (Cohen <em>v. </em>Dry Dock E. B. &amp; B. R. R. Co., 69 <em>N. Y. </em>170 ; Rounds <em>v. </em>Del., Lack. <em>&amp; </em>W. R. R. Co., 64 <em>Id. </em>129; Mott <em>v. </em>Consumers Ice Co., 73 <em>Id. </em>543). The authority to do the act must be first established, and it must be one that the master might lawfully do (Peck <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 70 <em>N. Y. </em>587; Hoffman <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 87 <em>Id. </em>25 ; Cosgrove <em>v. </em>Ogden, 49 <em>Id. </em>258; Lynch <em>v. </em>The Met. El. R. R. Co., 90 <em>Id. </em>77; Corwin <em>v. </em>Long Is. R. R. Co., 2 <em>City Ct. Report, </em>106 ; 15 <em>Amer. &amp; English R. R. Cases, </em>158; London &amp; S. W. R. R. Co., 2 <em>L. R. Q. B. </em>534).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-6\">VI. It is well settled that if a private person merely communicates facts or circumstances to an officer, leaving him to act on his own judgment, he is not liable (Brown <em>v. </em>Chadsey, 39 Bart. 253; Farnam <em>v. </em>Feeley, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>451, Burns <em>v. </em>Erben, 40 <em>Id. </em>463 ; Coombs <em>v. </em>Scott, 12 <em>Allen, </em>493). To hold one responsible for a tort, his adoption of and assent to the same must be clear (Adams <em>v. </em>Freeman, 9 <em>Johns; </em>117; West <em>v. </em>Shockley, 4 <em>Harring. </em>287; Kreger <em>v. </em>Osborn, Blackf. 74; Abbott <em>v. </em>Kimall, 19 <em>Vt. </em>551; Hyde <em>v. </em>Cooper, 26 <em>Id. </em>552; Alb. Law J\u2019s Report of Tucker <em>v. </em>Jarvis, 75 <em>Maine; </em>29 <em>Alb. Law J. </em>115 ; Von Latham <em>v. </em>Rowen, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>237 ; Vanderbilt <em>v. </em>Richmond Turnpike Co., 2 <em>N. Y. </em>479).</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-7\">VII. Nothing should be taken against the defendants by reason of the supposed admissions in their answer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>complaint (Farnam v. Feeley, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>451; Brown v. Chadsey, 39 <em>Barb. </em>253 : Von Latham v. Rowen, 17 Abb. Pr. 237).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-5\">VIII. It was error for the court to refuse to charge the jury, that if they believed the right to arrest, or search, .was confined exclusively to the superintendent and his assistant, and not to the floor-walker, then the defendants are not liable; and also to refuse the request to charge that the defendants are not liable for the wrongful acts of the officer and the floor-walker unless they authorized these acts (Fraser v. Freeman, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>566 ; Kiff v. Youmans, 86 <em>Id. </em>329, 330).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>Ferdinand Kurzman {Kurzman v. </em>Yeoman, attorneys) for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGK\">I. The defendants in their answer attempt a justification of the arrest and imprisonment of the plaintiff and then in another paragraph deny \u201c each and every allegation, not hereinbefore admitted, or which is in conflict with what is hereinbefore stated.\u201d This is not a denial under the code and will not weaken the force of defendants\u2019 admissions (Clark v. Dillon, 15 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>264, 280, 281).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">II. The case of Mali v. Lord, 39 <em>N. Y. </em>381, so often referred to, is inapplicable. In that ease the defendants denied their participation in the arrest. The answer in the case at bar states that the defendants were justified in suspecting that plaintiff was purloining property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-8\">III. The defendants were connected with the wrong by their answer, and by the testimony in the case. Even without the direct testimony connecting the floor-walker\u2019s acts with the defendants\u2019, there was evidence of a custom, or a system, of arresting people in the defendants\u2019 store.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-9\">IV. The principal was held liable for an arrest and imprisonment, in a case where the act of the employee was apparently a much greater excess of power than were the acts herein (Lynch <em>v. </em>R. R. 90, <em>N. Y. </em>77). The selection of employees by employers places the public at their <em>mercyr </em>and if the acts of the servants be really in excess of instructions, the principal should be held.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>V. The amended answer admits that plaintiff\u2019s acts gave the defendants probable cause to suspect that plaintiff was purloining goods. This is an admission of their direct agency in the arrest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\">VI. The case of Mali <em>v. </em>Lord is no longer law in this state. It was relied upon and held to be decisive in Isaacs <em>v. </em>Third Ave. R. R., 47 N. <em>Y. 122. </em>Since then the doctrine has been abandoned and overruled (46 <em>N. Y. </em>23; 69 <em>Id. </em>170 ; 73 <em>Id. </em>543; 64 <em>Id. </em>129 ; 87 <em>Id. </em>25 ; 87 <em>Id. </em>535; 90 <em>Id. </em>77 ; 5 <em>Supreme Ct. [T. &amp; C.] </em>475 ; 36 <em>Superior Ct. </em>222; 46 <em>Superior Ct. </em>211). The real question is whether the acts are within the scope of the employee\u2019s duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\">VII. As the jury could not have found for the plaintiff without finding that the floor-walker had no authority to do what he did, that question of fact is conclusively settled in plaintiff\u2019s favor. What the servant did was in the natural line of his employment. It might have been regarded by him as a duty and a benefit to the master (Quinn <em>v. </em>Power, 87 <em>N. Y. </em>p. 541; Rounds <em>v. </em>R. R. Co., 64 <em>Id. </em>129; Lynch <em>v. </em>R. R. Co., 90 <em>Id. </em>77 ; Geraty <em>v. </em>Stern, 30 <em>Hun, </em>426).</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-7\">VIII. The defendants cannot try the case on two theories ; one that Graff had no authority; the other that the defendants caused the arrest justifiably. Having in their answer assumed responsibility for the arrest by justifying it, and failing to sustain the plea there is no ground upon which the verdict can be disturbed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b230-8\">Van Brunt, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">The. evidence in this case does not seem to materially differ from that which was presented by the record upon the last trial of this ease, upon the appeal from the judgment, in which this court held that there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could find that the floor-walker in the arrest and searching of the plaintiff acted within the scope of his authority, and it would not be necessary upon this appeal to do more than to refer to the opinion previously announced, in order to sustain the judgment, were it not for the apparent failure to comprehend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the evidence, which seems to be indulged in by the counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In discussing the previous opinion of the General Term, it is insisted that it does not apply, because the record on the present appeal discloses absolutely nothing in the nature of instructions that could possibly justify any employe of the defendants in dragging into their store a woman who had been arrested a block away and forcibly taking her to a private room and subjecting her to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We have searched the record in vain to find any evidence which in the slightest degree justifies the foregoing statement. The whole argument is based upon the assumption that the plaintiff was arrested by the policeman in the street and dragged into defendants\u2019 store, and that such arrest was in no way requested by defendants\u2019 agents. The evidence in the case, however, discloses that the plaintiff was not arrested in the street, and that no force whatever was applied to her, either in respect to her movements or in respect to her person, except while she was in or upon defendants\u2019 premises. It is true that the policeman accosted her in the street, but he simply asked her to go back to the store. She did not refuse, and went voluntarily, and had no idea whatever that she was the subject of restraint, or that she was in the custody of an officer of the law. Upon her arrival at the store, the plaintiff went with the policeman and the floor-walker over to a saleswoman by the name of Clark, who was asked: \u201c Is this the woman who stole the corset?\u201d The answer was : \u201cI didn\u2019t see that woman steal a corset; I thought she was looking at bracelets.\u201d The man, who subsequently turned out to be a policeman, looked at the woman and then at the floor-walker, Hr. Graff, and Graff said : \u201c Take her up stairs ; fetch her along.\u201d and she was taken up-stairs and searched by these two men, who, after finding nothing upon her, permitted her to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The evidence in this case shows that Graff\u2019s duties were those of a floor-walker; that he was to look after the employees and to look after thieves; that the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>exhibited their goods in such a way as to attract shop-lifters, and that it was the duty of this floor-walker to arrest persons-caught in shop lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">It is true that Mr. Moore, the superintendent, swears that his duty was, when a person was caught shop-lifting, to report to him, which is absurd upon its face, as while a report was made to him the shop-lifter would have ample time to escape. But he also swears, \u201cWe never apprehend a person on suspicion.\u201d And when asked who he meant by \u201c we,\u201d he said himself and his subordinates. From which the jury had a clear right to infer that, notwithstanding Mr. Moore\u2019s testimony on the subject of instructions, it was the understanding that persons were to be arrested by the floorwalkers who were caught in the act of shop-lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">It is clear that they had the right to arrest, and if they arrested upon insufficient evidence, or made a mistake in their conclusions from what they saw or heard, the defend \u2022 ants can not escape responsibility. The floor-walker evidently had the right to arrest and apprehend thieves, and under that authority, if he apprehended an innocent person his employers are necessarily responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">They cannot confer such an authority upon the employee, and claim the benefits of his action when he acts advisedly, and absolve themselves from all risk when he acts on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">It seems from the facts, to which attention has already been called, that the jury had ample justification in concluding that, although there was an attempt to disguise the authority of these floor-walkers in reference to the powers which they had for apprehending those caught in the commission of crime, it was a mere subterfuge, and that the understanding of the defendants was that their employees should exercise this extreme power, and in those cases where they were justified in so doing the authority was to be deemed conferred, but in those cases in which they acted hastily the sole authority was vested in the general superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tendent, and therefore they were not responsible for the ill-advised action of the floor-walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">There is another view to be taken of this case, which seems to be in consonance with the present line of decisions in regard to the principal being liable for the acts of his subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It was long held by the courts that a common carrier was not responsible for a willful assault by one of its employees upon a passenger. This rule, however, has been abrogated upon the theory that the common carrier invites the passenger to subject himself to the protection and care of the employe of the corporation, and under these circumstances the common carriers should be responsible for all the acts of the subordinates toward the passenger while under his custody and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In like manner, the storekeeper invites the public to enter his premises and to subject themselves to the custody and control of his subordinates, and by parity of reasoning he should be held responsible for the brutalities of such subordinates, even where they are not committed within the \u25a0strict line of his employment. There seems to be no distinction in principle between the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Daniels and Brady, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Note on Liabilities foe Injuries to the Person as AFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT THE INJURED PERSON WAS in Defendant\u2019s care, or by invitation on his premises; or the injury was by fault of Defendant\u2019s EMPLOYEE.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">I. <em>Duty of care.] </em>Formerly the courts were accustomed to \u25a0determine the questions of liability for negligence, according to a test drawn from a conventional and artificial classification \u25a0of negligence into three grades, as \u201cgross,\u201d \u201c ordinary \u201d and \u201c slight,\u201d corresponding to three equally rude distinctions in the duty of care. Perhaps the latest recognition of these distinctions is that to be found in Mark <em>v. </em>Hudson River Bridge Co., 103 N. <em>Y. </em>28, 35 ; but they have now, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>practically disappeared both from arguments and opinions in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In place of these discarded tests the law now looks to the relation between the parties, and inquires for the degree of care which that relation rendered it incumbent upon the defendant to exercise, and the degree of responsibility for the conduct of his subordinates which common usages and public policy render it just to impose in the case of that relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">It will be seen from the cases below stated that an important element in establishing an enhanced duty of care consists in the fact that the person injured was in charge of the defendant or was on his premises by his invitation express or implied ; and that a very different rule of liability applies when he was there only by sufferance though not as a trespasser; and a different one still when he was there as a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The significance of the case in the text, considered in this, light, is in its applying to the relation of shop-keeper and customer substantially the same rule of care, and consequently the same test of liability for wrong, which the law has long applied to carriers. It will readily bo seen, on looking at the cases in the note below, that the same suggestion would be equally applicable to several other classes of relations, although in perhaps a different degree (See cases 1-18).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">II. <em>Modified duty in case of tenancy. </em>J Obviously an important modification of the liability of the owner of premises-for injury to those coming thereon may arise when the owner was not in actual possession, but the premises were in the actual possession of a tenant. For a long time the courts held that the liability to third persons was generally that of the tenant, and that if the premises were in good condition when the-landlord gave possession to the tenant, the stipulations between-them binding the former to keep them in good condition would not cast on him a duty toward third persons, on which \u25a0 they could maintain an action. But recent cases have resulted in the general rule that,\u2014\u201c The owner is responsible if he creates a nuisance and maintains it; if he creates a nuisance and then demises the land with the nuisance thereon, although he is out of occupation ; if the nuisance was erected on the-land by a prior owner) or by a stranger, and he knowingly maintains it; if he has demised premises and covenanted to keep them in repair and omits to repair and thus they become a nuisance; if he demises premises to be used as a nuisance, or for a business, or in a way so that they will necessarly become-a nuisance/' <em>\u201c </em>In all such cases <em>\u201d </em>says Judge Earl in Ahern <em>v. </em>Steele, 115 <em>N. Y. </em>203. \u201cI believe there is now no dispute that the owner would be liable. But an owner who has demised premises for a term during which they become, ruinous, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>thus a nuisance, is not responsible for the nuisance unless he has covenanted to repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The cases in this state in which a landlord has been held liable in ail action in tort for injuries sustained by his tenant or a third person lawfully upon the premises by reason of the dangerous condition thereof, may be divided generally into three heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">1. Where he has leased portions of the premises to several tenants as offices or apartments, retaining other portions . thereof under his own control for general use of all the tenants, as the halls, stairways, etc. (cases 30-35).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">2. Where he has rented the premises with a covenant to keep in repair, and the injuries have been sustained by the tenant or a third person lawfully upon the premises through his omission to make needed repairs after proper notice and opportunity (eases 36, etc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">3. Where he has leased premises upon which there existed a nuisance created by him or of which he had knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\"><em>Relation betiueen employe\u2019s act or neglect and Ms </em>service.] An element of equally frequent importance in cases of negligent or wilful injuries is the question where the line is to be drawn between those acts of an employee for which he alone and not his employer is responsible, and those for which his employer is equally responsible. A few years ago it was almost universally held in this country that an act of the employee the motive of which appeared to be his own malice, did not render the employer liable even though done within the scope of the employment; but all the authorities which sanction that rule are now deemed in so far overruled ; and in respect to the question of the right of action, the motive of the servaut is now immaterial, and even the fact that the employer gave proper instruction and that the act was in direct violation of those instructions does not shelter the employees. The only question is, where the line is to be drawn between acts so related to the employment that it is just to hold the employer liable, and acts so disconnected from it that the employee alone should be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Recent cases to which the reader will look for authority on this question, a convenient number of which are briefly stated below, differ in a way we may best indicate by contrasting two characteristic phrases; some say it is only when the act was <em>\u201c within the scope of the employment </em>\u201d that the master is liable ; others that it is enough that it was <em>\u201c in the course of the employment.\u201d </em>The principle now recognized is, that while the employee is acting in the course of his employment, the employer is liable' even though the act was without the scope of the employment, that is to say unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>And a number of cases go so far as to hold (and it seems justly) that if it was done in the apparent course of his employment and with the implements and the facilities of the employer\u2019s place and premises, the employer is liable notwithstanding that the act may have been in a service not stipulated for by the contract of employment, or during hours when the contract of employment did not require any service. In other words, the liability of the principal is not, as in the case of agency, tested by the' <em>scope of employment </em>but by the <em>course of service.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Notes op Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The following typical cases selected from a large number of recent decisions will afford sufficient illustration of these distinctions, and adequate clue to other earlier authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>Notes of Gases.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">I.

The passage was the usual and ordinary means of ingress and egress to and from the office, from and to the public street. The defendant negligently permitted a trap-door of the passage to remain open, without being properly guarded and lighted. The plaintiff's wife had been to the brewery office as a customer in the defendant\u2019s business, and was walking along to passage on her return to the public street, when she fell through the trap-door and was injured and killed. Upon the argument, counsel for defendant insisted that no facts appeared showing it to be the duty of the defendant to keep the trap-door <em>closed.\u2014Held, </em>on demurrer, that the duty of defendant and breach sufficiently appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">9.

The night was dark and the door was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"><em>Held, </em>that by letting this hall for public purposes, defendant held out to the public that it was safe ; and he was bound to exercise proper care in providing safe arrangements for entrance and departure to those invited to the hall ; and that the question whether there was a breach of this duty, and also the question whether plaintiff was in such a state of intoxication that it contributed to the injury, were properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">12. <em>Fair building.] </em>Latham v.

Of the danger from the rock he had long been aware, but gave no notice thereof to the owners of the vessel. Without negligence on their part, the vessel settled down upon the rock, with the ebb of the tide, and was bilged by <em>it.\u2014Held, </em>that he was liable, whether or not he owned the soil of the dock, and whether or not his wharf was a public place. The owner or occupant of land is liable in damages to those coming to it, using due care, at his invitation or inducement, express or implied, on any business to be transacted with or permitted by him, for an injury occasioned by the unsafe condition of the land, or of the access to it, which is known to him and not to them, and which he has negligently suffered to exist and has given them no notice of.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">17.

Plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed by the fall of such scaffold erected by defendant. In an action to recover damages, plaintiff was non-suited, upon the ground that defendant owed no duty to deceased in respect to the construction of the <em>scaffold.\u2014Held </em>error; that the owner was liable for the injury of persons lawfully on the premises, by his permission or invitation; that the scaffold being erected by defendant upon its own premises for the express purpose of accommodating the workman, a duty was imposed upon it toward them to use proper diligence in constructing and maintaining the structure; and that this duty existed, independently of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">19. <em>Prisoner.] </em>Hartwig <em>v. </em>Bay State Shoe &amp; L. Co., 43 <em>Hun, </em>425.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Prisoner laboring under contractor for prison labor, and injured by machine, sued the contractor. The contract of defendant with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>prison authorities bound defendant to furnish \u201c all the tools, machinery and. stock necessary.\u201d Action sustained. The court says: \u201c While the usual relation of master and servant did not exist, because the labor furnished was compulsory, the defendant must be held to have owed a duty to the convict in respect to the machinery to be furnished for the purpose of the work. This follows from the covenant itself. A contract for machinery carries with it an obligation to furnish machinery fitted to and sufficient for the work, and that it shall be kept in constant repair. The contract, it is true, was with the county of Kings, but the convict was essentially a servant of the defendant. By his crime he lost the power over his own freedom to contract and labor, and his services were let out to defendant as minors and apprentices are let out, by the authority of a temporary superior. He was defendant\u2019s workman, though his wages went to the county of Kings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">[For the limits of disciplinary treatment by jailor, see <em>Re </em>Birdsong, 4 <em>Law Rep.

Followed in Byrne v. N. Y. Centr., etc., R. R. Co., 104 <em>N.

The ceiling in such hallway was in a dangerous condition and defendant had received notice of that fact. Plaintiff\u2019s infant daughter, while going through such hallway, was struck by a piece of plastering falling from the ceiling, striking her upon the head, prostrating her and causing serious <em>injuries.\u2014Held, </em>that the liability of a landlord, who retains-control of a portion of the premises, for an injury sustained through his negligence, is well settled; that the hallway in question was not rented to any tenant except in common with the others, and the defendant was charged with keeping it in repair within the rule, and \"that its unsafe condition and notice to defendant being established all the elements-necessary to justify a recovery existed. The court held further that the fact that plaintiff and his daughter knew of the defects mentioned did not necessarily charge them with contributory negligence, the passageway in question furnishing the only access to their premises, nor was the duty imposed upon them when walking through the hallway of being constantly on the alert to protect the defendant from the consequences of his own misconduct; that it was the duty of the defendant as soon as he was informed of the danger to remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">36. <em>Oases where owner covenanted to repair.] </em>Johnson <em>v. </em>Dixon, 1 <em>Daly, </em>178.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Action by tenant of a stall to recover from the landlord the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>of a horse injured by reason of the bad condition of the flooring, which defendant\u2019s agent had agreed to repair. There was an excavation under the stall of which plaintiff was ignorant and the flooring was rotten. Plaintiff\u2019s son called the attention of defendant\u2019s agent to the fact that the stall was unfit for- use and the agent replied that he would attend to it. The morning, after this was said, it was found that the horse had broken through the floor and sustained injuries from which he <em>died.\u2014Held, </em>that the renting being by the month, the tenant was under no obligation to take up the defective floor and put down a new one, but that the obligation to do so rested upon the defendant, and that for his neglect in so doing the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">37. Flynn v. Hatton, 43 <em>How. Pr. </em>333.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Action by plaintiff and infant child of the tenant against landlord to. recover for personal injuries sustained by the giving way of the railing of a piazza by reason of its decayed condition. The railing had been for two years getting quite rotten and out of repair. Plaintiff\u2019s parents were aware of its dangerous condition and defendant had promised to have it <em>repaired.\u2014Held, </em>that the action could not be sustained on the following grounds: (1.) The piazza was' included in the demise to plaintiff\u2019s father and did not constitute a common passage over which the landlord retained a general or exclusive control. (2.) Conceding that defendant promised to keep it in repair, a breach of her agreement only subjected her to liability to the party with whom she contracted for such damages as might reasonably be supposed to be within the contemplation of the parties, and did not include personal injuries sustained by a member of the tenant\u2019s family. (3.) No warranty is to be found in principle or authority for the proposition that a landlord under contract generally to keep the premises in repair is, for breach, also further liable to his tenant as in tort for willful refusal or neglect to perform his obligation, and his subsequent parol promise after being-notified of defects to make necessary repairs, unless founded on a new consideration, superadds nothing to his original obligation. (4.) The plaintiff was chargeable with the contributory negligence of its parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Note.\u2014This and the two following cases are probably no longer regarded as authorities upon the question of the liability for injuries to person and property, in an action <em>ex delicto </em>based on failure to repair after notice.

Plaintiff continued to use the floor with knowledge of its dangerous condition and received the accident complained of by slipping and injuring his <em>arm.\u2014Held, </em>that \u2022 plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in using the floor after actual experience of its dangerous condition ; that the parol promise to make repairs added nothing to the original obligations and furnished no ground for awarding additional damages; and even had there been an agreement to repair, it would not be deemed to contemplate any destruction to life, or injuries to person or property which might result from an omission to fulfill the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">39.

The lease enumerated certain repairs to be made by the tenant, not including the ceiling, but there was no covenant to repair on the part of the landlord. <em>Held, </em>that the action would not lie; that there was no obligation on the part of the landlord to repair, and that if there had been its breach would not authorize a recovery for personal injuries.

He failed to keep an old shed on the premises in repair, and by reason of its being left in a weak and dilapidated condition, it fell down and drew down a shed of the plaintiff\u2019s adjoining to it, injuring his wagons, etc.\u2014 <em>Held, </em>that defendant was liable for the injury, his liability not being discharged by his having leased the premises to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">41. O'Brien <em>v. </em>Capwell, 59 <em>Barb. </em>497.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Action by employee of tenant against the landlord for personal injuries sustained by the giving away of the railing of a back piazza upon which plaintiff was suspending clothes at the time of injury. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had negligently and carelessly permitted the premises to become decayed and out of repair. There was no covenant to repair. In reversing a judgment for plaintiff on the ground that a non-suit should have been granted, the court held that the plaintiff, at most, occupied but the position of the tenant and that as between landlord and tenant the law is well settled when there is no fraud or false representations or deceit, and in the absence of an express warranty or-covenant to repair, that there is no implied covenant that the demised premises are suitable or fit for occupation, or for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>particular use which the tenant intends to make of them, or that they are in a safe condition for use; and that the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies to all contracts for the letting of property, real, personal or mixed, as much as to contracts of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">42.

There was a provision in the lease that in case of destruction of the premises by fire so .as to make them untenantable for more than thirty days, the rent should, at the option of the tenant, <em>cease.\u2014Meld, </em>sustaining order for new trial and awarding judgment absolute, against plaintiff, that although plaintiff was a tenant of but a portion of the building, and the fire occurred in another portion, there was no obligation upon the part of the landlord to repair in the absence of a covenant to that effect, and the action could not therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">43.

It appeared that the explosion might have been prevented had there been a safety valve affixed to the boiler, but it was not shown that the defendant knew or'had reason to suspect that the boiler was improperly constructed or that any danger was to be apprehended from its use. The lease from the lessor contained no covenant to make any repairs to the premises, nor was there any sufficient proof of such agreement on his <em>part.\u2014Meld, </em>that the obligation to the subtenant was the same as that to the lessee, and that under the circumstances the defendant was not liable for the condition of the premises and that the complaint was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">44.

The evidence was such as to support the inference that the defendant was under obligation to keep the ceiling in reasonable repair, and that there were indications that it required atten<em>tion.\u2014Meld, </em>under the authority of Edwards <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; Harlem R. R. Co., 98 <em>N. Y. </em>245, that defendant was liable upon breach of his agreement to repair in an action for negligence by plaintiff, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>lawfully upon the premises, and that plaintiff could not, as a legal conclusion, be charged with contributory negligence under the circumstances, her eye-sight being somewhat defective, and she being to some extent assured by the defendant that there was no cause for alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><em>45.

The defendant did not make the excavation complained of, and the premises were occupied at the time by a tenant with whom defendant had agreed to put them in repair. Plaintiff was injured while passing along the street in front of the <em>premises.\u2014Held, </em>sustaining a recovery, that the premises having been in a dangerous condition when defendant put his tenant in possession, he was not relieved from liability by the lease, but it simply added another party to the negligence, and as between these parties defendant was the principal, as he agreed to put the premises in repair, but had failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">46.

A lessee of defendant\u2019s was in possession of the pier at the time of the injury. Such lessee had covenanted to keep the pier in order and repair at its own cost. The insecure condition of the pier had existed at the time the lease was made. <em>\u2014Held, </em>that defendants were liable, having leased the premises on which there was an existing nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">47. Camp v. Wood, 76 <em>N. Y. </em>92.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Defendant occupied an inn on the premises in question, and had rented a hall in the third story for a dance, which plaintiff attended. During the evening plaintiff passed through a doorway on the floor below such hall on to a wooden awning above the street: walked along such awning for a distance of about forty feet until he reached the end and was precipitated to the ground, receiving the injury in question. The night was dark and there was no guard or railing to the awning.\u2014 <em>Held, </em>that defendant by letting the hall for public purposes, held out to the public that it was safe, and was bound to exercise care to provide safe arrangements for the entrance and departure of people, for a breach of which duty an action would lie; and that a judgment in favor of plaintiff upon a verdict should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">48. Edwards v. N. Y. &amp; Harlem R. R. Co., 98 <em>N.

There is no distinction in this respect between a demise of dwelling-houses and of buildings to be used for public purposes; in either case, if guilty of negligence or other <em>delictum </em>leading directly to the accident, he is liable, otherwise not. In the case at bar the gallery in question having been erected for the occupation of a limited number of persons in boxes, and being suitable for that purpose, but such gallery having been used without the knowledge of defendant by a large, noisy and boisterous crowd, the mere fact that it fell was not sufficient to charge the defendant with negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">49.

The jury found that the apparatus was unsafe and insecure when the premises were rented by defendant to the tenant in possession at the time of the <em>accident.\u2014Held, </em>affirming judgment in favor of plaintiff, that defendant having rented the premises when they were in an unsafe and insecure condition was liable to any one of the public injured in consequence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">51. In Ahern <em>v. </em>Steele, 115 <em>N. Y. </em>203, 222, the court (Earl, J.) states the rule to be as follows:\u2014\u201cEven when an owner demises premises and -covenants to repair, the covenant cannot inure directly to the benefit of .a third person not a party thereto. But in such case the third person injured because, for want of repairs, the demised premises have become a nuisance, has a cause of action primarily against the tenant. But be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>cause the tenant in case of a recovery against him could sue his landlord for indemnity upon the covenant, to prevent circuity of action, the person injured may bring his action against the landlord, not because the-landlord owed him any duty to repair, but because he owed that duty to his tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">III.

A common carrier undertakes to protect the passenger against anything arising from the wilful misconduct of its servants, while engaged in discharging a duty which the carrier owes to the passenger. Stewart v. Brooklyn &amp; Crosstown R. R. Co., 90 <em>N. Y. </em>588.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">In Feeney v. The Brooklyn City Railroad Co., Barnard, P. J., said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201cThe court of appeals in the case of Stewart <em>v. </em>The Brooklyn &amp; Crosstown Railroad Co., 90 <em>N. Y. 588,\u2014Held, </em>that the carrier was liable for the unjustifiable assault upon the passenger, when the servant, in that case a conductor, was not acting within the scope of his employment. The effect of the decision is to hold that a carrier\u2019s servant is the carrier himself in respect to assaults committed upon the journey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Where the master has undertaken to transport a person safely, an act which amounts to a breach of the carrier\u2019s contract if negligently done, is equally a breach if done wilfully or maliciously. Stewart <em>v. </em>Brooklyn &amp; Crosstown R. R. Co., 90 <em>N. Y. </em>588. If he places lady passengers under the protection of libertines who insult or assault them, or male passengers under the protection of drunken ruffians who fall upon and beat them without cause, he is responsible for the injury. <em>Ib.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">82.

St. Rep. </em>35, the court saying: \u201c The doctrine of that case, in our judgment, is both just and sound, and is sustained by authority;\u201d and citing : <em>Wood on Master and </em>Servant, 2d ed., \u00a7 284, pp. 234- 236 ; \u00a7 300, p. 567 ; <em>Gooley on Torts, </em>535-538.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">83.
