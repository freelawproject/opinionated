The second complaint alleged that, upon being terminated in May 1997, Mrs. Karasek filed for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>began receiving unemployment benefits, that \u201c[o]n 6/28/97, I received a letter from the Unemployment Office stating that my employer Freedom Express/Domegold had filed an objection to my unemployment benefits,\u201d and that \u201cI believe that my employer\u2019s objection was in retaliation for filing the original charge of discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">In accordance with Art. 49B, \u00a7 10, the Executive Director of the Commission referred the complaints to the Commission\u2019s staff for investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In attempting to investigate and obtain information from the defendant, the Commission\u2019s staff was consistently met with a refusal based on the defendant\u2019s assertion that the Commission had \u201cno jurisdiction\u201d over the defendant. The \u201cno jurisdiction\u201d assertion was based upon the defendant\u2019s allegation that it had less than fifteen employees and that, therefore, it was not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the \u201cDiscrimination In Employment\u201d subtitle of Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, the Commission asked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>documentation concerning the allegation of having fewer than fifteen employees, as well as information relating to Mrs. Karasek\u2019s complaints. In one 1999 letter, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201cIt is fully understood that Respondent operates more than one pharmacy, with each being a separate corporation and operating as such. This does not negate the fact that personnel is not being shared among each pharmacy. Thus, ownership is not irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">\u201cEvery effort should be made on Respondent\u2019s part to provide this information within five (5) days from the date of this letter. Failure to do so will result in the issuance of a subpoena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Having received no further information from the defendant, the Commission on December 22, 1999, issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to the defendant, seeking documents concerning the defendant\u2019s corporate structure, the employer\u2019s quarterly federal tax returns for businesses owned or operated by Harvey Goldberg, and documents relating to the discharge of Mrs. Karasek.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant did not furnish the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>sought by the subpoena, and on February 28, 2000, the Commission\u2019s Assistant General Counsel wrote to the defendant\u2019s attorney, stating, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">\u201cAs you have been advised, operations between separate and distinct legal entities may be integrated as to constitute a single employer for purposes of ... Article 49B. Four factors generally are considered: (1) interrelation of operations; (2) centralized control of labor relations and personnel; (3) common management; and (4) common ownership and financial control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201cThe only information you have provided to support your allegation of lack of jurisdiction is the number of employees for one entity owned or operated by Harvey Goldberg. Information must also be provided regarding Mr. Goldberg\u2019s other businesses, including all Freedom Express, Freedom Pharmacy and Freedom Drug stores. Relevant and necessary information includes, but is not limited to: (1) Articles of Incorporation, (2) source of payroll checks, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment and other benefits, (3) hiring practices, (4) personnel forms and procedures, and (5) the legal counsel, for each entity owned or operated by Mr. Goldberg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201cDespite repeated requests, you have failed to provide this relevant and necessary information. Unfortunately, your client has failed even to respond to the Commission\u2019s subpoena seeking relevant and necessary information. In addition to the assertion of lack of jurisdiction, you indicate that your client\u2019s position is that the Commission is not entitled to all of the information sought by the subpoena. However, you do not specify what information your client believes the Commission is not entitled to or why your client believes the Commission is not entitled to it. Accordingly, on March 6, 2000, the Commission will file an action for the issuance of a court order compelling compliance, unless the subpoenaed documents are delivered prior to that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5\">The defendant then turned over to the Commission articles of incorporation and redacted employer\u2019s quarterly federal tax returns \u201cFor Harvey Goldberg\u2019s Corporations: Domegold, Aerogold, Norgold and Bergold.\u201d None of the other requested documents were submitted to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Next, the Commission informed the defendant that the documents . submitted indicated that the four corporations were \u201cintegrated entities so as to constitute a single employer for purposes of ... Article 49B.\u201d The Commission pointed to documents showing that Mr. Goldberg was the president of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>each corporation, that they all had the same principal place of business, and that the wages and benefits were the same with respect to each corporation. The Commission requested that the defendant comply with the other parts of the subpoena \u201cin order that the Commission\u2019s investigation of this matter can be completed.\u201d The defendant replied by refusing to supply additional documents and asserting: \u201cthere is no jurisdiction over Domegold and the subpoenaed items going to the issue of jurisdiction have been provided.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Pursuant to Art. 49B, \u00a7 11(d)(3), the Commission filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the present action to enforce the administrative subpoena.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s \u201cPe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tition for Enforcement\u201d stated that the \u201csubpoena is to obtain information necessary and relevant to the Commission\u2019s investigation as required pursuant to Article 49B, \u00a7 10,\u201d and that the defendant Freedom Express/Domegold, Inc. \u201chas refused to produce the requested documents.\u201d The Commission\u2019s petition went on to set forth in detail the factual allegations of Mrs. Karasek\u2019s complaints, the history of the case, and the correspondence between the Commission and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The defendant\u2019s answer in the Circuit Court repeatedly stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission \u201chas received the subpoenaed information which establishes that the Petitioner does not have jurisdiction, as Domegold, Inc. did not have \u2018fifteen or more employees....\u2019\u201d The defendant requested that the court dismiss the petition for \u201clack of jurisdiction over the subject matter----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an order which neither enforced the subpoena, nor denied enforcement, nor dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Instead, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">\u201cORDERED that the case be remanded to the Maryland Commission on Human Relations for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing to determine whether a sufficient basis existed at the time the subject complaints were filed to treat the then extant corporate entities owned and controlled by Harvey Goldberg as a \u2018single employer\u2019 for purposes of establishing jurisdiction by the Commission. The exhibits which were entered into the record before this Court by stipulation are insufficient to determine more than the common own\u00e9rship and financial control of the various corporate entities by Mr. Goldberg. The other factors which courts have deemed relevant to this inquiry cannot be determined on the basis of the record before the Court and the Court\u2019s suspicion that the operations of these entities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>were sufficiently integrated is an insufficient predicate upon which to establish the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction at this juncture. Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the Commission for an evidentiary hearing----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">On the day after the Circuit Court\u2019s order, the Commission filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing, among other things, \u201cthat there is no authority under Article 49B for the Court to order the Commission to conduct an evidentiary hearing\u201d at this stage of the case and that there had been no exhaustion of administrative remedies. In response, the defendant urged the Circuit Court to deny the motion for reconsideration and dismiss the petition for enforcement, arguing that <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>287 Md. 80, 411 A.2d 86 (1980), was \u201cclearly the applicable case\u201d and warranted a dismissal of the Commission\u2019s petition for enforcement of the administrative subpoena. The Circuit Court entered an order simply denying the Commission\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The Commission appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to any proceedings in that intermediate appellate court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Commission on Human Relations v. Freedom Express, </em>364 Md. 461, 773 A.2d 513 (2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Art. 49B, \u00a7 11(d), authorizes the Commission, \u201c[i]n the administration and enforcement of the ... subtitles\u201d of Art. 49B, \u201cto issue subpoenas\u201d and \u201c(iii) [cjompel the production of books, papers, records and documents <em>relevant or necessary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>for proceedings under the particular subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Commission\u2019s investigation of an employment discrimination complaint is a proceeding under Art. 49B and, therefore, is a proceeding for which the Commission is empowered to compel the production of books, papers, records and documents. <em>See, e.g., Banach v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 502, 356 A.2d 242 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The only prerequisites expressly set forth in Art. 49B, \u00a7 11, for the issuance and judicial enforcement of a Commission subpoena are certain formal requirements, proper service of process, and a finding that \u201cthe production of the books, papers, records and documents is relevant or necessary for the proceedings\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 ll(d)(l)(iii), ll(d)(3)(ii)). The requirement of \u201crelevance\u201d in \u00a7 11(d) is the same as the requirements of \u201crelevance\u201d or \u201creasonableness\u201d which are generally applied by the courts in determining whether to enforce administrative subpoenas. <em>Banach v. State Commission on Human Relations, supra, </em>277 Md. at 506-507, 356 A.2d at 245-246. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 70 S.Ct. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401 (1950); <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946); <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. State Commission on Human Relations, supra, </em>287 Md. at 91-94, 411 A.2d at 92-94; <em>Vulcan Waterproofers\u2019, Inc. v. Maryland Home Improvement Commission, </em>253 Md. 204, 210, 252 A.2d 62, 65 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In the case at bar, there has never been a contention that the above-mentioned \u00a7 11(d) prerequisites for the issuance and enforcement of a Commission\u2019s subpoena were not present. On the contrary, during the hearing before the Circuit Court, the defendant\u2019s counsel agreed that, if there was a judicial finding that the Commission had \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in light of the statutory definition of employer, the defendant would \u201cnot contest\u201d that \u201cthe subpoena should be enforced, [and] that those [documents] are relevant.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel stated that, upon a finding of jurisdiction, \u201cthen their investigation would go forward as to the underlying claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>And yes, if there was that finding, then yes, we do not dispute that we would have to give them that information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Moreover, even if a final resolution of the \u201cemployer\u201d issue were a prerequisite for the issuance and/or enforcement of the subpoena (and it clearly is not such a prerequisite), nothing in Art. 49B or in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, would authorize the Circuit Court, while the case is pending before the agency at the investigatory stage, to remand the case and order the agency to conduct a hearing. As later discussed, a court\u2019s authority to remand a case to the Human Relations Commission for further proceedings is ordinarily limited to actions for judicial review of <em>final </em>administrative decisions. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10-222(a) and (h)(1) of the State Government Article. In an action under Art. 49B, \u00a7 11(d), the court\u2019s authority is to either enforce the subpoena, or modify the subpoena and, as so modified, enforce it, or to dismiss the Commission\u2019s petition for enforcement. <em>See Equitable Trust Co. v. State Commission on Human Relations, supra, </em>287 Md. at 100, 411 A.2d at 97; <em>Banach v. State Commission on Human Relations, supra, </em>277 Md. at 517, 356 A.2d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Whether the defendant was an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of Art. 49B, \u00a7 15(b), rather than an issue to be resolved in a subpoena enforcement action, is a typical statutory interpretation or application issue to be determined by a final administrative decision and to be judicially reviewed in an action under the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Depending upon the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>trative record, and particularly the transcript of the hearing under Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 11(a), 11(b), and 11(c), the issue may turn out to be one of fact, or one of law, or a mixed factual and legal issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The disputed \u201cemployer\u201d issue in the present case is also not a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d question. Instead, it is similar to many other issues which, under this Court\u2019s opinions, ordinarily cannot be judicially reviewed until there is a final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">For example, <em>Board of License Commissioners v. Corridor, </em>361 Md. 403, 761 A.2d 916 (2000), involved an administrative proceeding against the holder of an alcoholic beverage license, based on the sale of alcoholic beverages to a minor, by an employee of the licensee. A statute provided that, if a court found the employee not guilty of the offense or placed the employee \u201con probation without a verdict,\u201d the \u201cfinding operates as a complete bar to any proceeding by any alcoholic beverage law enforcement or licensing authorities against the licensee on account of the alleged violation.\u201d Immediately prior to the administrative hearing, the Maryland District Court disposed of the criminal charge against the licensee\u2019s employee by entering \u201ca verdict of \u2018Probation Before Judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corridor, </em>361 Md. at 407, 761 A.2d at 917. The licensee then argued, at the administrative hearing, that this District Court verdict was a statutory bar to the administrative proceedings and that the proceedings should be dismissed. The agency rejected the argument and scheduled a resumption of the hearing to deal with the merits. Before the administrative hearing could resume, the licensee filed a Circuit Court action, seeking an order requiring the agency to dismiss the administrative proceedings. Like the defendant in the case at bar, the licensee asserted that, under the statute, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>verdict \u201cdeprived the Board of jurisdiction.\u201d 361 Md. at 409, 761 A.2d at 919. The Circuit Court agreed, held \u201cthat the Board \u2018lacks jurisdiction to proceed in the pending administrative matter,\u2019 \u201d and ordered the administrative agency to dismiss the proceedings. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">This Court in <em>Corridor, </em>361 Md. at 417-418, 761 A.2d at 923-924, reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision, held that \u201cthe statutory interpretation issue underlying this case does not relate to the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board,\u201d and held that judicial review of the issue \u201c \u2018will lie only if the administrative order is final,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Driggs Corp. v. Md. Aviation, </em>348 Md. 389, 407, 704 A.2d 433, 442 (1998), and <em>Holiday Spas v. Montgomery County, </em>315 Md. 390, 395, 554 A.2d 1197, 1199 (1989). In holding that the type of issue raised in <em>Corridor </em>was not jurisdictional, we explained <em>(Corri</em>dor, 361 Md. at 417-418, 761 A.2d at 923-924):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">\u201cJudge J. Dudley Digges for this Court, in <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>272 Md. 329, 335, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974), set forth the general test for determining the subject matter jurisdiction of a tribunal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">\u2018If by that law which defines the authority of the court, a judicial body is given the <em>power </em>to render a judgment over that class of cases within which a particular one falls, then its action cannot be assailed for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\"><em>\u201cSee also Board of Nursing v. Nechay, </em>347 Md. 396, 405-407, 701 A.2d 405, 410-411 (1997). Art. 2B of the Maryland Code clearly gives the Board the power to render a decision over the class of cases within which the present case falls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201cSimply because a statutory provision directs a court or an adjudicatory agency to decide a case in a particular way, if certain circumstances are shown, does not create an issue going to the court\u2019s or agency\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. There have been numerous cases in this Court involving the situation where a trial court or an adjudicatory agency has jurisdiction over the subject matter, but where a statute directs the court or agency, under certain circumstances, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>exercise its jurisdiction in a particular way, or to rule in favor of a respondent, or to dismiss the case, and the tribunal erroneously refuses to do so because of an error of statutory interpretation or an error of fact. In these situations, this Court has regularly held that the matter did not concern the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court or the agency. <em>See, e.g., Montgomery County v. Ward, </em>331 Md. 521, 527-528, 629 A.2d 619, 622 (1993); <em>Md. Comm\u2019n On Human Relations v. Beth. Steel, supra, </em>295 Md. [586] at 594-595, 457 A.2d [1146] at 1150-1151; <em>Comm\u2019n On Human Relations v. Mass Transit, </em>294 Md. 225, 233-235, 449 A.2d 385, 389-390 (1982); <em>Parks v. State, </em>287 Md. 11, 16-17, 410 A.2d 597, 601 (1980); <em>Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 268-271, 407 A.2d 320, 321-323 (1979).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">More recently, Judge Wilner for the Court in <em>Carey v. Chessie Computer, </em>369 Md. 741, 755-756, 802 A.2d 1060, 1068-1069 (2002), underscored the narrowness of the \u201clack of jurisdiction\u201d concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cIn earlier days, courts seemed more willing to view limitations on their authority or discretion as jurisdictional in nature. We have moved away from that view in the past few decades, however, in part because of the consequences of such an approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cThat characteristic <em>\\i.e., </em>that rulings are void if the tribunal lacked jurisdiction] \u2014 the utter nullity of rulings that the court had no jurisdiction to make \u2014 necessarily follows from the very concept of the rule of law, the protection of which is a court\u2019s predominant, if not only, function. The Judiciary can no more bind persons to orders it has no power to make than can any other institution or branch of government. If Order is not to descend into Chaos, however, that characteristic needs some circumscription, which, through revisiting the notion of jurisdiction, we have given it. Though recognizing the broad and varied meanings that have been given to the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 in various contexts, we have in recent times determined that, when considered in terms of whether challenged rulings are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>truly and intrinsically void or merely erroneous and therefore voidable, the term must be taken in a more limited sense, to mean \u2018fundamental jurisdiction\u2019 \u2014 the \u2018power to act with regard to a subject matter which \u201cis conferred by the sovereign authority which organizes the court, and is to be sought for in the general nature of its powers, or in authority specially conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pulley v. State, </em>287 Md. 406, 416, 412 A.2d 1244, 1249 (1980) (quoting from <em>Cooper v. Reynolds\u2019 Lessee, </em>10 Wall. 308, 77 U.S. 308, 316, 19 L.Ed. 931, 932 (1870)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The above-quoted language is equally applicable to rulings by adjudicatory administrative tribunals.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">A case that is very analogous to the instant one is <em>Commission on Human Relations v. Mass Transit, </em>294 Md. 225, 449 A.2d 385 (1982). <em>Mass Transit </em>was also an employment discrimination case and, as in the present case, the employer raised a statutory coverage issue. The statutory provisions gave the Commission authority over employment discrimination because of an individual\u2019s \u201cphysical or mental handicap.\u201d The employer rejected the complainants\u2019 employment applications oh the ground that they were \u201coverweight.\u201d Before a. scheduled administrative hearing on the complaints occurred, the . employer filed a Circuit Court action to enjoin the administrative proceedings. The employer contended \u201c \u2018that overweight or obesity is not a physical handicap within the meaning of the definition found in Article 49B\u2019 and \u2018that the Commission has neither the power, authority nor jurisdiction to consider obesity as a physical handicap\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Mass Transit, </em>294 Md. at 228, 449 A.2d at 386. The Circuit Court held that the Commission was \u201cwithout jurisdiction\u201d and enjoined further administrative proceedings. This Court, however, reversed, stating (294 Md. at 233, 449 A.2d at 389):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">\u201cThe [employer] in the present case has couched the statutory interpretation issue in terms of the Commission\u2019s \u2018authority\u2019 or \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 and has charged that the Commission is attempting to \u2018expand\u2019 its jurisdiction and proceed in an unauthorized manner. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>many, if not most, statutory interpretation issues arising in administrative proceedings could be phrased in terms of the agency\u2019s \u2018authority,\u2019 \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 to take a certain type of action in a specific case. A party\u2019s argument that an agency will be exceeding its authority if it ultimately interprets the statute and decides the case contrary to that party\u2019s position, does not excuse the failure to await a final agency decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><em>See also, e.g., State Retirement v. Thompson, </em>368 Md. 53, 65-66, 792 A.2d 277, 284-285 (2002); <em>SEFAC v. MTA, </em>367 Md. 374, 380-383, 788 A.2d 192, 196-197 (2002); <em>State v. State Board of Contract Appeals, </em>364 Md. 446, 456-458, 773 A.2d 504, 510-511 (2001); <em>Commission on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel, </em>295 Md. 586, 592-596, 457 A.2d 1146, 1149-1151 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Finally, even when a disputed issue in an administrative proceeding might legitimately relate to the agency\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, this Court has consistently taken the position that judicial review of the issue must await a final administrative decision unless \u201cthe agency is \u2018palpably without jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d <em>SEFAC v. MTA, supra, </em>367 Md. at 382, 788 A.2d at 197, quoting <em>State v. State Board of Contract Appeals, supra, </em>364 Md. at 458, 773 A.2d at 511. <em>State v. State Board of Contract Appeals </em>also involved a statutory coverage issue, namely whether a particular contract was a \u201cprocurement contract\u201d and thus covered by the statute authorizing the administrative agency to resolve disputes under such contracts. One party insisted that the issue was \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and that, therefore, a court could resolve it prior to a final administrative decision. In holding that judicial consideration of the issue must await a final administrative decision, this Court stated that, \u201c[rjegardless of how the \u2018procurement contract\u2019 issue is ultimately resolved, it is obvious that the Board of Contract Appeals is not \u2018palpably without jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d 364 Md. at 458, 773 A.2d at 511. As an example of a tribunal being \u201cpalpably without jurisdiction,\u201d we referred to the illustration discussed in <em>Parker v. State, </em>337 Md. 271, 282-283, 653 A.2d 436, 441-442 (1995), of a probate court, invested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>only with authority over wills and the estates of deceased persons, attempting to try someone for a criminal offense. <em>See also Board of License Commissioners v. Corridor, supra, </em>361 Md. at 418, 761 A.2d at 924; <em>Montgomery County v. Ward, </em>331 Md. 521, 527, 629 A.2d 619, 622 (1993); <em>Commission on Human Relations v. Mass Transit, supra, </em>294 Md. at 235, 449 A.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The Human Relations Commission, by deciding to continue administrative proceedings on Mrs. Karasek\u2019s complaints, was clearly not acting \u201cpalpably without jurisdiction.\u201d Instead, it was in the process of resolving the types of issues which the Legislature intended it to resolve, including the issue of whether the defendant was an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">As earlier mentioned, the defendant\u2019s principal reliance has been upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. State Commission, supra, </em>287 Md. 80, 411 A.2d 86. <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>was an action by the Human Relations Commission to enforce an administrative subpoena, and this Court decided that the trial court should have declined to enforce the subpoena. The Court held that the subpoena should not have been enforced because the Commission had failed to comply with a statutory prerequisite for conducting an investigation after the filing of a complaint, and for issuing a subpoena as part of that investigation. The disputed issue in <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>was whether, under what is now Art. 49B, \u00a7 9A(b), a complaint by the Commission on its own motion was required to be under oath. The Commission argued that any technical defects in a complaint should be ignored, that, moreover, a complaint by the Commission did not have to be under oath, and that, therefore, the complaint could properly be the basis for a subsequent investigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court disagreed, holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the statutory language required the Commission\u2019s complaint to be under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In <em>Equitable Trust Co., </em>no issue was raised by a party, or addressed by the Court, as to whether a significant defect in the complaint could be resolved in an action to enforce a subpoena. No argument was made in <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>that the issue concerning the validity of the complaint should await a final administrative decision. In addition, where an investigation and subpoena are based upon a complaint, the basic validity of that complaint might logically be a prerequisite for proceeding with the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We need not at this time explore the question of whether the <em>Equitable Trust Co. </em>case was correctly decided, as the issue in that case was quite different from the statutory coverage issue in the case at bar. As previously discussed, a final ruling as to whether the defendant falls within the statutory definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is not a prerequisite for the issuance and enforcement of the Commission\u2019s subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
