We shall overrule the line of cases which injected the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement into the definition of \u201caccidental injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">In January 1999, the petitioner, Vernell Harris, was fifty-eight years old and had been employed by the respondent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Howard County Board of Education, for twelve years at Wilde Lake High School, as a \u201cFood and Nutritional Service Assistant I.\u201d Ms. Harris\u2019s duties included preparing lunches for the students, tending to the cash register, cleaning the kitchen area, and laundering all linens used throughout the day. It is undisputed that Ms. Harris\u2019s regular work involved lifting boxes of frozen food weighing approximately thirty-five pounds from the freezer and carrying them to the appropriate food preparation area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">On the day that she incurred her injury, January 25, 1999, Ms. Harris was doing laundry with a co-worker, as she typically did at the end of her workday. The two women opened a forty-five pound box of laundry detergent, but they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>found that the box was full of cockroaches. They immediately closed the box to prevent the insects from contaminating the food preparation area and moved the box outside. Because the box was very heavy, they could not lift it. Instead, Ms. Harris and her assistant dragged the box out of the laundry room by sliding it through the kitchen and out of a side door. Once outside, they removed the bag of soap powder from the box. This required some pulling back and forth on their part. Ms. Harris pulled on the box while her assistant pulled out the soap powder bag. Once the soap powder was out of the box, they took the bag back inside to the laundry room and placed it in a different box that was elevated only about half as high as the original box.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">After bending down to scoop some soap detergent into a cup, Ms. Harris bent down a second time to tie up the bag of soap powder. At that point, her back \u201ccracked\u201d and she screamed. Ms. Harris was unable to stand upright, and, when a co-worker brought her a chair, she was unable to sit. She appeared to be in excruciating pain. With the aid of another co-worker, Ms. Harris walked to the cafeteria manager\u2019s office who gave her an incident form authorizing her to see a doctor at a nearby medical office.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Ms. Harris was seen by Dr. Prudence Jackson at the Concentra Medical Center later that afternoon. Dr. Jackson testified that it was her expert medical opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that dragging the heavy box of laundry soap outside caused Ms. Harris\u2019s back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In August 1999, Ms. Harris filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, alleging that she was disabled as a result of her back injury on January 25, 1999. After a hearing, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission issued an order finding that Ms. Harris had sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment and was entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The employer, the Howard County Board of Education, filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County an action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>judicial review. At the jury trial in December 2000, Ms. Harris moved for judgment at the close of the employer\u2019s case-in-chief and at the close of all evidence on the ground that, as a matter of law, her injury was compensable under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The trial judge denied both motions on the ground that there was sufficient contradictory evidence, as to whether the injury arose out of \u201cunusual activity,\u201d for the issue to go to the jury. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the employer. Thereafter, Ms. Harris filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial, but the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Ms. Harris took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals which, in an unreported opinion, affirmed. The intermediate appellate court, relying upon <em>Sargent v. Board of Education, Baltimore County, </em>49 Md.App. 577, 580-582, 433 A.2d 1209, 1211-1212 (1981), held that there was sufficient evidence that Ms. Harris\u2019s injury did not arise out of \u201cunusual activity\u201d to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. The appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">\u201cClearly, there was sufficient evidence to allow appellee\u2019s case to proceed to the jury. Although dragging the detergent box outside of the kitchen was not a task which was performed with regular frequency, the nature of the task was similar to the chores performed by appellant during a typical work day, satisfying the first prong of the <em>Sargent </em>test. During its case-in-chief, appellee presented evidence that lifting boxes, weighing between twenty-seven and thirty-six pounds, was a normal occurrence, even if dragging a soap box was not. Similarly, with regard to the second prong of the test, appellee presented sufficient evidence that the tasks were performed with relative frequency: appellant was to lift the boxes almost every day during the completion of her duties.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Ms. Harris filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, requesting in her first question presented that we \u201crevisit the definition of the word \u2018accident\u2019 within the meaning of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d and that we \u201crestore the use of the meaning this Court originally gave the word: an untoward event which was neither expected nor intended-referring to the injury itself, not the activity which resulted in the injury, and thus cons\u00f3nate Maryland law with that of the vast majority of the states____\u201d In her second question presented, Ms. Harris argued that, if this Court were to retain the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement, we should hold that the activity in the case at bar was \u201cunusual.\u201d We granted the petition, <em>Harris v. Board of Education of Howard County, </em>369 Md. 659, 802 A.2d 438 (2002), and we shall reverse. In light of our holding on the first question presented, we do not reach the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Maryland was the first state in the nation to enact a workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>See </em>Ch. 139 of the Acts of 1902; <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Development Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 223 n. 2, 401 A.2d 1013, 1016-1017 n. 2 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>current Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was initially enacted by Ch. 800 of the Acts of 1914. As first enacted, the 1914 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act compensated employees for \u201caccidental injuries\u201d occurring in \u201cextra-hazardous\u201d employment, but the Act excluded \u201coccupational diseases.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The coverage of \u201coccupational diseases\u201d began in 1939, and the \u201cextra-hazardous\u201d language was deleted by Ch. 741 of the Acts of 1970.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The current Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in \u00a7 9-101(b) of the Labor and Employment Article, defines \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201c \u00a7 9-101. Definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 In this title the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">(b) <em>Accidental personal injury. </em>\u2014 \u201cAccidental personal injury\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(1) an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">(2) an injury caused by a willful or negligent act of a third person directed against a covered employee in the course of the employment of the covered employee; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">(3) a disease or infection that naturally results from an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">(i) an occupational disease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">(ii) frostbite or sunstroke caused by a weather condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The above-quoted language contains no mention of \u201cunusual activity.\u201d Under the plain language of the statute, what must be \u201caccidental\u201d is the <em>injury </em>and not the activity giving rise to the injury. The activity giving rise to the injury need only \u201carise[ ] out of and in the course of employment,\u201d and not be otherwise excluded by the Act. <em>See </em>Seidman, <em>\u201cAccidental Means\u201d In Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>18 Md. L.Rev. 131 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">As Judge John J. Parker stated for the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, with regard to the same language in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the statutory language \u201csays nothing about unusual or extraordinary conditions; and there is no reasonable basis for reading such words into the statute.\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. Clark, </em>59 F.2d 595, 597 (4th Cir.1932). The Fourth Circuit in <em>Clark </em>refused to follow this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Slacum v. Jolley, </em>153 Md. 343, 138 A. 244 (1927), and <em>Miskowiak v. Bethlehem Steel Co., </em>156 Md. 690, 145 A. 199 (1929), which had added the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement to the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The line of cases in this Court requiring that an accidental personal injury arise out of \u201cunusual activity\u201d for there to be coverage obviously adds a requirement not contained in the statutory language. That line of cases requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>both (1) that the accidental injury arise out of and in the course of employment and (2) that the accidental injury arise out of \u201cunusual activity.\u201d Such cases cannot be reconciled with the often-repeated principle that this Court will \u201cneither add nor delete words in order to give the statute a meaning not otherwise communicated by the language used,\u201d <em>Blind Industries v. Department of General Services, </em>371 Md. 221, 231, 808 A.2d 782, 788 (2002). <em>See, e.g., Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 38, 811 A.2d 297, 303 (2002) (\u201cWe cannot modify an unambiguous statute, by adding or removing words\u201d); <em>Dyer v. Otis Warren Real Estate, </em>371 Md. 576, 585, 810 A.2d 938, 943 (2002) (\u201c[F]or the petitioner\u2019s interpretation to be adopted, ... there would need to be additional language added to [the statute]\u201d); <em>Caffrey v.

State, </em>294 Md. 370, 378, 451 A.2d 107, 111 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The plaintiff in the case at bar primarily relies upon the leading case of <em>Victory Sparkler &amp; Specialty Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 128 A. 635 (1925), which may be the most cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Maryland case concerning the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Victory Sparkler </em>was a tort action by Catherine Francks, an employee of a fireworks manufacturing plant, against her employer, the fireworks manufacturer. The plaintiff had become ill as \u201cthe result of the gradual contraction of a disease known as \u2018phosphorus poisoning,\u2019 caused by the inhalation of fumes and gases wrongfully and negligently permitted and allowed by the defendant to be collected in the place in which the ... plaintiff worked,\u201d <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 371, 128 A. at 635-636 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[D]uring the years 1921, 1922, 1923, or parts thereof, \u2018she gradually contracted [the] disease,\u2019 \u201d 147 Md. at 378, 128 A. at 638. It was claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the employer failed \u201cto supply proper appliances and equipment for the expulsion of the gases,\u201d and that the employer did not obtain competent employees to operate the equipment for expelling the fumes. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The employer in <em>Victory Sparkler </em>defended the negligence action on the ground that Ms. Francks\u2019s injury was covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, that the employer was ready and able to pay her the compensation to which she was entitled under the Act, and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was her exclusive remedy. The plaintiff replied that her illness \u201cwas not an accidental injury but an occupational disease, and so not within the Workers\u2019] Compensation Act.\u201d 147 Md. at 378, 128 A. at 638. The Circuit Court for Caroline County agreed with the plaintiff, overruled the employer\u2019s defense, permitted the negligence action to be tried, and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff was rendered. Upon the employer\u2019s appeal, this Court unanimously reversed, holding as follows (147 Md. at 382-383, 128 A. at 640):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cThe phosphorus poisoning of the girl was contracted in the course of and arising out of an hazardous employment, at a particular place and within a known and definite particular period of time, and in causal connection with the negligence of the employer, whose neglect and its effect were not foreseen or anticipated by her. She was accordingly entitled to compensation under the act, as is admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>by the appellant, as well as its willingness to pay her compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Judge Parke for the Court in <em>Victory Sparkler </em>began his discussion of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by pointing out that prior opinions had established that, aside from specific exceptions, the Act furnishes the remedy \u201cin hazardous employments, in regard to <em>all injury </em>arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d (147 Md. at 375, 128 A. at 637, emphasis added). With regard to the plaintiffs argument that the \u201cAct is restricted in its operation to that distinct and separate class of injuries arising from accidents,\u201d and the plaintiffs reliance on a few out-of-state cases interpreting workers\u2019 compensation statutes narrowly, the <em>Victory Sparkler </em>opinion responded (147 Md. at 376-377, 128 A. at 637-638, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cThis theory of the statute is at once confronted by the salient purpose of the act, to put an end to private controversy and to litigation. [The plaintiffs theory] splits apart the field of negligence in hazardous employments, and makes futile the law\u2019s pronouncement that it is the exclusive <em>remedy for every phase of extra-hazardous employment, </em>except as by its own terms specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cThe statutory definition of injury, which was made compensable without reference to neglect of employer or fault of worker, except when the injury was self-inflicted or the sole result of the intoxication of the employee, and the abolition of the fellow-servant rule, of the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk, and the substitution of a regulated and certain compensation for damages, contribute convincingly to the conclusion that the legislative intent was to include within the act not only the newly created class of compensable injuries, but also <em>every injury which could be suffered by any worker in the course and arising out of the employment, for which there was then a subsisting right of action. E. Baggot Company v. Industrial Commission, </em>290 Ill. 530, 125 N.E. 254. With this conception of the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and effect of the act, the Legislature was consistent in making the prescribed liability of the employer and remedy of the employee exclusive <em>with respect to all injuries sustained in the hazardous employment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">\u201cThe decisions of other appellate tribunals, which have not reached our conclusion, were controlled by the wording of their own respective statutes, which will be found to be substantially different from the Maryland act either in phrasing, or in additional or in omitted provisions in respect to or affecting the subject under discussion. If the decisions of these courts were adopted, the Maryland act would undergo an amendment by judicial construction through engrafting upon it the effect of the particular provisions of the foreign acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Limiting accidental injury coverage to those accidental injuries arising out of unusual conditions cannot be reconciled with the breadth of the statute described in the above-quoted language.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Next, the Court in <em>Victory Sparkler </em>dealt with the plaintiffs argument that her illness was an occupational disease. The respondent in the case at bar asserts that the <em>Victory Sparkler </em>Court \u201cdid not consider ... the breadth or limitations of the term \u2018accidental injury\u2019 because it was dealing with the negligent leak of a toxic substance into the work place atmosphere, clearly an extraordinary and unusual situation.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief at 10). In the following passage, however, the <em>Victory Sparkler </em>Court included an injury arising out of an employee\u2019s \u201ccommon and regular task[s]\u201d within the ambit of \u201caccidental injuries\u201d covered under the Act. The Court explained (147 Md. at 379-380, 128 A. at 638-639, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cAn occupation or industry disease is one which arises from causes incident to the profession or labor of the party\u2019s occupation or calling. It has its origin in the inherent nature or mode of work of the profession or industry, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>is the usual result or concomitant. If, therefore, a disease is not a customary or natural result of the profession or industry, <em>per se, </em>but is the consequence of some extrinsic condition or independent agency, the disease or injury cannot be imputed to the occupation or industry, and is in no accurate sense an occupation or industry disease. In this case, the occupation of the girl as an employee in a department of a manufactory of fireworks was simply a condition of her injury, whose cause was the definite negligence charged against the employer. The most that is warranted to be infeired from the allegations of fact in the declaration is that the phosphorus poisoning alleged was the gradual result of the negligence of the employer. As this negligence was a breach of duty to her, it was not to be foreseen or expected by the worker as something which would occur in the course of her employment. <em>The fact that she continued, at her place of </em>labor; <em>in the doing of her common and regular task, makes it clear that the phosphorous poisoning happened without her design or expectation, and so her injury was accidental. Providence Life Ins. Co. v. Martin, </em>82 Md. 310, 314, 315....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201cIt was by chance that employer did not use due care, and by chance that the vapor of phosphorus was where its noxious foreign particles could be inhaled by the girl. It was by chance that the inspired air carried these particles into her system, sickening her, and causing a necrosis of the jaw after fortuitously finding a lesion. The injury thus inflicted upon her body was accidental by every test of the word, and its accidental nature is not lost by calling the consequential results a disease. Nor can the fundamentally accidental nature of the injury be altered by the consideration that the infection was gradual throughout an indefinite period, as this simply implies a slow development of the malady, or that, instead of a single accidental injury, there was a succession or series of accidental injuries culminating in the same consequential results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>It is significant that the one prior Maryland case relied on by the <em>Victory Sparkler </em>Court for the above-quoted definition of \u201caccidental injury\u201d was <em>Providence Life Ins. Co. v. Martin, </em>32 Md. 310, 314-315 (1870). In the <em>Providence Life Ins. </em>case, the employee was a locomotive engineer who was stepping between the tender and the first car of a moving train, and was directing the fireman who was backing up the train. The engineer slipped, fell between the moving tender and car, and was killed. He was not engaged in any unusual activity, and nothing unusual caused him to slip. Instead, his slipping was the result of his carelessness. \u201cIt [was] a common practice with persons employed on railroads and engaged in the management of trains to pass from car to car, while the train is in motion,\u201d 32 Md. at 314. In holding that the engineer incurred an \u201caccidental injury\u201d for purposes of an insurance policy, this Court stated <em>(id. </em>at 314-315, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cThe fact that he slipped and fell in so doing, shows it was an unusual and unexpected result <em>attending the performance of a usual and necessary act. </em>His falling was an event which took place without his foresight or expectation, . and therefore clearly an accident in the common acceptation of the word, and the resulting injury, therefore, within the plain meaning of the terms of his insurance----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Consequently, what must be unexpected, unintended, or unusual is the resulting injury and <em>not </em>the activity out of which the injury arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The <em>Victory Sparkler </em>Court later distinguished the noun \u201caccident\u201d from the adjective \u201caccidental,\u201d explaining that \u201caccidental injury\u201d was broader than \u201caccident\u201d (147 Md. at 381, 128 A. at 639-640):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201cIt will be observed that the statutory definition of a compensable injury under the Maryland act is not that it is an \u2018accident,\u2019 or that it is an injury \u2018by accident\u2019 but that it must be \u2018accidental injuries.\u2019 The difference is important, as it marks the divergence between the thing or the event <em>(i.e., </em>accident) and a quality or a condition <em>(i.e., </em>accidental) of that thing or event. As the substantive carries the idea of something happening unexpectedly at a time and place, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the term \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018injury by accident\u2019 has been consistently construed by the courts to embrace two different notions: the first is that of unexpectedness, and the second, that of an injury sustained on some definite occasion, whose date can be fixed with reasonable certainty. The adjective \u2018accidental\u2019 is not a technical term but a common one whose popular usage would not necessarily mean that the words \u2018accidental injuries\u2019 indicated the existence of an accident, but rather the idea that the injury was either unintended or unexpected. <em>See </em>25 <em>Harvard Law Review, </em>pp. 338, 342. In the term \u2018accidental injuries,\u2019 the substantive \u2018injuries\u2019 expresses the notion of the thing or event, <em>i.e., </em>the wrong or damage done to the person; while \u2018accidental\u2019 qualifies and describes the noun by ascribing to \u2018injuries\u2019 a quality or condition of happening or coming by chance or without design, taking place unexpectedly or unintentionally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The Court in the above passage was specifically addressing the employee\u2019s argument that her injuries were outside the scope of the Act because the Act only covers \u201caccidents.\u201d The <em>Victory Sparkler </em>Court responded by pointing out that the Act covers \u201caccidental injuries,\u201d not just \u201caccidents.\u201d The Court went on to define the adjective \u201caccidental\u201d in the above-quoted passage. In the case at bar, Ms. Harris\u2019 injuries are clearly within <em>Victory Sparkler\u2019s </em>definition of \u201caccidental injuries,\u201d which requires that the <em>injuries </em>happen \u201cby chance or without design, taking place unexpectedly or unintentionally.\u201d <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 381, 128 A. at 640. This language was also used to ensure that the injury did not fit within the Act\u2019s two express exceptions to compensation, namely: (1) injuries \u201coccasioned by the wilful intention of the injured employee\u201d and (2) injuries \u201cresulting] from the intoxication of the injured employee while on duty.\u201d <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 374, 128 A. at 637. In the instant case, Ms. Harris\u2019s injuries occurred by chance and were completely unexpected and unintentional. They were neither wilfully self-inflicted nor the result of being intoxicated while on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Court in <em>Victory Sparkler </em>concluded as follows (147 Md. at 382, 128 A. at 640):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cThe Maryland act is remedial and should receive a liberal construction so as to give to it the most beneficial operation; and when it contains positive direction that should \u2018be so interpreted and construed to effectuate its general purpose,\u2019 the Court must act under the compulsion of this mandate, and not disappoint an explicit provision, plainly expressed .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The requirement that an accidental injury, arising out of and in the course of employment, must also arise out of unusual activity for there to be coverage, directly conflicts with this \u201cmandate\u201d set forth in <em>Victory Sparkler. </em>Instead of a \u201cliberal construction so as to give to it the most beneficial operation,\u201d the respondent\u2019s position makes the Maryland Act the most restrictive in the nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The first opinion by this Court relied on by the respondent is <em>Standard Gas Equipment Corp. v. Baldwin, </em>152 Md. 321, 136 A. 644 (1927). <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>was a workers\u2019 compensation action and not a tort action. Nevertheless, like <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>the issue in <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>was not whether an injury resulting from a particular unintended event or condition was covered as an accidental injury. Instead, the issue was whether the employee\u2019s injury resulted from a pre-existing disease or from an accidental injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The employee in <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>\u201cwas an iron moulder in the foundry room\u201d of the corporation who worked \u201cunder unusual stress owing to the extreme heat,\u201d and who had pre-existing heart disease. 152 Md. at 323, 328, 136 A. at 645, 647. \u201cThe evidence [was] that the occupation was dangerous for a man with [the employee\u2019s] disease, of which, so far as the record shows, he was unaware.\u201d 152 Md. at 330, 136 A. at 647. On the day he died, the employee was carrying a ladle of molten iron from the furnace when some of it spilled, burning his clothing, left arm, left leg, and buttocks. He died on the way to the hospital because of \u201cthe dilation of his heart.\u201d There was some medical evidence that the death from heart disease was accelerated by the shock resulting from the bums, \u201calthough such shock would not have caused his death except for the condition of his heart.\u201d 152 Md. at 328, 136 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>at 647. There was also evidence that working under the stress of the extreme heat in the foundry may have contributed to the death by heart disease. Although the majority of the Court reversed an award for the employee because of the form of the verdict, the majority awarded a new trial and held that, because of the above-summarized evidence, the jury could find that the death due to heart disease was an accidental injury covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The dissenting opinion, however, took the position that any \u201cslight exertion\u201d would have caused the employee\u2019s death from heart disease, that \u201chis employment required him to work in [the] heat,\u201d that this was \u201cmerely a common incident of [the] employment,\u201d and that his death did not \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of [his] employment\u201d but resulted from an \u201canteri- or\u201d disease. 152 Md. at 331, 136 A. at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Nothing in the Court\u2019s <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>opinion supports the view that an injury resulting from an unintended event or condition, which arises out of and in the course of employment, is not a covered accidental injury. The issue in <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>was whether the employee died from a pre-existing heart disease or from an injury arising out of and in the course of employment. The Court in <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>was simply setting forth a theory by which the employee\u2019s death might not entirely be the result of a preexisting disease. As the dissent in <em>Standard Gas Equipment </em>pointed out, the Court was willing to allow a jury to find that the employee\u2019s injury was accidental, even though his disease \u201cexisted wholly independent of and anterior to the hiring by his employer.\u201d 152 Md. at 331, 136 A. at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The next case relied on by the respondent is <em>Slacum v. Jolley, supra, </em>153 Md. 343, 138 A. 244. <em>Slaeum </em>appears to be the first opinion of this Court which injected into the definition of \u201caccidental injury\u201d a restrictive requirement that the injury, to be covered, must result from \u201cunusual activity.\u201d In <em>Slaeum, </em>the employee, Mr. Jolley, was a bus driver who became ill and died after driving a bus on a hot June day. The Court in <em>Slacum </em>stated (153 Md. at 351, 138 A. at 248, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201c \u2018But to entitle the claimant to compensation, it was essential that there be at least some evidence that her husband died of heat stroke or heat prostration and that such injury was occasioned by <em>some unusual and eoctraordinary condition in his employment </em>not naturally and ordinarily incident thereto and there is no such evidence in this case.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The <em>Slacum </em>opinion cited no case, in Maryland or elsewhere, for the above-quoted statement. In fact, except for a few cases on unrelated procedural issues, the <em>Slacum </em>opinion cited no case-law whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">As previously indicated, the decision in <em>Slacum v. Jolley </em>represents an extreme minority view and has been criticized. <em>See, e.g., Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. Clark, supra, </em>59 F.2d at 597. The notion that an injury or death of an employee, caused by a continuing heat condition in the place of employment, is not an accidental injury arising out of the employment, is contrary to the plain meaning of the term \u201caccidental injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The first case after <em>Slacum v. Jolley </em>to apply the <em>Slacum </em>holding was <em>Miskowiak v. Bethlehem Steel Co., supra, </em>156 Md. 690, 145 A. 199. <em>Miskowiak </em>involved the death of an employee occasioned by a normal continuing heat condition in the place of employment, and the Court held that the death \u201cwas not compensable under' the rule announced in <em>Slacum v. </em>Jolley.....\u201d 156 Md. at 696, 145 A. at 201. The <em>Miskowiak </em>opinion neither relied upon nor cited any authority other than <em>Slacum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The initial Maryland case to apply the \u201cunusual condition or strain\u201d requirement to an injury similar to that in the present case was <em>Atlantic Coast Shipping Co. v. Stasiak, </em>158 Md. 349, 148 A. 452 (1930). The employee Michael Stasiak was a stevedore employed by the Atlantic Coast Shipping Company, and was working for his employer on a pier owned by the Western Maryland Railway Company. While loading tin plate onto trucks, along with other stevedores, Mr. Stasiak felt sudden pain. An examination disclosed that he suffered a hernia from the lifting, and an operation was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>repair it. This Court reversed a workers\u2019 compensation award in favor of Mr. Stasiak, holding that the employee did not suffer an \u201caccidental injury within the meaning of the Compensation Act\u201d because \u201cthere was no evidence that the injury was caused by any unusual strain or by any condition not incident to claimant\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Atlantic Coast Shipping Co. v. Stasiak, supra, </em>158 Md. at 351, 148 A. at 453. The Court, in a very brief opinion, relied on the \u201cunusual strain or condition\u201d language in <em>Slacum v. Jolley, supra, </em>and <em>Miskowiak v. Bethlehem Steel Co., supra. </em>The opinion in <em>Stasiak, </em>158 Md. at 351, 148 A. at 453, said that <em>Victory Sparkler Co. v. Francks, supra, </em>and <em>Standard Gas Equipment Corp. v. Baldwin, supra, </em>\u201care not controlling, as the facts are distinguishable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The opinions in <em>Slacum, Miskowiak, </em>and <em>Atlantic Coast Shipping Co. v. Stasiak, </em>have spawned a line of cases holding that, to be an accidental personal injury covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the injury must not only arise out of and in the course of employment, but it must also result from an \u201cunusual condition or strain.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Rieger v. Wash. Sub. San. Comm., </em>211 Md. 214, 215, 216, 126 A.2d 598, 599 (1956) (the claimant suffered a back injury from tightening a large bolt \u201cwith a three-foot box wrench,\u201d and the Court stated that \u201cnot all injuries arising out of and in the course of employment are compensable\u201d); <em>Caled Products Co. v. Sausser, </em>199 Md. 514, 517, 86 A.2d 904, 905 (1952) (the claimant\u2019s lifting of a box caused a back injury, but compensation was denied because \u201cthe sudden and unexpected rupture of some portion of the internal structure of the body ... is an \u2018accidental injury\u2019 ... only when it results from some unusual strain ... or some unusual condition in the employment\u201d); <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. v. Daniels, </em>199 Md. 156, 161, 85 A.2d 795, 797 (1952) (acknowledging that the Maryland requirement of \u201cunusual\u201d activity is not followed elsewhere in the United States or England); <em>Jackson v. Ferree, </em>173 Md. 400, 196 A. 107 (1938) (a mechanic was putting a wheel on a truck when the strain caused a hernia, and the Court held that there was no coverage because the activity was not unusual); <em>Heil v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Linck, </em>170 Md. 640, 642, 185 A. 555, 556 (1936) (the employee was lifting \u201ca fore quarter of beef weighing about 160 pounds,\u201d and shortly afterwards he died; the Court held that the death was not caused by unusual activity and thus was not compensable).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">If the decisions of this Court had uniformly required that an injury, arising out of and in the course of employment, must also result from unusual activity in order to be covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, a not unreasonable argument could be made that our erroneous insertion of language into the statute had become too ingrained to be corrected by judicial decision and that any correction should be made by the Legislature. Our decisions, however, have not been uniform or consistent. We have on numerous occasions held that accidental injuries were compensable even though they did not result from unusual activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The decision in <em>Baltimore v. Schwind, </em>175 Md. 60, 199 A. 853 (1938), relied on by the petitioner Harris, clearly supports coverage in the case at bar. In <em>Schwind, </em>a school janitress suffered a paralytic stroke upon moving a long and unwieldy ladder which had fallen and needed to be moved quickly. As the respondent points out, the <em>Schwind </em>Court stated, 175 Md. at 63, 199 A. at 855 (emphasis added), that \u201cthe paralysis which developed as a causal consequence of the rupture of a blood vessel by the claimant, <em>in her unusual effort </em>to lift and place a ... ladder, must be accepted as an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment within the meaning of the statute.\u201d The respondent capitalizes upon this language as support for the requirement that an unusual activity or condition in the workplace must be present in order to have a compensable accidental injury under the Act. The janitress in <em>Schwind, </em>however, encountered the same type of situation that Ms. Harris did in the present case. As the <em>Schwind </em>Court explained, 175 Md. at 64-65, 199 A. at 855 (emphasis added), the janitress\u2019s injury</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u201cwas <em>an untoward event ivhich she neither expected nor intended. </em>The unforeseen mishap took place in the course of her employment as janitress. Her duties required her ... to do the common work of a janitress. It was while she was so engaged that she found it necessary, on account of the delay of the janitor in coming to do the work, and the immediate need of the women teachers to go to the dressing room, to act in the emergency thus created by attempting to raise the ladder and put it out of the way. Although this was not strictly within the ordinary duties of her service, yet this sphere must be determined upon a general survey of the nature of the employment, its conditions, obligations and incidents. She was hired to keep the premises fit for use, and, although the fall of the ladder, and its breaking the glass of the transom and scattering the fragments on the floor, were an unusual occurrence, <em>it was unquestionably her work to remove the glass and get the room in condition for use, </em>and it was in natural and reasonable connection with the proper performance of this work for the janitress to move the ladder, and the court cannot say as a matter of law that her act was in any way inconsistent with her continuing within her employment. The act was not done for the servant\u2019s purpose, but her conduct was on her master\u2019s account, and as janitress, and any peril which she thereby encountered, even if in consequence of her negligence or carelessness, if directly or indirectly involved by her contract of service, would be an incident of and within the scope of her employment. At the time of the accident, the claimant had hardening of the arteries and her physical condition was not good. Although the paralysis might not have happened if it had not been for her physical condition, yet this does not bar compensation, as there are facts and circumstances which tend to prove that she was not made ill or sustained the paralysis from natural causes, but that the paralysis was the result of <em>an unusual and sudden strain or wrench unexpectedly suffered by her in the course and arising out of her employment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>It is noteworthy that the Court in <em>Schwind </em>used the words \u201cunusual and sudden strain or wrench\u201d to describe the injury suffered by Ms. Schwind and not the activity of moving the ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">If the words \u201cMs. Harris\u201d are substituted for the word \u201cjanitress,\u201d the above-quoted passage would be applicable to this case. Like the employee in <em>Schwind, </em>Ms. Harris\u2019s injury was an \u201cuntoward event which she neither expected nor intended.\u201d <em>Schwind, </em>175 Md. at 64, 199 A. at 855. Just as in <em>Schwind, </em>\u201cthe unforeseen mishap took place in the course of her employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Laundering all linens was part of Ms. Harris\u2019s work as a Food and Nutritional Service Assistant, and it was while she was so engaged that she found it imperative, on account of the necessity to preserve the cleanliness of her work station, \u201cto act in the emergency thus created\u201d by moving the detergent box away from the food preparation area. <em>Ibid. </em>Although moving the detergent box outside \u201cwas not strictly within the ordinary duties of her service,\u201d whether or not an activity fits within the scope of ordinary duties \u201cmust be determined upon a general survey of the nature of the employment, its conditions, obligations and incidents.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>She was hired, <em>inter alia, </em>to launder the linens, and, although the detergent box being filled with insects was an \u201cunusual occurrence, it was unquestionably her work\u201d to remove the contaminated detergent box to an area where it would not affect the cleanliness of the food preparation area. <em>Ibid. </em>It had a \u201cnatural and reasonable connection with the proper performance of this work\u201d for Ms. Harris to move the detergent box. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe act was not done for [Ms. Harris\u2019s] purpose, but her conduct was on her [employer\u2019s] account, and as [a food service employee], and any peril which she thereby encountered, even if in consequence of her negligence or carelessness, if directly or indirectly involved by her contract of service, would be an incident of and within the scope of her employment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Under <em>Schwind, </em>an injury is an \u201caccidental injury\u201d if it is the result of an \u201cuntoward event which [the employee] neither expected nor intended.\u201d <em>Schwind, </em>175 Md. at 64, 199 A. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>855. Applying this principle to the present case clearly mandates coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Another case affirming an accidental injury award of compensation, even though the employee\u2019s injury did not result from unusual activity, was <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 6 A.2d 48 (1939). In <em>Foble, </em>the employee\u2019s job was to operate a machine for sewing cuffs on shirts. The operation of the machine involved the repeated use of a \u201cknee press,\u201d whereby the employee would press her knee against a plate, thus permitting the insertion of fabric. The machine had been adjusted so that the knee press was stiff to operate. The employee developed a bruise on her knee from operating the machine, and it became progressively worse. Finally, the employee was taken to a doctor, and subsequently her knee condition required an operation. In holding that the employee suffered an accidental injury within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, this Court relied on a broad meaning of \u201caccidental injury,\u201d pointing out that its holding was \u201cconsistent with the conclusion stated in <em>Victory Sparkler Co. v. Francks, supra, </em>that an injury may be accidental even though the conditions which caused it extended over a considerable period of time.\u201d <em>Foble v. Knefely, supra, </em>176 Md. at 487, 6 A.2d at 53. In the same passage, the Court indicated that \u201cunusual\u201d was simply synonymous with, <em>e.g., </em>such words as \u201cunforeseen,\u201d \u201cunexpected,\u201d \u201cabrupt,\u201d or \u201cunlooked for.\u201d The facts of <em>Foble v. Knefely </em>show that the injury was not the result of \u201cunusual activity,\u201d and the Court did not even cite <em>Slacum, Miskowiak, Atlantic Coast Shipping Co. v. Stasiak, </em>or similar cases. The <em>Foble </em>Court\u2019s reliance was on <em>Victory Sparkler Co. v. Francks, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Zapf, </em>192 Md. 403, 64 A.2d 139 (1949), the employee worked in a rolling mill, operating equipment which lifted red hot axles, weighing about 325 pounds, so that they could be run back through rollers. When operating the equipment on one occasion, the employee felt a pain in his back which got worse over the next few days and which required medical treatment. Although the employer argued that \u201clifting the steel axle into the rollers ... was his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>[the employee\u2019s] usual work,\u201d 192 Md. at 409, 64 A.2d at 141, this Court upheld a workers\u2019 compensation award in favor of the employee, stating (192 Md. at 410, 64 A.2d at 142):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">\u201c \u2018The many cases in which the question has been considered afford no more definite or sufficient basis for that construction than that the rule is one of policy rather than law, and results from an effort to construe all parts of the statute so as to harmonize them and carry out its general intent. The word \u201caccident\u201d is usually considered in connection with the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d and, where it seems clear that the injury arose \u201cout of the employment,\u201d the tendency of the courts has been to give to the word \u201caccidental\u201d a liberal construction in harmony with the general intent of the act, so as to find the injury compensable.\u2019 <em>See also Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. </em>Schwind....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">This Court has, on numerous occasions, upheld coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for accidental injuries incurred in the course of work-related activities which were not \u201cunusual.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Suburban Hosp. v. Kirson, </em>362 Md. 140, 763 A.2d 185 (2000) (the employee fractured her right femur when she slipped and fell in the operating room while she was working as a nurse; she was deemed to have sustained a covered accidental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment); <em>Waters v.

The decisions in these cases cannot be reconciled with the notion that an injury must arise out of unusual activity in order to be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">There is another line of Maryland cases which hold that the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement is pertinent only when there is no apparent causal connection between the accidental injury and the employment. In other words, under the opinions, the presence or absence of \u201cunusual activity\u201d is an aspect in the \u201carising out of the course of employment\u201d analysis. Judge Markell for the Court in the often-cited opinion, <em>Perdue v. Brittingham, </em>186 Md. 393, 402-403, 47 A.2d 491, 495-496 (1946), thus explained (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">\u201cIt must always be shown that the injury arose not only \u2018in the course of [the] employment\u2019 but also \u2018out of the employment.\u2019 ... There must be a \u2018causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u2019 ... The causal connection may relate either (a) to the act or event, <em>e.g., </em>a fall, which produces the injury or (b) to the consequences of the particular act or event. If there is other evidence that the work causes the act or event, <em>then it is immaterial how usual or trivial the act or event is, </em>or how unusual or abnormal the consequence.... If, however, there is no apparent causal connection between the work and the event, <em>e.g., </em>a cerebral hemorrhage or an epileptic fit, then <em>unusual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>or extraordinary conditions </em>of the employment, constituting a risk peculiar to the work, <em>may establish the causal connection </em>between the work and the injury....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">For other cases reflecting this limited role of the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement, <em>see, e.g., Montgomery County v. Wade, supra, </em>345 Md. at 10, 690 A.2d at 994 (\u201cWhere there is no causal connection between the work and the event giving rise to the injury, then unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment constituting a risk peculiar to the work may establish the requisite causal nexus\u201d); <em>Scherr v. Miller, </em>229 Md. 538, 543, 184 A.2d 916, 919 (1962) (\u201cAnd if the causal connection between the injury and the employment is not apparent, \u2018then unusual ... conditions of the employment, constituting risk peculiar to the work, may establish the causal connection\u201d); <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v.

[The appellant] fails to refer to the circumstances under which the rule applies____It does not apply where injury or death results from a fall or a similar accident\u201d); <em>Kletz v.

Terra Chemicals International, </em>14 Md.App. 172, 176, 286 A.2d 568, 570 (1972) (In which Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy reiterated that, \u201cif ... the causal connection between the injury and the employment is not apparent, then unusual ... conditions of the employment ... may establish the causal connection between the work and the injury\u201d). This line of cases is in direct conflict with the cases following <em>Slacum, Miskowiak, Atlantic Coast Shipping Co., </em>and their progeny, which hold that, to be covered, an accidental personal injury must always arise out of unusual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In still other cases, purporting to require that an injury arise out of unusual activity, this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have strained to label as \u201cunusual\u201d activities which appear to be entirely normal in the particular employments, and thus have upheld coverage. <em>See, e.g., Fisher Body Division v.

In these frays, the word \u2018unusual\u2019 is pulled and tugged by the opposing sides in an effort to make it more or less elastic to suit the particular facts of the claim.\u201d Gilbert and Humphreys, <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook, </em>\u00a7 5.1-1, at 77 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In other areas of the law, where a judicially created standard has not been uniformly followed, has been inconsistently applied, and has treated differently persons who were similarly situated, this Court has not hesitated to change or abandon the standard. <em>See, e.g., Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 450-463, 601 A.2d 633, 647-654 (1992) (overruling a long line of cases which, in certain ill-defined types of tort actions, permitted the recovery of punitive damages on an \u201cimplied malice\u201d basis); <em>Skok v.

There are at least four different lines of Maryland Court of Appeals cases concerning the issue, each line conflicting with the others. Like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>judicially created standards that were overruled or changed in the above-cited cases, the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement for workers\u2019 compensation coverage should be abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">This Court has previously recognized that the line of Maryland cases, requiring that an injury arise out of \u201cunusual activity\u201d to be covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, is peculiar to Maryland. In <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. v. Daniels, supra, </em>199 Md. at 161, 85 A.2d at 797-798, after reviewing cases elsewhere, which follow the rule that any accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment is covered, Judge Delaplaine for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cThis broad rule, which has been adopted quite generally in the United States following the decisions in England, has not been fully accepted in Maryland. In this State the sudden and unexpected rupture of some portion of the internal structure of the body, or the failure of some essential function of the body, is held to be [an] accidental injury only when it results from some unusual strain or exertion of the employee or some unusual condition in the employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\"><em>See also, e.g., Stancliff v. H.B. Davis Co., </em>208 Md. 191, 199, 117 A.2d 577, 581 (1955) (pointing out that the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement is contrary to \u201cthe great weight of authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The wording of Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is essentially the same as the wording of most workers\u2019 compensation statutes throughout this country. The American workers\u2019 compensation statutes, in turn, were based upon the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1897, and, therefore, it is generally held that the English cases under that Act are entitled to great weight. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3.06 n. 5, 150.01[1] n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">With regard to injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, based on particular unintended events or conditions, the leading case is <em>Fenton v. Thorley &amp; Co., Ltd., </em>[1903] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Law Rep.App. Cas. 443. In that case, Fenton injured himself while trying to turn a wheel in the course of his ordinary work. There was no slip, wrench or sudden jerk. In holding that the resulting injury was a compensable accident within the meaning of the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1897,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lord MacNaghten stated <em>(id- </em>at 448):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">\u201c[T]he expression \u2018accident\u2019 is used in the popular and ordinary sense of the word as denoting an unlooked for mishap or an untoward event which is not expected or designed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">At another point in the opinion, Lord MacNaghten explained <em>(id. </em>at 446-447):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cIf a man, in lifting a weight or trying to -move something not easily moved, were to strain a muscle, or rick his back, or rupture himself, the mishap, in ordinary parlance, would be described as an accident. Anybody would say that the man had met with an accident in lifting a weight or trying to move something too heavy for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">It does seem to me extraordinary that anybody should suppose that when the advantage of insurance against accident at their Employers\u2019 expense was being conferred on workmen, Parliament could have intended to exclude from the benefit of the Act some injuries ordinarily described as \u2018accidents\u2019 which beyond all others merit favorable consideration in the interest of workmen and employers alike. A man injures himself by doing some stupid thing, and it is called an accident, and he gets the benefit of the insurance. It may even be his own fault and yet compensation is not to be disallowed unless the injury is attributable to \u2018serious and wilful misconduct\u2019 on his part. A man injures himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>suddenly and unexpectedly by throwing all his might and all his strength and all his energy into his work by doing his very best and utmost for his employer, not sparing himself or taking thought of what may come upon him, and then he is told that his case is outside the Act because he exerted himself deliberately, and there was an entire lack of fortuitous element! I cannot think that that is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The above-described concept has been adopted throughout the United States. Professor Francis H. Bohlen, in his oft-cited article, <em>A Problem in the Drafting of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, </em>25 Harv. L.Rev. 328, 340, 343 (1912), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">\u201cSince the case of <em>Fenton v. Thorley, </em>nothing more is required than that the harm that the plaintiff has sustained shall be unexpected. It is no longer required that the causes external to the plaintiff himself, which contribute to bring about his injury, shall be in any way unusual; it is enough that the causes, themselves known and usual, should produce a result which on a particular occasion is neither designed nor expected. The test as to whether an injury is unexpected and so if received on a single occasion occurs \u2018by accident\u2019 is that the sufferer did not intend or expect that injury would on that particular occasion result from what he was doing. * * * The element of unexpectedness, inherent in the word \u2018accident\u2019 is sufficiently supplied either if the incident itself is unusual, the act or conditions encountered abnormal, or if, though the act is usual and the conditions normal, it causes a harm unforeseen by him who suffers it.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Only a small minority of other jurisdictions have adopted the \u201cunusual activity\u201d requirement with regard to continuing conditions in the workplace such as involved in <em>Slacum v. Jolley </em>and <em>Miskowiak v. Bethlehem Steel Co.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>With regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>injuries of the type involved in the present case, namely injuries arising out of and in the course of employment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>based on specific, sudden, unexpected and unintended events, the line of Maryland cases following <em>Atlantic Coast Shipping Co. v. Stasiak, </em>requiring \u201cunusual activity,\u201d seems to constitute a minority of one. A review of decisions under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes of the other states, as well as the federal workers\u2019 compensation acts, indicates that no other jurisdictions presently require that an accidental injury of the type here involved arise out of \u201cunusual activity\u201d for there to be coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> . For a sampling of some of the cases, <em>see, e.g., Alabama Textile Products Corp. v. Grantham, </em>263 Ala. 179, 184, 82 So.2d 204, 208 (1955) (The employee, who operated a sewing machine, lifted a bundle of fabric and injured her back, and the court, pointing out that the injury resulted from no \u201cunusual strain or exertion,\u201d held that it was covered); <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v.

We would also, in effect, recast upon the disabled employee the burden of the old common law defense of assumed risk in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>specific violation of the statute.

Under this more restrictive view, in order for an injury sustained during the course of his employment to be 'accidental,' and thus compensable, it must result \u2018from some <em>unusual </em>strain, exertion or condition in the employment.'
