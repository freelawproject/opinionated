The procedure consists of four parts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the dispute must be submitted to the agency procurement officer for attempted resolution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the agency head may approve, disapprove, or modify the procurement officer\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Third, the decision of the agency head may be appealed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cMSBCA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Fourth, the MSBCA\u2019s decision is subject to judicial review under the contested case provisions of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The present case, being the fruit of the foregoing dispute resolution process, arises from a dispute between Engineering Management Services, Inc. (\u201cEMS\u201d) and the Maryland State Highway Administration (\u201cSHA\u201d) over a contract for the removal of lead paint and the repainting of five bridges in Baltimore and Howard Counties. The dispute revolved around EMS\u2019s claim for additional funds to comply with changes in the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) regulations relating to lead exposure of abatement workers which had not been taken into account expressly during the bid and award process. For purposes of EMS\u2019s appeal to the MSBCA, the \u201cfinal decision of the unit\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> denying EMS\u2019s claims occurred on 28 June 1999. EMS timely appealed that final decision to the MSBCA on 27 July 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The SHA filed a \u201cMotion for Summary Disposition,\u201d asserting that EMS\u2019s notice of claim was untimely. The MSBCA held a hearing at which EMS and SHA presented their respective positions concerning summary disposition. The MSBCA granted SHA\u2019s motion on 9 February 2000, and dismissed EMS\u2019s appeal, construing against EMS the 30-day \u201cnotice [to the procuring unit] of claim\u201d provision of COMAR 21.10.04.02(A) &amp; (C)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as an absolute condition precedent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>MSBCA\u2019s jurisdiction to review the final decision of the procuring unit. EMS timely petitioned the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for judicial review of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The Circuit Court reversed the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the case, ordering the MSBCA to conduct a hearing on the merits of EMS\u2019s claim. The SHA appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In what ultimately became a reported decision, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. <em>Maryland State Highway Administration v. Engineering Management Services, Inc., </em>147 Md.App. 132, 807 A.2d 1131 (2002). EMS filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court which we granted. <em>Engineering v. State Highway, </em>371 Md. 264, 808 A.2d 808 (2002). In so doing, however, we added a third question to the two presented in EMS\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The three questions for review are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c1. Did the Board err in construing the 30-day \u2018notice of claim\u2019 provision of COMAR 21.10.04.02 as an absolute condition precedent to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to review the final decision of a procuring unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">\u201c2. Did the Board, using an unwritten \u2018summary disposition\u2019 procedure, err in dismissing EMS\u2019s appeal based on an allegedly untimely \u201cnotice of claim\u201d to the SHA\u2019s procurement office, where the undisputed record evidence established that the SHA had actual notice of the facts and circumstances giving rise to EMS\u2019s claim, the SHA\u2019s denial of EMS\u2019s claim was not based on lack of timely notice, EMS\u2019s affidavit regarding timeliness was unrebutted, and there is no record evidence of any prejudice to the SHA by timeliness of the notice EMS provided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201c3. Whether, in a contested case involving a claim against a government entity, Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Vol.), Section 10-210(6) of the State Government Article, authorizes an agency to <em>reject </em>the claim by summary disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In March 1998, the SHA issued invitations for bids for the removal of lead-based paint and the repainting of five bridges over 1-95 in Baltimore and Howard Counties. The Contract Special Provisions required compliance with the U.S. Environmental \u2022 Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The relevant extant standard, embodied in 40 C.F.R. Part 50, included a general permissible exposure limit for workers of 150 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter. Contract General Provision GP-7.01 required the contractor to \u201ccomply with all Federal, State, and local laws, regulations and ordinances applicable to its activities and obligations under this contract.\u201d General Provision GP-7.05 additionally subjected the contractor to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926, containing federal OSHA regulations, \u201cas revised from time to time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">By letter dated 13 April 1993, the SHA notified EMS that, at bid opening, EMS was the apparent lowest competitive bidder. The SHA issued a Notice of Award to EMS on 21 May 1993. During the time between the bid opening and the Notice of Award, OSHA added a new subsection to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926. The new regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.62, were published in the Federal Register on 4 May 1993, with an effective date of 3 June 1993. \u201cLead Exposure in Construction,\u201d 58 Fed.Reg. 26,627 (4 May 1993). The pertinent new regulation imposed a maximum permissible exposure limit for lead inhalation, applicable to construction workers, of 50 micrograms per cubic meter and required protections such as protective clothing and equipment and special hygiene facilities and practices not previously mandated by other regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>On 26 July 1993, SHA issued a Notice to Proceed to EMS. EMS began performance of the Contract on 30 September 1993. The record indicates that EMS began experiencing difficulties with equipment it had procured to perform the contract, resulting in some impatience on the SHA\u2019s part. In a letter dated 12 January 1994, EMS attempted to explain its difficulties with the equipment in terms of attempting to meet the EPA requirements, and requested an extension of time to complete the work. On 28 March 1994, the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Unit (MOSH) of the Division of Labor and Industry adopted for state regulatory purposes the more protective federal OSHA standard in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.62.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On 22 April 1994, EMS inquired of the SHA which standard \u2014 EPA\u2019s 150 micrograms per cubic meter or OSHA\u2019s 50 micrograms per cubic meter \u2014 applied to the contract. Five days later, on 27 April 1994, SHA advised EMS that the more stringent provision of the \u201cnew\u201d OSHA regulations governed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">EMS notified SHA on 2 May 1994 that it was temporarily halting work while it awaited results of tests to evaluate compliance with the new OSHA standards. On 6 March 1995, EMS asked SHA for a 180-day extension due to the impact on productivity of compliance with the OSHA regulations. EMS followed on 13 June 1995 with a written explanation of a claim for additional compensation of $1,244,564.00 to complete work on all five bridges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This amount was reduced eventually to the additional cost of the three bridges on which EMS had completed work to that time. On 11 February 1997, SHA instructed EMS not to complete the remaining work on the contract. SHA and EMS terminated the contract as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>remaining two bridges on 20 November 1997, entering into a mutual termination agreement which read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">SHA and EMS agree to mutually terminate this contract based upon the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">EMS agrees that the claim and extensions for the amount of $764,036.00 dated February 26, 1997 (currently at Chief Engineer\u2019s level) is EMS\u2019 final claim on this contract. It is understood that EMS does not waive any rights of appeal of this claim. It is the intent of the parties to delete the remainder of the work under the contract without cost or claim to either party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">SHA agrees not to pursue termination for default. In accordance with normal project close out, SHA will pay EMS any and all retention due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">It is understood that SHA has not agreed to make any payments under said claim before the Chief Engineer, but will consider the claim submitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">This is a mutual termination and release of claims with the exception of those mentioned above. The signatures below indicate confirmation of this agreement, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">The SHA procurement officer denied EMS\u2019s claims for additional compensation on 28 June 1999. No mention was made in the decision of the procurement officer regarding the timeliness (or not) of EMS\u2019s notice of claim for the $764,036.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">After EMS appealed to the MSBCA, the SHA moved for summary disposition of EMS\u2019s claim, arguing, for the first time,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that EMS\u2019s notice of claim to the SHA was untimely under COMAR 21.10.04.02, requiring that a contractor \u201cshall file a written notice of a claim ... with the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>procurement officer within thirty days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to the SHA, the first notice of claim by EMS to the SHA\u2019s procurement officer was a letter dated 13 June 1995; however, timely notice was due by the end of October 1993, according to its calculation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In response, EMS asserted that three of its letters to the SHA during contract performance \u2014 dated 12 January 1994, 6 March 1995, and 13 June 1995 \u2014 each served to put the SHA on timely written notice of its claim that EMS required more time and money to perform the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The MSBCA, after observing that it had been recognizing, considering, and granting motions for summary disposition for seventeen years, based on an unwritten summary disposition procedure, granted the SHA\u2019s motion for summary disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After making fifteen findings of fact (presumably gleaned from the documentary record before it), the MSBCA selected its own date for when notice of claim was due, one which differed from those advanced by the parties. The MSBCA reasoned that EMS knew or should have known of the basis for its claim by the end of May 1994. The MSBCA then held that, \u201c[s]ince EMS failed to submit its notice of claim in a timely manner, the Board lacks jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d The MSBCA justified this conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">The Board\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is limited to that which has been specifically conferred upon it by the legislature. <em>Cherry Hill Constr., Inc., </em>MSBCA No.2056, 5 MSBCA \u00b6 459 (March19,1999) at p. 26 <em>citing Univ. of Maryland v. MFE Inc./NCP Architects, Inc., </em>345 Md. 86, 691 A.2d 676 (1997). The Board only has jurisdiction over a claim that is timely filed under and otherwise meets the requirements of COMAR 21.10.04, as that regulation implements the statutory provisions regarding final agency action in contract claims for construction contracts and appeal to the Board as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 15-211, 15-215, 15-217 and 15-219 of the State Finance and Procurement Article. <em>Cherry Hill, </em>at page 26. In reviewing the pertinent statutes and regulations relating to timeliness, the Board held that \u201c[cjontract claims for which notice was not submitted during the regulatory time period are to be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction without consideration of prejudice.\u201d <em>Cherry Hill, </em>at pages 24-25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">The State Finance and Procurement Article (as it was in effect in 1993) provides that a contract claim shall be submitted in the time required under regulations adopted by the primary procurement unit responsible for the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>curement. Md. State Fin. and Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-217(b)(1988). Pursuant to that statutory authority, the Board of Public Works promulgated regulations in COMAR concerning the filing of claims by contractors. The pertinent provision, in effect in 1993, is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">COMAR 21.10.04.02. Filing of Claim by Contractor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">A. Unless a lesser period is prescribed by law or by contract, a Contractor shall file a written notice of a claim relating to a contact with the appropriate procurement officer within thirty days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">B. [omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">C. A notice of claim or a claim that is not filed within the time prescribed in Regulation .02 of this chapter shall be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">D. Each procurement contract shall provide notice of the time requirements of this regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">In accordance with COMAR 21.10.04.02(D), <em>supra, </em>the Contract provides that a notice of claim be filed within a thirty (30) day time frame. Specifically, General Provision 5.14(A) of the Contact provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">The Contractor shall file a written notice of claim for extension of time, equitable adjustment, extra compensation, damages, or any other matter (whether under or relating to this Contract) with the procurement officer within 30 days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">General Provision 5.14(d) of the Contract further advises that a \u201cnotice of claim or a claim that is not filled within the prescribed time shall be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">From the perspective of the MSBCA, strict compliance with COMAR 21.10.04.02 \u2014 at the procurement officer level \u2014 was a condition precedent to the establishment of a claim, and an absolute jurisdictional prerequisite to any subsequent appellate jurisdiction of the MSBCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversed the MSBCA action. The Court questioned, but did not decide, the propriety of summary disposition without written procedures. The Court instead held that, regardless of whether the MSBCA could proceed without formal rules, the issue of timeliness, defined by the regulation in question as when a contractor knew or should have known of its claim, was a question of fact. As such, the Circuit Court reasoned that the MSBCA could not render a summary disposition without a fair hearing on the merits of the claim, including its timeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The Circuit Court, in turn, was reversed by the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court held that the filing of written notice within 30 days of discovery was a mandatory requirement, and the MSBCA therefore had no discretion to entertain EMS\u2019s appeal once it determined that the appeal was based on an untimely notice of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We shall consider the questions presented in reverse order. At bottom, this case involves interpretation of statutes and regulations. In <em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enterprises, Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 549-50, 814 A.2d 469, 490 (2002) citing <em>Mazor v. Department of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360-61, 369 A.2d 82, 86-87 (1977) we reiterated the six principal tenets of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">[1] The cardinal rule of construction of a statute is to ascertain and carry out the real intention of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">[2] The primary source from which we glean this intention is the language of the statute itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">[3] In construing a statute, we accord the words their ordinary and natural signification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">[4] If reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause, or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">[5] Similarly, wherever possible an interpretation should be given to statutory language which will not lead to absurd consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>[6] Moreover, if the statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, the sections must be read together to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">There is no doubt that the MSBCA is endowed fundamentally with the power to provide for the disposition of contested cases by summary disposition in appropriate circumstances. Whether it has provided properly for the exercise of that power and articulated the circumstances in which that disposition might be appropriate are at the core of this case. Md. Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Art., \u00a7 15-216(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">(b) <em>Proceedings of Appeals Board. </em>\u2014 The Appeals Board shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with Title 10, subtitle 2 of the State Government Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Maryland Code (1974, 1999 Repl Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-210 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">Unless otherwise precluded by law, an agency or the Office may dispose of a contested case by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">(1) stipulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">(2) settlement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">(3) consent order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">(4) default;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">(5) withdrawal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">(6) summary disposition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">(7) dismissal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>While acknowledging that \u00a7 10-210 allows for summary disposition, Petitioner argues that such disposition is \u201cotherwise precluded by law\u201d and cannot be utilized by an agency against a citizen due to a procedural conflict between fundamental concepts of administrative law and those of summary judgment jurisprudence. The Petitioner points out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQW\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e) provides that a trial court may grant summary judgement when there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d and the moving party is entitled to judgment \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d Amplifying on this, this Court has held that the trial court may only make rulings as a matter of law; it should \u201c \u2018resolv[e] no disputed issues of fact.\u2019 \u201d Put another way, \u201c \u2018[i]n considering a motion for summary judgment the Court does not attempt to decide any issue of fact or credibility, but only whether such issues exist ... \u2019 \u201d All inferences must be resolved against the party moving for summary judgment. This deference to the opponent of a motion for summary judgment continues at the appellate stage, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aih\">This summary of the civil law of summary judgment applicable in our state\u2019s Article IV<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> courts is essentially correct. Petitioner continues, however, that under the tenets of administrative law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">[a]n agency\u2019s decision is \u201creviewed in the light most favorable to the agency,\u201d because such decisions carry \u201ca presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1124(1978). Accordingly, judicial review of the agency decision is limited to determining \u201cwhether a reasoning mind could have reached the factual conclusions reached by the agency.\u201d <em>Liberty Nursing Center, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 443, 624 A.2d 941, 946 (1993)(citing <em>Supervisor v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. 614, 616, 547 A.2d 190, 195(1988)). <em>Accord Resetar v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>284 Md. 537, 399 A.2d 225 (1979)(reviewing court will affirm the administrative action when it concludes that a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusions which the agency has reached). Further, \u201c \u2018where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Courtney v. Bd. of Trustees of Maryland State Ret. Systems, </em>285 Md. 356, 362, 402 A.2d 885, 889 (1979)(quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>supra) (citation omitted). <em>See also A.H. Smith Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Water Resources, </em>270 Md. 652, 313 A.2d 820 (1974)(reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for the expertise of the agency in reviewing the agency\u2019s decision.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">This is also a correct statement of law, as far as it goes. Petitioner argues that where the agency is seeking summary judgment, which it equates with summary disposition within the meaning of \u00a7 10-210(6), deference to the agency decision or action is in conflict with the tenet of summary judgment jurisprudence that reasonable inferences be drawn in favor of the non-moving party [contractor], and that therefore summary judgment is an inappropriate procedure, as it would not be reviewable on appeal in effect. A careful reading of Petitioner\u2019s argument, however, reveals that Petitioner is mixing the proverbial apples and oranges on this record and the relevant statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Petitioner\u2019s argument fails to distinguish the various forms of judicial review of administrative decisions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the APA, Md.Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>(1974, 1999 RepLVoL), State Government Art., \u00a7 10-222(h) sets forth six grounds upon which a court can reverse or modify an agency decision if any substantial right of a petitioner has been prejudiced.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 10-222(h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">It is true, as Petitioner sets forth, that an agency\u2019s findings of fact and inferences made in the course of rendering findings of fact are given deferential treatment under \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review [APA, \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v), <em>supra].

Under summary judgment jurisprudence, however, it is not a procedural vehicle to be used to determine factual disputes, but rather to determine whether there is a dispute over a material fact or facts that should be tried. <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn of Bethesda, Inc., </em>335 Md. 135, 144-45, 642 A.2d 219, 224 (1994); <em>Di Grazia v. County Executive, </em>288 Md. 437, 445, 418 A.2d 1191, 1196 (1980). Maryland Rule 2-501(e) instructs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>summary judgment is appropriate \u201cwhere there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Whether summary judgment is properly granted as a matter of law is a question of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The standard for appellate review of a summary judgment is whether it is \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>342 Md. 634, 638-39, 679 A.2d 540, 542 (1996); <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prod. &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591-92, 578 A.2d 1202, 1206 (1990). This is the same standard of review we apply to the question of the legal correctness of an administrative agency\u2019s decision. <em>See Banks, </em>354 Md. at 67-69, 729 A.2d at 380-81. As a result, there is no significant conflict between the deference given to factual determinations made by an agency and the principles of summary judgment. Whether the same may be said for summary disposition practice at the administrative agency level will be discussed <em>infra. </em>In any event, we shall not answer Question 3 because of the reasons stated in our following analysis of Question 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Petitioner next argues, again applying principles of summary judgment jurisprudence, that the MSBCA erred in dismissing EMS\u2019s claim where there is documentary evidence showing that there were disputes of material fact, i.e., what was the trigger date for tolling the notice of claim period and whether EMS\u2019s claim was timely. Were this case to be scrutinized as a summary judgment action at law, we would agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">As we observed, <em>supra, </em>the purpose of summary judgment is to determine whether there are facts in dispute that must be resolved through a more formal dispute resolution process, a trial on the merits. As noted, it is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>purpose of summary judgment to resolve issues of material fact. Despite this principle, the MSBCA made fifteen findings of fact, including a determination of when EMS\u2019s notice should have been given, a determination which differed from that advanced by either of the parties. Furthermore, because review of the grant of summary judgment is <em>de novo, </em>there would exist potentially the question of whether the State is estopped or otherwise waived the notice requirement by its entry into the 20 November 1997 Mutual Termination Agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the regulation in question, COMAR 21.10.04.02, requires that \u201ca contractor shall file a written notice of a claim relating to a contract with the appropriate procurement officer within 30 days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.\u201d We consistently have held that \u201csummary judgment generally is inappropriate when matters \u2014 such as knowledge, intent or motive \u2014 that ordinarily are reserved for resolution by the fact-finder are essential elements of the plaintiffs case or defense.\u201d <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 355-56, 744 A.2d 47, 53 (2000). Were the present case controlled by our summary judgment jurisprudence, this certainly would appear to be such a case where summary judgment would be inappropriate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As a practical matter, however, this question, as well\" as most of what we thus far have said in this opinion in response to Petitioner\u2019s arguments, is ultimately not disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>five of this case, though it may be potentially relevant upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The administrative action under review <em>sub judice </em>was decided ostensibly under the grant to the MSBCA of the power to enter a summary disposition, not summary judgment, in a contested case. APA, \u00a7 10-210, does not describe the modality of action as summary judgment, nor does the MSBCA\u2019s decision in the present case, except in a footnote.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The question thus becomes whether the MSBCA properly implemented the ability to grant summary disposition, and, if so, whether it properly granted it in this case. A more puzzling question is how it is that we are supposed to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">APA, \u00a7 10-206(b), states that \u201c[e]ach agency may adopt regulations to govern procedures under this subtitle and practice before the agency in contested cases.\u201d The enabling statute for the MSBCA is a bit more direct and specific. Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Art., \u00a7 15-210 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">In accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 1 of the State Government Article [the APA], the Appeals Board <em>shall </em>adopt regulations that provide for informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of appeals before the Appeals Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5q\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We have not found, nor has either party directed us to, any regulation of the MSBCA that provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>summary disposition procedures.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Where an agency decision flows from an unlawful procedure, that decision is subject to reversal or modification by the courts. APA, \u00a7 10 \u2014 222(h)(8)(iii).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We have recognized this principal of our State\u2019s administrative law as being similar to the federal <em>Accardi </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>MTA v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 286-87, 799 A.2d 1246, 1252-53 (2002). <em>See Pollock v. Patuxent Institution Bd. of Review, </em>374 Md. 463, 823 A.2d 626 (2003)(expressly adopting for purposes of Maryland administrative law a version of the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine). Contrary to the conduct of the MSBCA, procedural rules must be promulgated by formal rulemaking and cannot be made in ad hoc fashion through adjudication. Under \u00a7 10-101(g)(l), \u201cthe Maryland APA does not follow the federal APA\u2019s exceptions to the rulemaking procedures [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A) &amp; (B)], and indeed expressly rejects most of the federal APA exceptions. Under the Maryland APA, an agency\u2019s organizational rules, procedural rules, interpretive rules and statements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>policy all must go through the same procedures as required for legislative rules.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While an agency has some discretion with regard to policy questions whether to proceed by regulation or by decisional rule, <em>Maryland Ass\u2019n of Health Maint. Org. v. Health Serv. Cost Review Comm\u2019n, </em>356 Md. 581, 600, 741 A.2d 483, 493 (1999), in Maryland, this discretion does not exist as to procedural matters.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As we pointed out in <em>Calvert County v. Howlin, </em>364 Md. 301, 322, 772 A.2d 1209, 1221 (2001), in a non-APA context:<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Rules for the transaction of business of public agencies are intended to be normative principles formally adopted by the agency in written form, in accordance with whatever procedural requirements may apply, and, upon request, made available in advance to persons dealing with the agency. Only then can there be some assurance against arbitrary and capricious conduct on the part of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Here, the MSBCA was directed by statute that it \u201cshall adopt regulations,\u201d yet it failed to do so with regard to summary disposition. In <em>Tranen v. Aziz, </em>59 Md.App. 528, 534-35, 476 A.2d 1170, 1173 (1984), the Court of Special Appeals correctly observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">[t]he term \u201cshall\u201d is presumed mandatory on the parties, denoting \u201can imperative obligation inconsistent with the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Johnson v.

Judicial review of administrative decisions generally is limited to the issues raised before the agency. <em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Woodmont Country Club, </em>348 Md. 572, 582, n. 3, 705 A.2d 301, 305, n. 3 <em>(1998)(citing Ins. Comm\u2019r of the State of Maryland v. Equitable Life Assurance. Soc\u2019y. of the United States, </em>339 Md. 596, 634, 664 A.2d 862, 881 (1995)). We reach this issue, however, not because EMS raised it on appeal, but rather because it is an integral, and thus unavoidable, component of our determination of the properly raised issue of whether the MSBCA\u2019s grant of summary disposition was appropriate in this case. This is because the MSBCA\u2019s failure to adopt pertinent procedural rules in the case <em>sub judice </em>interferes with the ability of the courts to perform their constitutional function of review. <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 500-503, 331 A.2d 55, 65-66 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">As we pointed out, <em>supra, </em>APA, \u00a7 10-222(h) sets forth six grounds upon which a court may reverse or modify an agency decision if any substantial right of a petitioner has been prejudiced, among which are any finding, conclusion, or decision which results from an unlawful procedure, and any finding, conclusion, or decision which is affected by any other error of law. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the MSBCA has failed to define what a \u201csummary disposition\u201d is, or to set forth by what standards and under what conditions it is appropriate that a summary disposition may be sought or granted, or what procedures will be utilized by the MSBCA to make such a determination. Absent such standards, procedures, and defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>nitions, the courts cannot make a determination as to whether, in application, an error of law or procedure otherwise occurred at the administrative level.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We only may reverse the decision of the MSBCA on the ground that it utilized an unlawful procedure by not adopting relevant procedures as required under its enabling statute, Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Art., \u00a7 15-210. Thus, while there can be no doubt that APA, \u00a7 10-210 permits agencies to dispose of cases by summary disposition, we hold that the MSBCA is required to promulgate proper descriptions and procedures through formal rulemaking before it may do so henceforth.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Concluding that the MSBCA utilized an unlawful procedure to dispose of EMS\u2019s claim, we could end our analysis. In this instance, however, because a substantive determination was made by the MSBCA which we regard as being potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>erroneous in another regard, we shall comment on that as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Art., \u00a7 15-217(b) mandates that a contract claim \u201cshall be submitted within the time required under regulations adopted by the primary procurement unit responsible for the procurement.\u201d Pursuant to this statute, the procurement regulations require that \u201ca contractor shall file a written notice of a claim relating to a contract with the appropriate procurement officer within 30 days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.\u201d COMAR 21.10.04.02(A).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> These regulations also state that \u201c[a] notice of claim or [an explanation of] a claim that is not filed within the time prescribed in Regulation .02 shall be dismissed\u201d by the procurement officer. CO-MAR 21.10.04.02(C). The MSBCA, relying entirely on its own prior reasoning in <em>Cherry Hill Constr., Inc., </em>MSBCA No.2056, 5 MSBCA \u00b6 549 (1999), asserted that this requirement is a condition precedent to its exercise of jurisdiction, and dismissed EMS\u2019s appeal on those grounds.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Such an analysis appears incorrect.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The \u2022 MSBCA decision took the position that it had no subject matter jurisdiction where a condition precedent to the establishment of a claim had failed to occur, following its own reasoning in <em>Cherry Hill. </em>To understand the MSBCA\u2019s reasoning requires reciting the statutes, the interpretation of which the MSBCA\u2019s <em>Cherry Hill </em>action was based. Md.Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Art., \u00a7 15-217(b) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">(b) <em>Time for submission. </em>\u2014 Except a provided in \u00a7 15-219 of this subtitle, a protest or contract claim shall be submitted within the time required under regulations adopted by the primary procurement unit responsible for the procurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Md.Code (1974, 2001 RepLVol.), State Finance and Procurement Art., \u00a7 15-219 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">(a) <em>Notice of claim must be filed within 30 days. </em>\u2014 Except to the extent a shorter period is prescribed by regulation governing differing site conditions,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> a contractor shall file a written notice of a claim relating to a procurement contract for construction within 30 days after the basis for the claim is known or should have been known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">(b) <em>Explanation of claim. </em>\u2014 Unless extended by the unit, within 90 days after submitting a notice of a contract claim under a procurement contract for construction, a contractor shall submit to the unit a written explanation that states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">(1) the amount of the contract claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">(2) the facts on which the contract claim is based; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">(3) all relevant data and correspondence that may substantiate the contract claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">In response to these statutes, COMAR 21.10.04.02 was promulgated,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>A.

Contemporaneously with or within 30 days of the filing of a notice of a claim, but no later than the date that final payment is made, a contractor shall submit the claim to the appropriate procurement officer. On conditions the procurement officer considers satisfactory to the unit, the procurement officer may extend the time in which a contractor, after timely submitting a notice of claim, must submit a contract claim under a procurement contract for construction. An example of when a procurement officer may grant an extension includes situations in which the procurement officer finds that a contemporaneous or timely cost quantification following the filing of the notice of claim is impossible or impractical.

It then concluded that \u201cuntimely notice is sometimes a jurisdictional issue, and sometimes a defense to a claim, depending upon which clause is controlling \u2014 the 30-day requirement for filing notice of a claim is jurisdictional; documentation of that claim is more a matter of discretion on the part of the Agency and the Board, and therefore falls more towards a defense to a claim.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Cherry Hill </em>at \u00b6 458-59. We reject this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Relying on its reasoning in <em>Cherry Hill, </em>the MSBCA in the case <em>sub judice </em>concluded that the notice requirement was a condition precedent to the existence of a claim, and thus to its exercise of jurisdiction. The MSBCA appears to reason that COMAR 21.10.04.02(A) may not be waived expressly, and therefore a failure to make a timely claim necessarily precludes all circumstances where the existence of a valid claim might arise, and also prevents the creation of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The MSBCA overlooks, however, the possibility of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In <em>Chandlee v.

Because a condition precedent can be met by estoppel, and estoppel is a factual matter which can be determined only upon a full hearing, on the merits, it is inappropriate to view a statute [of limitations] which exists as a condition precedent to a claim in a summary judgment context to be a matter of subject matter jurisdiction to which issues of estoppel and waiver may not be considered [under Maryland administrative law]. We conclude, therefore, that the issue of untimely notice would be a defense and a factual question to be determined during the course of a full hearing on the merits, and not a jurisdictional bar to the pursuit of a contractor\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>As a result, we further conclude that the MSBCA had jurisdiction to hear this claim on the merits.

As is discussed <em>infra, </em>certain determinations by governmental agencies are afforded deference by a reviewing court on the theory that the agency is specialized and has greater expertise within the area of its authority. This presumption of expertise, however, cuts both ways. We observe that the new OSHA standards were published before the SHA let the contract to EMS. It reasonably could be argued that the SHA, therefore, knew or should have known before it let the contract that the more stringent standards would apply, that they would be more expensive to comply with, and that all of the bids it received for the bridges contract, being calculated and submitted prior to the publication of the changes to the OSHA regulations, were likely to be based on a mistaken estimate as to what those cost would be, thus substantially under-calculating the actual costs involved in the anticipated performance of the contract. <em>See </em>n. 10, <em>supra. </em>Further, that the State was aware that the new regulations were causing problems for bridge painters elsewhere in the State, particularly with regard to acquiring approved respiratory equipment necessary for compliance, was admitted by the State in a 22 June 1994 letter, in the record, addressed to Reglas Painting from the Division of Labor and Industry compliance health manager, Andrew Alcarese.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\">.

While both <em>Howlin </em>and the case <em>sub judice </em>involve circumstances where the agency in question failed to promulgate, through rulemaking, procedural rules, as opposed to agency policy determinations, in reaching this decision we distinguish factually the case <em>sub judice </em>from <em>Howlin. </em>In <em>Howlin, </em>we found that, although the County Planning Commission failed to promulgate procedural rules, no due process right was violated by that omission. That determination is fairly limited to the specific facts of <em>Howlin, </em>a case to which the State APA did not apply, and is not applicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>At issue in <em>Howlin </em>was the fact that the Planning Commission had no rules of procedure for a unique, one-of-a-kind hearing re-opening a prior Commission determination that subsequently was found to be in error. While the Planning Commission announced procedural rules, which were agreed to, immediately prior to the hearing, it failed to announce what burden of proof would have to be met. We held that, while the failure to have rules in place violated the Commission\u2019s enabling statute, no injury or prejudice resulted from the failure to announce a standard because the developer/applicant was unable to meet even the lowest burden, that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>preponderance of the evidence.
