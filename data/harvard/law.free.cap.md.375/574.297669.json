The Circuit Court. for St. Mary\u2019s County reversed the judgment of the Commission, ruling, on summary judgment, that jurisdiction over the matter did not lie in Maryland. Dissatisfied with the reversal of the judgment of the Commission, the respondent appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court agreed with the Commission and, thus, reversed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Pohopek v. McElroy Truck Lines, </em>140 Md.App. 235, 237, 780 A.2d 383, 384 (2001). We shall affirm the Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The respondent sought employment with the petitioner by filing an application with an agent of the petitioner in North Carolina. After having been offered, and accepted, employment with the petitioner, the respondent underwent a week\u2019s training and orientation in North Carolina, during the course of which he was presented with, and signed, a Workers\u2019 Compensation Agreement. Under that agreement, all workers\u2019 compensation claims were to be \u201cexclusively governed by the [workers\u2019] compensation laws of the State of Alabama,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the petitioner\u2019s principal place of business was located. Thereafter, the respondent was assigned a tractor-trailer leased by the petitioner, which he picked up in Virginia, and, having only a Pennsylvania commercial driver\u2019s license, at the petitioner\u2019s request, obtained a Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The respondent obtained his delivery assignments by calling the petitioner\u2019s dispatchers. Mostly he called dispatchers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>North Carolina, but he also received assignments from dispatchers in Alabama and Virginia. The respondent\u2019s deliveries were to states primarily along the eastern seaboard, from as far north as New Hampshire to as far south as Mississippi.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitioner argued, and the Circuit Court determined, that it was undisputed that, while he was employed by the petitioner, the respondent made 145 deliveries, of which only 28, or 19 percent, were in Maryland and, of 45 refueling stops, only 9 occurred in Maryland. The Circuit Court concluded: \u201cGiven these facts, [the petitioner] conducted around 80 percent of his employment activity outside the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The respondent was off on weekends. When he was off, as a part of his employment agreement, the company supplied tractor-trailer was kept in Maryland near the respondent\u2019s home in St. Mary\u2019s County. In addition to looking after the tractor-trailer and its contents \u2014 it usually was loaded on Fridays for Monday morning delivery \u2014 , the respondent was responsible for its regular maintenance and appearance. The Court of Special Appeals also observed: \u201cIn the early morning hours each Monday, Pohopek would conduct a pre-trip checklist of the truck, which consisted of testing the engine, brakes, lights, and other routine mechanical components. Pohopek then, in accordance with federal requirements, updated his log book.\u201d <em>Pohopek, </em>at 237, 780 A.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">After having worked for the petitioner for approximately six months, the respondent was involved in an accident while driving the petitioner\u2019s tractor-trailer through South Carolina. He filed in Maryland a workers\u2019 compensation claim for the injuries he sustained. The petitioner defended on the basis that the Commission had no jurisdiction over the case, that the respondent was not a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d As indicated, although the Circuit Court was persuaded, both the Commission and the Court of Special Appeals rejected that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Whether the respondent is a \u201ccovered employer\u201d must be determined by reference to \u00a7 9-202 and \u00a7 9-203. The former addresses the relationship between the employee and the employer, while the latter, the place of the injury. Section 9-202 makes clear that to be a \u201ccovered employee,\u201d an individual must be \u201cin the service of an employer under an express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire.\u201d On the other hand, \u00a7 9-203 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual is a covered employee while working for the employer of the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201c(1) in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201c(2) outside of this State on a casual, incidental, or occasional basis if the employer regularly employs the individual within this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201c(3) wholly outside the United States under a contract of employment made in this State for the work to be done wholly outside of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">\u201c(b) <em>Incidental service in State. </em>\u2014 (1) An individual is not a covered employee while working in this State for an employer only intermittently or temporarily if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">\u201c(i) the individual and employer make a contract of hire in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">\u201c(ii) neither the individual nor the employer is a resident of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">\u201c(iii) the employer has provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under a workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of another state to cover the individual while working in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">\u201c(iv) the other state recognizes the extraterritorial provisions of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">\u201c(v) the other state similarly exempts covered employees and their employers from its law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-15\">\u201c(2) If an individual is exempted from coverage under this subsection and injured in this State while working for the employer of the individual, the sole remedy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>individual is the workers\u2019 compensation or similar law of the state on which the exemption is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201c(3) A certificate from an authorized officer of the workers\u2019 compensation commission or similar unit of another state certifying that the employer is insured in that state and had provided extraterritorial insurance coverage for the employees of the employer while working within this State is prima facie evidence that the employer carries that compensation insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201c(c) Outside State. \u2014 Except as otherwise expressly provided, an individual who is employed wholly outside of this State is not a covered employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Thus, to be a \u201ccovered employee\u201d and therefore eligible to bring, and maintain, a worker\u2019s compensation claim in this State, a worker must be an employee, \u00a7 9-202(a), and, as the Court of Special Appeals recognized, \u201cthe site of one\u2019s employment is the critical element for\u201d making that determination. <em>Pohopek </em>at 240, 780 A.2d at 385. In this case, we are concerned only with \u00a7 9-203(a): the petitioner does not contend that the respondent was employed wholly outside of Maryland, rendering \u00a7 9-203(c) inapplicable, and although the petitioner maintains that the respondent was not regularly employed in Maryland, so that, in that sense, he was employed in Maryland only intermittently, it does not suggest that the prerequisites that make \u00a7 9-203(b) applicable are present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The gist of the petitioner\u2019s argument is that the respondent simply was not regularly employed in the State of Maryland. It asserts, noting that <em>Dixon v. Able Equip. Co., </em>107 Md.App. 541, 549, 668 A.2d 1009, 1012 (1995), indicated that \u201c \u2018regular\u2019 implies a uniform course of conduct\u201d and relying on what the Movement Listing for the respondent shows, that about 80 percent of the respondent\u2019s trips were to places other than Maryland, that the respondent\u2019s employment in Maryland lacked the required uniformity of conduct. The petitioner argues, alternatively, that, even if the respondent were regularly employed in this State, his employment outside the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>cannot be characterized, logically or appropriately, as \u201ccasual, incidental or occasional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Relying on the same case and the same definition, the Court of Special Appeals concluded otherwise with respect to the regularity of the respondent\u2019s employment in Maryland. Noting the <em>Dixon </em>court\u2019s acknowledgment that there is \u201cno particular formula for establishing \u2018regular\u2019 employment\u201d and evaluating the case on its facts, 140 Md.App. at 241, 780 A.2d at 386, the intermediate appellate court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cHere, the consistency of Pohopek\u2019s schedule and the employment responsibilities he carried out within the State persuade us to' find regularity in Pohopek\u2019s Maryland employment. Pohopek was not commuting to work in another state on a daily or regular basis, but, instead, he was based out of Maryland and traveled regularly, albeit extensively, as part of his routine employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>Id. </em>Turning to the respondent\u2019s employment outside the State, the court conceded that it was, like his employment in State, regular. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201c[0]ur finding that Pohopek regularly works outside the State is inherently a finding that Pohopek does not work wholly outside the State, and, therefore, under <em>Dixon </em>and Garrett,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pohopek\u2019s work outside the State must be inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>preted as casual. <em>Dixon </em>and <em>Garrett </em>essentially instruct us that the finding of regular employment outside of the State is inconsequential, until there is a finding of casual employment within the State, which triggers Section 9-203(b). Until there is a finding of casual employment within the State, the only determinative status of work outside of the State is either \u2018whole\u2019 or \u2018casual.\u2019 Under our interpretation, Pohopek is covered under subsection (a)(2), because his work outside of the State is said to be casual (because it is not whole), while his work within the State is said to be regular, because of the uniformity of his schedule and employment responsibilities in Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 242-43, 780 A.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">This Court has not addressed the precise question this case presents. We have, however, interpreted a predecessor of \u00a7 9-203(a), Maryland Code (1939, 1947 Cum.Supp.) Art. 101, \u00a7 67(3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>see Gatton v. Sline Co., </em>199 Md. 578, 87 A.2d 524 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>(1952), and considered the meaning of \u201ccasual employees\u201d in the context of statutory provisions excluding such employees from the coverage of the workers\u2019 compensation laws. <em>See, e.g. Wood v. Abell, </em>268 Md. 214, 221, 300 A.2d 665 (1973); <em>Lupton v. McDonald, </em>241 Md. 446, 217 A.2d 262 (1966); <em>Clayburn v. Soueid, Inc. </em>239 Md. 331, 211 A.2d 728 (1965); <em>East v. Skelly, </em>207 Md. 537, 114 A.2d 822 (1955); <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>171 Md. 39, 187 A. 887 (1936); <em>Marvil v. Elliott, </em>164 Md. 659, 165 A. 822 (1933); <em>Hygeia Ice &amp; Coal Co. v. Schaeffer, </em>152 Md. 231, 238, 136 A. 548 (1927); <em>State Accident Fund v. Jacobs, </em>134 Md. 133, 106 A. 255 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In <em>Gatton, </em>the employer was a Maryland company, with offices in Baltimore City, that worked jobs in other states, including, West Virginia. Gatton, who was accidentally killed while working for the company in West Virginia, was turned down when he applied for a job at the company\u2019s Baltimore office, there being no union openings. As directed, he went to the company\u2019s job site in West Virginia. After being instructed that he had to before he could do work on the West Virginia job, he joined the union in West Virginia, was hired and worked on the West Virginia job. Although his paychecks were drawn in Baltimore City and sent to him at the job site, he was paid according to the West Virginia union wage scale. The evidence was that Gatton was not provided transportation to West Virginia and that the decision to hire him was made by the job foreman in West Virginia. 199 Md. 578 at 580-81, 87 A.2d at 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Court summarily disposed of the question whether Gatton was a casual employee, concluding that his employment outside the State was not a casual, occasional or incidental employment by a Maryland employer of a workman regularly employed within this State, so that the sole question is whether he was an employee who was \u201cemployed wholly without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 87 A.2d at 525. It held that Gatton was hired to work entirely and wholly outside the State of Maryland and, thus, his wife could not claim benefits under the Maryland\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Id. </em>at 584-85, 87 A.2d at 526-27. The Court made clear, however, that the place of employment \u2014 where the employee was hired \u2014 is not dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cHowever, we do not think the question of where he was actually engaged to do work affects his widow\u2019s rights under our statute. The Legislature has seen fit to exempt from the operation of our act those who are \u2018employed wholly without the State.\u2019 That cannot mean those who enter into their contract of employment outside of the State, because otherwise the word \u2018wholly\u2019 would have no meaning whatever. It must mean those who are employed to do work entirely or wholly outside of the State, and this is emphasized by the exception which permits casual, occasional or incidental employment outside of the State. The deceased in this case did not have a casual, occasional or incidental employment outside of the State. His employment was to work entirely outside of the State, and that is all the work he ever did for this employer. The Legislature could have caused the statute to embrace all employments of residents of this State by employers located in this State, but it did not do so, and we cannot change the plain wording of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>Id., </em>199 Md. at 583-84, 87 A.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, in <em>L.R. Willson &amp; Sons v. Garrett, </em>76 Md.App. 120, 543 A.2d 875 (1988), relied on this passage to reject the argument that an employee who worked only out of State for a Maryland employer, but was promised an in-state job site at the earliest opportunity, was not entitled, as a matter of law, to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 543 A.2d at 878. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201cAs <em>Gatton </em>demonstrates, the Court of Appeals has given \u00a7 21(c)(4)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a broader interpretation than that urged by appellants. This is shown by the fact that it emphasized that the relevant inquiry is whether the employee is \u2018employed to do work entirely or wholly outside of the State\u2019 and by its reference to the exceptions for casual, occasional or incidental employment outside of the State. Thus, although we agree with appellants that, where an employee is \u2018actually engaged\u2019 is not dispositive, we disagree that the only relevant factor to be considered is where the employee actually worked. We think it necessarily follows from the Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute that the question whether an employee was employed to work wholly outside of the State of Maryland is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Although, as indicated, this Court has considered the term, \u201ccasual employee\u201d in a number of cases, it has, as have courts generally, \u201crefrained from giving a definition ... which must govern in all cases.\u201d <em>Hygeia Ice &amp; Coal Co., </em>152 Md. at 238, 136 A. at 551. <em>See Wood v. Abell, </em>268 Md. at 221, 300 A.2d at 669. Instead, we have consistently held that the decision in any case was to be determined by <em>\u201cits peculiar facts and circumstances.\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hygeia </em>at 238, 136 A. at 551). What has resulted has been the development of \u201can elastic test for determining whether an employee is \u2018casual\u2019 or \u2018regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lar,\u2019 \u201d with the factors to be considered being the nature of the employer\u2019s work, the scope and purpose of the hiring and the duration of the employment, <em>Wood </em>at 223, 300 A.2d at 670, \u201cwhether it is occasional, incidental, accidental, or a usual concomitant of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Moore </em>at 53, 187 A. at 894. <em>See Clayburn </em>at 337, 211 A.2d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">This Court has held, where the essential terms and manner of employment is undisputed, <em>see Clayburn </em>at 337, 211 A.2d at 731, that the worker has been hired to perform a single service on a single or particular occasion, that the employment was casual. <em>Lupton </em>at 450-51, 217 A.2d at 264. <em>See Wood </em>at 223, 300 A.2d at 670; <em>East </em>at 540, 114 A.2d at 823; <em>Moore </em>171 Md. at 53, 187 A. at 893-94; <em>Marvil v. Elliott, </em>164 Md. 659, 165 A. 822 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In <em>Wood v. Abell, </em>the worker was hired to help prepare the local fairgrounds for an upcoming event. Aside from the fact that he was to do various odd jobs as required by the county fair association and would be paid by the hour, there was \u201c[n]o definite understanding ... concerning the duration of their employment, but it was generally expected that [his] services would be needed for approximately one or two weeks. Clearly, no decision was reached that [he] would be employed in the future or that the job[ ] would be continuous.\u201d 268 Md. at 217, 300 A.2d at 667. We noted also, quoting the testimony of the general manager of the county fair association, that the worker was hired to do odd jobs, on an indefinite basis, \u201clike on call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 300 A.2d at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\"><em>Lupton v. McDonald </em>involved an injury to a worker who had been hired to \u201chelp finish the job\u201d that the employer\u2019s previous employee had abandoned. 241 Md. at 449, 217 A.2d at 264. The evidence was undisputed that the duration of the job was short, no more than one day, and that there was no prior relationship between the employer and the worker. Concluding that the worker was a casual employee, the Court noted that \u201c[t]he nature of the work was temporary, the duration of the employment was only for a day, and it was occasional and incidental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 217 A.2d at 264. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Court rejected the argument that the scope and purpose of the hiring must be considered, along with duration and regularity of service, in determining whether the employment was casual, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cBut the scope and purpose of Lupton\u2019s hiring by Milburn was only to complete the work which Lupton\u2019s predecessor had left unfinished; the hiring was confined to completing a specific job on a particular piece of land which might \u2018possibly\u2019 take a day. Lupton also refers to the definition of casual employment given in 1 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 51.00 (1965), that \u2018Employment is casual when it is irregular, unpredictable, sporadic and brief in nature.\u2019 Here, the employment was not only irregular but for a single occasion; Milburn had never employed Lupton before and had no plans to engage him for the future. It was unpredictable and sporadic, in that Lupton was only hired because Marx, who had originally been engaged by Milburn to do the work, had left the job. The hiring was clearly brief in nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 217 A.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\"><em>East v. Skelly </em>and <em>Moore v. Clarke </em>both involved jockeys and, in both, the Court concluded, as a matter of law, that the jockeys were casual employees. In <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>the jockey, who was regularly employed by a trainer to ride that trainer\u2019s horses, was hired solely to ride a horse in a race, by the horse\u2019s owner, with whom he had no on-going relationship. Explaining our decision, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201cIn this case the employment extended over a period of but a few minutes at most, and while it was a part of a business in which the employer was regularly engaged, it was single isolated, complete in itself, was connected with no past or future employment, and when it was finished all contractual relations between the employer and the employee ceased. It was incidental and fortuitous in the sense that, while the employer must have employed some one to ride her horse, she was under no obligation to employ Hanford, and that while his business was riding horses in races, he was, until she employed him for that service, under no obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ride her horse in that race, or indeed to ride in it at all. The distinction between a casual employment and a regular employment is illustrated by his relation to Burch, by whom he was employed at a fixed monthly compensation to ride Burch\u2019s horses, when requested by Burch, in any race in which they were entered, and his relation to Mrs. Clarke, by whom he was employed for a single race.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">171 Md. at 54, 187 A. at 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The jockey in <em>East v. Skelly </em>was a free lance jockey, who had ridden horses for the same owner some ten or twelve times during a six or seven month period, or about two percent of the races he had ridden during that time frame. 207 Md. at 539, 114 A.2d at 823. We noted \u201ca complete analogy\u201d between that case and <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>which we explained, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\u201cThe jockey in the earlier case was a contract rider for a well known trainer of a public stable. As is usually the case, he was free to ride in any race in which his employer did not have a horse entered. In the race in which he was killed, he was doing that, and riding for a trainer for whom he had ridden a number of times during the meet and for whom, but for the accident, he would have presumably ridden in the future. The methods of employment, the methods of payment and all significant facts are the same in the two cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 541, 114 A.2d at 823-24. Accordingly, we reached the same result, holding that the jockey was a \u201ccasual employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ4\">In <em>Marvil v. Elliott, </em>a carpenter, hired to remove shingles from the eaves of a building, was injured when he fell from a ladder. Addressing the question presented, whether the injured worker was entitled to an award of workers\u2019 compensation as an employee, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">\u201cIn the present case, the appellee was allowed by a property owner for whom he was working to be engaged temporarily by a contractor in charge of other work on the same premises. Upon the completion of the task to which the appellee was thus assigned, and which would probably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>required not more than two or three hours for its performance, he was to resume his work for the first employer. The brief service he was undertaking to render for the contractor had no relation to any engagement between them in the past or future. It was limited to a particular occasion beginning and ending within a short portion of a single day. In view of its restricted scope and purpose, it must be regarded as casual within the meaning of the Maryland statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">164 Md. at 665, 165 A. at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">These cases are to be contrasted with those in which the Court concluded that the employment was \u201cregular,\u201d not \u201ccasual.\u201d <em>Clayburn v. Soueid, Inc., </em>239 Md. at 337, 211 A.2d at 731; <em>State Accident Fund v. Jacobs, </em>134 Md. 133, 106 A. 255 (1919). In <em>Clayburn v. Soueid, Inc. </em>we explained why the worker in that case was not a \u201ccasual employee\u201d and, thus, a \u201cregular\u201d one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cThe work which Clayburn performed for Soueid was essential to Soueid\u2019s business of building houses. Soueid sub-let the work of building the houses, but engaged laborers, of whom Clayburn was one, in the cleaning of the houses after they were built, laying drain, leveling the ground, moving material from one location to another, and general laborer\u2019s work. This, work was necessary in connection with each of the houses Soueid was building. Clayburn was taken by Soueid from one location to another and always worked under Soueid\u2019s personal direction. The work was not seasonal, except in the sense that, being largely performed out of doors, the weather had to be favorable. The work did not have to be performed continuously, but it was necessary at certain stages of each building operation, and Soueid built houses steadily. Clayburn testified, without contradiction, that after Soueid first engaged him from the labor pool, Soueid told him he would give him a steady job, and Clayburn said that this was what he was looking for. After a few days, Soueid raised Clayburn\u2019s pay, and called for him, not at the place where the other men, in a labor pool, awaited day\u2019s employment, but at another location previous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ly agreed upon between the two men. During the entire period, Clayburn worked for no one except Soueid, except for a day or two between April 3 and 8, when Soueid had said he would be out of town. The evidence is clear that Clayburn\u2019s employment by Soueid was steady and pursuant to a continuing and individually arranged agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><em>Id, </em>at 340, 211 A.2d at 732-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The Court relied on Jacobs, in which the worker, a farmer and a teamster, was hired early in the canning season \u201cto work for [the employer] at such times as I might need him, and he promised to help me out at all such times as I might call upon him.\u201d 134 Md. at 134, 106 A. at 255. Receiving during the season, \u201cthe same wages paid all the time,\u201d the worker had been called on repeatedly for hauling, which he did. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the worker was not a \u201ccasual employee.\u201d Noting that the determination of the nature of an employment relation must be made \u201cwith principal reference to the scope and purpose of the hiring rather than with sole regard to the duration and regularity of the service,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 135, 106 A. at 255, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">\u201cOne who enters into a contract of employment for an entire season is not a casual employee merely because he may be required to work for only a short and irregular periods. When there is a continuing engagement to serve the employer in his business at such times as the particular and essential service may be needed, the employment is not \u2018casual\u2019 according to any of the judicial definitions of that term. In this case the service required and rendered was occasional, but it was in pursuance of an engagement covering the whole of the working season at the employer\u2019s plant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 135, 106 A. at 255-56. We held that the worker was injured, and his death therefore resulted from, engaging in work that was a necessary part of the employer\u2019s business, work that was done \u201cunder an employment which was not limited to the hauling then in progress, but applied to every recurring occasion for such assistance during the whole of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>of the annual productive periods of the employer\u2019s enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 106 A. at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We may glean from the foregoing that where the facts and the circumstances of a given case reveal that the undertaking by the worker, on behalf of the employer, is not pursuant to an agreement providing for a continuous employment relationship, is of short duration and/or is temporary or sporadic, the employment, and therefore the employee, is \u201ccasual.\u201d On the other hand, where the facts and circumstances reveal an agreement or arrangement, continuous in nature, calling for the worker to work for the employer, as and when the particular and essential requirements of the business demand, the employment, and therefore the employee, is not \u201ccasual.\u201d And this is true whatever the duration or nature of any one or more of the component undertakings.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">It is undisputed that there is an employment relationship between the petitioner and the respondent; the respondent regularly makes deliveries all along the east coast, driving the petitioner\u2019s tractor-trailer. Apropos the issue with which we are presented, whether the regular employment is in Maryland, the arrangement contemplates a regular presence in Maryland. The respondent begins, and ends, his work week in Maryland and the petitioner\u2019s tractor-trailer is kept in Maryland. In regard to the latter responsibility, the respondent is charged with its safekeeping and the safekeeping of any cargo that it might contain. Moreover, the respondent is responsible for the maintenance of the tractor-trailer. We believe these facts and circumstances suffice to establish that the respondent\u2019s employment in Maryland, rather than being \u201ccasual,\u201d was \u201cregular.\u201d This is consistent with the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, which, as we have seen, relying on the definition of \u201cregular\u201d enunciated in <em>Dixon, </em>i.e. \u201ca uniform course of conduct,\u201d was persuaded by the consistency of the respondent\u2019s schedule and job responsibilities. <em>Pohopek </em>at 240-41, 780 A.2d at 386, (quoting <em>Dixon v. Able Equip. Co. </em>107 Md.App. at 549, 668 A.2d at 1012).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals determined, however, that the respondent was also regularly employed outside the State of Maryland, but that finding, in and of itself, was necessarily one that the respondent\u2019s employment outside the State was only \u201ccasual\u201d \u2014 reasoning that only employment wholly outside the State would preclude a compensation award to an employee regularly employed in State. <em>Pohopek, </em>140 Md.App. at 241, 780 A.2d at 386. To be sure, the respondent spends a considerable amount of his time working for the petitioner outside the State of Maryland, about 80 percent, judging from the petitioner\u2019s Movement Listing for the respondent. That\u2014 considering all of the employment activity outside the State as a whole \u2014 does seem to qualify as regular employment. Tractor-trailer drivers, however, \u201cconstitute a unique class of employees whose activity, by its very nature, is transient. The fact that a truck driver may spend a significant amount of time in one State does not detract from the essentially transitory nature of the activity in which he engages.\u201d <em>Cowger v. The Industrial Commission, </em>313 Ill.App.3d 364, 374, 245 Ill.Dec. 707, 728 N.E.2d 789, 796 (2000), quoting <em>Patton v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>147 Ill.App.3d 738, 745, 101 Ill.Dec. 215, 498 N.E.2d 539, 544 (1986). <em>See also </em>9 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 143.04[2][c] (2003), in which it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\u201cIn some kinds of employment, like trucking, flying, selling, or construction work, the employee may be constantly coming and going without spending any longer sustained periods in the local state than anywhere else; but a status rooted in the local state by the original creation of the employment relation there, is not lost merely on the strength of the relative amount of time spent in the local state as against foreign states. An employee loses this status only when his or her regular employment becomes centralized and fixed so clearly in another state that any return to the original state would itself be only casual, incidental and temporary by comparison. This transference will never happen as long as the employee\u2019s presence in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>state, even including the original state, is by the nature of the employment brief and transitory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Thus, while, when viewed together, the amount of employment activity outside the State dwarfs the amount in State, when each location to which the respondent travels making deliveries and pick-ups is considered separately, the respondent\u2019s presence in none of them is substantially greater than in Maryland. Indeed, the respondent\u2019s presence in Alabama, the place to which the agreement refers and which the petitioner suggests is the proper situs for the compensation action, is considerably less.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Professor Larson, <em>Cowger </em>and <em>Patton </em>all addressed the situation in which the place where the employment was contracted is determinative of the situs of the employment relation for purposes of jurisdiction to award workers\u2019 compensation. In this case, the place at which the employment relation was formalized was North Carolina, rather than Alabama. Under their rationale, the situs of the employment relation would be North Carolina and, therefore, the jurisdiction to, resolve workers\u2019 compensation issues arising out of that relationship. That situs would remain unless and until the employee\u2019s regular employment becomes fixed clearly in another State; it is not sufficient that the relative amount of time spent in the local State is less, even considerably so, than that spent in the foreign states.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In Maryland, the place where the employment was contracted is not the dispositive factor. <em>Gatton, </em>199 Md. at 583-84, 87 A.2d at 526. That factor is whether the employment in Maryland is regular when compared to the employment outside Maryland. That comparison, when the employment itself' is transitory, is between the State where the employment has been found to be regular and each of the other locations to which the employment has a relationship. Thus, it is not the whole of the employment outside the State that is considered, it is only that in some other State that surpasses the \u201ccasual.\u201d As Professor Larson points out, \u201ca status rooted in the local state ... is not lost merely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>strength of the relative amount of time spent in the local state as against foreign states. An employee loses this status only when his or her regular employment becomes centralized and fixed so clearly in another state that any return to the original state would itself be only casual, incidental and temporary by comparison.\u201d 9 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 143.04[2][e] (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We hold that the respondent was regularly employed in Maryland and that his employment activity in none of the other states in which he makes deliveries and pick-ups is, by comparison, other than \u201ccasual, occasional or incidental.\u201d Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-11\">.
