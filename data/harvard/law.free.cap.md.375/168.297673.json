On the same day as the verdict was rendered, Chaney was sentenced by the trial judge to life imprisonment. On direct appeal, his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Chaney v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 563, 402 A.2d 86, <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 745 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The present case arises from the Circuit Court\u2019s 12 September 2000 denial of Chaney\u2019s pro se \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief (To Grant Post-Conviction Relief, Habeas Corpus Relief, To Correct Illegal Sentence, or to Reconsider Sentence).\u201d Chaney averred that the sentence imposed was illegal or irregular because the sentencing judge did not consider, as an option at sentencing, the suspension of all or some part of his life sentence. The motions judge in the Circuit Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in denying Chaney\u2019s motion without hearing, treated it as a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Chaney filed with the Court of Special Appeals an Application for Leave to Appeal the denial of his motion. Thereafter, he retained counsel who filed a Motion to Treat the Application for Leave to Appeal as a Notice of Appeal, on the basis that Chaney\u2019s motion in the trial court actually was a motion to correct illegal sentence. The Court of Special Appeals granted Chaney\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s motion, and transferred the case to its regular docket. On 6 August 2002, after briefing and oral argument, the Court of Special Appeals filed an unreported decision reversing the decision of the Circuit Court and remanding the case for a new sentencing hearing. The State then filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted. <em>State v. Chaney, </em>372 Md. 132, 812 A.2d 288 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">On 6 December 1971, ten-year-old Elizabeth Ann Metzler failed to return from school to her home in northern Anne Arundel County. The following day, her dead body was found in the woods several miles from her home. She had been molested sexually and strangled. Richard Miles Chaney was convicted of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Following return of the verdict, sentencing proceeded immediately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">Judge: Gentlemen, lets take this matter up for sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Mr. [State\u2019s Attorney], is there anything else you would like to present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">State\u2019s Attorney: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Judge: [Defense counsel], is there anything you would like to say? Sentencing, there is not a lot either can say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">Defense Counsel: I have discussed the possibility of filing a motion for a new trial with my client and he waives his right to file a motion for a new trial and we submit to sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">Judge: You have a perfect right to file a motion for a new trial in this court anytime up to thirty days from today. Sentence or unsentence has nothing to do with that here. That is an old hangover from Baltimore City days but we don\u2019t operate under that anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">All right. Richard Miles Chaney, stand up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">Mr. Chaney, is there anything you wish to say to the Court before sentence is determined in this case? If so, the Court affords you an opportunity to say it at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-14\">Defendant: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-15\">Judge: Well gentlemen, there is only one punishment in this State for the crime of which this man has been convicted. The law provides a single penalty and no other penalty and so the sentence in the discretion of the Court in this case is limited to the imposition of that penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Accordingly, Madame Clerk, the sentence of the Court in this case is that the Defendant be committed to the jurisdiction of the Division of Corrections for the remainder of his natural life. Mr. Chaney, the Court informs you that you have the following rights. You may appeal this entire proceeding to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. That right is exercised by filing a written order for appeal with the Clerk of this court. It must be filed not later than thirty days from today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Secondly, you may apply to a panel of Circuit Trial Judges to review the sentence imposed upon you by this member of the court. That right is exercised by filing a written application for review with the Clerk of this Court on forms which the Clerk will provide to you at your request. It must be filed not later than thirty days from today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">Finally, you have a right to move this member of the court to modify or reduce the sentence imposed upon you. That right is exercised by filing a written motion for reconsideration. It must be filed with the Clerk of this court not later than ninety days from today or not later than ninety days from the date of a mandate of any or of the last Appellate Court which would hear this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">Now, it is [your attorney\u2019s] responsibility as your counsel under our rules of court to initiate any or all three of these proceedings if you request him to do so. Once he has done that his obligation to you as your attorney under our rules of practice ends unless, of course, you make other arrangements with him for further representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The State presents one question for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that Chaney\u2019s sentence was illegal due to the alleged failure of the sentencing court to recognize its discretion to suspend part of Chaney\u2019s life sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Respondent, in his brief, dissects this somewhat generic question into three sub-parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">A. [The sentencing judge] erred in failing to recognize that he had the discretion to suspend a portion of the life sentence imposed in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">B. The failure to exercise discretion rendered Mr. Chaney\u2019s sentence illegal and/or Mr. Chaney\u2019s sentence was imposed in an irregular manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">C. If the Sentence imposed in this case is not illegal or imposed in an irregular manner, this court can still grant Mr. Chaney a new sentencing hearing pursuant to the Post Conviction Procedure Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The first two of Chaney\u2019s formulated queries were presented by him, as Appellant there, to the Court of Special Appeals. The third, (C), is new and not properly before us for two reasons. First, it was not raised in the trial court. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-181(a)(ordinarily the appellate court will not decide an issue not raised in or decided by the trial court); <em>Walker v. State, </em>338 Md. 253, 262-63, 658 A.2d 239, 243 (1995). Second, this issue was not raised by way of cross-petition in this Court, nor was it included in our order granting the writ. <em>See Gonzales v. State, </em>322 Md. 62, 69, 585 A.2d 222, 226 (1991)(issue not presented in petition for writ will not be addressed); <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 106, 532 A.2d 1066, 1077 (1987). Additionally, appellate counsel for Chaney, during oral argument before us, affirmatively withdrew any argument that this case involves an illegal sentence; thus we shall not address his question (C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Our reading of the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals reveals that the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court because it viewed the trial judge as having imposed the sentence in 1978 under the mistaken assumption that he did not have the power to suspend any portion of the life sentence. We therefore limit our review to the question of whether, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>this record, the trial judge failed to recognize that he had the discretion to suspend all or a portion of the life sentence imposed in this case, and if so, does that error require a new sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Respondent argues that the trial judge erred when he imposed a life sentence without expressly recognizing that the sentence, or a portion of it, could have been suspended. Chaney relies entirely on the transcript of the sentencing proceeding to prove his point. Specifically, he points to the following language employed by the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">Well, gentlemen, there is only one punishment in this State for the crime of which this man has been convicted. The law provides a single penalty and no other penalty and so the sentence in the discretion of the Court in this case is limited to the imposition of that penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In Respondent\u2019s view, this statement indicates that the trial judge was under the impression that he had no discretion to suspend all or any portion of the life sentence. To bolster this argument, Respondent alleges an absence of any mention by the trial judge that he was aware of the suspension option. Respondent\u2019s argument, in short, is that because the trial judge failed to mention the possibility of suspension of sentence, and stated instead that his discretion was limited to the imposition of the statutory penalty, the trial judge must not have realized that he had the power to suspend the life sentence or a portion of it. Chaney, therefore, argues that he is entitled to be sentenced anew so that effectively a different sentencing judge may consider the possibility of a suspended sentence on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Respondent\u2019s position, finding that the trial judge \u201cfailed to recognize that he had the discretion to suspend all or part of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>sentence.\u201d In reaching its conclusion, the intermediate appellate court relied on <em>Williamson v. State, </em>284 Md. 212, 395 A.2d 496 (1979) and <em>Sanders v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 247, 659 A.2d 356 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In <em>Williamson, </em>we were confronted with a situation where the sentencing judge refused to follow an opinion of this Court recognizing that a life sentence could be suspended. In that case, the following transpired in the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">[The Court]: As far as the murder conviction is concerned, there\u2019s no choice. She gets life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">[Defense Counsel]: No, Your Honor. There is a choice. You can suspend part of it. I brought the <em>Wooten </em>case with me.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">[The Court]: I understand that, and I completely disagree . with Judge Raine and the Court of Appeals. I think the Legislature said when a person kills somebody else or causes them to be killed, it\u2019s life. So as far as I am concerned, the sentence on the murder charge is life ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao3\">[Defense Counsel]: I was going to comment to the Court on the <em>Wooten </em>case, but I guess I won\u2019t do that either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">[The Court]: No. I have very strong feelings about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">284 Md. at 213-14, 395 A.2d at 496-97. We reversed, observing that \u201c[b]y precluding any consideration of suspending any part of the life sentence, the trial judge denied appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>right to a proper exercise of the discretion vested in him.\u201d 284 Md. at 215, 395 A.2d at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>Sanders, </em>the Court of Special Appeals was confronted with a situation where a judge on resentencing apparently felt that he was constrained in his analysis by what a prior sentencing judge had done. The intermediate appellate court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">It is apparent from the record that the resentencing judge felt bound by the nature of the sentence imposed by the original trial judge. Prior to hearing the evidence by Sanders and his counsel, the judge checked with defense counsel to be sure the earlier sentence had been imposed consecutively. Prior to announcing the sentence, the judge noted Sanders\u2019s accomplishments but then he said that he was \u201cstuck with a handicap\u201d and had to \u201cstand in the [prior judge\u2019s] shoes.\u201d He indicated that it was hard to \u201csecond guess what [the prior judge] would or would not do,\u201d and then he imposed virtually the same sentence as [the prior judge] had, simply reducing it to the maximum that was legally allowed. The law requires the judge to conduct his own inquiry and to reach his own sentences based upon the evidence before him. Because it appears that the judge erroneously felt constrained to follow his predecessor\u2019s decision and was therefore motivated by impermissible considerations, Sanders is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlD\">105 Md.App. at 256-57, 659 A.2d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The Court of Special Appeals found the case <em>sub judice </em>analogous to <em>Williamson </em>and <em>Sanders, </em>holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">[i]n this case the sentencing judge believed that the only option open to him was a sentence of life imprisonment, and he, therefore, did not consider the possibility that a portion of the sentence could be suspended. Since this was an impermissible consideration, we will remand the case to the circuit court for resentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">We find the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals unpersuasive, and the cases it relied on distinguishable. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>This case turns on how we today, some twenty-five years after the event, interpret the sentencing judge\u2019s remark that \u201c[t]he law provides a single penalty and no other penalty and so the sentence in the discretion of the Court in this case is limited to the imposition of that penalty.\u201d The statute in effect, at the date of the crime, and under which Chaney was sentenced, Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 413, provided in relevant part that \u201c[ejvery person convicted of murder in the first degree .... shall suffer death, or undergo a confinement in the penitentiary of the State for a the period of their natural life.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 413 did not address the potentiality for suspension of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The version of Art. 27, \u00a7 413 in effect at the time of Elizabeth Ann Metzler\u2019s murder on 6 December 1971 subsequently was found to be unconstitutional, as regards the death penalty, in <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A.2d 696 (1972), based on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). In <em>Bartholomey, </em>after invalidating the death penalty, this Court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">The invalidity of Bartholomey\u2019s death sentences does not, of course, affect the legality of either of his underlying murder convictions. The \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d required to be taken under <em>Furman </em>are limited to those involved in imposing valid sentences upon Bartholomey. The only law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ful sentence that can be imposed for murder in the first degree under the controlling statute (\u00a7 413) is life imprisonment; no discretion is lodged in the sentencing judge and the imposition of any other sentence would plainly be illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK8\">267 Md. at 185, 297 A.2d at 701 (citations omitted)(footnote omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sentencing judge\u2019s statement, therefore, far from being in error, was legally correct in its historical context, and, so understood, reflected an implicit knowledge of the extant, though recent, changes in the case law regarding sentencing in murder cases in Maryland at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">An important point here is that, temporally, one must pass a sentence before one can suspend it. As noted, the sentencing judge correctly stated the law. Under Art. 27, \u00a7 413, the only sentence available at the time under these circumstances was life imprisonment. The issue before us, therefore, is whether the sentencing judge\u2019s failure expressly and consecutively to acknowledge the existence of a second statute permitting a suspension of that sentence, Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 641A,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is sufficient to infer that he was unaware of its potential application to the sentence he imposed in the case <em>sub judice. </em>We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">A compelling reason for not interpreting the fact that the sentencing judge did not state expressly that he was aware of and considered that the life sentence, or a portion of it, could be suspended as implying that he was unaware of that option is presented by the State in its brief here, which observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxJ\">[T]he finding of the intermediate appellate court runs afoul of the well-established principle that \u201c[t]rial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it properly.\u201d <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 206, [699 A.2d 1170, 1194](1997); <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082[, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763] (1998)(holding that, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s representation of the purpose of victim impact evidence, the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ing court is presumed to have made proper use of such evidence.) Accord <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Jeter, </em>365 Md. 279, 288, [778 A.2d 390, 395] (2001)(while lower court \u201cdid not elaborate on the reason [for finding no violation of Rule 8.1], we presume that judges know the law and correctly apply it\u201d); <em>Davis v. State, </em>344 Md. 331, 339-46, [686 A.2d 1083, 1087-90] (1996)(as \u201ctrial judges are presumed to know, and properly to have applied, the law,\u201d trial court\u2019s determination of inconsistency in witness statements was implicit); <em>Whittlesey v.

One of these sources is the strong presumption that judges, like other public officers, perform their duties properly. <em>Bank of the United States v. Dandridge, </em>12 Wheat. 64, 25 U.S. 64, 69-70, 6 L.Ed. 552, 554 (1827); <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, 126, 213 A.2d 475, 479 (1965); <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>132 Md. 150, 156, 103 A. 443, 445 (1918). Another source is the presumption that all citizens are charged with an awareness of the law. As the Court of Special Appeals pointed out in <em>Samson v. State, </em>27 Md.App. 326, 334, 341 A.2d 817, 823 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">Judges, lawyers and laymen alike are all presumed to know the law regardless of conscious knowledge or lack thereof, and are presumed to intend the necessary and legitimate consequences of their actions in its light. <em>Grumbine v. State, </em>60 Md. 355, 356 (1883). Without that presumption one could escape the consequence of the law merely by denying prior knowledge of its existence and one\u2019s ignorance would become paramount to the law. <em>Cf. Hopkins v. State, </em>193 Md. 489, 498-499[, 69 A.2d 456] (1949), supra. [\u201cIgnorantia juris, quod quisque tenetur scire, neminem excusat.\u201d] \u201c[I]gnorance of the law, which every man is bound to know, excuses no man, is as well a maxim of our own law, as it was of the Romans.\u201d 4 Cooley, <em>Blackstone, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Sec. 27 at 1233. That maxim applies equally to state and federal law, to both of which we are subjected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN8\">The general presumption that trial judges know the law and apply it properly, however, is much more than a mere combination of the above maxims. Such a simplistic view would tend to minimize and trivialize the foundational role of trial judges in our legal system, our government, and in our society as a whole. The social and moral character of that role as one of the cornerstones of our system of law and governance was well observed over one hundred and fifty years ago, in the case of <em>Moody v. Davis, </em>10 Ga. 403, 411-13 (1851), in words which are as elemental today as they were when written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">The people are the depository of judicial power with us. Judges are their authenticated representatives, charged with the duty of dispensing justice, according to the constitution and laws of the State, and according to the constitution of the United States----It is the duty of the Judge to enforce the laws of the State, made in accordance with State and Federal <em>Constitution </em>\u2014 the <em>whole law, </em>as it applies, in his judgment, to the cases which come before him. He has no right and no power to withhold the application of one single principle of law, to a single case over which he has jurisdiction; he has no dispensation, justifying or excusing an omission to <em>apply the law. </em>Neither conscientious scruples about the morality of the law, nor convictions of its inexpediency \u2014 nor what are called the tendencies of the age \u2014 nor political biases or party associations \u2014 nor fear, nor favor, nor reward, nor the hope of reward, nor all of these combined, should be sufficiently potent to induce him, in his judgments, to <em>transcend </em>the law, or to <em>fall short </em>of its strict enforcement. If such are his duties, it is wholly immaterial whether a principle of law be brought to his notice by counsel, or is suggested by his own knowledge and observation. If the principle grow out of the case, and he believes it to be law, he is bound by the responsibilities of his position \u2014 by his official oath \u2014 by the very nature of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>office \u2014 by all the expediencies of judicature, to give it full effect. To <em>that </em>he is called \u2014 for <em>that </em>he is clothed with the people\u2019s (if I may so speak) judicial sovereignty; and if conscience or aught else suggests a higher law, and conscience cannot yield, let him retire and give place to those who are willing to execute the laws. It is the business of the Judge to <em>know </em>the law; that he does <em>know </em>the law, is the presumption of all the departments of the State. He is selected, (such at least is the theory,) on account of his knowledge of the laws, as well as on account of other qualifications. He is presumed to bring to the Bench fitness for its duties. This presumption of knowledge does not attribute to him perfection in the knowledge of a science, to the mastery of which the allotted term of human life, occupied with all possible diligence, is insufficient. It does not charge him with the indispensable necessity of ascertaining and ruling every point of law which may spring out of the case, from its beginning to its conclusion. Hence, a mere omission to suggest and apply a point not brought to his notice, is not error, unless, as I suppose, it were made to appear to a corrective tribunal that he was cognizant of it. He is not presumed, of course, to be infallible; and hence, he is not liable to an action for any judgment which he may, in good faith, render in a cause over which he has jurisdiction. He is presumed to be fallible; else why provide, not only that he shall correct his own errors by a power to grant new trials, but, also, that they shall be corrected by others, by organizing Courts of Review. The presumption demands diligence to know, and diligence to apply the law \u2014 patience and painstaking to master the facts of the case, and to ascertain upon what principles the right between the parties depends. With all the aid that counsel can give him, and without aid from counsel, he is bound to labor to ascertain truth \u2014 the truth of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Continuing recognition of the presumption has important implications for appellate review as well. \u201c[T]he most fundamental principle of appellate review [ ] is that the action of a trial court is presumed to have been correct and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>burden of rebutting that presumption is on the party claiming error first to allege some error and then to persuade us that that error occurred.\u201d <em>Fisher v. State, </em>128 Md.App. 79, 104-105, 736 A.2d 1125, 1138-39 (1999). See <em>Hebb, </em>31 Md.App. at 499-500, 356 A.2d at 587-88. Though prejudice occasionally may be presumed, error is never presumed by a reviewing court, and we shall not draw negative inferences from this silent record. As we pointed out in <em>Bradley v. Hazard Technology Co., </em>340 Md. 202, 206, 665 A.2d 1050, 1052 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-y\">It is well-settled that, on appeal, the burden of establishing error in the lower court rests squarely on the appellant. Wooddy <em>v. Mudd, </em>258 Md. 234, 237, 265 A.2d 458, 460 (1970)(quoting <em>Rippon v. Mercantile Safe Dep., </em>213 Md. 215, 222, 131 A.2d 695, 698 (1957)). This rule reflects a general presumption of regularity in the proceedings below. See <em>Hagerstown Trust Co., Ex. of Mealy, </em>119 Md. 224, 230, 86 A. 982, 984 (1913)(\u201cThe presumption is that the ruling of the lower Court was correct, until the contrary appears.\u201d). Unless an appellant can demonstrate that a prejudicial error occurred below, reversal is not warranted. See <em>Wooddy, </em>258 Md. at 237, 265 A.2d at 460.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Chaney fails to provide us with any evidence sufficient to rebut this presumption. There is nothing in the record to negate the presumption that the sentencing judge knew and properly applied the law. He did not misstate the law. In fact, as both we and the intermediate appellate court agree, he correctly stated that the only sentence available under Art 27, \u00a7 413 and <em>Bartholomey </em>was life imprisonment under these facts. The <em>Wooten </em>decision, clarifying that life sentences were subject to possible subsequent suspension, was decided <em>two years prior </em>to Chaney\u2019s conviction. Nothing has been presented that rebuts the presumption that the sentencing judge was aware of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">This is not a case like <em>Williamson, </em>where the trial judge expressly refused to follow established precedent allowing for the suspension of sentence. Nor is it a case where the trial judge \u201cfailed to conduct his own inquiry and to reach his own sentence based upon the evidence before him,\u201d as was the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in <em>Sanders. </em>The presumption is that he did so, and there is nothing in this record to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY; ALL COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">.

Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 641A read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">Upon entering a judgment of conviction, the court having jurisdiction may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. The court may impose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a lesser period be served in confinement, suspend the remainder of the sentence and grant probation for a period longer than the sentence but not in excess of 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Article 27, \u00a7 641A was repealed by Ch 356, Acts 2001, Effective October 1, 2001 and re-enacted with amendments as Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7\u00a7 6-221 and 6-222(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">.

It was replaced by Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 413, applicable to offenses committed on or after 1 July 1975, which in turn was found to be unconstitutional in <em>Blackwell v. State, </em>278 Md. 466, 365 A.2d 545 (1976). That statute, declared unconstitutional in <em>Blaclcwell, </em>was replaced by renumbered Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol., 1978 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 412, applicable to offenses committed on or after 1 July 1978 (over three months after Chaney\u2019s conviction), which thereafter remained substantively unchanged.
