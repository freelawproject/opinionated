The Maryland Tax Court answered, \u201cno.\u201d On judicial review initiated by the Comptroller of the Treasury, the appellant, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County agreed. We shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">The facts, which are straightforward, are not in dispute. Olaf A. Kolzig, the appellee, a professional hockey player, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>for the tax years 1995 and 1996 income tax returns, on which he acknowledged that he was a Maryland resident. He subsequently filed an amended income tax return for each of the tax years, on each then claiming non-resident status and, as a result, a refund. The amended returns were filed in April, 1998, prior to the running of limitations as to either of the returns. The appellant paid the appellee the refund. After conducting an audit of the amended income tax returns and the appellee\u2019s claim of non-resident status, however, the appellant assessed the appellee the amount of the refunds he had been paid. That occurred on December 4, 2000, more than three years after both of the original income tax returns had been filed. The appellee appealed the assessment to the Tax Court and moved to dismiss the assessment as untimely, arguing that it was barred by the statute of limitations. The Tax Court agreed with the appellee and, so, granted the appellee\u2019s motion. Dissatisfied with that result, the appellant sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which, as already indicated, affirmed the judgment of the Tax Court. Aggrieved, the appellant noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While the case was pending, but prior to any proceedings in that court, this Court, on its own motion, issued the writ of certiorari. <em>Comptroller v. Kolzig, </em>373 Md. 406, 818 A.2d 1105 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Section 13-1101 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c(a) 3-year limit. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this section, an assessment of financial institution franchise tax or income tax may not be made after 3 years from the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c(1) the date that the return is filed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">\u201c(2) the date that the return is due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c(b) No limit. \u2014 An assessment of financial institution franchise tax or income tax may be made at any time if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asb\">\u201c(1) a false return is filed with the intent to evade the tax;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alz\">\u201c(2) a willful attempt is made to evade the tax;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c(3) a return is not filed as required under Title 8 or 10 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201c(4) an incomplete return is filed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201c(5) a report of federal adjustment is not filed within the period required under \u00a7 13-409 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201c(c) 1-year limit. \u2014 If a report of federal adjustment is filed within the time required under \u00a7 13 \u2014 409 of this title, the tax collector shall assess the financial institution franchise tax or income tax within 1 year after the date on which the tax collector receives the report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Since none of the conditions addressed in subsections (b) and (c) are applicable to the facts <em>sub judice, </em>only subsection (a) is at issue in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to it, the question to be answered is the reach of the limitations period it prescribes, whether, as the appellant argues, it is applicable in the case of both original income tax returns and amended income tax returns, running from the filing of whichever one produces the assessment at issue, or, as the appellee argues, it applies only to an original income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Determining the meaning of \u00a7 13-1101(a) involves statutory construction, the rules for which are well-settled. <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 221, 817 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>229, 233 (2003); <em>Gallegos v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>372 Md. 748, 756, 816 A.2d 102, 107 (2003); <em>Dyer v. Otis Warren Real Estate Co., </em>371 Md. 576, 580-81, 810 A.2d 938, 941 (2002). We approach the interpretation of a statute with the goal of determining the intention of the Legislature in enacting it. <em>Dyer, </em>371 Md. at 580-81, 810 A.2d at 941. In that regard, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we ordinarily end our inquiry there also. <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. v. Dir. of Fin. for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 567, 578-79, 683 A.2d 512, 517 (1996). \u201cIf, and only if, it proves impossible to determine what the Legislature intended with respect to the question before us from the language alone, we turn to other indicia that have proved useful in discerning that intent.\u201d <em>Gallegos, </em>372 Md. at 756, 816 A.2d at 107. <em>See Caffrey v. Liquor Control, </em>370 Md. 272, 291-92, 805 A.2d 268, 279 (2002); <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 106, 803 A.2d 518, 521-22 (2002); <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525-26, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002). Thus, when the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to \u201creflect an intent not evidenced in that language,\u201d <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 755 (1993), or construe the statute with \u201c \u2018forced or subtle interpretation\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Relying on the canons of statutory construction, emphasizing in particular, quoting, respectively, <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 364, 772 A.2d 1240, 1246 (2001); <em>Brown v. State, </em>285 Md. 469, 474, 403 A.2d 788, 791 (1979); <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001); <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 467, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995), the admonition to courts to: give the words of a statute \u201ctheir natural and usual meaning in the context of the Legislature\u2019s purpose and objective in enacting the statute,\u201d avoid \u201cresorting to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of extending or limiting [the statute\u2019s] operation,\u201d read statutes from a \u201ccommonsensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>cal perspective to avoid a farfetched interpretation,\u201d so as to reconcile and harmonize all of its parts, as much as possible, and interpret the language in context, the appellant maintains that the interpretation given \u00a7 13-1101(a) by the Tax Court and the Circuit Court \u201cstands the statutory language on its head.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief, at 5). He reasons: \u201c[t]he natural and usual meaning of the word \u2018return\u2019 is tax return, and an amended return fits within this definition. It is one type of \u2018return\u2019, and use of the word \u2018return\u2019 by the statute does not inherently prefer one adjective \u2014 \u2018original\u2019\u2014over another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For support, the appellant directs our attention to \u00a7\u00a7 13-301<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 13-401,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> both permitting the Comptroller to audit tax returns, without differentiating between an original return and an amended one. The appellant also relies on <em>Comptroller v. Fairchild Indus., </em>303 Md. 280, 493 A.2d 341 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The appellee sees the matter totally differently. He maintains that the interpretation that the Maryland Tax Court and the Circuit Court gave \u00a7 13-1101(a) is the only reasonable interpretation. Aside from urging that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and, thus, by its very terms, excludes amended income tax returns, the appellee relies on legislation introduced by the appellant during the 2003 Legislative Session, now enacted, but not effective until July 1, 2003, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>which specifically provided that assessments of income tax \u201carising out of an amended return shall be made within three years after the date that the amended return is filed\u201d and the Senate amendment limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the assessments as a result of amended returns to \u201cchanges made by the amended items in the return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">As we have seen, pursuant to \u00a7 13-1101(a), \u201can assessment of ... income tax may not be made after three years from the later of: (1) the date that the return is filed; or (2) the date that the return is due.\u201d Thus, limitations prescribed by that statute runs from the later to occur of two dates, when the return is filed or when the return is due. So phrased, the statute is clear and not at all ambiguous and the Legislature\u2019s intention, with regard to the meaning of \u201creturn\u201d is patent. Only an original income tax return has a due date; an amended return, because it changes one also filed and in some particular, presumably discovered after the filing of the return being amended, does not, and, indeed, can not have a due date. Moreover, the words of the statute provide for but one filing date, one due date and one return, expressly referring only to \u201cthe return.\u201d Finally, by tying the running of limitations to the latest to occur of two dates relevant to the filing of an income tax return, without providing that one of those two dates relates to a different return, the General Assembly made clear that \u201cthe return\u201d referred to in paragraph (1) is the same \u201creturn\u201d referred to in paragraph (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\"><em>Fairchild Industries </em>is not to the contrary. That case did not involve an interpretation of \u00a7 13-1101(a). Rather, it was whether, under Maryland Code (1957, 1980 RepLVol.), Article 81, \u00a7 310(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a corporate taxpayer was entitled to interest on a state income tax refund paid in respect to a carryback of a net operating loss and, if so, the date from which the interest was computed. 303 Md. at 282, 493 A.2d at 342. Fairchild filed amended tax returns for the tax years 1975, 1976 and 1977, in which it claimed tax refunds for those years based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>losses incurred in 1978. Although it filed the amended return in September 1979, Fairchild sought interest computed from the date the original returns were filed. The comptroller paid the principal amount due, but refused to pay any interest. <em>Id. </em>at 282-83, 493 A.2d at 342. This Court determined that interest was payable. Section 310(c) provided that interest was payable \u201cfrom the date the return required under this' subtitle was due to be filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 493 A.2d at 344. The Comptroller argued that \u201creturn,\u201d as used in \u00a7 310(c) referred to the return generating the refund upon which the interest is claimed. Fairchild, on the other hand, relying on the plain meaning rule, argued that the interest must be computed from the date of the original returns and that, to hold otherwise, would be to rewrite the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 287-88, 493 A.2d at 344-45. Concluding from the differing positions of the parties that \u201ca doubt or ambiguity exists regarding the meaning and application of the phrase in question, in the context of its usage in \u00a7 310(c),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 287-88, 493 A.2d at 344-45, the Court opted for the construction urged by the Comptroller. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">\u201cAs we see it, to interpret the statute to afford the taxpayer a right to interest, commencing from the due date of the original return, rather than from the date the amended return was filed, is inconsistent with common sense and with the legislative purpose in authorizing interest .on tax refunds. The interest provisions contained in Article 81 of the Maryland Code are designed to commence the running of interest from the time that the operative fact arises which entitles a taxpayer or the State to the principal amount in question and for the period that such amounts were held by or subject to the use. of the other party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cThe event which gave rise to the overpayment of Fair-child\u2019s 1975, 1976 and 1977 taxes was its net operating loss in 1978 \u2014 a year subsequent to the year in which the excess taxes were actually paid. Had there been no net operating loss incurred in 1978, there would have been no net operating loss carryback to the three previous years. Before Fairchild incurred net operating losses in 1978, it had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>basis for claiming a refund for overpayment of taxes. From the extended due dates of the original returns until the amended returns were filed, the State was legally entitled to the use and possession of Fairchild\u2019s tax payments. The State had no obligation to pay Fairchild a tax refund, let alone interest on the refund, until the later ensuing net operating loss arose and the carryback was claimed. That the law permits a taxpayer to subsequently carryback a net operating loss and to obtain a refund in no way reflects a taxpayer\u2019s right to derive the benefits of the funds during the intervening period. Plainly, the nature and context of a net operating loss carryback supports the end result that where a refund for taxes arises from a net operating loss carryback, interest should be computed from the date the amended return claiming the net operating loss carryback is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 288-89, 493 A.2d at 345 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Clearly, the total illogic of requiring the payment of interest computed for a period prior to the refund being due was the basis of the <em>Fairchild </em>decision. It was the context of <em>Fair-child </em>that rendered the meaning of \u00a7 310(c) ambiguous. The circumstances of the case <em>sub judice </em>are by no means comparable. Certainly, the fact that \u00a7\u00a7 13-301 and 13-401 may be interpreted inconsistently with \u00a7 13-1101(a), without more, in particular, a context similar to that in <em>Fairchild, </em>does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We may confirm the meaning reached by reference to the words of the statute by considering the purpose, goal or context of the statute, or other extraneous considerations relevant to, and bearing on the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>See Total Audio-Visual Sys. v. Dept. of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 395, 758 A.2d 124, 128 (2000); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Vieira, </em>340 Md. 651, 658, 667 A.2d 898, 901 (1995); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. at 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731, 732. <em>See also Taylor v. Friedman, </em>344 Md. 572, 582, 689 A.2d 59, 63 (1997) (even when language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, courts may look to a legislative purpose to support or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>confirm plain meaning). Although certainly not required, confirmation of the interpretation we give \u00a7 18-1101(a) can be made by reference to the interpretation given a similar statute by the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Section 10-107 of the Tax-General Article requires, \u201c[t]o the extent practicable, the Comptroller [to] apply the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law to the administration of the income tax laws of this State.\u201d In <em>Lyon v. Campbell, </em>324 Md. 178, 185, 596 A.2d 1012, 1015 (1991), despite rejecting its application in that case, this Court explained that \u00a7 10-107 applies where the Maryland tax code is \u201c \u2018inextricably keyed\u2019 \u201d to the federal tax code by virtue of its adoption of the federal law, (quoting <em>Comptroller v. Chesapeake Corp., </em>54 Md.App. 208, 213-14, 458 A.2d 459, 463 (1983)), and, thus, is designed to avoid the \u201canomalous result\u201d of a taxpayer having different result regarding payment of his Maryland and federal tax, even though the Maryland tax provision incorporates the federal tax provision. <em>See Comptroller v. Diebold, Inc., </em>279 Md. 401, 409, 369 A.2d 77, 82 (1977) (holding that where the Maryland tax code incorporates a provision in the federal tax code, the interpretation of the Maryland and federal tax provisions should be consistent). More recently, in <em>Comptroller v. Gannett Co., </em>356 Md. 699, 720, 741 A.2d 1130, 1141 (1999), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">\u201cSection 10-107 is not a direct authorization for appellant to incorporate into the Maryland tax code whatever I.R.C. provisions it sees fit to apply; rather, section 10-107 expresses a policy of comity that, when exercising any legislatively-authorized powers that parallel an I.R.C. provision, appellant must comply with the judicial and administrative interpretations of that federal statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The section of the Federal Tax Code comparable to \u00a7 13-1101(a), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201c(a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed within 3 years after the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>or, if the tax is payable by stamp, at any time after such tax became due and before the expiration of 3 years after the date on which any part of such tax was paid, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun after the expiration of such period. For purposes of this chapter, the term \u2018return\u2019 means the return required to be filed by the taxpayer (and does not include a return of any person from whom the taxpayer has received an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agf\">Moreover, also relevant is \u00a7 6501(c), and, in particular, three of the exceptions it prescribes to the limitations period. Those exceptions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201c(1) False return. In the case of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201c(2) Willful attempt to evade tax. In case of a willful attempt in any manner to defeat or evade tax imposed by this title (other than tax imposed by subtitle A or B), the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time. \u201c(3) No return. In the case of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">As the appellee points out, these three exceptions in the federal law are substantially identical to \u00a7 13-1101(b)(l)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In <em>Badaracco v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>464 U.S. 386, 388, 104 S.Ct. 756, 759, 78 L.Ed.2d 549, 554 (1984), the Supreme Court of the United States observed, as to this section, that it \u201cestablishes a general 3-year period of limitations \u2018after the return was filed\u2019 for the assessment of income and certain other federal taxes,\u201d noting, however, that \u201cthe filing of an amended return in a non-fraudulent situation does not serve to extend the period within which the Commissioner may assess a deficiency.\u201d <em>Id . </em>at 398, 104 S.Ct. at 762, 78 L.Ed.2d at 558. For the latter proposition, it cited <em>Zellerbach </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Paper Co. v. Helvering, </em>293 U.S. 172, 181, 55 S.Ct. 127, 131, 79 L.Ed. 264, 269 (1934), in which it had earlier held that \u201ca second return, reporting an additional tax, is an amendment or supplement to a return already upon the files, and being effective by relation does not toll a limitation which has once begun to run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The Circuit Court concluded, as the appellee argues, that \u201cthe Maryland provision parallels the federal limitations provision\u201d and that \u201cit [is] practicable to apply the federal interpretation and create continuity between the two tax systems.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-14\">.

Senate Bill 102 was introduced, at the request of the Comptroller, as a Departmental Bill, by the Chairman of the Budget and Taxation Committee to address the issue that this case presents. Its purpose, as stated in the legislation, was, <em>inter alia, </em>to \"provid[e] that the Comptroller shall make certain assessments within a certain period following the date an amended income tax return is filed.\u201d As filed, the bill added a new section (d), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">\"An assessment of income tax arising out of an amended return shall be made within 3 years after the date that the amended return is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">It also provided for a prospective effective date of July 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">Senate Bill 102 was enacted, with amendments, <em>see </em>2003 Md.
