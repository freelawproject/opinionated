(hereinafter \u201cBank of America\u201d or the \u201cBank\u201d), altered the effect of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code, presently codified at Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 to 10-112 of the Commercial Law Article (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol.) (hereinafter \u201cUCC\u201d), so that the Bank was entitled to debit Lema\u2019s account for losses that the Bank incurred because of an altered check deposited into Lema\u2019s account by a third party without Lema\u2019s authorization or signature. Under the circumstances of this case, and for the reasons discussed herein, we conclude that because provisions of the UCC permit parties by a deposit agreement to alter the effect of the UCC, the Bank was permitted to debit Lema\u2019s account as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In 1999, Lema, an accountant, had two business checking accounts with Bank of America; one was held under the name of \u201cN.J. Lema Co.\u201d, Lema\u2019s accounting business, and the other was held under the name of \u201cAmas Trading Co.\u201d, another one of Lema\u2019s businesses. When Lema opened these accounts in 1999, he signed a signature card in which he agreed that the accounts \u201cshall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in ... the Deposit Agreement.\u201d He also acknowledged that he received the Deposit Agreement. The Deposit Agreement provided, among other things, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">Unless prohibited by applicable law or regulation, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item deposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to an allegedly forged, unauthorized or missing endorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error or other problem which in our judgment justifies reversal of credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The Deposit Agreement also stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">We may use funds in any account you maintain with Bank of America, N.A. to repay any debt which is due without notice to you (other than indebtedness incurred through the use of a credit card or if otherwise not permitted by law).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">On November 24, 1999, Willy Amuli, a former accounting client and friend of Lema, deposited a check purportedly for $ 63,000 payable to N.J. Lema Co. into the N.J. Lema Co. account at a Virginia branch of Bank of America. The check was drawn by an Italian bank, Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo, on its account at the Bank of New York. From December of 1999 to February 11, 2000, Lema withdrew the funds and gave them to Amuli in seven different transactions: four checks made payable to cash, the proceeds of which were given to Amuli, a wire transfer to Amuli in Nairobi, Kenya, a set of traveler\u2019s checks made payable to Amuli, and a transfer of $2,000 into Lema\u2019s \u201cAmas Trading Co.\u201d account, which, he stated, was to satisfy a debt that Amuli owed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>On January 12, 2000, Bank of New York forwarded to Bank of America a \u201cNotice of Forgery Claim\u201d informing Bank of America that the check Amuli deposited into Lema\u2019s account had been altered, since it was actually for $3,000, not $63,000. Bank of America returned $60,000.00 to Bank of New York by cashier\u2019s check dated February 16, 2000. Thereafter, in an \u201cAdvice of Debit\u201d form dated February 22, 2000, Bank of America informed Lema that it was charging his account $60,000 as a result of the forgery claim it had received from the Bank of New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On April 5, 2000, Lema filed a complaint for injunctive relief against Bank of America seeking the release of funds that the Bank had frozen in Lema\u2019s business checking accounts. On June 7, 2000, Bank of America filed an answer to Lema\u2019s complaint, included within which was a counter-claim seeking to recover for damages it incurred because of the altered check.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its counter-claim, Bank of America alleged, among other things, that Lema violated various provisions of the UCC and also \u201cbreached the contract governing his deposit accounts\u201d by \u201callowing raised and counterfeit checks to be passed through his accounts.\u201d On August 30, 2000, Lema filed an amended complaint for monetary damages in the amount of $60,000.00, $57,888.60 of which Bank of America had taken from his accounts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bank of America responded with an amended answer denying liability for Lema\u2019s money damages. A bench trial was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 23 and 24, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Lema testified that he had no knowledge of the altered check, that he did not authorize Amuli to deposit it into his account, and that he did not know it was made payable to N. J. Lema Co. According to Lema, he first noticed a substantial increase- in the balance of his N.J. Lema Co. account in late November of 1999. Lema then learned from Amuli that his friend had deposited a check into Lema\u2019s account. Amuli told Lema that the check was to be used to support the children of a former president of Zaire who were living in the United States and explained that he deposited the check into Lema\u2019s account because Amuli did not have a bank account of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">After his discussion with Amuli, Lema spoke with a customer service representative from the Bank of America who explained that the proceeds from the check would not be available until it cleared, which would take about 17 days. Lema also requested a copy of the check. After the check cleared, but before receiving a copy of it, Lema withdrew the proceeds from the check in several different transactions and gave them to Amuli, except for the $2,000 that Amuli owed Lema. On February 23 or 24, 2000, after withdrawing all of the proceeds of the check and giving them to Amuli, Lema received Bank of America\u2019s \u201cAdvice of Debit\u201d form informing him that the Bank was charging his account $60,000 because of Bank of New York\u2019s forgery claim. After that, Lema received a copy of the check and first realized that the check was made payable to N.J. Lema Co. Lema then sent an affidavit to Bank of America disclaiming any involvement in the alteration of the check. He also contacted the United States Secret Service and cooperated in its investigation regarding the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On April 26, 2001, the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of Lema for $62,325.50<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and dismissed Bank of America\u2019s counter-claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In rendering its judgment, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>judge stated that the case was \u201ccontrolled in the major part by the Uniform Commercial Code, which has now been adopted by the State of Maryland and is part of our Annotated Code dealing with negotiable instruments.\u201d Section 3-401 of the UCC, the Circuit Court opined, provides that a person is not liable on an instrument unless the person signed the instrument or authorized a representative to sign on the person\u2019s behalf. After finding that Lema had not signed the altered check, and that Amuli was not Lema\u2019s agent, the Court rejected Bank of America\u2019s argument that Lema was nonetheless liable on the check because he ratified it by his conduct and had breached certain warranties provided for in the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The Court also rejected Bank of America\u2019s claim that it had a separate contractual right to reimbursement from Lema pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. Specifically, the Court noted the Deposit Agreement, by its own terms, limited the Bank\u2019s rights against Lema if \u201ccontrary to law\u201d and then found that it would be \u201ccontrary to law to enforce the contractual agreement between the parties in this case\u201d because Section 3^101 of the UCC declares that a person cannot be liable on an instrument unless the person or the person\u2019s agent has signed the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Bank of America appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appellate court agreed with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that Lema had not ratified the altered check or breached any warranties under the UCC. The Court of Special Appeals ultimately held, however, that the Deposit Agreement between Lema and Bank of America permitted the Bank \u201cto debit Lema\u2019s accounts in the manner in which it did.\u201d In so holding, the court stated that under the circumstances of the case, Sections 1-102 and 4-103 of the UCC \u201cclearly provide that the Deposit Agreement governs the relationship between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We granted Lema\u2019s writ of certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Does Bank of America\u2019s Deposit Agreement with its customers operate as an agreement to eliminate the protections afforded bank customers under Title 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">For the reasons discussed herein, we conclude that under the circumstances of this' case, the Deposit Agreement between Lema and Bank of America altered the effect of Section 4-214 of the UCC. Consequently, the Deposit Agreement entitled Bank of America to debit Lema\u2019s accounts for $60,000, the difference between the true amount of the check deposited by Amuli and its altered amount, and it also entitled Bank of America to interest, certain expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, as provided for in the Deposit Agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Lema contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court because \u201cthe plain language of the [Deposit Agreement] imposes no liability on Lema for the altered check.\u201d In support of his contention, Lema asserts that the Deposit Agreement gives the Bank rights of charge-back and setoff only if those rights are not \u201cprohibited by applicable law.\u201d The applicable law, found in Titles 3 and 4 of the UCC, however, prohibits the actions of the Bank, according to Lema. Specifically, Lema claims that Title 3 of the UCC, \u201cprohibits the bank from reversing the credit because Lema did not indorse the instrument, did not alter it, did not transfer it, and did not ratify it.\u201d Title 4 of the UCC also precludes the Bank\u2019s actions, according to Lema, because it \u201cprohibits a bank from charging back a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>customer\u2019s account\u201d once a \u201csettlement\u201d becomes \u201cfinal.\u201d In addition, Lema claims that the provisions of the Deposit Agreement are ambiguous as to whether they were intended to alter the effects of the UCC, and that the Circuit Court was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in determining that the UCC was controlling. Further, even if the provisions of the Deposit Agreement entitled the Bank to debit Lema\u2019s accounts, he asserts that they are void because they impose no duty of good faith and ordinary care on the Bank, which the UCC requires. Finally, Lema claims that the Bank never raised the issue of whether the Deposit Agreement altered the effect of the UCC to the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals. Consequently, Lema contends that the Court of Special Appeals raised the issue <em>sua sponte </em>and abused its discretion by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Bank of America counters that the Deposit Agreement is enforceable under the UCC and that the Agreement clearly authorized the Bank to \u201ccharge-back and set off ... the raised amount of the altered check.\u201d The Bank also asserts that it \u201cacted in good faith and observed its duty of ordinary care,\u201d and that, contrary to Lema\u2019s contention, it did in fact raise its contractual claims in the Circuit Court and before the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">It is undisputed that the UCC applies to commercial transactions in Maryland, including the commercial dealings between a bank and its customer. In <em>Wright v. Commercial &amp; Sav. Bank, </em>297 Md. 148, 153, 464 A.2d 1080, 1083 (1983), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">Title 3 of the [UCC] governs transactions with negotiable instruments ...; however, that provision of the Code does not address the relationship between a bank and its depositor except as those parties might deal with a specific check. Title 4 of the [UCC,] [however,] covers \u201cBank Deposits and Collections____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Because this case involves a specific negotiable instrument, the altered check, as well as bank deposits and collections, both Title 3 and Title 4 apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Section 3-401 (a) of the UCC requires that a person or the person\u2019s agent must sign an instrument in order to have liability on the instrument. That Section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">A person is not liable on an instrument unless (i) the person signed the instrument, or (ii) the person is represented by an agent or representative who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on the represented person under \u00a7 3 \u2014 402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Section 4-214(a) gives a bank the right under certain conditions to revoke a \u201csettlement\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> given to a customer with respect to an \u201citem,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to charge-back to a customer\u2019s account the amount of any credit given for an item, and the right to obtain a refund from its customer. These rights terminate under the UCC, however, once settlement for an item received by the bank becomes final. Section 4-214(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">If a collecting bank has made provisional Settlement with its customer for an item and fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank, or otherwise to receive settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge-back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer\u2019s account, or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not it is able to return the item, if by its midnight deadline or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts. If the return or notice is delayed beyond the bank\u2019s midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge-back the credit, or obtain a refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay. These rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>revoke, charge-back, and obtain a refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Thus, the provisions of the UCC state that a person is not liable on an instrument unless the person or the person\u2019s agent signs the instrument and that a bank\u2019s right to revoke settlement, charge-back to a customer\u2019s account, and obtain a refund from a customer, terminates when the settlement for an item received by a bank becomes final.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">These provisions, however, are not necessarily binding. As observed by Professors White and Summers, \u201cThe parties may vary their effect or displace them altogether: freedom of contract is the rule rather than the exception. Most commercial law is therefore not in the Code at all but in private agreements.... \u201d James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3 (5th ed.2000) (footnote omitted). Indeed, the UCC expressly provides that the effect of its provisions may be altered by agreement. Section 1-102(3) declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">The effect of provisions of Titles 1 through 10 of this article may be varied by agreement, except as otherwise provided in Titles 1 through 10 of this article and except that the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by Titles 1 through 10 of this article may not be disclaimed by agreement but the parties may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of such obligations is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Similarly, according to Section 4-103(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">The effect of the provisions of this title may be varied by agreement, but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim a bank\u2019s responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure. However, the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which the bank\u2019s responsibility is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We have recognized the ability of parties by contract to alter the effect of provisions of the UCC in <em>Etelson v. Suburban Trust Co., </em>263 Md. 376, 379, 283 A.2d 408, 410 (1971). In that case, Mr. Etelson, as president of a corporation that received a loan from Suburban Trust Company, executed a promissory note payable to the order of Suburban. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 283 A.2d at 409. As security for the loan, Suburban required an interest in a truck owned by the corporation and that Mr. Etelson and his wife guarantee payment of the note. The Etelsons indorsed the back of the note, which stated in part that they consented to \u201cthe release or exchange of any collateral without notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 283 A.2d at 410. After the corporation filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on the note, Suburban attempted to assert its priority security interest in the truck but was unsuccessful because it had failed to file a financing statement on time. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 283 A.2d at 409. Unable to recover the truck, Suburban brought an action against the Etelsons as endorsers on the promissory note. The Etelsons, relying on the UCC<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, asserted that Suburban could not recover from them because the bank had negligently impaired its security by failing to timely file the financing statement. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78, 283 A.2d at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We agreed with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that the bank \u201cowed no duty to the Etelsons to record the financing statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380, 283 A.2d at 411. \u201cThe UCC,\u201d we explained, \u201crecognizes that there may be times where parties to an instrument may choose to alter the general provisions of the UCC to meet their particular purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 283 A.2d at 410 (citing Section 1-102(3)). Thus, we concluded that \u201cby agreeing to the broad language of the endorsement\u201d, the Etelsons \u201climited the protection to which they might have otherwise been entitled under the UCC.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Taylor v. Equitable Trust Co., </em>269 Md. 149, 157, 304 A.2d 838, 843 (1973)(recognizing that under Section 4-103(1), \u201cUCC provisions may be varied by agreement so long as \u2018a bank\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care\u2019 is not disclaimed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Other jurisdictions also have recognized that parties may vary by agreement the effect of the terms of the UCC. <em>See, e.g., Western Air &amp; Refrigeration, Inc. v. Metro Bank of Dallas, </em>599 F.2d 83, 89-90 (5th Cir.1979) (concluding that an agreement to vary the \u201cmidnight deadline\u201d requirements of Section 4-302 is valid and enforceable); <em>Zambia Nat'l Commercial Bank Ltd. v. Fidelity Int\u2019l Bank, </em>855 F.Supp. 1377, 1392 (S.D.N.Y.1994)(stating that, \u201cthe bank and depositor may agree to include conditions precedent or vary the statute of limitations under the U.C.C. consistent with the principle that such agreements may not be manifestly unreasonable\u201d); <em>Scott Stainless Steel, Inc. v. NBD Chicago Bank, </em>253 Ill.App.3d 256, 192 Ill.Dec. 333, 625 N.E.2d 293, 297 (1993) (stating that Section 4-103(1) \u201cauthorizes a bank to enter into an agreement with its customers that modifies the provisions of Article 4 of the Code\u201d and upholding indemnification agreement between bank and customer that did not exculpate bank from duties of good faith and ordinary care); <em>First United Bank v. Philmont Corp., </em>533 So.2d 449, 454 (Miss.1988)(stating \u201c[t]hat a transaction falls within Article <em>4 .... </em>does not necessarily lead to a mechanical application of Code law\u201d for \u201c[t]he UCC empowers parties to commercial transactions to vary by agreement the Code provisions in many significant ways\u201d and determining that the authority controlling the rights and liabilities of the parties included a \u201cMerchant Agreement\u201d and clearinghouse rules); <em>Triffin v. First Union Bank, </em>319 N.J.Super. 72, 724 A.2d 872, 874-75 (1999) (recognizing that under Section 1-102(3) of New York\u2019s UCC, the effect of the provisions of the UCC, \u201cmay be varied by agreement,\u201d and upholding agreement that shifted risk of loss from bank to customer, unless loss resulted from bank\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct); <em>National Title Ins. Corp. Agency v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>263 Va. 355, 559 S.E.2d 668, 671 (2002)(concluding that bank may, through a contractual agreement with its customer, shorten a one-year statute of limitations period provided for in the Virginia UCC to 60 days).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The official comments to Sections 1-102 and 4-301 reinforce the concept that the UCC\u2019s effect may be altered by agreement, and as we recently recognized in <em>Messing v. Bank of America, </em>373 Md. 672, 684-85, 821 A.2d 22, 29 (2003) (quoting <em>Jefferson v. Jones, </em>286 Md. 544, 547-48, 408 A.2d 1036, 1039 (1979)), the official comments are \u201ca useful aid for determining the purpose\u201d of UCC provisions. Official comment 2 to Section 1-102 states that, \u201cfreedom of contract is a principle of the Code,\u201d and \u201c \u2018the effect\u2019 of its provisions may be varied by \u2018agreement.\u2019 \u201d Similarly, Official Comment 1 to Section 4-103 states that the Section \u201cpermits within wide limits variation of the effect of provisions of [Title 4] by agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The official comments also discuss the types of agreements that may vary the effect of the UCC\u2019s terms. Official comment 2 to Section 4-103 provides that the term \u201cagreement,\u201d as used in that Section, has the same meaning as given to it by Section 1-102(3), and specifically states that an agreement may be with respect to \u201call items handled for a particular customer, e.g, a general agreement between the depositary bank and the customer at the time a deposit account is opened.\u201d That, of course, is the type of agreement in issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The relationship between a bank and its customer is contractual. <em>University Nat. Bank v. Wolfe, </em>279 Md. 512, 514, 369 A.2d 570, 571 (1977)(\u201cThe relationship, which has been universally recognized and consistently followed in this State to the present time, is that of debtor and creditor, with the rights between the parties considered as contractual, and derived by implication from the banking relationship unless modified by the parties\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Taylor, </em>269 Md. at 155, 304 A.2d at 842 (stating that \u201cthe rights of the depositor and the liability of the bank [are] contractual\u201d). In the present case, there is no dispute that Lema signed two signature cards for his accounts at Bank of America. Those cards stated, in part, that Lema \u201cacknowledges and agrees\u201d that his accounts \u201cshall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in the following documents, as amended from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>time to time: (1) the Deposit Agreement....\u201d Thus, the signature cards, along with the Deposit Agreement, constitute the contract between Lema and Bank of America. <em>See Kiley v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Maryland, </em>102 Md.App. 317, 326-27, 649 A.2d 1145, 1149 (1994)(recognizing that a signature card constitutes a contract between a bank and its customer and finding that the bank customer accepted bank rules and regulations when the signature card specifically referred to those rules and regulations), <em>cert denied, </em>338 Md. 116, 656 A.2d 772, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 866, 116 S.Ct. 181, 133 L.Ed.2d 120 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Lema contends that the Deposit Agreement did not entitle the Bank to debit Lema\u2019s account because the Agreement provides the Bank with that right only if not \u201cprohibited by applicable law.\u201d According to Lema, Title 3 is the applicable law, and Section 3-401(a) of that Title \u201cprovides that a person is not liable on an instrument unless the person or an authorized representative signed it.\u201d As we have seen, however, Title 3 is not the <em>only </em>applicable law; Title 4 deals with \u201cBank Deposits and Collections\u201d and also is applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Section 4-214 allows a collecting bank to charge back and obtain a refund from a customer\u2019s account if the bank does not receive final settlement for an item. Neither that section, nor any other section of Title 4 indicates that the bank\u2019s rights to charge back and reimbursement are dependent upon whether the customer indorsed a deposited item.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Indeed, former Section 4-205(1) expressly allowed a bank to accept an unindorsed item for collection and to \u201csupply any indorsement of the customer.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Code, \u00a7 4-205 of the Commercial Law Article (1975, 1992 Repl.Vol.). Revised Section 4-205 does not eliminate a bank\u2019s ability to supply an indorsement. The revised Section states in part: \u201cThe depositary bank becomes a holder of the item at the time it receives the item for collection if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder of the item, whether or not the customer indorses the item.... \u201d The purpose of the amendment, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>indicated in the official comment, was to clarify that a bank is a holder whether or not it supplies the missing indorsement of its customer. The comment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">It is common practice for depositary banks to receive unindorsed checks under so-called \u201clock box\u201d agreements from customers who receive a high volume of checks. No function would be served by requiring a depositary bank to run these items through a machine that would supply the customer\u2019s indorsement except to afford the drawer and the subsequent banks evidence that the proceeds of the item reached the customer\u2019s account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In addition, in other contexts, Title 4 allows for customer liability for the amount of an item, even though the customer has not signed the item. For example, Section 4-401(a) \u2014 (b) allows for customer liability for the amount of an overdraft even if the customer did not sign the item, as long as the customer benefitted from its proceeds. Section 4-401 (b) states: \u201cA customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefitted from the proceeds of the item.\u201d Thus, Lema\u2019s contention that the Bank was \u201cprohibited by applicable law\u201d from debiting his account because he did not sign the altered check is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Although Section 4-214 does not require that a customer sign an item in order for a bank to exercise its rights of charge back and reimbursement, those rights are not without limits. Section 4-214(a) does state that the \u201crights to revoke, charge-back, and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As previously discussed, however, the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>provisions of Title 4 are subject to alteration by agreement. Acknowledging this, Lema, nonetheless, contends that the provisions of the Deposit Agreement are ambiguous as to whether they were intended to modify the UCC, and that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that they did because the Circuit Court\u2019s determination on the issue was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Contract ambiguity, however, is not a factual issue and is not, therefore, subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. \u201c[T]he determination of ambiguity is one of law, not fact, and that determination is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by the appellate court.\u201d <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 434, 727 A.2d 358, 362 (1999). Viewing the provisions of the Deposit Agreement under that standard, we conclude that they are not ambiguous, as asserted by Lema. The Deposit Agreement clearly states that unless prohibited by applicable law, the Bank has the right \u201cto charge back to [Lema\u2019s] account the amount of any item deposited to [his] account or cashed for [him] which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to ... a claim of alteration ... which in our judgment justifies reversal of credit [emphasis added].\u201d The Agreement also declares that the Bank \u201cmay use funds in any account\u201d that Lema maintains with the Bank \u201cto repay any debt which is due without notice to [Lema] (other than indebtedness incurred through the use of a credit card or if otherwise not permitted by law).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Agreement also does not terminate the Bank\u2019s rights of charge back and reimbursement, as does the UCC, once settlement becomes final and so alters the effect of Section 4-214, as permitted in the UCC. It is for this reason that Lema\u2019s reliance on <em>Boggs v. Citizens Bank and Trust Co. of Maryland, </em>32 Md.App. 500, 363 A.2d 247 (1976), with respect to Section 4-214, is misplaced. There, the Court of Special Appeals held that because settlement of an item had become final, a bank was not permitted under Section 4-212, the predecessor of Section 4-214, to charge back a customer\u2019s account. <em>Id. </em>at 505, 363 A.2d at 250. <em>Boggs, </em>however, did not involve any agreements altering the effect of the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Moreover, the Deposit Agreement is in accord with the UCC\u2019s policy of shielding transferees of items from the risk of loss created by, for instance, an unauthorized alteration. Section 4-207(a)(3) of the UCC, for example, provides that, when a bank customer transfers an item and receives consideration, the customer warrants to the transferee that, among other things, \u201c[t]he item has not been altered.\u201d Although Lema did not himself transfer the altered check to the Bank, the Deposit Agreement follows the general policy of this Section by providing protection for a transferee, in this case the Bank, that receives an altered item.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The power to alter the effect of UCC provisions, however, is not unlimited, The text and comments of the UCC emphasize that agreements cannot disclaim a bank\u2019s obligations of good faith and ordinary care. <em>See also Taylor, </em>269 Md. at 157, 304 A.2d at 843 (recognizing that under Section 4-103, agreements may not disclaim \u201ca bank\u2019s responsibility for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care\u201d); <em>Bank of S. Maryland v. Robertsons\u2019 Crab House, Inc., </em>39 Md.App. 707, 714 n. 5, 389 A.2d 388, 393 n. 5 (1978)(noting that Sections 1-102 and 4-103 \u201cprevent a bank from contracting away its obligation to use ordinary care in the handling of depositors\u2019 funds\u201d). Also, as indicated in official comment 2 of Section 1-102, although \u201can agreement can change the legal consequences which would otherwise flow from the provisions of the Act,\u201d an agreement cannot alter \u201c[t]he meaning of the statute itself.\u201d Such meaning \u201cmust be found in [the UCC\u2019s] text, including its definitions, and in appropriate extrinsic aids.\u201d In explanation of this distinction, comment 2 to Section 1-102 provides the following examples. Agreements may not make an \u201cinstrument negotiable within the meaning of Title 3 except as provided in Section 3-401.\u201d Agreements also may not \u201cchange the meaning\u201d of various UCC terms, such as \u201cbona fide purchaser,\u201d \u201cholder in due course,\u201d or \u201cdue negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The Deposit Agreement in the present case does not vary the \u201cmeaning of the statute itself.\u201d Rather, it changes \u201cthe legal consequences which would otherwise flow from the provisions of the Act.\u201d Under Section 4-214(a) of the UCC, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201clegal consequence\u201d of final settlement is that a bank loses its right to charge-back and obtain a refund from a customer. The Deposit Agreement has no such restriction. Thus, the Agreement alters the legal effect of the UCC, not its \u201cmeaning\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Further, we disagree with Lema\u2019s contention that the provisions of the Deposit Agreement disclaim the Bank\u2019s obligations of good faith and ordinary care. In support of that contention, Lema relies on the decision in <em>Cumis Ins. Soc\u2019y v. Girard Bank, 522 </em>F.Supp. 414 (E.D.Pa.1981). There, an agreement between a bank and its customer authorized the bank to honor checks when \u201cbearing or purporting to bear the facsimile signature or any signature\u201d of two authorized representatives of the bank\u2019s customer \u201cwith the same effect as if the signature or signatures were manual signatures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. The agreement also stated that the customer \u201cagrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Bank ... from any damages the bank may suffer ... by reason of its acting upon\u201d the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 417. After the bank paid checks that bore unauthorized facsimile signatures and debited its customer\u2019s account, the customer\u2019s insurance company brought an action to recover the funds. <em>Id. </em>In a motion for summary judgment, the bank argued that the insurer was \u201cprecluded from denying the validity of the unauthorized signature\u201d because the agreement between the bank and the customer \u201cshift[ed] the risk of loss for unauthorized signatures to the customer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420. The United States District Court rejected the bank\u2019s argument because it found that the agreement was ambiguous and that if it were construed as the bank asserted, it would \u201chave the effect of exculpating the bank from any liability regardless of its own negligence in paying the instruments bearing forged drawer signatures.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Unlike the agreement in <em>Cumis, </em>the Deposit Agreement in the present case, as previously discussed, is not ambiguous. Additionally, the Deposit Agreement\u2019s plain language does not exculpate the Bank from its own lack of good faith or ordinary care, and the Bank has not advocated such an interpretation. The Bank\u2019s rights to \u201ccharge-back\u201d and \u201cuse the funds\u201d in any of Lema\u2019s accounts under the Agreement exist only if not \u201cprohibited by applicable law.\u201d The applicable law, Sections 1-102(3) and 4-103(a), prohibits parties from disclaiming the requirements of good faith and ordinary care. Thus, in contrast to the exculpatory clause in <em>Cumis, </em>the Deposit Agreement in the instant case recognizes the Bank\u2019s obligations of good faith and ordinary care by limiting its contractual rights so that they are in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Lema also claims that other provisions of the Agreement giving rights to the Bank, which neither state \u201cunless prohibited by applicable law\u201d nor contain a similar disclaimer, are void because they impose no duty of good faith and ordinary care on the Bank. Specifically, Lema takes issue with the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">If a deposited item is returned to us by the bank on which it is drawn, we may accept that return and charge the item back against your account without regard to whether the other bank returned the item before its midnight deadline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Lema also finds fault with the Deposit Agreement\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">Credit for items deposited is provisional and subject to revocation if the item is not paid for any reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Lema claims the following provision is also void:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">[I]f payment is not received for any deposited item, the amount of the item will be charged back to your account and may create an overdraft, for which we will charge you a fee. You agree to pay the amount of any overdraft together with any overdraft fees immediately upon demand.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avf\">As Lema himself points out, however, parties are presumed to know the law when entering into contracts, and thus, \u201call applicable or relevant laws must be read into the agreement of the parties just as if expressly provided by them, except where a contrary intention is evident.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>297 Md. at 153, 464 A.2d at 1083. Nothing in the language of the provisions of the Deposit Agreement referred to by Lema explicitly exculpates the Bank from its duties of good faith and ordinary care. Those requirements, therefore, must be \u201cread into the agreement.\u201d Moreover, even if the provisions referred to by Lema were to be considered void, the Bank\u2019s right to recover from Lema for losses it suffered because of the altered check would remain intact, for the Deposit Agreement contains a severability clause: \u201cA determination that any part of this agreement is invalid or unenforceable will not effect the remainder of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In addition, the Circuit Court made no finding that Bank of America acted in bad faith or without ordinary care. Although the Circuit Court concluded that the Bank\u2019s policy of accepting unindorsed checks for deposit was \u201ccontrary to the law of liability as to required signatures,\u201d it did not make any findings regarding bad faith or ordinary care. Moreover, the court was incorrect in concluding that the Bank\u2019s policy of accepting unindorsed checks is contrary to law. As discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>above, Title 4 of the UCC specifically allows a bank to supply an indorsement on an item deposited by its customer and imposes liability on a customer for the amount of an overdraft even if the customer did not sign the item, as long as he or she benefited from its proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Lema\u2019s argument that the Bank failed to raise its contractual claims in the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals, and that the Court of Special Appeals violated Maryland Rule 8-131<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by raising the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>In Count II of its four-count counterclaim, the Bank advocated a \u201cBreach of Contract\u201d theory of recovery, arguing that, \u201cin allowing raised and counterfeit checks to be passed through his accounts,\u201d Lema had \u201cbreached the contract governing his deposit accounts\u201d and that as a result, the Bank was \u201cinjured ... in the amount of at least $60,000, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees.\u201d In addition, during trial, counsel for the Bank presented the Deposit Agreement, including the provision addressing the Bank\u2019s right to setoff, which was entered into evidence by the Circuit Court, and had Lema read the provisions of the Agreement addressing the Bank\u2019s right to setoff. Indeed, during closing argument, counsel for Lema acknowledged the Bank\u2019s contractual theory of recovery by stating, \u201cDepositary Agreement is another theory by which the Bank of America is attempting to proceed against Mr. Lema,\u201d and argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">So the Bank of America can\u2019t say on the one hand the commercial law article might apply, there might not be a signature, it might not have been ratified, but we are entitled to get the money back anyway because we had this deposit contract. Doesn\u2019t work that way. That contract can\u2019t overwrite the laws of Maryland. It can\u2019t seek to collect something when there is no legal right to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>In addition to arguments by counsel, the Circuit Court specifically ruled on the Bank\u2019s contractual theory. It declared in its oral ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">As a fallback final position, the bank falls back on the deposit agreement in its contractual relationship with Mr. Lema. That is in evidence in this case. It says, in essence, that the bank may use funds in any account which the plaintiff may maintain with the bank to repay debt which is due without notice to the customer.... It goes on to say in its own language, unless contrary to law.... Court finds in this case that the law as cited in Uniform Commercial Code subsection 3-401 indicates that a person is not liable on the issue unless the person signed the instrument or the person is represented by an authorized agent. Therefore, it would be contrary to law to enforce the contractual agreement between the parties in this case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Further, in its motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the Circuit Court, the Bank argued that it \u201chad both a statutory and contractual right to charge the altered check back against [Lema\u2019s] accounts.\u201d In support of that argument, the Bank quoted the provision of the Deposit Agreement that gave it the right to charge back Lema\u2019s account \u201cthe amount of any item deposited to [Lema\u2019s] account or cashed for [Lema] which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to [Bank of America] due to ... [a] claim of alteration----\u201d <em>See Walls v. Bank of Glen Burnie, </em>135 Md.App. 229, 240, 762 A.2d 151, 157 (2000)(con-cluding that \u201crelation back\u201d issue was preserved for appellate review when it was \u201craised in the circuit court\u201d in a \u201cmotion to alter or amend\u201d). Finally, in its brief submitted to the Court of Special Appeals, the Bank argued that Lema was \u201calso liable under the Deposit Agreement between [Lema] and Bank of America for any loss suffered by Bank of America due to ... any claim of alteration\u201d and referred to the provision of the Deposit Agreement that provided the Bank with a right to charge back the amount of any item deposited to a customer\u2019s account if initially paid but later returned because of a claim of alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Thus, we conclude Bank of America was entitled to debit Lema\u2019s accounts as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY </em>PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">BELL, C.J., ELDRIDGE and HARRELL, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\">.

The \u201cdoubt\u201d of the <em>Cumis </em>court as to the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of the agreement in that case arose from its interpretation of UCC provisions dealing with forged signature liability, which the court viewed as creating \u201cexpressions of policy\u201d that were \"specific\u201d to the issue of forged signature liability. <em>Id. </em>In particular, the court noted that under Section 4-401(a) of the Pennsylvania Commercial Code, a bank may charge against a customer's account only items that are \"properly payable\u201d and that pursuant to Section 3-404, an instrument containing a forged or unauthorized signature is not \"properly payable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. The <em>Cumis </em>court opined that these provisions created \"strict liability,\" and that the risk of loss for a forged or unauthorized signature must be assumed by the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 423. Lema has not argued forged signature liability in the present case. Thus, Maryland statutory provisions equivalent to those Pennsylvania provisions referred to by the <em>Cumis </em>court are not implicated, and the statements of the <em>Cumis </em>court with respect to forged signature liability under the UCC are inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">.

Interpretations of these UCC provisions impact the very foundations of the economy of Maryland. Because the Majority, in my opinion, distorts the Code and Maryland contract law to achieve perhaps what may appear to the Majority to be a just result based on the aroma of possible inferences emanating from the facts of this case, rather than deciding the case in accordance with the clear dictates of the principles of the UCC, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">The facts of this case raise obvious questions in addition to those properly before the Court.

In addition to the unanswered question of Lema\u2019s state of mind, there exists the unaddressed question of who, under the UCC, if not Lema,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> might ultimately and properly be liable on the altered check as a negotiable instrument. As I see it, the issue of whether Lema is liable on the instrument under the UCC is an issue separate and distinct from the question of Lema\u2019s potential liability arising under the Deposit Agreement with the Bank. The trial court was correct in concluding that Lema is not liable on the check. Checks are negotiable instruments and are governed by Title 3 of the UCC. <em>See Messing v. Bank of America, </em>373 Md. 672, 821 A.2d 22 (2003). Section 3-401(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">(a) A person is not liable on an instrument unless (i) the person signed the instrument, or (ii) the person is represented by an agent or representative who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on the represented person under \u00a7 3-402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">This is the UCC default provision for all circumstances not otherwise provided for by other sections of the UCC. Its existence is necessary to insure the degree of certainty of liability and extent of risk required for those engaged in commercial / financial transactions. The record shows that neither Lema, nor anyone else, endorsed the pertinent check in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">While it does not appear essential to the Majority decision in this case, the Majority, at the invitation of Bank of America, asserts the proposition that the UCC, as a matter of policy, allows for the transfer of rights, duties, liabilities, and warranties without signature. The Majority opinion suggests (slip op. at 638-40; 646) that because it can identify two sections of Title 4, \u00a7 4-205 and \u00a7 4 \u2014 401, where liability is imposed or rights transferred in the absence of a signature, that the UCC contemplates, as a matter of implied policy, such transfers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>circumstances apparently not provided for by the UCC. Nothing could be further from the truth. The UCC is quite explicit as to how seemingly unprovided-for-situations are to be handled.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">As was pointed out, <em>supra, </em>under \u00a7 3-401 (a) an individual is not liable on an instrument unless signed by that individual or an agent of that individual. Also as noted, <em>supra, </em>this is the default provision of the Code pertaining to negotiable instruments. We know this because of \u00a7 3 \u2014 102(b), which provides that \u201c[i]f there is a conflict between this title and Title 4 or 9, Titles 4 and 9 govern,\u201d and \u00a7 4-102(a), which states that \u201c[t]o the extent that items within this title are also within Titles 3 and 8, they are subject to those titles. If there is a conflict, this title governs Title 3, but Title 8 governs this title.\u201d (Emphases added). Both \u00a7\u00a7 3-201(b) and 4-102(a) require a direct conflict between applicable sections of Title 3 and Title 4 in order to override the requirement of a signature on the instrument as provided in \u00a7 3-401(a). As will be shown, <em>infra, </em>neither of the statutory provisions pointed to by the Majority, \u00a7 4-205(1) and \u00a7 4-401, are applicable to the facts of this case, and thus no conflict between the provisions of Title 3 and Title 4 exists. Because no conflict between the Titles exists, \u00a7 3^101(a), requiring a signature, controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Contrary to the apparent suggestion of the Majority opinion (slip. op. at 638-40, 646), Lema is not liable on the check under \u00a7 4-205. Section 4-205 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">If a customer delivers an item to a depositary bank for collection:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">(1) The depositary bank becomes a holder of the item at the time it receives the item for collection if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder of the item, whether or not the customer indorses the item, and, if the bank satisfies the other requirements of \u00a7 3-302, it is a holder in due course; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">(2) The depositary bank warrants to collecting banks, the payor bank or other payor, and the drawer that the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>of the item was paid to the customer or deposited to the customer\u2019s account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">(Emphases added). The Majority is correct that this provision was intended to make clear that the depositary bank obtains the rights of a holder. The problem here is that this section of the Code is inapplicable to the facts of this case. Lema did not deliver the check to the Bank, nor apparently did an agent. In addition, Lema was never a \u201cholder\u201d of the instrument, and therefore the Bank could not acquire holder rights through him. A \u201cholder\u201d is defined by \u00a7 1-201(20), in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201cHolder\u201d with respect to a negotiable instrument, means the person in possession if the instrument is payable to bearer or, in the case of an instrument payable to an identified person, if the identified person is in possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgR\">The undisputed facts are that Lema never possessed the check. Because Lema was never in possession, Lema was never a \u201cholder;\u201d thus Lema had no rights as a \u201cholder\u201d to be transferred to the Bank. Whether Lema may be held liable for activities occurring in his accounts under a contract theory is a different question, addressed <em>infra, </em>from that of liability on the check under the UCC. As powerful as the Majority wishes to make the Bank\u2019s Deposit Agreement with Lema, the Agreement nevertheless lacks the power to confer rights of a \u201cholder\u201d upon Lema in an instrument never possessed or endorsed by Lema as required by the Code. Section 4-205 is not applicable to the facts of this case, and therefore does not create a conflict with \u00a7 3-401. Thus, \u00a7 3-401 controls the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Nor is \u00a7 4-401 (b) applicable to the facts of this case. Section \u00a7 4-401 (b) states: \u201cA customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefitted from the proceeds of the item.\u201d Official Comment 2 to that section informs us that: \u201cSubsection (b) adopts the view of case authority holding that if there is more than one customer who can draw on an account, the nonsigning customer is not liable for an overdraft unless that person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>benefits from the proceeds of the item.\u201d The issue before this Court is the alteration of a check, not an overdraft. Furthermore, this is not a situation where there are multiple parties drawing checks on the account; nor is this a factual situation where Lema can be cast in the role of a drawer responsible for the drawing of the instrument in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 4-401 (b) is not applicable to the facts of this case, and no conflict exists between it and \u00a7 3-401. Section 3-401 applies to the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The unanswered question remains, however, that if I am correct and Lema is not liable under Title 3 of the Code for the altered check, who, if anyone, is? I address this question only because, contrary to the apparent belief of the Majority, this case does not present a circumstance unprovided-for by the Code. Though the issue is not before us, and I in no way argue that the Court properly could reach it, the answer to this question is contained in the Code and in the. instrument itself. The check was drawn by an Italian bank, Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo, on its account at the Bank of New York. A copy of the check was contained in the record, and an examination of it is revealing of more than the alteration. Though the copy is less than perfectly legible, there appears to be no expression of the amount of the check written in script. There is merely a long rectangular box near the upper right-hand comer for the placement of numbers indicating the amount. There is sufficient space for at least twenty (20) digits. Inside this rectangle, starting from the left margin, is typed the letters \u201cUSD\u201d, indicating that the check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>is to be paid in U.S. Dollars. Inside the rectangle, from the right margin, are the numbers \u201c63,000.00.\u201d Because these numbers start at the right margin, reading to the left, there is a large space of at least one inch between the letters \u201cUSD\u201d and the amount of \u201c63,000.00.\u201d Obviously, there was even more additional space available when the check was drawn originally for \u201c3,000.00.\u201d The point is that the lay-out of the check is such that it facilitated alteration. The perpetrator of an alteration merely has to place the instrument into a printer or typewriter and type in a number to the left of the original amount, thus increasing its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Section 3^106 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">(a) A person whose failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration of an instrument or to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the alteration or the forgery against a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">(b) Under subsection (a), if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(c) Under subsection (a), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person asserting the preclusion. Under subsection (b), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person precluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Section 3 of the Official Comment to \u00a7 3-406 offers several illustrative examples of \u201cthe kind of conduct that can be the basis of a preclusion under [the] section\u201d, of which \u201cCase # 3\u201d is applicable to the present matter. \u201cCase # 3\u201d explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">A company writes a check for $10. The figure \u201c10\u201d and the word \u201cten\u201d are type-written in the appropriate spaces on the check form. A large blank space is left after the figure and the word. The payee of the check, using a typewriter with a typeface similar to that used on the check, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>writes the word \u201cthousand\u201d after the word \u201cten\u201d and a comma and three zeros after the figure \u201c10.\u201d The drawee bank in good faith pays $10,000 when the check is presented for payment and debits the account of the drawer in that amount. The trier of fact could find that the drawer failed to exercise ordinary care in writing the check and that the failure substantially contributed to the alteration. In that case the drawer is precluded from asserting the alteration against the drawee if the check was paid in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">In short, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Bank of America was obliged to return the funds to the Bank of New York (an assumption that is not a certainty on this record), a proper party from which Bank of America may seek recompense on the check was the Italian bank. Perhaps viewing such an action as an expensive proposition to litigate, given the amount involved, Bank of America instead sought to enforce its asserted contract rights against its account holder, and to do so on a basis which would expand greatly the powers of such contracts if Bank of America\u2019s arguments were accepted by this Court. The Majority opinion grants the Bank this undeserved double victory.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Majority is correct when it states that the UCC expressly allows many of its terms to be modified by private agreement. Given that having a bank account is a virtual necessity in our society and the unequal bargaining power between banks and the majority of their customers, if the Code did not allow expressly for these agreements the argument fairly could be made that such contracts as the one before us are textbook examples of contracts of adhesion. It is for this reason that the Code does not recognize agreements purporting to alter certain of the provisions of the UCC, and makes certain duties and obligations non-waivable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For example, \u00a7 4-103(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The effect of the provisions of this title may be varied by agreement, but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim a bank\u2019s responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure. However, the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which the bank\u2019s responsibility is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">(Emphases added). Similarly, \u00a7 1-102(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">The effect of provisions of Titles 1 through 10 of this article may be varied by agreement, except as otherwise provided in Titles 1 through 10 of this article and except that the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by Titles 1 through 10 of this article may not be disclaimed by agreement but the parties may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of such obligations is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">(Emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The Majority concludes that the Deposit Agreement in question acts to change \u201cthe legal consequences which would otherwise flow from the provisions of the [UCC],\u201d and thus allows the Bank to charge back against Lema\u2019s account where under \u00a7 4-214 that possibility might not exist.(Maj. slip op. at 642). As a result, the Majority affirms the Court of Special Appeals decision reversing the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of Lema. Even if I were to accept the Majority\u2019s reasoning regarding the impact of the parties\u2019 contract, which I do not, the result would not be as suggested by the Majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The Majority opinion asserts that the outcome of this case is determined by clause 4(e) of the Deposit Agreement. (Maj. slip op. at 640-43). This clause reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">e. Items returned. If a deposited item is returned to us by the bank on which it is drawn, we may accept that return and charge the item back against your account without regard to whether the other bank returned the item before its midnight deadline. At our option and without notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>you that the item has been returned, we may resubmit any returned item for payment. You waive notice of dishonor and protest, and agree that we will have no obligation to notify you of any deposited item that is returned to us. Unless prohibited by applicable law or regulation, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item deposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to an allegedly forged, unauthorized or missing endorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error or other problem which in our judgment justifies reversal of credit. We may process a copy or other evidence of a returned item in lieu of the original.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">(Emphasis added). The Majority overlooks that this provision contains elements implicating the Bank\u2019s duty to exercise ordinary care, the waiver of which duty is prohibited by the Code. It overlooks that the Code places the burden of proof for those elements squarely on Bank of America. (Maj. slip op. at 640 n. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Under \u00a7 4-105(2) and (5), Bank of America is, under the facts Of this case, both a \u201cdepositary bank\u201d and a \u201ccollecting bank.\u201d Under \u00a7 4-202(a)(2), a collecting bank must exercise ordinary care in \u201csending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning an item other than documentary draft to the bank\u2019s transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted, as the case may be.\u201d Under \u00a7 4-202(b), \u201c[a] collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subsection (a) by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following receipt of an item, notice, or settlement. Taking proper action within a reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of establishing timeliness.\u201d Notice, under \u00a7 4-105, is a part of the exercise of ordinary care and, under \u00a7 4-103(a) <em>supra, </em>the duty to exercise ordinary care may not be disclaimed by agreement between the parties. Thus, the provisions of clause 4(e) of the Deposit Agreement purporting to waive the notice requirement are void as against public policy. As such, the Bank has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the burden to show that it gave notice to Lema within a reasonable time; otherwise, it is liable for resulting damages as defined by \u00a7 4-103(e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals failed to recognize this, and thus it would be incorrect, even under the Majority\u2019s contract theory, for this Court to simply affirm the decision of the intermediate appellate court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The undisputed facts in this case are that the Bank of New York forwarded to Bank of America a \u201cNotice of Forgery Claim\u201d on 12 January 2000. Bank of America did not inform Lema that it was charging his account $60,000 until 22 February 2000, forty (40) days after the midnight deadline<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for ordinary care as required by \u00a7 4-202. Because Bank of America missed its midnight deadline for giving Lema notice, it bears the burden of proving that a 40 day delay was reasonable; a burden, as pointed out, which it may not avoid by private contract. Contrary to the opinion of the Majority (slip, op at 640 n. 10), it is not necessary that Lema raise the issue of lack of ordinary care. The burden of proof that its actions were reasonable and that it therefore is entitled to the full amount is placed on the Bank by \u00a7 4-202. Bank of America presented no evidence to show that the 40 day delay in giving notice was reasonable under \u00a7 4-202. As a result, even if the Majority\u2019s interpretation of the effect of the Deposit Agreement were correct, a simple affirmance of the decision of the intermediate appellate court is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The problems addressed in sections I and II of this Dissent illustrate the errors in the Majority opinion in its relation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the UCC to the facts of this case. Those errors are ultimately of little consequence to the determination of this case, however, as the Majority opinion does not decide the case on UCC principles, but rather upon general contract principles. Here also I depart from the analysis and conclusions of the Majority opinion in a number of substantive ways, although there are some points it makes with which I agree. I agree with the conclusion of the Majority that \u201cTitle 3 is not the only applicable law; Title 4 deals with \u2018Bank Deposits and Collections\u2019 and also is applicable in this case\u201d (Maj. slip op. at 639). I also agree with the Majority\u2019s conclusion that the Deposit Agreement is not ambiguous. (Maj. slip op. at 644). I disagree, however, with the conclusion of the Majority that the Deposit Agreement functions to change the legal consequences which otherwise would flow from the provisions of the Code <em>(id.). </em>On the contrary, the plain meaning of the unambiguous language of the contract clause in question, clause 4(e), indicates that, far from altering the Code by agreement, the terms used incorporate the Code in its entirety into the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Construction of a contract is, in the first instance, a question of law for the court to resolve. <em>Suburban Hosp. v. Dwiggins, </em>324 Md. 294, 306, 596 A.2d 1069, 1075(1991). There is no room for construction where the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, and we \u201cmust presume that the parties meant what they expressed.\u201d <em>Gen\u2019l Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261-62, 492 A.2d 1306, 1310 (1985). The question presented by this case is whether the terms of the Deposit Agreement were meant to substitute for the provisions of the Code, or merely act as gap fillers. Bank of America seems to argue at one point, contrary to the conclusion of the Majority, that the contract was not intended to vary the terms of the UCC (Brief at 17). The Bank there states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">The charge-back provision in the Deposit Agreement does not \u201celiminate the protections of Title 3\u201d as suggested by Appellant. If the language varies the effect of Title 3, such variation is permitted under Title 4. However, Bank of America submits that the text does not vary the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the UCC Both lower courts determined that Appellant had not ratified the deposit and, therefore, was not liable under Title 3. Therefore, the Bank\u2019s invocation of Title 3 did not change anyone\u2019s liabilities. Rather, in this instance, the text addresses this unique situation that falls outside the limits of the UCC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">(Emphases added; internal citations omitted). While Bank of America is correct that the text of the Deposit Agreement does not vary the terms of the UCC, it is incorrect in asserting that the text addresses a unique situation outside the provisions of the UCC. In fact, the plain language of the Deposit Agreement specifically states that the UCC, as the applicable law, shall apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As I noted <em>supra, </em>I agree with the Majority that Title 3 and Title 4 are the applicable law. I also agree that the relevant contract provision is 4(e), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Unless prohibited by applicable law or regulation, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item deposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us do to an allegedly forged, unauthorized or missing endorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error or other problem which in our judgment justifies reversal of credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">(Emphases added). My difference with the Majority opinion is that after recognizing Title 4 as the applicable law, the Majority failed to apply it as required by clause 4(e) of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Because Titles 3 and 4 are the applicable law, we must interpret the first clause of 4(e) as reading \u201cUnless prohibited by applicable law [which, by definition, includes the provisions of Titles 3 and 4] or regulation.... \u201d Because Title 4 is the applicable law, and the right of charge-back granted to the Bank contained in clause 4(e) is conditioned upon such charge-back not being prohibited by the applicable law, then if a section of Title 4 prohibits such a charge-back, that section of Title 4 controls the right of the Bank to charge-back the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>customers account. Section 4-214 is such a section, and states in relevant part that \u201crights to revoke, charge-back, and obtain a refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.\u201d Section 4-214 being the applicable law under the terms of the contract, Bank of America is precluded by the terms of the contract from charging-back the account if the payment of the check to the account was final, as opposed to provisional. <em>Boggs v. Citizens Bank and Trust Co. of Maryland, </em>32 Md.App. 500, 505, 363 A.2d 247, 250 (1976)(holding that where settlement of an item becomes final, a bank is not permitted under \u00a7 4-214 to charge back a customer\u2019s account).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The question comes down to whether the credit to Lema\u2019s account was provisional or final. My review of the record extract indicates that Bank of America produced no evidence as to whether its release of funds was provisional or final. All that was shown was that the deposit was made on 24 November 1999, and that no withdrawals were made until the check had \u201ccleared.\u201d Lema testified that, after discovering that the deposit had been made, he spoke to a customer service employee of the Bank, one Weise Price, and that that person informed him that the item would be paid after the item was collected, and that that would take about 17 days. This testimony is uncontradicted by the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">For purposes of appellate review, the state of the record is unfortunate. Nevertheless, Bank of America is the party asserting its rights under the Deposit Agreement and, thus, Bank of America has the burden of establishing its right to do so', which includes producing evidence establishing that the release of funds to Lema\u2019s account was provisional, and that final settlement had not occurred prior to the date of the charge-back. \u201cIn Maryland, as in the majority of States, it is the rule, in either breach of contract or tort cases, that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, or on the party who asserts the affirmative of an issue, and that burden never shifts.\u201d <em>Kruvant v. Dickerman, </em>18 Md.App. 1, 3, 305 A.2d 227, 229 (1973). Bank of America failed to meet its burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>For the forgoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, in my opinion, should be reversed, and the judgment of the trial court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge ELDRIDGE have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\">.
