On 7 December 2000, by an unreported Opinion and Order (Misc. Docket AG, No. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>September Term, 2000), we suspended Respondent from the practice of law in the State of Maryland for a period of ninety days based on allegations separate from this proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her suspension commenced on Monday, 8 January 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Attorney Grievance Commission, acting through Bar Counsel, filed a petition with this Court for disciplinary action against Respondent alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct for conduct committed from May 1991 through December 2000.

Hackner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Judge Hackner held an evidentiary hearing on 8 and 9 January 2003. Petitioner was represented by Bar Counsel and Respondent was represented by counsel. After counsel was heard, the judge took the case <em>sub curia. </em>On 14 February 2003, Judge Hackner entered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cI. Background</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cThis case was filed by the Petitioner, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cAGC\u201d), through Bar Counsel, against the Respondent, Susan McMillan Davis. Ms. Davis was admitted to the Bar on June 26, 1985, and currently maintains a law office in Howard County. The matter was called in open court on January 8 and 9, 2003. Testimony and exhibits were received. After counsel were heard, the Court held the case <em>sub curia. </em>The Court, having reviewed the testimony taken, all exhibits, and having considered the arguments of counsel, finds the following facts and makes the following conclusions of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201cII. Findings of Fact</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201cThe Court finds the following facts have been established by clear and convincing evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\u201cA. Complaint of Mia Darbouze</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">\u201cOn May 21, 1991, Mia Darbouze employed Ms. Davis to represent her with respect to a workers\u2019 compensation claim arising from a May 6, 1991 slip and fall accident that occurred during the course of her employment at Howard County General Hospital (the \u201cHospital\u201d). <em>(See </em>Ex. 7). Before she retained Ms. Davis, Ms. Darbouze\u2019s previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>attorney had already filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim on her behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\u201cBetween May 1991 and May 1993, Ms. Davis and Ms. Darbouze had regular contact regarding the status of the workers\u2019 compensation claim. During that time, the two discussed the possibility of filing a third party claim could not be filed until the workers\u2019 compensation case was concluded. She also explained that normally, workers\u2019 compensation is the only available remedy against an employer but there are limited situations in which an employee can recover from an employer in a third party claim. Ms. Davis and Ms. Darbouze also discussed the possibility of pursuing a third party claim against the Hospital\u2019s cleaning company. Ms. Darbouze informed Ms. Davis that she thought the Hospital\u2019s cleaning company on the date of her injury was called Marriott. Ms. Davis explained that any money awarded in the third party claim would be subject to a workers\u2019 compensation lien and also analyzed Ms. Darbouze\u2019s likelihood of success if her case went to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cWhen Ms. Darbouze retained Ms. Davis, she was an associate attorney with Cooper &amp; Reuter, P.A. In May 1993, Ms. Davis left the Law Office of Jack Cooper (formerly Cooper &amp; Reuter) and became a principal in the firm Reuter, Turna &amp; Davis, P.A. On May 25, 1993, Ms. Darbouze signed a document discharging the former firm and authorizing Ms. Davis and her new firm to represent her. <em>(See </em>Exs. 8 &amp; 9). Ms. Darbouze\u2019s file was transferred from Mr. Cooper\u2019s office to Ms. Davis\u2019s new office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cMs. Davis continued to represent Ms. Darbouze before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. By order dated August 3, 1993, Ms. Darbouze was awarded permanent partial disability and Ms. Davis and her firm were awarded attorneys fees. <em>(See </em>Ex. 10).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR4\">\u201cAfter the conclusion of the workers\u2019 compensation case, Ms. Davis and Ms. Darbouze had further discussions about filing a third party claim. Ms. Darbouze always desired to file such a claim. On several occasions, Ms. Davis advised Ms. Darbouze she would be responsible for advancing costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>if the action was filed. <em>(See </em>Exs. C &amp; D). However, Ms. Davis never definitively advised Ms. Darbouze that she would not file the claim without an advance on fees or that she would decline to represent her without such an advance. Indeed, Ms. Davis eventually undertook to file suit without an advance of costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">\u201cOn May 5,1994, one day before the statute of limitations was to run, Ms. Davis filed suit on behalf of Ms. Darbouze in the Circuit Court for Howard County. The civil complaint named the Hospital and \u201cABC Corp. (name to be supplied) Unidentified Business, Corporation or Partnership\u201d as defendant. Ms. Davis did not conduct any research into whether she could proceed against the Hospital in a third party claim.1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201d1 An action pursuant to the Workers Compensation Act is generally the exclusive remedy for an employee against an employer. Md. Code Ann., Labor &amp; Employment, \u00a7 9-509(a). There are limited exceptions where a third party suit can be maintained against an employer, for example, where an employer fails to secure compensation in accordance with the title, or if the employer\u2019s deliberate act caused the injury. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 9-509(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cMs. Davis did not name Marriott as a defendant. Ms. Davis believed that she could have amended the complaint after the statute of limitations expired to substitute the name of the cleaning company for ABC Corporation.2 Ms. Davis contacted the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation and was unable to find a cleaning service with the name of Marriott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201d2 Under Maryland law, it is unlikely that the complaint could have been amended after the statute of limitations had run in order to substitute the name of the cleaning company. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Hofmann Balancing Techniques, Ltd., </em>139 Md.App. 339, 365, 776 A.2d 4 (2001) (clarifying that an amendment to a pleading to add a new defendant is allowed after the statute of limitations runs if it corrects the name of an original party who ha notice of the pending case, but not to add a new party who had no notice of the claim); <em>Nam v. Montgomery County, </em>127 Md.App. 172, 186, 732 A.2d 356 (1999) (holding \"John Doe\u201d pleading cannot be amended to correct the name of a defendant if that person had no notice of the suit before the statute of limitations runs).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">\u201cThe docket entries for Ms. Darbouze\u2019s case indicate that the original summons for the Hospital was issued on May 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>1994. The Hospital was not served with that summons. Another summons was issued on October 24, 1994, but that one was also not served. Ms. Davis wrote the court on November 17, 1994 to request another summons. On the same date, Ms. Davis wrote Ms. Darbouze a letter and apologized for not getting back to her sooner and advised that she was waiting for a summons to be issued to serve the Hospital. <em>(See </em>Ex. 11). The Hospital was served by certified mail on December 12, 1994. <em>(See </em>Ex. 6). Ms. Davis did not offer any explanation at trial as to why the Hospit\u00e1l was not. served until seven months after suit was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cAfter the Hospital was served, its attorneys contacted Ms. Davis several times to ask her to voluntary dismiss because the suit was barred by the Workers Compensation Act. <em>See </em>Exs. 18 &amp; 19. Ms. Davis did not respond to counsel and did not voluntarily dismiss the claim against the Hospital. On January 17, 1995, the Hospital filed a motion to dismiss. Ms. Davis testified that she does not recall doing any research to respond to the motion to dismiss, and her file did not disclose any such research. Ms. Davis did not file a response to the motion to dismiss and did not inform her client that the motion had been filed, In fact, Ms. Davis and Ms. Darbouze had no contact regarding the case from November 17,1994 through February 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201cMs. Darbouze did not learn about the motion to dismiss until Ms. Davis\u2019s office forwarded to her a copy of a February 23, 1995 order granting the motion. The Circuit Court for Howard County dismissed the claim against the Hospital and imposed sanctions in the amount of $250.00 against Ms. Darbouze. <em>See </em>Ex. 12. The claim against ABC Corporation was not affected by the order of dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cAfter receiving the order, Ms. Darbouze contacted Ms. Davis\u2019s office and was informed by either Ms. Davis or her secretary that Ms. Davis would pay the $250 sanction. Ms. Davis does not recall whether she ever paid the sanction. There being no other activity reflected in the court file, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Circuit Court for Howard County closed the case on March 8, 1996.3 <em>(See </em>Ex. 6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201d3 Although the record does not indicate why the file was closed by the circuit court, more than one year had transpired from the last activity in the case and it is likely that the case was closed by operation of Md. Rule 2-507.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201cBetween late 1995 and 1999, Ms. Darbouze contacted Ms. Davis\u2019s office several times regarding the status of her case against the cleaning company. Ms. Darbouze also contacted Ms. Davis regarding several other matters, including her bankruptcy, conflicts with her job, and problems with her marriage. None of these other contacts or conversations pertained to any litigation involving Ms. Darbouze.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201cTelephone message logs from Ms. Davis\u2019s office indicate lengthy periods of time during which Ms. Davis did not return Ms. Darbouze\u2019s phone calls. (See Joint Ex. I). Ms. Davis conceded that she did not return Ms. Darbouze\u2019s calls\u2019 call for call.\u2019 A phone log dated TO/25 to 11/15\u2019 with an unknown year, contains messages from Ms. Darbouze on October 27, October 31, November 9 and November 14. <em>(See id.). </em>In each message, Ms. Darbouze was calling about the status of her case and asking Ms. Davis to call her back. <em>(Id.). </em>Another log in an unknown year for the time period \u20183/1 to 3/16\u2019 includes three messages from Ms. Darbouze requesting the status of her case. <em>(Id.). </em>A ten-day span is also indicated by messages dated October 31 and November 9, 1995. Again, Ms. Darbouze was requesting an update on her case. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">\u201cSometime in 1997, Ms. Darbouze contacted Ms. Davis to say that she was ill and wanted to do whatever was possible to settle her case. At this time, Ms. Davis advised Ms. Darbouze that her case was still active and set up an appointment with her. Ms. Darbouze\u2019s testimony on this point is consistent with a telephone message dated September 8, 1997, indicating there was an appointment scheduled for September 18 at 12 p.m.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">\u201d4 According to Ms. Davis, this took place sometime in 2000. As discussed later in the Court's conclusions of law, whether this conversation took place in 1997 or 2000 has no bearing on the conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201cAt one point in 1998 or 1999, Ms. Darbouze contacted Ms. Davis\u2019s office and a secretary named Debbie informed her the case had been closed. However, soon after, Ms. Davis called Ms. Darbouze back and said that her case was not closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201cMs. Davis also informed Ms. Darbouze several times after late 1995 that the court file was in a retired judge\u2019s chambers. Ms. Darbouze\u2019s testimony on this point is consistent with an April 29, 1998 message from Ms. Darbouze: \u2018she wants to know what is happening with her case. Said she spoke with you 8 months ago. Her case is from 91. <em>Has the judge changedV (See </em>Joint Ex. I) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201cAfter April 29, 1998, Ms. Davis was again delinquent in returning Ms. Darbouze\u2019s calls for nearly a month. Ms. Darbouze left another message on May 4, 1998. Again on May 18, 1998, Ms. Darbouze left a message asking for her case number and the date the case was filed. On May 21, 1998, Ms. Davis left another message inquiring what court her case was filed in, the date filed and the docket number. <em>(See </em>Joint Ex. I). It is clear that in all of these messages, Ms. Darbouze was calling about the status of the case against the cleaning company. The Court concludes that Ms. Davis did not return Ms. Darbouze\u2019s calls in each instance where there was another message asking for the same information within a few days of a prior message.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cIn October 1999, Ms. Darbouze went to the clerk\u2019s office at the circuit Court for Howard County and learned her file was on the \u2018shelf and that there had been no activity in the case since the claim against the Hospital was dismissed on February 28, 1995. A few days later, Ms. Darbouze asked Ms. Davis if there was still a case pending against the cleaning company, and Ms. Davis assured her that there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cIn late 2000 or early 2001, Ms. Darbouze requested a copy of her file from Ms. Davis. Ms. Davis got in touch with Ms. Darbouze and advised her that the file would be available in mid-January 2001. Ms. Darbouze still had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>received the file in early February, so she left a message for Ms. Davis stating that if she did not receive the file, she would file a complaint with the AGC. Ms. Darbouze still did not receive the file from Ms. Davis and she filed a complaint with the AGC on February 13, 2001. <em>(See </em>Ex. 13).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">\u201cMs. Darbouze eventually received a copy of her file from Ms. Davis in April 2001. Upon review of the file, Ms. Darbouze found a copy of a March 23, 1995 letter addressed to her. It stated, in pertinent part: \u2018This letter will confirm our recent meeting wherein it was decided that we would not proceed against the cleaning company. Therefore at this time I will be closing my file.... \u2019 <em>(See </em>Ex. 14).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cWhile there is no direct evidence, circumstantial evidence leads the court to the conclusion that Ms. Davis created the March 23, 1995 letter after Ms. Darbouze filed her complaint with the AGC.5 Ms. Darbouze never received this letter and she does not recall any meeting with Ms. Davis in March of 1995. Ms. Darbouze maintained her own file of correspondence and case information and did not have a copy of this letter. Ms. Darbouze\u2019s actions after March 1995 are consistent with not having received the letter. If Ms. Darbouze had been informed that her case was closed, it is unlikely that she would have contacted Ms. Davis repeatedly over several years to inquire about the status of her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201d5 The Court cannot be certain how the letter was created, but realizes that it could have been by a number of possible means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201cMs. Davis contends that the letter was written on March 23, 1995. She states that the letter could not have been after the fact because Turna <em>&amp; </em>Davis, the firm she was with in 1995, has disbanded sometime in 1997 and all letterhead was discarded at that point. Additionally, Ms. Davis contends that she does not possess the computer skills to create Turna &amp; Davis letterhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201cMs. Davis\u2019s actions, however, are inconsistent with her position. On more than one occasion after March 1995, Ms. Davis represented to Ms. Darbouze that her case was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>open. If Ms. Davis had sent the letter and closed her file in March of 1995, she would not have led Ms. Darbouze to believe her case still active, rather she would have reminded Ms. Darbouze that her case had been closed or sent a copy of the March 1995 letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">\u201cMs. Davis testified that she personally typed a letter dated April 4, 2001 to the AGC. <em>(See </em>Ex. 15). The Court notes that the font in this letter is the same as that in the March 23, 1995 letter. <em>(Compare id. with </em>Ex. 14). But, other letters from Ms. Davis in 1994 and 1995 contain a different font. <em>(See </em>Exs. 11 and 14).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201cAdditionally, when Ms. Davis wrote to the AGC in April 2001 in response to the complaint filed by Ms. Darbouze, she did not mention or attach the March 23, 1995 letter. <em>(See </em>Ex. 15). Since the letter would have been critical documentary evidence in support of Ms. Davis\u2019s response to the complaint, logic dictates that she would not have omitted a reference to the letter if it had existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cAfter Ms. Darbouze filed her complaint, an AGC investigator, Sterling Fletcher, met with Ms. Davis on June 1, 2001 regarding both the Darbouze and Harris matters.6 At that meeting, Mr. Fletcher renewed his request by a telephone call to Ms. Davis. Mr. Fletcher still had not received the file by July 18, 2001 and he wrote Ms. Davis on that date and again requested the file. <em>(See </em>Ex. 16). Ms. Davis wrote back on July 30, 2001 and advised that she would provide the file. <em>(See </em>Ex. 17). Ms. Davis has never provided the Darbouze file to Mr. Fletcher or to the AGC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201d6 The Harris matter is discussed in Section B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201cB. Complaint of Cher Harris</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201cIn January 2000, Cher Harris, who was in the early stages of an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, retained Ms. Davis to represent her with respect to establishing the paternity of her unborn child and any relating claim for child support after the child\u2019s birth. At that time, Ms. Harris paid Ms. Davis a retainer fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201cWhen she initially met with Ms. Davis, Ms. Harris told her that the father of the child was William Leonard Mahoney. Ms. Harris explained that she met Mr. Mahoney when he was her client at Total Body Images, where she worked as a licensed massage therapist. During the course of their relationship, Mr. Mahoney went to Ms. Harris\u2019s home, where she gave him topless massages. Ms. Harris considered Mr. Mahoney to be her boyfriend. At all times during the course of their relationship, Mr. Mahoney was married with three children.7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">\u201d7 Mr. Mahoney is still married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cMs. Harris explained that Mr. Mahoney worked for a family owned business and that she believed he received compensation or cash \u2018under the table\u2019 in addition to the income that would be shown on his pay stubs. Ms. Harris also stated that Mr. Mahoney frequently gave her expensive gifts and large amounts of cash. For these' reasons, Ms. Harris requested that Ms. Davis conduct discovery or otherwise attempt to uncover Mr. Mahoney\u2019s assets and income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\u201cAfter she met with Ms. Harris, Ms. Davis contacted Mr. Mahoney\u2019s attorney, Paul Newhouse. From one or more of the letters she received from Mr. Newhouse, Ms. Davis learned that the details of the parties\u2019 relationship would be presented at the child support hearing and that the relationship would be portrayed as one of prostitution. Ms. Davis forwarded to Ms. Harris copies of all the letters from Mr. Newhouse. Ms. Davis advised Ms. Harris that the circumstances surrounding her relationship with Mr. Mahoney and the fact that he was married and had three other children might have an effect on the amount of child support awarded.8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\u201d8 Ms. Davis further explained that these facts would only have an effect if the parties\u2019 income was high enough to exceed the maximum support guidelines, so that the amount of child support would be within the discretion of the judge or master. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 12-204(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">\u201cOn August 11, 2000, Ms. Harris gave birth to a daughter. Within a few days of the birth, Ms. Harris stopped into Ms. Davis\u2019s office and urged her to move forward with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>paternity and child support proceedings. On or around August 18, 2000, Ms. Davis learned from Mr. Newhouse that a paternity test would be necessary. On August 22, 2000, Ms. Davis filed a \u201cPetition to Establish Paternity and Child Support\u201d (the \u2018petition\u2019) on behalf of Ms. Harris in the Circuit Court for Howard County. Mr. Mahoney\u2019s answer was filed on or around September 28, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">\u201cMs. Harris attempted to unsuccessfully contact Ms. Davis a number of times during the course of her representation. There was not always a secretary or receptionist at Ms. Davis\u2019s office, so Ms. Harris usually left voice mail messages at the office or on Ms. Davis\u2019s cellular phone. Ms. Davis returned some, but not all, of the calls. If Ms. Davis was in the office when Ms. Harris called, she would take her call. Ms. Harris also stopped into Ms. Davis\u2019s office several times. Ms. Davis was not always there, but if she was available, she would meet with Ms. Harris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201cIn mid-October 2000, Ms. Davis attempted to schedule a paternity test with a mobile testing company, but this arrangement was unacceptable to Ms. Harris. Ms. Davis then contacted a lab in Baltimore and tentatively scheduled a test for Ms. Harris and her daughter for November 4, 2000. Ms. Harris called the lab and changed the date to one that was more convenient for her. The results of the paternity test established that Mr. Mahoney was the father of Ms. Harris\u2019s daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">There was no unreasonable delay in scheduling the paternity testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\u201cMs. Davis never filed any written discovery or noted any depositions in the action. She did informally receive copies of Mr. Mahoney\u2019s pay stubs. In December 2000, Ms. Davis related to Ms. Harris that a settlement proposal had been made by Mr. Newhouse under which Mr. Mahoney would pay $1000 per month in child support. Ms. Davis believed that this was a reasonable offer based on the income reflected in Mr. Mahoney\u2019s pay stubs and in light of the evidence that could be introduced at the child support hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cMs. Harris was not satisfied with this offer and requested Ms. Davis to counter-propose that Mr. Mahoney also pay for the child\u2019s health insurance. Ms. Harris reiterated to Ms. Davis that she did not want to accept $1000 a month until discovery was conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">\u201cOn December 7, 2000, the Court of Appeals suspended Ms. Davis from practicing law in the State of Maryland for a period of 90 days, effective Monday, January 8, 2001. Ms. Davis did not notify Ms. Harris of her impending suspension between December 7, 2000 and January 8, 2001. Additionally, Ms. Davis did not strike her appearance in Ms. Harris\u2019s case during this time or after the commencement of her suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cDespite Ms. Harris\u2019s rejection of the proposed settlement terms, Ms. Davis sent Ms. Harris a letter and proposed consent order on December 13, 2000, which contained the same terms.9 <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Ex. 1). There was no mention of the suspension in the letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201d9 The Court is not convinced that Ms. Davis failed to present the counter proposal to Mr. Newhouse, as alleged by the AGC. Ms. Davis testified that she submitted the counter proposal to Mr. Newhouse and he rejected it and that she relayed the information to Ms. Harris. The Court finds that it is just as likely that Ms. Davis submitted the counter proposal to Mr. Newhouse and that his response was in the negative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201cMs. Harris contacted Ms. Davis to let her know that the proposed consent order was unacceptable. Ms. Davis testified that, shortly thereafter, she began to draft interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but these were not presented at the hearing of this case. Ms. Davis did not explain how she anticipated handling discovery requests, given that the responses would have been due during the period of her suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cThere is no evidence that Ms. Davis did anything else to preserve Ms. Harris\u2019s interests after that point. Ms. Davis knew that her suspension was pending, yet she did not inform Ms. Harris. Moreover, Ms. Davis did not immediately refer Ms. Harris to another attorney, which would have been particularly important to preserve the momentum of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201cDuring the period of Ms. Davis\u2019s representation, Ms. Harris filed a claim for assistance with the Department of Social Services (\u2018DSS\u2019). DSS initiated a separate child support case and a hearing was scheduled for Friday, January 5, 2001. Ms. Harris went to Ms. Davis\u2019s office on or around January 2, 2001 to ask her to attend the hearing and to request that she contact the State\u2019s Attorney who would be prosecuting the matter. Ms. Davis did not inform Ms. Harris during that meeting of her impending suspension. Ms. Davis did not contact the State\u2019s Attorney and could not attend the hearing because she had a hearing in another matter at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">\u201cSometime in early to mid-January 2001, Ms. Harris contacted the AGC to inquire about filing a grievance against Ms. Davis. Ms. Harris then learned for the first time of Ms. Davis\u2019s suspension. On January 21, 2001, Ms. Harris filed a complaint with the AGC. <em>(See </em>Ex. 3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">\u201cBefore she filed the complaint with the AGC, Ms. Harris wrote Ms. Davis to terminate her representation by letter dated January 15, 2001. <em>(See </em>Ex. 2). In that letter, Ms. Harris included the contact information for her new attorney, Stuart Snyder. <em>(Id.). </em>Upon receipt of the letter, Ms. Davis wrote to Ms. Harris and advised that her file was available to be picked up. Neither Ms. Harris nor her attorney ever picked up the file from Ms. Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiR\">\u201cIt did not occur to Ms. Davis until after her suspension began that she should write her clients to advise them of the suspension. The only evidence that Ms. Davis informed Ms. Harris of her suspension is a letter dated January 22, 2001. <em>(See </em>Ex. 4). This letter was sent after Ms. Davis\u2019s suspension began and after she had already been terminated by Ms. Harris.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u201cIf Ms. Harris had learned of the suspension earlier, it is reasonable to conclude that she would have terminated Ms. Davis sooner and would have employed another attorney in order to prosecute her case without interruption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>III. Conclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">\u201cAt a hearing on a petition filed by the AGC pursuant to Md. Rule 16-757, the AGC has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, the averments of the petition. A respondent attorney must only establish an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">\u201cA. Mia Darbouze</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cIn connection with her representation in the Darbouze matter, the AGC has charged that Ms. Davis engaged in professional misconduct by violating the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 8.4 and 8.1. [Footnotes 10-16 omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cThe Court finds that the AGC has established by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Davis violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3. Ms. Davis did not provide Ms. Darbouze with competent and diligent representation when she filed suit without having a viable basis for a cause of action against the Hospital and by failing to investigate the real name of the cleaning company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">\u201cMs. Davis also violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3 when she waited nearly nine months from the conclusion of the workers\u2019 compensation claim to file suit. There was no evidence presented to establish that such a delay was warranted. Additionally, by delaying the filing until the day prior to the expiration of the limitations period, Ms. Davis created the likelihood that a subsequent amendment to add the name of the cleaning company would have been unsuccessful. Furthermore, once suit was filed, three summonses were issued before the Hospital was finally served, which was more than seven months after suit was filed.17 The Court also finds that Ms. Davis failed to act with diligence with regard to paying the sanction imposed against Ms. Darbouze because there is no evidence it was ever paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">\u201d17 As evidenced by the fact that Hospital was ultimately served by certified mail, it does not appear there was any difficulty in accomplishing service of process so as to explain the delay in service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u201cThe Court finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 3.1, by filing suit against the Hospital without having a good faith basis to proceed and by naming ABC Corporation without making a reasonable investigation to determine the true defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">\u201cThe Court finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 3.2 because she made no efforts to expedite the third party suit. After filing the case, she merely allowed it to languish in the court system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u201cThe Court also finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.4 during the course of her representation of Ms. Darbouze. Ms. Darbouze\u2019s calls went unanswered, sometimes for more than a month at a time. This clearly shows a failure to communicate on the part of Ms. Davis. Ms. Davis also violated Rule 1.4 when she failed to keep Ms. Darbouze reasonably informed about the status of her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">\u201cAdditionally, Ms. Davis violated both Rules 1.4 and 8.4(c) by misrepresenting the status of Ms. Darbouze\u2019s case to her. Ms. Davis knew or should have known that the court had actually closed the case on March 8, 1996, yet she led Ms. Darbouze to believe that the claim was still active.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">\u201cFurthermore, the Court is led to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Davis created the March 23, 1995 letter <em>(See </em>Ex. 14) sometime after March 1995 to make it appear as if she had previously advised Ms. Darbouze that they would not be pursuing a claim against the cleaning company. Ms. Davis, therefore, violated Rule 8.4 by creating a false document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Lastly, the Court finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 8.1 by knowingly failing to respond to the AGC\u2019s request to provide a copy of the Darbouze file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">\u201cB. Cher Harris</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">\u201cIn connection with her representation in the Harris matter, the AGC has charged that Ms. Davis engaged in professional misconduct by violating the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 1.16(a) and (d). [Footnotes 18-20 omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201cThe Court finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.3 by failing to conduct discovery when she had specific information that Mr. Mahoney\u2019s pay stubs likely were not an accurate representation of his income.21 The Court also finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.4 when she failed to advise Ms. Harris of her impending suspension.22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">\u201d21 At trial, the AGC argued that Ms. Davis violated this rule in other ways during the course of the Harris representation, however, the Court does not conclude that the evidence supports such a finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201d22 Insofar as the AGC alleges that Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.4 in other ways, the Court concludes Ms. Davis did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cThe Court further finds that Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.16(a). Under Rule 1.16(a)(1), a lawyer shall withdraw from the representation of a client if the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. Although Ms. Davis did not actively represent Ms. Harris during her suspension \u201e(i.e., by going to court on her behalf), she continued to technically represent her because she held herself out as her attorney and her appearance remained entered in her case. Ms. Davis also violated subsection (a)(3) of the rule when she did not strike her appearance after Ms. Harris terminated her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201cRule 1.16(d) sets forth what an attorney must do upon termination of representation. Ms. Davis\u2019s 90-day suspension was a termination of her representation because she was not allowed to practice law or represent clients during that time period. Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.16(d) because she failed to protect Ms. Harris\u2019s interests by giving her reasonable notice and to allow time for her to employ another attorney.23 <em>See id. </em>at 327 (noting that a suspension terminates ethical representation and thus, Rule 1.16(d) becomes operative).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201d23 The Court does not find that Ms. Davis violated this rule insofar as she did not forward Ms. Harris or her attorney a copy of her file, because she had advised Ms. Harris that the file was available, but it was never retrieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201cIV. Conclusion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">\u201cWherefore, it is this 4th day of February, 2003, found by the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County, for the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>set forth herein, that the Respondent, Susan McMillan Davis, has violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 1.3,1.4,1.16(a) and (d), 3.1, 3.2, 8.1 and 8.4.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Bar Counsel took no exceptions to Judge Hackner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended disbarment as a sanction for Ms. Davis\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Bar Counsel finds Respondent\u2019s history of dishonesty in the practice of law to be of particular importance and urges us to find her morally unfit to continue in the practice of law. We previously suspended Ms. Davis, by unreported opinion, for ninety days for engaging in other conduct violating Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(b) and 8.4(c) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Davis, </em>Misc. AG No. 1, September Term, 2000. She failed to act with requisite competence and diligence in her representation of a client with a potential workers\u2019 compensation claim by not filing any claim. <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 19. She falsely told her client that a claim had been filed and continued to deceive the client for a period of several years. <em>Id. </em>When requested to respond to the client\u2019s complaint, Ms. Davis failed to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s letters, in violation of Rule 8.1(b). <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 22. She later lied to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator and testified falsely under oath before an Inquiry Panel, thereby violating Rule 8.4(c). <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 23. The hearing judge in that case specifically determined that \u201cthe Respondent was not truthful when speaking to the [Commission\u2019s] investigator, when testifying before the Inquiry Panel, and to the Court.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>We observed in our opinion in the prior case that \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct in the case <em>sub judice </em>is not simple neglect or the result of an error of judgment made in good faith.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 19. We overruled all of her exceptions and, in imposing the ninety-day suspension, noted \u201cthat, while we have generally suspended lawyers who for the first time have been found to have violated rules relating to competency, we have disbarred subsequent offenders.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Bar Counsel describes yet another prior instance of dishonesty resulting in Ms. Davis being reprimanded. Ms. Davis received a private reprimand issued by the Review Board, pursuant to former Maryland Rule BV7c, for failing to respond to four separate complaints and also for making misrepresentations about having mailed a response to one of the complaints. The Review Board found, subsequent to an Inquiry Panel proceeding, that Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s demands for information in each of the four matters under review. The Review Board found additional violations of Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) based on the Respondent\u2019s false statements, both to Bar Counsel and to an Inquiry Panel, that a letter responding to one of the complaints had been mailed on three prior occasions. The Review Board found that Ms. Davis fabricated a letter purporting to demonstrate that she had responded to Bar Counsel\u2019s first three requests for a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Bar Counsel concludes that the matter currently before this Court involves allegations of misconduct similar to the misconduct for which Ms. Davis was sanctioned previously. Such repeated misconduct shows a blatant disregard for the Rules of Professional Conduct and, urges Bar Counsel, requires that the offending party be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Ms. Davis presented several exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law in the present case and, based on these exceptions, suggests that we dismiss the disciplinary proceedings in their entirety. She disputes numerous findings of fact found by the hearing judge to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>been established by clear and convincing evidence. Ms. Davis argues that Ms. Darbouze consulted with her regarding many matters other than the hospital case and she therefore takes exception to the finding that \u201cthe case\u201d referred to in various telephone messages referred to the hospital case. She takes further exception to Judge Hackner\u2019s conclusion that the 23 March 1995 letter was created after Ms. Darbouze complained to the AGC and proffers instead that she did in fact send the letter on 23 March 1995. Ms. Davis also claims that although she did promise to give Sterling Fletcher, the AGC\u2019s investigator, a copy of the Darbouze file, she was under the impression that he already had a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Ms. Davis takes exception to multiple findings of fact regarding the Harris complaint as well. She takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she did not inform Ms. Harris of her pending suspension. She contends that she did inform Ms. Harris of her suspension before it took effect and that she also notified Ms. Harris of her suspension by letter sent at the end of January and counseled her to get alternative representation. Respondent argues that Ms. Harris had additional counsel for her proceeding for child support in the Circuit Court for Howard County. She also excepts to the failure of Judge Hackner to note that the settlement ultimately reached by Ms. Harris was for $1,000.00 without health insurance, the same terms Ms. Davis recommended to Ms. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Respondent takes exception to every conclusion of law reached by Judge Hackner. Ms. Davis argues that she was working to protect the interests of Ms. Darbouze although she failed to find the name or confirm the existence of the third party cleaning company. She argues that Ms. Darbouze was not prejudiced in any way by the time lapse between the determination by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission and the filing of the lawsuit. Ms. Davis further contends that it is not \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that one cannot file a lawsuit against an unknown party and she therefore did not violate Rule 3.1 in naming the ABC Corporation as a defendant in Ms. Darbouze\u2019s lawsuit. Respondent also excepts to the conclusion that she violated Rule 3.2 because she made no effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>expedite a third party suit. She contends instead that she pursued the matter until she informed Ms. Darbouze that there was no reasonable expectation of recovery. She excepts to the judge\u2019s conclusion that Rules 1.4 and 8.4 were violated as a result of her misrepresentations to Ms. Darbouze. She claims that she accurately informed Ms. Darbouze that she was no longer working on her case. Ms. Davis excepts to the conclusion that she violated Rule 8.4 by creating a false document. She contends that she lacked the ability to create such a document and, in fact, did not create it.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Concerning the Harris complaint, Ms. Davis takes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 1.3 by failing to conduct discovery to determine Mr. Mahoney\u2019s undisclosed income. She finds sustenance in the fact that the subsequent attorney representing Ms. Harris settled the matter on the same terms recommended by Ms. Davis. She takes further exception to the finding that she failed to advise Ms. Harris of her pending suspension. She claims to have told Ms. Harris of her suspension at the time Ms. Harris requested that Ms. Davis act as her lawyer in the case handled by the Howard County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office to collect unpaid child support. She argues that she confirmed that in a letter to Ms. Harris describing the prior conversation. Ms. Harris advised Ms. Davis of her new counsel less than a week after Ms. Davis\u2019s suspension began and Respondent suggests that those facts preclude the possibility that she violated Rule 1.16. Ms. Davis takes final exception to the judge\u2019s finding that she violated Rule 1.16(d) by continuing to represent Ms. Harris after her suspension took effect. She contends that she did not represent Ms. Harris after she was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">This Court exercises original jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We conduct an independent review of the record, accepting the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Respondent must only establish an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation by a preponderance of the evidence. Md. Rule 16-757(b). Maryland Rule 16-759 requires this Court, when exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings are taken properly, to determine whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standards of proof set out in Rule 16-757(b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Ms. Davis\u2019s contention fails that the hearing judge incorrectly found that the references by Ms. Darbouze to \u201cthe case\u201d in her various telephone messages left for Ms. Davis referred to the hospital case. The hearing judge found that Ms. Darbouze indeed did telephone Ms. Davis to discuss several other matters, but none of them properly could be termed a \u201ccase,\u201d as that term tends to refer to a legal action actually commenced and Ms. Darbouze had no other \u201ccases\u201d pending with Ms. Davis. Ms. Davis does not suggest that there were any other matters she was handling for Ms. Darbouze that had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Ms. Davis also takes issue with the finding that the 23 March 1995 letter was not authentic and had not been sent by Ms. Davis to Ms. Darbouze as Ms. Davis asserted. Ms. Davis states that there was no evidence before the hearing judge that a third party could have created the letter and she further asserts that she lacked the means to create the letter in 2001 as the hearing judge found. While she is correct in observing that there is no evidence of a third party creating the letter, the hearing judge noted adequate circumstantial evidence indicating that the letter was fabricated by Ms. Davis sometime in 2001, after Ms. Darbouze filed her complaint. Ms. Darbouze claimed she never received the letter and the hearing judge found her actions after March 1995 to be consistent with not having received the letter. Ms. Davis\u2019s actions after March 1995 are inconsistent with her claim that she sent the letter because she continued to represent to Ms. Darbouze that her case was still active. We agree -with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[i]f Ms. Darbouze had been informed that her case was closed, it is unlikely that she would have contacted Ms. Davis repeatedly over several years to inquire about the status of her case,\u201d and correspondingly, if Ms. Davis has sent the letter and closed Ms. Darbouze\u2019s file, \u201cshe would not have led Ms. Darbouze to believe her case still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>active; rather, she would have reminded Ms. Darbouze that her case had been closed or sent her a copy of the March 1995 letter.\u201d Ms.' Davis\u2019s exception to the finding that she fabricated the 23 March 1995 letter is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Ms. Davis also excepted to the finding that the AGC investigator, Mr. Fletcher, requested the Darbouze file and Ms. Davis failed ever to provide the file to Mr. Fletcher despite several subsequent requests from him to do so. Ms. Davis merely proffers that she was under the impression that Mr. Fletcher already had a copy of the file. That assertion is nonsensical given his repeated requests in writing and via telephone conversation that Ms. Davis provide him with the Darbouze file. That exception also is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Ms. Davis\u2019s exceptions regarding the findings of fact relative to the Harris complaint are likewise overruled. We conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by clear and convincing evidence. Ms. Davis presents no evidence to challenge the hearing judge\u2019s findings that she did not notify Ms. Harris of her suspension in a timely manner, failed to assist Ms. Harris with her case in Circuit Court, or drafted a consent order despite Ms. Harris\u2019s repeated and prior objection to the proposed terms of that order. Ms. Davis merely argues that the ultimate settlement in the case was consistent with her prediction. That the financial number ended up being the same is no excuse for not responding to the interests of her client. Ms. Davis also defends her action regarding the Circuit Court proceedings by pointing out that at the time of the proceeding Ms. Harris was represented by the State\u2019s Attorney. That the State\u2019s Attorney was prosecuting the matter is irrelevant to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Ms. Davis failed to attend the hearing and failed to contact the State\u2019s Attorney as Ms. Harris requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">C. <em>Conclusions of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Accepting the findings of the hearing judge to be proven adequately, we proceed to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. We find that the facts are sufficient to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>conclusion that Ms. Davis violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 8.1(b), 8.4(a) and (c), and 1.16(a) and (d) in her representation of Ms. Darbouze and Ms. Harris. Based on her history of violating the Rules of Professional Conduct and her current proven violations, we find the appropriate sanction to be disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\n<em>Rules 1.1 and 1.3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We turn first to Ms. Davis\u2019s violation of Rules 1.1 and 1.3. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pinkney, </em>311 Md. 137, 141, 532 A.2d 1367, 1369 (1987), this Court disciplined an attorney who led her client to believe that she had filed a lawsuit on the client\u2019s behalf when in fact she had not. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">Respondent violated DR 6-101(A)(3)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by neglecting a legal matter entrusted to her. Respondent admitted that she set Ms. Manner\u2019s file aside from all of the others in her office and ignored it unless she heard from Ms. Manners. She also failed to adequately investigate and sufficiently research the matter to either establish that there was a cause of action or dissuade Ms. Manners from pursuing the claim if there was insufficient basis to file suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id. </em>We found in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cohen, </em>361 Md. 161, 174, 760 A.2d 706, 713 (2000), that the respondent in that matter violated Rule 1.3 through his repeated failure to return telephone calls to his client, by failing to pay a court fee that prevented the processing of his client\u2019s motion, and by claiming to have sent various letters to his clients which were not actually received by them. We have stated before that \u201c[t]he quality of a lawyer\u2019s representation is measured by the degree of legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation the lawyer brings to the representation.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 85, 753 A.2d 17, 32 (2000). We also observed that the line between incompetence and mere neglect \u201cdepends upon what reasonably is necessary in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Ms. Davis filed suit without having a viable basis for a cause of action against the Hospital and by failing to investigate the proper name of the cleaning company. She waited nearly nine months from the conclusion of the worker\u2019s compensation claim to file suit the day before the limitations period expired. By so doing, she made it unlikely that an amendment to add the name of the cleaning company would be successful. Ms. Davis failed to act with diligence in serving summonses on the Hospital and with regard to paying the sanction imposed against Ms. Darbouze. The evidence indicates that although Ms. Davis literally may not have put Ms. Darbouze\u2019s file aside, she did not pursue actively Ms. Darbouze\u2019s claims against the Hospital and cleaning company. There is no evidence to indicate that Ms. Davis acted with thoroughness, preparedness, or diligence in her representation of Ms. Darbouze.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Ms. Davis offers, in her defense, that Ms. Darbouze\u2019s interests were not prejudiced by her acts or failure to act. We observed, on consideration of an exception asserting the \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d defense, the attorney\u2019s neglect was still established. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. 1, 25, 762 A.2d 950, 963 (2000). Ms. Davis\u2019s argument that no prejudice resulted from her negligence is insufficient to derail our determination that she did not exercise diligence or competence in her representation of Ms. Darbouze\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Her representation of Ms. Harris\u2019s interests was likewise inadequate. She violated Rule 1.3 by not conducting discovery to determine whether Mr. Mahoney\u2019s pay stubs were an accurate representation of his income, despite information that they likely were not a complete representation and despite repeated exhortation to do so by Ms. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\n<em>Rule 1.4</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">An attorney is required by Rule 1.4 to engage in reasonable communication with his or her client regarding the status of his or her case. Rule 1.4 also requires that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>attorney comply with requests from the client for information about his or her case. Ms. Davis did not maintain such a dialogue with either Ms. Darbouze or Ms. Harris. Ms. Darbouze\u2019s calls went unanswered, sometimes for a month at a time. Ms. Davis misrepresented to Ms. Darbouze the status of her case, leading her to believe it was active when in fact it was closed. Ms. Davis violated Rule 1.4 by failing to inform Ms. Harris of her suspension in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Ms. Davis claims that she did not violate Rule 1.4 in her dealings with Ms. Darbouze because she sent Ms. Darbouze a letter on 23 March 1995 informing her that the case had been closed. Because we find that Ms. Davis fabricated the March 1995 letter to Ms. Darbouze, we conclude that this exception is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>Rule 1.16</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Rule 1.16(a) requires an attorney to withdraw from representing a client if the representation will result in violation of any of the Rules of Professional Conduct. We have indicated elsewhere that suspension of an attorney terminates ethical representation. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>340 Md. 318, 327, 666 A.2d 1246, 1250 (1995). Rule 1.16(d) provides that, upon termination of representation, an attorney must continue to protect the client\u2019s interests by giving reasonable notice to the client and allow the client the opportunity to employ other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Ms. Davis\u2019s ninety-day suspension terminated her representation of Ms. Harris. Ms. Davis violated subsection (a) by continuing to hold herself out as Ms. Harris\u2019s attorney during her suspension and by not striking her appearance when Ms. Harris did terminate her. She failed to give Ms. Harris reasonable notice and to allow her time to employ other counsel. Ms. Davis clearly violated the dictates of Rule 1.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\n<em>Rule 3.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Rule 3.1 is violated when \u201cthe lawyer is unable ... to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken.\u201d Rule 3.1, comment. In <em>Zdravkovick, </em>we imposed disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>measures on an attorney who attempted to remove his client\u2019s state action to federal court although \u201ca reading of [the relevant federal statute] would have made it crystal clear to respondent that, under the circumstances, he could not remove the Texas action to a federal court in Maryland.\u201d 362 Md. at 29, 762 A.2d at 965. In <em>Pinkney, </em>we found a violation of the MRPC when an attorney failed to investigate a matter, determine what statute of limitations applied, and otherwise failed to engage in adequate preparation. 311 Md. at 141, 532 A.2d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The hearing judge concluded that Ms. Davis violated Rule 3.1 by filing suit against the Hospital without a good faith basis from which to proceed and by naming ABC Corporation \u2022without making reasonable investigation to determine the actual defendant. In her defense, presumably referring to the language used in <em>Zdravkovich, </em>Ms. Davis claims that it was not \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that one cannot file a lawsuit against an unknown party. There is no evidence that Ms. Davis made any attempts to' discover the true identity of the cleaning company other than her initial feeble investigation. She did not file any written discovery, note any depositions, or take any other steps in that regard. Furthermore, Ms. Davis did not conduct any research into whether she could proceed against the Hospital in a third party claim before filing suit. Although there are exceptions to where a third party suit can be maintained against an employer, the Workers Compensation Act is generally the exclusive remedy for an employee against an employer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Ms. Darbouze was awarded permanent partial disability as a result of proceedings before the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission and there is no indication that Ms. Darbouze\u2019s claim fell into any of the named exclusions to that general limitation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree with the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>judge that Ms. Davis violated Rule 3.1 in her representation of Ms. Darbouze.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>Rule 3.2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">After filing the ill-fated suit, Ms. Davis proceeded to ignore it largely. The Hospital was not served with the summons until seven months after she filed suit. After the Hospital was served, its attorneys made numerous attempts to contact her in order to request that she voluntarily dismiss the suit as it was barred by the Workers Compensation Act. Ms. Davis was unresponsive to those attempts. Ms. Davis also failed to respond to the Hospital\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, causing the claim to be dismissed and a $250 sanction levied on Ms. Darbouze. Ms. Davis hardly could have done more to ignore Ms. Darbouze\u2019s claim after she filed suit. It is clear to us that her behavior violated the mandate of Rule 3.2 \u2014 \u201cA lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Rule 8.4</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Ms. Davis violated Rule 8.4(c) by fabricating the 23 March 1995 letter in an attempt to mislead Bar Counsel into believing that she had advised Ms. Darbouze that she would not be pursuing a claim against the cleaning company and to obscure the fact that Ms. Davis misrepresented the status of the case to Ms. Darbouze on multiple occasions. We repeatedly have recognized the unparalleled importance of honesty to the practice of law. We have stated that \u201cintentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 420, 800 A.2d 747, 757 (2002). We further observed that \u201c[hjonesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>attorney\u2019s character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ms. Davis\u2019s actions in this matter and prior matters indicate that dishonesty is present in her character. By creating a false document and seeking to pass it off as genuine, Ms. Davis evidenced a clear disregard for the basic tenets of ethical behavior. We agree with the hearing judge that she violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\n<em>Rule 8.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Finally, Ms. Davis violated Rule 8.1 by knowingly failing to respond to the AGC\u2019s request to provide a copy of the Darbouze file to Mr. Fletcher. Despite numerous attempts made by Mr. Fletcher to obtain it, Ms. Davis never provided the file. Rule 8.1(b) provides that a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter shall not \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information\u201d from a disciplinary authority. We observed in an earlier case that \u201c[t]he practice of law carries with it special responsibilities of self-regulation, and attorney cooperation with disciplinary authorities is of the utmost importance to the success of the process and the integrity of the profession.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 255, 760 A.2d 1108, 1119 (2000). Ms. Davis does not assert that the demand was unlawful, nor does she dispute her noncompliance with Mr. Fletcher\u2019s requests. Her refusal to cooperate and flimsy attempt to justify that refusal by claiming she thought he already had a copy of the file, reflect poorly on her integrity and honesty. We find that her failure to provide the AGC with Ms. Darbouze\u2019s file violated Rule 8.1(b). <em>See Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 760 A.2d 1108 (finding that an attorney\u2019s failure to comply with \u201clawful demands\u201d from Bar Counsel for information violated Rule 8.1); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. David, </em>331 Md. 317, 628 A.2d 178 (1993) (finding an attorney\u2019s failure to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information to be a violation of Rule 8.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">D. <em>Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Our consideration of the appropriate disciplinary measure to be taken in any given case involving violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the Rules of Professional Conduct is guided by our interest in protecting the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002). The purpose of such proceedings is not to punish the lawyer, but should deter other lawyers from engaging in similar conduct. <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 96, 753 A.2d at 38. The public is protected when we impose sanctions that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We find that the appropriate sanction for Ms. Davis\u2019s ethical violations is disbarment. We find that the aggregation of Ms. Davis\u2019s prior offenses and these violations establish a pattern of deceitful conduct unbecoming to a member of the legal profession. We cautioned Ms. Davis in her earlier proceeding before this Court that \u201cwhile we have generally suspended lawyers who for the first time have been found to have violated rules relating to competency, we have disbarred subsequent offenders.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>slip op. at 24. We found that Ms. Davis failed to competently and diligently represent her client, failed to communicate with her client regarding the status of her case, and was dishonest in the AGC fact-finding process. <em>Id. </em>We have found her culpable for the identical behaviors in her representation of Ms. Darbouze and Ms. Harris and in her dealings with the AGC regarding this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Our decision to disbar Ms. Davis is consistent with other cases involving similar behavior. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Faber, </em>373 Md. 173, 817 A.2d 205 (2003) (repeated failure to respond to AGC requests for information, client neglect, and prior disciplinary history provided sufficient basis to disbar errant attorney); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fallin, </em>371 Md. 237, 808 A.2d 791 (2002) (disbarring attorney for failure to communicate with clients and diligently pursue their claims and in light of the history of disciplinary measures taken against him); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 567 A.2d 112 (1989) (holding that multiple acts of negligent misrepresentation, unavailability to and failure to communicate with clients, and failure to withdraw from cases after being discharged warranted disbarment).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST SUSAN MCMILLAN DAVIS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">.
