The hill also prays for general relief in the case as made by the hill of complaint. The marriage contract marked A., No. 1, and the will of Cath\u2022arine Michael, exhibit B., No. 2, are filed as exhibits with the bill. The appellant, in his answer, fully admits all \u25a0the material facts and allegations of the bill of complaint, \u25a0and rests his defence upon the following grounds: 1st. That the marriage contract is invalid, entered into by the \u25a0\u25a0said Catharine with an intent to deceive, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>fraudulent and void. 2nd. That the said Catharine, after the marriage, refused to perform the duties imposed upon her by her marriage vows ; that she violated all she stipulations of the contract without cause, and thereby rendered all the covenants to be performed after her death null and void. 3rd. That the complainants, under the true construction of the marriage contract, have no right to claim, either in a Court of Law or Equity, the said $4,250, and the interest thereon from the period of the death of the said Catharine, or any part of it; that the covenant in the marriage contract to pay the $4,250, and the interest thereon, to any child or children the said Catharine might leave, if more than one, equally between them, if only one, to that child, has no reference to the complainant, Caroline M. Morey; that the covenant, according to its true construction and the intent of the parties, had reference alone to the issue of the marriage, and not to any child the said Catharine had by a former marriage. 4th. That all the trusts created by the covenants in the marriage contract, ceased at the death of the said Catharine ; that the complainants, if they have any right to said sum of money, can only assert their right in a Court of Law, and that a Court of Equity has no jurisdiction upon the subject matter in controversy. 5th. That the averments in the bill of complaint are insufficient and excepted to on that ground. The decision of the points suggested by the defendant\u2019s-answer, will determine the case made by the bill and the rights of the complainants under the marriage contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">After general replication and testimony taken by agrees ment of the parties, a <em>pro forma </em>decree was passed for the complainant for the purpose of taking the case to the Court of Appeals, requiring the defendant to pay, orto bring into Court to be paid, unto the complainants, the sum of four thousand, two hundred and fifty dollars, with interest thereon from the 28th of February, 1858, till paid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>brought into this Court to be paid, with the complainants\u2019 costs of this suit to he taxed by the clerk. From which decree the appellant prayed an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b255-5\">The cause was argued before Bowie, C.

Palmer </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">The learned counsel for the appellees contend, that the questions submitted to the Court in the cause under consideration, are not now debatable. They insist, that the true construction of the marriage contract, and the question of jurisdiction, were \u201cfully and clearly\u201d settled by this Court, in a case between the same parties, reported in 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>227. To this proposition we demur. There is no analogy in principle between that case and this. More of this, however, in its proper place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">The only object of the appellees is to recover the specific sum of four thousand, two hundred and fifty dollars, and the interest thereon, from the time of the death of the wife of the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">The averments of the bill, filed by the appellees in the Circuit Court, are not sufficient to entitle them to the relief for which they pray. They have their action upon a covenant or contract entered into on the fourth day of March, 1850, between the appellant and one Catherine Baker, while <em>feme sole, </em>in contemplation of marriage. It is strictly a marriage contract, and not a marriage settlement; and the meaning and intention of the parties to it are to govern its construction, as in all other covenants. The bill charges that the appellant is the trustee for the appellees, and holds the said $4,250 in trust for them. That proposition cannot ho sustained upon any principle. Marriage is the principal consideration for the contract, and immediately upon the marriage of the parties, the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>became completely an executed contract, so far as tbe sum of $4,250 was involved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">We shall contend, that the appellees are not entitled to recover said sum of money in this action. Before the Court can come to a direct conclusion in the matter, we must carefully analyze the marriage contract, the covenants therein contained, and the meaning and intention of the contracting parties. The contract does not create any express trust for any purpose, and the law never will imply or presume a trust, except from absolute necessity. This is a principle indisputably settled .in' equity. <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>144, 171. <em>Cook vs. Fountain, </em>3 <em>Swanston, </em>585, 591.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">Lord Hahdwick defines a trust to be \u201csuch a confidence between the parties, that no action at law will lie, but is merely a case for the consideration of tbe Courts of Equity.\u201d Such a confidence, therefore, as would found an action at law, he would not have called a trust. <em>Stuart vs. Mellish, </em>2 <em>Atkins, </em>612, These principles are sustained by all the authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">In the case of a married woman, as in this case, where she has, by a marriage contract, property and rights secured to her, for her separate use and benefit, the law will, from necessity, presume a trust for the purpose of securing her separate property for her use and benefit; for by the strict rules of the common law, she is deprived by her marriage of all legal rights as against her husband. The act of marriage operates, at law, as an absolute gift to the husband of all chattels personal belonging to the wife, and all her choses in action, <em>&amp;c.

This is a general rule, with some exceptions ; but to abate the rigor of the common law, a Court of Equity will interpose its aid and convert the husband into a trustee for the wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Hill on Trustees, </em>420, <em>top p. </em>609. <em>Lee vs. Prideaux, </em>3 <em>Browne\u2019s Ch.

Wns., </em>125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-4\">l he question now is, what was the extent and character of the trust confided to the appellant ? A glance at the marriage contract will he sufficient to settle the question. The Court will he governed entirely by the true intent and meaning of the parties ; and that intent and meaning must he collected from the contract itself, taking it all together. Catherine Michael did not, in her lifetime, execute the power of appointment by will. It seems to he perfectly clear from the true construction of the contract, that the appellant was trustee for his wife only, and for no one else. There was no necessity for a trustee for any other purpose. There certainly is nothing in the contract to justify the conclusion that the appellant was trustee for the appellees. The authorities on the subject of trusts exclude such an idea, for if the appellee, Caroline M. Morey, is the person entitled by the true construction of the covenants in the contract, to the money in question, she has a full, complete and adequate remedy in a Court of Common Law; and ife is not absolutely necessary that a trust should be presumed to aid her in the recovery of it. The trust created for the benefit of the wife of the appellant ceased to exist, and was ended on the death of the wife, except so far as he had in his hands, at the time of her death, interest money which had accrued on said sum of $4,250 during her life, that was her trust fund. The question in relation to the balance of such trust money, was fully disposed of by the Court in the case of <em>Caroline Morey, executrix of Catharine Michael, vs. Isaac Michael, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">The counsel of the appellees contend, that the contract-in question is a legal and valid contract. That was never denied. It is admitted that the contract, in its inceptiony was a valid aad binding contract. The counsel have dig.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>played much learning on the subject of marriage settlements, and the principles governing them. In this case there is no marriage settlement to he considered by the Court. The contract is strictly a marriage contract, containing covenants by which all parties to it are hound. The doctrine of the right by limitation in marriage settlements, submitted, has no sort of application. The appellees do not pretend to claim the money in question by way of limitation, hut, as <em>cesluis que trust, </em>against the appellant as trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-5\">The bill charges, that the said sum of money passed into the hands of Isaac Michael, as trustee, charged with certain trusts. This averment is not sustainable by the terms of the contract, except so far as the appellant was constituted trustee for his wife, to protect and secure her rights to the interest of said sum of money, as her sole and separate property, she having lost all her legal rights by her marriage with appellant. This created the necessity of the interposition of the trustee for her. The doctrine of limitation, therefore, cannot apply in this case. This case rests entirely upon the covenant to pay a certain and specific sum of money, which is for a Court of Law, and not in confidence, which is for a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\">The next question submitted is, that this Court, as a Court of Equity, has no jurisdiction. This question of jurisdiction is an important question, and ought to be examined and settled deliberately, so as to prevent its recurrence in future cases. It would seem to be clearly settled by all the authorities, that if the appellees have a complete and adequate remedy at law, they have no rights in a Court of Equity, except in cases where Courts of Law and Equity have concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">1st. In this case the remedy at law is complete and adequate, and the aid of a Court of Equity cannot be necessary ; the remedy is as effectual and complete in a Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Law as in a Conrt of Equity. <em>Story\u2019s Eq.

Th# prayer of the bill is-, that the appellant be compelled by a decree of the Court to pay to the- complainants the sum of <em>$4,250-, </em>with interest thereon, \u00e1re-., and the decree of the Circuit Court is, \u201cthat the defendant pay, or bring into this Court to be paid, unto the complainants, the-sum of $4,250&gt; with interest thereon from the 28th day of February, 18fi8, until paid.\u201d &amp;c. There was certainly no necessity in this case to invoke the aid- of a Court of Equity, to decree the-payment of this fired and certain sum of money; a Court of Law could do- precisely the same thing without difficulty. Courts of Equity never will lend- their- aid where equity and justiee do not imperiously demaud it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">The counsel for the appellees contend, that there is nothing in the question- of jurisdiction ; that the question of jurisdiction was fully and clearly settled in- the case of <em>Caroline Morey, executrix of Catharine Michael, vs. Isaac Michael, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>227. How could the Court settle the question of jurisdiction- in this ease-? Th-is case-was mot then before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-6\">The Court only decided in that case-that the complainant was entitled to relief, upon her bill, to the extent of the interest due at the decease of Catherine Michael, without affirming.or reversing the decree below.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-7\">2nd.

The questions now submitted are mixed questions of law and fact, depending upon the evidence in the case. The true theory ef the complainants\u2019 case, as made by the bill, seems to be the specific execution of the contract in the c\u00e1se for the payment of the sum of mosey claimed. Assuming this to be the case, the complainants must come into this Court with clean hands-free front all taint \u2014 with a cause just and equitable in all its parts, free from all fraud, negligence and misconduct on 'the part of the claimants, or on tbe part of those under whom they claim, so as to satisfy the Court, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the application is fair, j-ust -and reasonable, in every respect.

They could have defeated her contingent claim, if they had pleased to have done so by rescinding and vacating the contract. Mrs. Michael could have defeated the pretended claim of the appellee, Caroline Morey, by executing the power ; she could have bequeathed said sum of money, claimed by the appellees, to any one she pleased,\u2014 even to her husband, and any misconduct of Mrs. Michael during coverture, amounting to a violation of the covenants and stipulations on her part, and a violation of the marital rights, would defeat all the pretended rights of the appellees under the covenants in the contract.

But when the intended husband is a party to the marriage contract there can he no question as to its legal validity, because there can he no room for any inquiry as to its fraudulent import. In such case he, by his own act, excludes all such inquiries, because he has ratified and adopted the contract as his own, with full knowledge of its import and design. <em>Atherly on Marriage Settlements, </em>27 <em>Law Library, </em>320, 321, 322. <em>Slocombe vs. Glubb, </em>2 <em>Brown\u2019s Ch.

Maryland chancery fully sustains this doctrine. In this case the appellant, Isaac Michael, was a party to the contract. He was no infant, but a sagacious man, and in full possession of all his mental powers. He was not operated upon by any fraudulent inducement, hut voluntarily sought the alliance with the said Catharine, and entered into the said contract with full knowledge of what he was about to do, and with full knowledge of the import and meaning of the contract and of all its trusts, limitations and provisions. There is nothing disclosed in this record which can in the slightest degree even tend to impugn the purity or legal validity of the contrast at the time it was entered into, between the parties. It must consequently be regarded as a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>bf binding force in law and in equity. And this would he the case even though the settlement had been made in favour of children by a former marriage <em>nominatim </em>and \u2022specifically. <em>Atherly, </em>27 <em>Law Library, </em>327.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">2nd. But the appellant insists, that the said Catharine, \u2022after marriage, violated her solemn contract of marriage without cause, and by her conduct rendered all the covenants contained in the said contract, to he performed after the death of the said Catharine, utterly hull and void, and that he is not bound in equity to comply with or perform any of the covenants in the said marriage contract not to he performed in the lifetime of the said Catharine. If the marriage contract was of legal validity and of binding force \u2022at the' consummation of the marriage, it clearly follows that the legal rights of those who could rightfully and legally claim under the limitations over contained in the said contract became fixed vested rights, subject only to be divested by the exercise of the disposing power reserved to to the said Catharine in her said marriage contract. In a former case, in the Court of Appeals, between these sam\u00e9 parties, it was settled that Mrs. Michael had only a life estate in the $4,250, and that she died without having \u25a0exercised her disposing power reserved to her in her marriage contract. <em>Caroline Morey, Ex\u2019trix of Catharine Michael, and her husband, Albert Morey, vs. Isaac Michael, </em>18 <em>Md.

The fixed vested rights of those who can legally and equitably claim under the limitations over contained in the said marriage contract, were not divested by the exercise of Catherine Michael\u2019s power of appointment, hut still remain fixed vested rights by the terms of the said contract, and from its date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\">If .this be so, and it cannot be controverted, how can the fixed vested rights of third parties be in any mode affected by the acts of Mrs. Michael ? Her conduct, whatever it \u00abnay have been., clearly cannot in equity or law invalidate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the clear fixed vested rights of those whose rights are vested under the trust and limitation over contained in th\u00a9 said contract. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., sec. </em>1420. 1 <em>Fonbl., Bk. </em>1, <em>ch. 2, note k.

It is further insisted upon by the appellant, \u201cthat under the true construction of the marriage contract, the complainants have no right to claim the $4,250, and the interest thereon, from the death of the said Catharine, under the limitation over contained in the said contract, to any child or children the said Catharine might leave, if more than one, equally between them, if hut one, that one to receive the whole of the said real and personal estate.\u201d The appellant insists that the covenant contained in the said limitation over, in the case of the non-execution of the power of disposition, in the true construction of the contract, had reference to the issue of the intended marriage, and not to any child of the said Catharine by a former marriage. Can this he sustained? We think not. To ascertain and determine the meaning and proper legal construction of the contrast, in a case like this, the terms of the contract as a whole, and the language employed to convey the intent of the parties, are carefully to he examined and interpreted according to their natural and legal import, and construed strictly, precisely as any other written contract or agreement ought to be construed under the rules of law and canons of construction. It will be observed that this is not a case where the Court of Chancery is called upon to enforce by its decree, articles of agreement for a marriage contract. Articles for a marriage contract are generally considered as nothing more than minutes, intended to specify in a concise mode the manner in which the parties intend the estate shall he limited. These articles for an intended contract are often carelessly drawn, and, therefore, to draw the actual final marriage settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ment and limitations in the words of the articles, or even according to their legal import and operation, the real intentions of the contracting parties would he often defeated. In such cases the great object of the Court is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to decree a strict settlement according to such intent. In aiming at the intent in such cases, the Courts are not confined to the strict rules of construction in interpreting the language employed by the parties, a more liberal rule is allowed, and the Courts will often resort to presumptions in favour of tho issue. <em>Atherly on Marriage Settlements, </em>27 <em>Law Library, </em>92. <em>Blenfer vs. Duke of Marlboro, 2 Atkins, </em>545. <em>Randall vs. Willis, </em>5 <em>Vesey, </em>275. Hence, where marriage articles construed according to their legal import, give the settler an estate tail, they will, generally speaking, be executed by the Court in strict settlement in favour of the issue, from presumed intent; therefore, if it is expressed in the articles that the estate shall be settled upon the husband and the heirs of his body, either general or special, a strict settlement will be decreed, though there is nothing in the articles expressly indicating that such was the intention. <em>Atherly, </em>27 <em>Law </em>Library, 93. <em>Highway vs. Benner, </em>1 <em>Bro. C. C., </em>384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">But where the contract is an actual, complete and final marriage contract, made before marriage and without any previous articles, a different rule of construction prevails. In such cases the agreement embracing the final, complete settlement as intended by the parties themselves, must be construed strictly, according to the strict legal rules of construction. In such cases there is no room for presumptions. The parties themselves have embodied in their own agreement their true intentions as conveyed by the language they have employed according to their natural legal import. If, therefore, by a settlement before marriage without articles, the estate is limited to the use of or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>trust for the settler for life, with remainder to the use of or in trust for the heirs of his body, he will he considered as a tenant in tail, though under articles so expressed, he would he considered as tenant for life only. <em>Atherly, </em>27 <em>Law Library, </em>151, 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-5\">Now the case under consideration is not the case of articles for a marriage contract, but one where the parties, previous to their marriage, entered into a full, complete and final marriage contract, fully executed, and all the settlements and limitations according to their intentions as conveyed by the strict, natural and legal import of the language they employed ; in such a case the strict rule of construction must prevail, and the trusts and limitations en-grafted in the said contract, carried out and executed according to the intention of the parties, not from any presumption, but from the natural, legal import of the \u201ccontract itself.\u201d In a former case between these parties, as has already been stated, the Court of Appeals determined that Mrs. Michael died without having exercised her disposing power, and as a consequence the right of the parties, under the limitations over in the said marriage contract, was not divested, but remains in full force as limited in the said contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-6\">It is under these limitations over, contained in the said contract, that the complainants base their claim in the case made by their bill of complaint, as Mrs. Michael did not exercise her disposing power of appointment. The question then is, do the limitations over in the said contract embrace the complainant, Caroline M. Morey, as the only child Mrs. Michael did leave at the time of her death, upon the true legal construction of the said marriage contract?</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b267-7\">There can be no doubt that Mrs. Michael could have made the said limitations over in favor of the anticipated issue of her marriage with the complainant, to the exclusion of the child of her former marriage, or she could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>made the said limitations over in favor of the child! of Tier-former marriage in exclusion of any anticipated issue by-her marriage with the appellant, and the limitations over-in either ease wouldf have been good in law and in equity. But she did not do so. For it must he observed, that there-is no express limitation in the eontraet to any class of children, as a class, either to the children of the marriage or to any child she- had* by a former marriage. The language-is general, and by its natural legal import will embrace-any child of Mrs. Michael, either by a former- marriage or by the appellant, as the- case may be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">4th. But the appellant, in his answer, denies the Jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery to grant relief in the case-made by the Bill of complaint, although the appellees may have a rightful elairn to the fund, and insists that they have a clear remedy at law. The question then is, has the Court of Chancery jurisdiction in the case made by tbe bill?'\" The appellee insists, that tbe jurisdiction in such a case is-undoubted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdZ\">The case arises upon an ante-nuptial contract and springs out of its true construction.

In what respect the averment of the bill can he regarded as insufficient, is for the appellant to show.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b269-4\">Bowie, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEh7\">delivered the \u00a9pinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The contract, the true construction and legal effect of which is the subject of the present appeal, was before this 'Court in the ease of <em>Morey, Ex\u2019tx of Michael, vs. Michael, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>228, brought up by appeal of the appellee, \u2018Caroline, as executrix of Catharine Michael, from a decree \u2022dismissing the hill on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">That suit was presented by her as executrix, and the demurrer overruled by this Court, upon the ground that \u2022although the will executed by Mrs. Michael, was not a good execution of the power, as to the principal sum covenanted to he paid by Isaac Michael, yet the interest accruing during the coverture, was the sole and separate estate of \u2022the wife, which she might bequeath independently, of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In the argument of that case, a prominent point on the part of the appellee was, as in this, that the appellant\u2019s remedy, if any, was in a Court of Law, and not in equity ; \u25a0that the only object of tbe hill was to recover a specific sum \u2022of money, and interest upon a covenant to pay. In other words, it was a contract for the payment of money to be \u2022enforced at law, not a trust resting in confidence, of which equity had cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">It became necessary, therefore, in deciding that point, \u2022which went to the .jurisdiction of the Court, and which,&lt;5f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tenable, would have compelled this Court to sustain tbe demurrer, to examine the character of the instrument exhibited with the bill, (which is the same now exhibited by the appellees with their bill,) and determine ,the rights of those claiming under it, particularly the relation of the appellee in that case (now the appellant) to the principal fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The views of the Court on this point are thus expressed, \u201cThe appellee took the legal title to the property under the contract, with limitations against any beneficial use or interest in himself, and a determination of the character of his relation to it will decide the question of jurisdiction presented by the demurrer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201cAlthough the contract in some respects is inartificially drawn, it is clear that the intent of the parties to it was, to fix upon the appellee a fiduciary possession of the fund assigned, and create a trust by which the purpose of the testatrix as to its beneficial use and ultimate destination would be accomplished.\u201d The creation of a trust depends upon intention, and when expressions used manifest an intention that the grantee or donee of property is not to have the beneficial use, but is to hold it for the benefit of another, he will be considered as a trustee holding the legal title for the beneficial owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>gift or grant of property to a grantee or donee, to be applied to a certain use or purpose, fastens a trust on the holding of the legal estate.\u201d <em>Hill on </em>Trustees, 65. 2 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>335. 7 <em>Eng. L. &amp; E. Rep., </em>134. 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>505. In this case, we think the appellee took the property assigned by the contract <em>as a fund, </em>with the interest as it might or should accrue- in the lifetime of the testatrix, encumbered with a trust, and <em>notwithstanding the form of his obligation in reference to it, relief in equity may be had for any failure or default on his part in its execution.\u201d </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>240, 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Although this point may not have been as fully argued m the former case as in the present, yet it cannot he said that the decision just cited was <em>\u201cobiter dictum,\u201d </em>as the question was directly involved in the issues of law raised by the demurrer to tho bill, and the mind of the Court was directly drawn to and distinctly expressed upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We consider this construction of the instrument in question conclusive on this point, not because it was made in a suit between the same persons hut different parties, but because the point was \u201cinvestigated with care and considered in its fullest extent,\u201d which is all that is necessary in this State to render a decision binding as a precedent. <em>Alexander vs. Worthington, </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>488, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The jurisdiction of this Court being established, the second point raised by the appellants is, that the appellee, Caroline, is not a <em>cestui que trust </em>under the ante-nuptial contract, which should be construed to embrace only a <em>child </em>or children of the marriage which the said Catharine might leave at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">This construction is based upon the assumption, that there is no allegation in the hill, or evidence in the cause, that Isaac Michael knew his intended wife had any child living at the time of their entering into the^contract, and the fact that the ante-nuptial contract does not refer to any such person specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">It must he conceded, there is no reference to the fact of a prior marriage on the part of Mrs. Catharine Michael, or of her being a mother, in the agreement referred to, hut the hill expressly charges, she was a widow and had an only child of tender years dependent on her, and the answer of the appellant admits the complainant, Caroline, is the child of Catharine by a former marriage, and there was no issue by her second husband. With these facts, it would be a most unnatural as well as forced construction, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>would confine the general terms of an ante-nuptial contract, which are broad enough to include all the children of the covenantee or <em>cestui que </em>trust, to those only she might <em>thereafter </em>have, and thus exclude the issue of the first marriage from all benefit of the estate of her mother, previously acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The complainant is clearly within the letter as well as the spirit of the contract, as indicated by the circumstances \u25a0of the contracting parties. The appellant\u2019s answer insists, that Catharine Michael violated all the stipulations of the marriage contract without any cause whatever, which he is \u2022advised renders all the covenants and stipulations, to be performed after the death of the said Catharine, utterly null and void, and that he is not, in equity, bound to comply with or perform any of the covenants in said contract not to be performed in the .lifetime of the said Catharine. This position is not, in our judgment, sustained by reason or the weight of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Although the articles of agreement between Michael and Baker recite that a marriage is about to be entered into by and between the parties, \u201cand in consideration thereof\u201d the parties agreed to enter into the following covenants \u25a0and stipulations, it is also recited, \u201cFirst,1 the said Catharine Baker, being possessed in her own right of money, etc., to the amount of $4,250, doth transfer, assign and convey the same to the said Isaac Michael,\u201d and the said Isaac Michael, in consideration of said sum, \u201cdoth covenant and agree ito pay, etc., in default of appointment to any child or children she may leave.\u201d It also appears from the said articles, that Catharine Baker owned and occupied a house and lot in Middletown, the rents and profits of which it was agreed she should receive during coverture, for her \u00a1separate use, with power to sell the same and invest the proceeds as she may direct, for her sole and .separate use. And the said Michael covenanted and agreed, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>said.seal estate, or any other she might purchase during the coverture, she might bequeath, or the proceeds thereof, and in default of appointment that such real estate shall descend to, and bo distributed among, any children she may leave, if more than one ; if only one child, that such child shall receive the whole personal estate and real estate which she, the said Catharine, may leave ; and it was further agreed, that nothing In said articles contained shall debar the said Catharine Baker from any right which she may acquire by virtue of her intermarriage with the said Michael, either in the real or personal estate of said Isaac Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The articles show, that the intended wife was possessed in her own right of both personal and real estate, the right of disposing of which she was determined to secure, notwithstanding . her marriage, without surrendering her rights in the real and personal estate of her intended husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">They further show the real estate and the proceeds thereof, were to descend to, or be distributed among, any children she might leave, and if only one, that child should receive the whole personal estate and real estate that Catharine Baker might leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">It would be impossible to imagine that terms so clear and comprehensive as these, would not include the only child of her first marriage <em>; </em>and if they received such construction when applied to the real estate, why adopt a different construction of words nearly identical, when speaking of the personal? It might justly he contended, also, that the words annexed to the covenant relating to the real estate, being subsequent to all others, are broad enough to include, and do include expressly, the whole personal and real estate which Catharine Baber might leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The consideration of marriage is a valuable consideration, and not only sustains covenants in favor of the wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and the issue of the marriage,\u2018but also covenants for settlements in favor of children of a former marriage as a moral consideration. <em>Cruise, Tit. </em>32, <em>sec. </em>752, <em>Vol. Greenleaf Ed. </em>The children are regarded as purchasers. They may enforce the obligations of the contracting parties, notwithstanding the non-performance of mutual stipulations on the other side, unless they are conditional and dependent covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Although the defaulting party may not, in some instances, be allowed to enforce the articles specifically, the children, the innocent objects of parental solicitude and care, are entitled to all the benefit of the uses under the settlement, notwithstanding there has been a failure on one side. <em>Macqueen on Husband and Wife, sec. </em>3, <em>Title \u201cAnte-nuptial .agreements,\u201d </em>and oases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">These reasons include as well the issue of\u00b0a former as a subsequent marriage. There can be no equity in inflicting upon the only child of a former marriage, dependent on its mother for support in whose behalf provision was made in anticipation of a second marriage, the penalty of forfeiture because of the subsequent misconduct of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In the case of <em>Sydney vs. Sydney, </em>where the bill was filed by the wife for specific performance of marriage articles, and the defence was, she had withdrawn herself from her husband, lived separately from him and very much misbehaved herself, although there was a violent presumption of adultery, the Lord Chancellor Talbot held, that \u201cthe articles being that the husband shall settle such and Such lands in certainty on his wife for her jointure, this is pretty much in the nature of an actual and vested jointure ; in regard to what is covenanted for a good consideration to be done, is considered in equity as done, consequently this is a jointure and not forfeitable,, either by adultery or elopement, and it was decided that the husband should perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>his marriage articles.\u201d 3 <em>P.

Such are the cases cited. 1 <em>Roper on Husband &amp; Wife, </em>215. <em>Carr vs. Eastbrooke, </em>4 <em>Ves. </em>146.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Roper remarks, \u201cit may he inferred from <em>Bell &amp; Montgomery, </em>that though the Court may not make a settlement on the wife when living in adultery, yet it will secure her trust property for the benefit of the survivor or her children.\u201d This principle is recognized in many of the cases. There is no pretence here, however, of any misconduct on the part of the wife, greater than the use of intemperate language, and separation from her husband because of unhappy domestic circumstances. There is no ground for any imputation upon her purity as a wife. She maintained reputable associates, notwithstanding her separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\n<em>Decree below affirmed, with costs to the appellees.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
