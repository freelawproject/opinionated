That afterwards, ou the 13th of November, 1857, Martha agreed to sell the laud to your orator for $3,000, and he agreed to purchase it at that price solely iu order to secure said sum of $850, no part thereof having been paid or secured to him, as he did not desire to become the purchaser of the property, and was urged to do so by said Martha, who - represented she had no means of paying him except by a sale of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>to him, and that on that day he executed to her his four promissory notes for the sum of $500 each, and it was agreed that the said $850 was to he considered as paid by your orator as so much of the purchase money, and the said Martha, on that day, executed and delivered to your orator a deed for the land, a copy of which is tiled with the bill, she being then about to go to the State of Illinois ; that having returned in a short time, she and her husband pretending that her deed to your orator was void because her husband had not united in its execution, undertook to sell the land to one-Peter Baumgardner, a brother-in-law of said Jeremiah, for $4,000, and actually conveyed the land to him by deed dated the 28th of May, 1S58, and have him put in possession thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">The bill then charges, that at the time of this pretended sale, Baumgardner knew perfectly well both that the said sum of $850 had been paid Jby your orator to the trustee on account of the purchase money of said land, and that no part of it had been paid by said Martha or her husband, or either of them, except by the sale of said land to your orator by said Martha as aforesaid, and also that the land had been sold and conveyed to your orator by said Martha as aforesaid, and that the deed from her to him had, long prior to that time, been duly recorded among the land records of Frederick county.

whereas, in fact and in truth, he has paid no value for the same, and holds them in trust for .the use of the said Martha and her husband, and so that Baumgardner may pretend that he is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser and liable to said Shaw as assignee for the balance of the purchase money not paid over to said Martha or her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">The bill then calls for answers on oath to these allegations, and to special interrogatories fully stated, and prays that the said sum of f850 may he declared and decreed to be a lien on said land, or that your orator is entitled to a resulting use to the amount of said sum and interest thereon, and that the said land may be sold for the payment thereof, or that said Baumgardner may he decreed to pay to your orator the same out of the purchase money yet due from him for said land, and deduct the same from the amount so due by him, and that said Martha or her bus-band, or whichever of them has the same in possession, may be compelled to surrender the notes given by your orator to said Martha for said purchase money, to be can-celled as to your Honor may seem just;

She had, .therefore, the power to eharge this land with her agreements or contracts, and the party with whom she contracts \u00abcan enforce in equity such contracts against her separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>estate, provided the agreement on its face shows the intent to charge the estate, or if there is evidence <em>aliunde </em>proving such intent. Here there is evidence., express and overwhelming, of the intent of Mrs. Shaner to charge this land thus purchased and conveyed to her with the payment of this claim of the appellant. <em>Cooke vs </em>Husbands, 11 <em>Md.

Though it may be true as a general proposition, as. in <em>Clabaugh vs. Byerly, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>362, that a mero <em>parol </em>agreement to execute a mortgage, when denied by the mortgagor, cannot be enforced in equity because of the Statute of Frauds, yet it is equally clear, lhat such an agreement, when confessed by the answer or when part performed, is taken out of the operation of the statute, and will he enforced against the party making it, and all those claiming under him who have actual no'ice, or could be presumed to have notice thereof. Here the agreement to execute a mortgage is not only confessed by Jeremiah Shauer in his answer, but'he says, such a mortgage was in fact prepared in writing, hut for some reason was not accepted. The proof also shows, that the purchaser, Baumgardner, had notice of all the -matters connected with the purchase of this land fully sufficient to put him on inquiry \u00ae,s to whether such an agreement existed or not. The proof also shows that a gross fraud would be allowed to be perpetrated if the relief here sought should be refused. <em>Clabaugh vs. Byerly, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>362. 1 <em>Sug.

M. Palmer </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">1st. The charges in the complainant\u2019s hill do not very clearly and distinctly disclose ttie real relief he seeks. The prayer of the hill is certainly very multifarious in its character, and it is the duty of the appellant to define the real object he has in view, to enable this Court to extend to him any relief. The Circuit Court dismissed his bill, because it did not appear from the charges in the bill, and the evidence in the case, that he was entitled to any relief, and it is insisted that the judgment of the Circuit Court was correct. If the complainant has any right or claim in the case, which he can enforce against anyb &gt;dy, or in any Court, it is for the payment of the sum of eight hundred and fifty dollars, which he claims to have loaned or advanced to Jeremiah Shauer and his wife, about the 1st of May, 1857, and the interest due thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-8\">We will assume then, after a careful examination of all the facts and circumstances of the case, that the real object of the appellant is to recover the sum of $850, and interest thereon, from somebody, without much regard from whom, or the means used to obtain it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-9\">It is a trite saying, that \u201call persons who come into a Court of Equity, seeking equity, must come with clean hands, untarnished and unsoiled with iniquity of any kind, and with a case fair, just and equitable in all its parts, and free from fraud of any kind.\u201d This is a sound common sense rule of equity, never to be departed from. <em>Stoddard et al. vs. Bowie, </em>5 <em>Md. </em>Rep., 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-10\">Can it be said that this complainant came into the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>of Equity seeking its aid, \u201cwith hands untarnished .and perfectly clean? with a case just,, fair and equitable in all its parts?\u2019\u2019 I think not. His own account, as averred in his bill, of his conduct with Mrs. Shaner in November, 1857, while she was on her way to a distaut State, in the absence and out of the presence of her husband, without a friend or protector to guard her rights, must certainly awaken the suspicions of the Court that, some fraud and unfairness was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-5\">The answer of Jeremiah Shaner, the husband, one of the defendants, in response to that statement in the bill, is a fair exposition of the motives of appellant. His object was sordid speculation, not justice. He never had claimed or demanded of Shaner and-wife the execution of said pretended parol agreement, to execute the mortgage to secure the eight hundred and fifty dollars. That was not what he wanted. He wanted to obtain the land at half its real value. That was his motive, as is clearly disclosed by the record in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-6\">But, it is said, the appellant is justly entitled to recover the $850, &amp;c., which he loaned and advanced to Shaner and wife; but the question is, how is he to obtain it? Certainly not in this Court as a Court of Equity, for he has no standing in a Court of Equity, from his own showing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-7\">He had, and now has, a full, complete and adequate remedy at law against Jeremiah Shaner, if he has not lost it by his negligence and fraudulent conduct. Whether or not he has lost, his remedy at law, is not now for this Court to decide. The money was loaned or advanced to Jeremiah Shaner and wife, they were both present at the time, he acquiesced in and sanctioned the loan, and the advancement of the money, and promised to secure it by a mortgage, and was clearly liable at law for its payment. Dotlerar, himself, proves this fact, and it is a fact in this case which cannot be denied. But the contract on the part of the wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>was utterly null and void, both in a Court of Law and in a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">It is a well settled principle in this State that all the contracts of a married woman, as a general rule, are void and not binding. She cannot convey her property unless by virtue of some special law, authorizing her to do so. All other contracts of a <em>ferae covert </em>are null and void, as well at law as in equity, and she cannot ho compelled to perform them, except for property which she holds for her separate use and benefit, free from her husband\u2019s marital rights. <em>Burton et al. vs. Marshall, </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>493. <em>Norris vs. Lantz &amp; Hyde, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>260. Judge Cochran in delivering the opinion of the Court, uses the following strong language, \u201cExcept in regard to the separate property of a <em>feme covert, </em>all her covenants, contracts and agreements in Courts of Law as well as of equity, are absolutely null and void, and she is under no obligation, and cannot be compelled to perform them, whether entered into by herself or on her behalf by ber husband without his consent.\u201d The property in that ease belonged to Mrs. Hyde, but was subject to the marital rights of the husband, and was not the separate property of the wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\">In this case, Martha Ann Shaner had no property which she held for her separate use and benefit, free from the marital rights of her husband, and she never had, so far as the recoid in the case discloses any such fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">The question, as to whether the appellant had a full, complete and adequate remedy at law against Jeremiah Shaner for the eight hundred and fifty dollars, can hardly be a delateahle question in this State. <em>Crane vs. Gough, </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>317. <em>Oliver vs. Palmer &amp; Hamilton, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>448. \u201cThe constant incroachments of the jurisdietiou of the Com Is of Equity ought to he resisted, because it is a jmisdiction confessedly inferior to the Courts of Common Law jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Richardson vs. Stillinger, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>480.

The counsel for the appellant have submitted to the Court three legal propositions to show that the judgment of the Circuit Court, in dismissing complainant\u2019s bill, was erroneous, and ought to be reversed. I contend that neither proposition can he sustained, by authority, upon the facts and circumstances of the case. The first point is, that the real estate in question, which Martha Ann Shaner purchased of Josiah Dotterar, and by him conveyed to her, is an estate for her separate use, free from the marital rights of her husband, and chargeable with the payment of the eight hundred and fifty dollars, loaned and advanced to Jeremiah Shaner and wife jointly. There ,are no facts in the case to sustain such a proposition. The law upon the subject is very clear and well settled, as appears from the authorities cited by the learned counsel, hut they have no applic\u00e1fcion to the case under consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">The facts in this case do not show that Martha Ann Shaner, at the time of the joint contract withher husband for the loan and advancement of the eight hundred and fifty dollars, did own any property for her sole and separate use,- independent of her husband\u2019s marital rights, or that she ever held or owned any such property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">If the complainant cannot show clearly and indisputably that the real estate in question was her. sole and separate property, free from the marital rights of the husband, there is nothing upon which this Court, as a Court of Equity, can act. The contracts of a married woman, as general rule, are void and not binding upon her person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ally, either in law or equity ; but such contracts are binding upon her property which she owns and holds for her separate use and benefit, if it clearly appears from the evidence in the case, that when she made the agreement, she had reference to her separate estate, and intended to charge it by the contract, and provided the contract he o\u00ed such a nature as to bind her individually in equity. This is the settled law of this State. It is admitted, that so far as her separate property is concerned, if she have any, she is considered as a <em>feme sole.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">But Martha Ann Shaner had no property for her separate use and benefit, at least it does not so appear from the facts in the record of this ease. Notwithstanding, the appellant\u2019s counsel insist, that the land purchased by Martha Arm Shaner of Dotterar became the sole'and separate property of the said Martha Ann, free from the marital rights of the husband, and liable to be charged with the eight hundred and fifty dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">That question depends entirely upon the terms and legal construction of the deed under which she holds the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">If it was intended that the grantee should have a sole and separata estate, free from the marital rights of her husband, it should have been so expressed and provided for in the deed, in language clear, certain and unequivocal, so as to free the question of all possible doubt. This is the language of all the authorities on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-8\">Such a claim or right on the part of a married woman, being against the common right, the instrument under which it is created must clearly speak the donor\u2019s intention, to bar the husband, else it cannot be allowed. <em>Clancy on the Rights of Married Women, </em>262, 263.\u201d It is not sufficient that there he a gift for the wife\u2019s benefit, or a direction to pay the money into her own hands, for there is nothing in ibis inconsistent with the marital rights. But there must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>be a direction that it shall be for her sole, separate and independent nse, or in other equivalent terms, showing a manifest intention to exclude the husband.\u201d <em>Taylor vs. Lake, </em>2 <em>Russ. &amp; Myl., </em>183 to 187. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., secs. </em>1381 and 1382. <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>420, 421, and cases re\u00b0 ferred to.

But we will suppose for a moment that Mrs. Shaner did own the property in question as her sole and separate estate, the appellant has no standing in this Court from his own showing, for indeed he has a complete remedy without the aid of this Court as a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">The law is well settled, and indeed it is admitted la%-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that a married woman as regards her separate property, is to all intents and purposes a <em>feme sole, </em>with full power to sell and dispose of at her will and pleasure, all her separate property. Mrs. Shaner exercised this right and power by selling and conveying the real estate in question to the appellant himself, which deed of conveyance was recorded and a copy of which forms a part of the proceedings in this case, having been filed by the appellant as a part of his claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">What more can the appellant want? According to the theory of his counsel, he has got the very thing that from the beginning he has been seeking to obtain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">Let the appellant bring his action of ejectment and try his title, and that will test the question as to the true character of the deed from Dotterar to Mrs. Shaner, and whether she took an estate for ber sole and separate use, free from the marital rights of her husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">It is not charged in complainant\u2019s bill, that Mrs. Shaner, at the time she entered into the joint agreement or contract with her husband to borrow eight hundred and fifty dollars of appellant, owned any property for her separate use and benefit, and if it was so charged, there is not a particle of evidence in the record to prove it. But suppose the property in question was her separate property, as contended for, there is no evidence in the ease that the appellant has any debt or claim against Mrs. Shaner which can properly he charged upon her separate estate, upon equitable principles, even if she owned separate estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">The counsel for the appellant, to sustain their first point, have referred to sundry Maryland decisions. The correctness of these decisions is not questioned. They certainly present a fair exposition of the law on this subject, hut they do not sustain the proposition of the learned counsel, they strongly tend the other way, as it will he found after a careful examination of them,</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Koontz vs. Nabb, </em>16 <em>Md. Rep., </em>549, is a case in which an attempt was made to enforce a debt of a married woman against her sole and separate property, and the Court decreed against the complainant upon a sound and clearly defined principle, that is, \u201ca married woman having a separate estate, cannot affect that separate estate, unless the obligation sought to be enforced present upon its face \u2022some evidence of the intent to charge the estate, or there be evidence <em>aliunde </em>tending to prove such intent.\u201d The opinion of the. Court in that case was prepared with great ability, and with legal accuracy and precision. The case of <em>Koontz vs. Nabb, </em>is strongly fortified by 11 <em>Md Rep., </em>492. 1 <em>Md. Ch. Rep., </em>212. 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>296. 12 G. <em>&amp; J., </em>236.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-4\">These cases all teach us that two facts must appear to the Court to be clearly and positively proved, before a Court of Equity will lend its aid to take the sole and separate estate \u25a0of a married woman to pay her debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-5\">1st. It must be positively proved by legal and proper evidence, that the property sought to be taken is, in truth, the sole and separate property of the married woman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">2nd. The debt or contract attempted to be enforced against the separate estate of a married woman, must have been made and entered into by her with a clear intent that it should be binding upon her separate estate, and that the claimant has no remedy at law to recover the money he seeks to charge on such separate estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">The question, whether the real property in question was the sole and separate property of Mrs. Shaner, depends \u2022entirely upon the terms and wording of the deed of Dotterar to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">There is another insuperable objection to the appellant\u2019s \u25a0claim for relief. The complainant does not charge in his bill, specifically, what debt or claim he seeks to charge \u00abupon the separate estate of Mrs. Shaner, which should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>been done to entitle him to relief. The Court is not informed from anything in the record, what particular debt is claimed as a charge on the pretended separate estate. Is it the note for $850, executed by Mrs. Shaner the 10th of November, 1857, that is claimed as a charge upon her separate estate? If so, the claim cannot be sustained, for there is no evidence to show for what the note was given, or the intention of Mss. Shaner in giving it, and there is nothing upon the face of the note to show any intention, &amp;c. The case of <em>Komtzva. Nabb, </em>settles this question. Is it, then, the contract of May, 1857, entered into by Shaner and wife jointly, with the appellant, fos* the loan of eight hundred and fifty dollars, that is sought to he charged on Mrs. Shaner\u2019s separate estate, because the appellant has no remedy at law ? If that he the claim, the appellant cannot haye any standing in this Court. Mrs. Shaner\u2019s separate property is not, upon any principle, to be charged with that debt. That was the contract of Jeremiah Shaner, and he was responsible for the money, and the appellant had a full, complete and adequate remedy at law for its recovery. The contract on the part of the wife was null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">I am satisfied that no case can he found in any hook of authority, where the separate property of a married woman has been charged in a Court of Equity with the payment of a debt or claim created by joint contract of husband and wife, unless it he in a case where the husband is proved to \"be utterly insolvent, and the wife entered into the contract with the intention to hind her separate estate on that account. In this case, Jeremiah Shaner has always admitted his liability and willingness to pay, and his ability to pay is not questioned, ana cannot be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">It would indeed he a very hard case if Baumgardner* should he deprived of his property, for which he paid its foil value, under such circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>3rd. The second proposition of the appellant cannot be sustained, for the real question involved in it was decided in the case of <em>Clabaugh vs. Birely, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>362. That case is in fact and principle very much like this. In that case the Court' decided that a mere parol agreement to execute a mortgage could not be enforced in a Court of Equity because of the Statute of Frauds. That certainly cannot now be considered a debateable question in this State, or anywhere else where the \u201cStatute of Frauds\u201d is in force. The learned counsel on the other side, however, admits the correctness of the principle as a general proposition, but he contends that there are exceptions to it, and that this case forms an exception to the general rule. He contends that if the parol agreement is confessed or admitted by the defendant in his answer, or where there is a part performance of the parol contract, that takes the case out of the operation of the Statute of Frauds. That as a general rule is correct, but there is nothing, in this case to give the rule any application. There is another general principle equally as sound, which must govern this case, that is, \u201cthe answer of one defendant in a case shall not be read in evidence against another defendant.\u201d <em>Gresley Ev., </em>29, <em>(note.) Jones vs. Torbervell, 2 Ves. Jur., </em>11. 4 <em>Brown Ch. Ca., </em>115. <em>Morse vs. Royal, </em>12 <em>Ves., </em>361. 1 <em>Greenlf.

Suppose he did admit the agreement to execute the mortgage, that cannot have any effect upon the rights of Mrs. Shaner and Baumgardner, and it cannot be used in evidence against them for any purpose. They have not admitted the parol agreement, or any other agreement to execute a mortgage. The real object of the appellant is to reach the said real property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the possession of Baumgardner, <em>alona fide </em>purchaser, without notice to him of any such agreement or contract on the part of Shaner and wife to execute a mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">The bill does not charge that Baumgardner, at the time he purchased the property, had notice of any agreement or contract, that Shaner and wife had agreed to execute a mortgage to the appellant to secure the payment of the sum of $850 on the property in-question, and if there were such a charge of notice in the hill, there is no evidence in the record to prove it. Baumgardner is charged with notice that the appellant had loaned or advanced to Shaner and wife eight hundred and fifty dollars to pay the last payment for said land, she having paid the first payment in some way, and Baumgardner the second payment as her security. But it is not charged he had notice of the contract for a mortgage. The appellant has an insnrmountahle difficulty to contend with in this case. The pretended contract by Shaner and wife with the appellant, to execute a mortgage on the property to secure the said sum of eight hundred and fifty dollars, for two reasons, was utterly null and void: 1st, it was void, being by parol, under the Statute of Frauds ; second, because all contracts, of married women, as a general rule, are void. The true principle to he extracted from all the cases is this: \u201cThe agreement of a \u2018 <em>feme covert\u201d </em>with the consent of hor husband for the sale of her real estate, is absolutely void at law, and a Court of Equity will never enforce such a contract against her. 2 <em>Kent\u2019s </em>Com., 168, 170. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Equity, secs. </em>733 to 736. <em>Emery vs. Ware, </em>8 <em>Ves., </em>814. <em>Davis vs. Jones, </em>4 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul., </em>207. <em>Jannes vs. </em>Jackson, 16 <em>Ves., </em>367. <em>Martin vs. Mitchell, 2 Jacobs &amp; Walker, </em>425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">In the case, 2 <em>Jac. &amp; </em>Walker, the Master of the Rolls uses this strong language : \u201cThe acts of a married woman with respect of her estate are perfectly void, she has, as said by the Master of the Rolls, in <em>Wright vs. Raller, 2 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Ves., </em>676, no disposing power, though she may have a disposing mind. This agreement signed by her with her husband cannot affect her estate, and cannot give the party a right to call upon her in a Court of Equity to execute a conveyance to bar her, if she survives, and to bind her inheritance.\u201d This is the settled law upon the subject. The-appellant has not a shadow of claim either against Mrs. Shaner or Baumgardner. In a case where- a <em>feme covert </em>owns real estate for her separate and sole use, with power to sell and dispose of it, the law is different. Jeremiah Shaner was unquestionably hound for the said eight hundred and fifty dollars, hut not in a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">4th. The third proposition of the appellant is certainly one not very easily solved, as applied to this case. The counsel say that the \u201ccomplainant is also entitled to relief upon the ground of an implied or resulting trust, having furnished his money as part payment of the purchase money for the land.\u201d The authorities referred to, to sustain the proposition, are not denied, but the proposition itself, as applied to this case, is new and novel, and I dare not risk any comment upon it, not having heard any lucid explanation of it by the learned counsel <em>on </em>the other side. There certainly is not one fact in the case to justify any such proposition, so far as I understand the record. <em>Hill on Trustees, 92, </em>95, 97, <em>and cases there cited.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-6\">Weisel, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhO\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The deed by Josiah Dotterer to Martha Ann Shaner, exhibited with the bill in this case, was executed on the 17th of October, 1857, and without any terms to constitute the real estate therein conveyed, her sole and separate estate, she beiDg a <em>feme covert. </em>The Acts of Assembly of 1842, ch. 293, and 1853, ch. 245, which govern this case, did not invest her with a separate estate in the property so as to exclude the marital rights, of the husband. This con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Stmetion has been distinctly and repeatedly settled by this Court. <em>Schindel vs. </em>Schindel, 12 <em>Md. Rep., </em>122, 312, 313. <em>Bridges &amp; Woods vs. McKenna, </em>14 <em>Md. Rep., </em>266. <em>Mut. Ins. Co. vs. Deale, </em>18 <em>Md. Rep., 47. Weems vs. Weems, </em>19 <em>Md. Rep., </em>345.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Such being the nature of her title, no question can arise as to her power to affect or charge it by any contract or agreement of her own. It is only in regard to the <em>separate property </em>of a/eme <em>covert </em>that she can make a contract that equity would recognize and enforce. 4 <em>Gill, </em>487. 18 <em>Md. Rep., </em>269.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">But the object of the bill, as shown by its frame-work and the proof taken to support it, is to charge the property with a resulting trust in favor of the appellant, by reason of his supplying $850 to Mrs. Shaner to complete the purchase money due by her to Dotterer, or with an equitable mortgage based on the parol promise and agreement of Mrs. Shaner and her husband, when he paid the $850, that he should he fully secured by a lien on the land, either by mortgage or in some other form, as might he deemed most effectual. Such is the averment of the hill, and one of the prayers is, that the said sum may be declared and decreed to be a lien on -the said land, or a resulting trust in favor of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">It was conceded, and cannot be denied, that a mere parol agreement to execute a mortgage of -real estate, cannot 'be enforced in equity because of the Statute of Frauds. But it was insisted, that when such an agreement is confessed by the answer, or has been performed in part, it is taken out of the operation of the statute, and will he enforced against the party making it, and all those claiming under him who had actual notice, or could he presumed to have notice of it, and that the answer of Shaner and the proof in the canse, are sufficient to place this case within the -exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The authorities before cited upon the subject of contracts by <em>femes covert, </em>establish the principle, that except as to her separate estate, any contract by the wife, made by her or by her husband, with or without her consent, is absolutely null and void, and she cannot be compelled to perform it. This principle, however, is to yield to any statutory mode for enabling married women to contract, or to bind or bar their interests in real estate. <em>Morris vs. Harris, </em>9 <em>Gilt, </em>28. <em>Johns vs. Reardon, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>470.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Even if this principle did not stand in the way of the appellant\u2019s claim to relief, the bill must charge the party to be affected by the decree with notice of the contract, and the proof must sufficiently sustain the averment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The bill in this case, while it charges Baumgardner (the purchaser of the land from Shaner and wife,) with knowledge of the loan to or payment for them of the $850, does not aver his knowledge of the alleged agreement to mortgage or give a lien on the land to secure its re-payment. Nor does the proof establish such knowledge in him, and his answer expressly denies it. The witnesses ( and they were all produced on the part of the complainant, Six,) testify as to Baumgardner\u2019s knowledge of the loan, but none of them prove that he knew of the alleged promise to give a lien. What was deposed to by Fuss and Merring conveys a mere suspicion of such knowledge on his part, while Shorb\u2019s testimony proves the want of it. It is also to be noted .that none of the interrogatories to which the witnesses deposed, specifically elicited their knowledge on this particular point of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We do not think that any resulting trust is established by the facts or circumstances of this case. It does not fall within the general principle of a purchase by one for and with the money of another, or any of its exceptions. It is the case of a loan of a sum of money to a vendee in her own name and for her own purposes and use, to eke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>out a \"balance due on the purchase, with a promise or under the expectation of being secured. The mode in which he sought the security by a purchase of the land himself from the wife alone, under the circumstances adverted to in the proceedings, and his alleged refusal to accept a mortgage when tendered, do not place him in a favorable attitude in a Court of Equity.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b455-8\">( Decided March 5th, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The answers deny all fraud and combination charged in the bill against the several defendants, and there is no proof of any.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The decree below simply dismissed the bill with costs, without noticing the several injunctions in the case. Those against Shaw and Baumgardner should he dissolved, but that against Jeremiah Shaner and Martha Ann Shaner to restrain them from assigning or transferring the four promissory notes for $500 each, given on the 10th day of ISTovember, 1857, by the appellant to said Martha Ann, as alleged in the bill, should be made perpetual, and the said notes should he decreed to he delivered to the said appellant to be cancelled. The appellees should however he allowed their costs. We will affirm the decree below dismissing the bill, except so far as it may affect the said injunction against Shaner and wife, and the relief prayed against them for the delivery up and cancellation of said notes. That should be made perpetual, and the bill retained for these purposes 5 the other injunctions to be dissolved. We will sign a decree accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed in part,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>and reversed in park</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
