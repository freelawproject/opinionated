That Act, for the first time, extended the jurisdiction of justices \u201cto all suits on bonds with penalty exceeding ones hundred dollars, where the sum due and claimed does not exceed one hundred dollars.'\u201d This Act also provides, that \u201cin all cases where the amount claimed or the thing in action exceeds the sum or value of fifty dollars, and Justices of the Peace have jurisdiction, the several Circuit Courts for tho counties shall have concurrent jurisdiction with Justices of the Peace.\u201d The test of jurisdiction here fixed is the amount due and claimed, and not the amount recovered. <em>O\u2019 Reiley, vs. Murdock </em>1 Gill, 33. <em>Beall vs. Black, 1 Gill, </em>203. <em>Carter vs. Tuck, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>251. <em>Ott vs. Dill, </em>7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">2nd. There is also error in the ruling of the Court in the plaintiff\u2019s first exception. That ruling is, that it was competent for the defendant to prove, in order to defeat*the action, that Hargate and Thomas, the parties named in the agreement, did not give the defendant previous notice of the time and place when and where they met and made the determination of the 17th of October, 1859. The general principle, that arbitrators must give notice to tho parties of the time and place of their meeting, to act upon the matters submitted to their arbitration, otherwise their award will be void, as announced in the case of <em>Emory vs. Owings, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>494, and other like cases, is admitted; but this general rule is qualified by the decision in <em>Bullitt vs. Mus-</em>grove, 3 <em>Gill, </em>31, so that it is made applicable only to cases where, from the nature of the submission, the judgment of the arbitrators may he influenced or enlightened by the adduction of evidence. It is insisted, that by the terms of this agreement, the parties named therein to make deter\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>initiation of the number of inches the dam ought to be lot?\" \u00abred, are not, in the strict sense of -the term, arbitrators, and the agreement is not strictly a submission to arbitrators of matters in dispute between the parties. By the terms of the agreement, all dispute was settled, and Culler agreed to lower his dam to the extent these named parties should \u25a0deem necessary to accomplish the result specified. The whole matter was left to their judgment upon their own \u25a0observation of natural results. No notice seems to have been contemplated by the parties, and none was necessary. But the ruling in question goes further than saying that notice was necessary of the time and place of meeting to \u25a0act upon the matters submitted to their arbitration ; it declares that notice was necessary of the time and place of meeting and making the award. It is not necessary that the parties should have notice of, or be present at the meeting of, the arbitrators, at which the award is made up and signed. <em>Roloson vs. Carson, </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-5\">3rd. There was also error in the Court\u2019s ruling in the plaintiff\u2019s second exception. The recalling of the witness, Hargate, for the purpose, and under the circumstances stated in this exception, and in the record, was the plaintiff\u2019s right, and to deprive him of it would have been a manifest injustice. Surely he could not be deprived of this right by a rule of Court which was never filed with the \u25a0clerk, and not placed amongst the general riiles, but which was kept locked up by the judge in his private drawer. Such a rule is no rule at all, \u2014 it is not binding on suitors or parties.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-6\"><em>Wm. J. Ross </em>and <em>Grayson Eichelberger </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-7\">The appellee submits, that there is no error in said judgment of the Court, and that the same should be affirmed, because the Circuit Courts have no jurisdiction in actions &lt;bcg <em>contractu, </em>where the amount recovered do'es not exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>fifty dollars. <em>O\u2019Reilly vs. Murdock, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>33. <em>Beall vs. Blade, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>203. <em>Ott vs. Dill, </em>7 <em>Md.

The case of <em>Ott vs. Dill, </em>was under the Constitution of 1850. The action in this case being on a covenant, is an action <em>ex contractu, </em>1 <em>Tidd\u2019s Pr., </em>1. 1 <em>Chiity\u2019s Pl., </em>110, ( 6th <em>American Edition.) </em>The verdict in this case being for one dollar, the Court below had no jurisdiction, and judgment of <em>non pross. </em>was properly entered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b561-7\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1JQ\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In our opinion, the question presented by the plaintiff\u2019s first exception is settled by the decision in <em>Bullitt vs. Musgrave, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>32. \u201cWhere from the nature of a submission the judgment of arbitrators may he influenced or enlightened by the adduction of- evidence, the parties are entitled, to notice of the time and place of their proceeding to investigate the matters submitted to them.\u201d Such was the nature of the submission in this case; there was consequently no error in admitting evidence to prove that such notice was not given, to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The ruling by the Circuit Court stated in the appellant\u2019s second exception, is not ground for reversal, because it was in conformity with a rule of that Court, which it had the discretion to adopt to preserve order in the trial of causes, and to promote fho'dispatch of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The only remaining point made by the appellant, is that the Circuit Court erred in directing a judgment of <em>non pross. </em>to be entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">The suit is upon an agreement under seal wherein the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>penalty is fixed at $1,000; the verdict was in favor of the plaintiff for one dollar.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b562-10\">( Decided March 13th, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In construing the several Acts of Assembly regulating the civil jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, ( prior to the Act of 1852,) the Court of Appeals determined that while in actions,for <em>\u00bforis, </em>the jurisdiction depended upon the amount of damages claimed, the test of jurisdiction in actions of contract was the amount recovered. <em>O'Reiley vs. Murdock, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>33. <em>Beall vs. Black, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>203. <em>Carter vs. Tuck, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>251. The Act of 1852, ch. 239, which enlarged the civil jurisdiction of the Justices of the Peace, departed somewhat from the language of the previous Acts, and in its first section provided, that they should have jurisdiction \u201cin all cases for the-enforcement of contracts, and to obtain redress for wrongs, when the debt or damages laid or claimed shall not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In <em>Ott vs. Dill, </em>7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>251, it was held that the Act of 1852, did not change the test of jurisdiction before established in cases of contract; but in such cases left it to depend upon the amount recovered, and not the sum laid or claimed in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The <em>Code, Art. </em>51, <em>sec. </em>13, pursues substantially the same language as the Act of 1852, above cited, and ought to receive the same construction. This being a suit upon a contract, the jurisdiction, as settled by the case of <em>Ott vs. Dill, </em>must depend upon the amount recovered, and that being below the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the judgment of <em>non pross. </em>was properly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In defining the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace in suits on bonds with a penalty, the language of the Code is not the same as the Act of 1852. But this case does not come within that provision, the instrument sued on is an agreement not a bond, and is governed by the decision of <em>Ott vs. Dill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
