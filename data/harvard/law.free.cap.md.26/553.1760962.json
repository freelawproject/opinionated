By L. J. Bayne, \u2014 that in July, 1852, he was a partner in the house of Selden, Withers <em>&amp; </em>Co. In that, month and year, Withers, ( the original plaintiff.) made a loan of $10,000 to Kelly, for which a note was given. The plaintiff then, on the requisition of' the defendants, produced said note, which was read in evidence by the defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>This note was diawn by Kelly, Ball &amp; Criss, dated July 35, 1852, to the order of J.

Wilson &amp; Co., and also the said Sellen, Withers &amp; Co., and there was a memorandum then read which imported that the sum of $10,000 was wanted on a lot of ground in the city of Baltimore, which, for the reasons stated, was deemed an ample security. But if required, additional personal security would be given by Kelly, Ball &amp; Criss and J. C. Wilson <em>&amp; </em>Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">They then proved by the said Bayne, that the said Kelly, so far as he knew, was the borrower of the said sum of $10,000 for which said note was given, and that J.

Woodward &amp; Co., as far as he knew, had no interest in or benefit from said loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">All this evidence having been given subject to exception, the plaintiff now moved that the same he rejected, and further prayed the Court to instruct the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-7\">1.

Kelly, Jr., and was so executed as the first step in the process of vesting the title in the plaintiff to the property covered by it, and that the parties who signed said contract assumed that the other deeds, necessary for the purpose of such vesting of title, were executed, when they were not, either because they thought, supposed or chose to consider what remained to <em>he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>done, as if actually done, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover whatever the jury may find to have been the loss sustain\u00e9d by him in consequence of the failure of the parties signing said agreement to pay and take up the said mortgage debt, and procure a release of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">2.

If the jury find the-facts enumerated in the preceding prayer, then there is no evidence that any property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>conveyed by Claik and wife to Withers, on the day of tbe date of the said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">3.

Whereupon the defendants excepted, and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiffs, appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b570-8\">The cause was argued before Bowie, C.

Dobbin </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-10\">The appellants claim a reversal of the judgment on the following grounds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-11\">1. A Court of Law cannot correct an alleged mistake in a written agreement, and administer relief on the footing of such correction. The juiisdiction in cases of mistake is purely equitable, and is termed even in equity a moral jurisdiction. <em>Townsend vs Stangroom, </em>6 <em>Ves., </em>326. <em>Wesley vs. Thomas, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>27. <em>Newcomer vs. Kline, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>471. In this last case, relief was given expressly on the ground that the party had not full and adequate relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>at law. See, also, <em>Hunt vs. Rousmanier, </em>8 <em>Wheat., </em>211, where it is distinctly assumed that the jurisdiction to correct a mistake is peculiar to equity. Those cases are illustrative of a rule which it is believed is evidenced by all the authorities. <em>Adams\u2019 Equity, </em>406, ( 168.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-5\">2. Mistake, to be corrected in equity, must he error in recital, description or stipulation, whereby the agreement is undesignedly made to import something diiferent from that which the parries intended it should import. \u201cIf parties voluntarily choose to express themselves in the language of the deed, they must be bound by it.\u201d The mistake must be the mistake of both parties, as well of the pa\u00bb ty who seeks relief, as of the party against whom relief is sought. And again, it is to be made out by evidence \u201cirrefragable,\u201d \u201cdear and overwhelming,\u201d \u201calmost, if not quite overwhelming.\u201d In the language of Chancellor Kent, \u201cno amendment was ever made without absolute conviction of the truth and precision of the real agreement.\u201d <em>Irnham vs. Child, </em>1 <em>Br. C. C., </em>92. <em>Shelburne vs Inchiquin, </em>1 <em>Br. C. C., </em>338. <em>Townsend vs. Stangroom, </em>6 <em>Ves., </em>328. <em>Wesley vs. Thomas, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>25. <em>Beard vs. Habble, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>430. <em>McElderry vs. </em>Shipley, 2 <em>Md.

In answer to the 1st point of the appellees, we rely upon 5 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>81. <em>2 H. &amp; J., </em>2. 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>322.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5l\">3. There is not sufficient evidence of a mistake to justify correction even hy a Court of Equity. If the parties \u201cchoose to consider what remain.ed tobe do\u00f1eas if actually done,\u201d tbe misrepresentation of fact, to gratify their caprice, is not a mistake which can be corrected anywhere. The paper on which this action is brought was prepared hy the counsel for the plaintiff, and we have no explanation by him of the causes of the alleged mistake. The only evidence of the agreement between the parties, is supplied by the writing itself. And it is not shown that there is not on the record's, a conveyance made by John Clark and wife to Withers, on the 7th of August, 1852, for land in the city of Baltimore, which was encumbered by mortgage to William Morris, as recited in said writing. It <em>i\u00e9 </em>not shown that the land mentioned in said writing is the same land covered by the mortgage from Camper to Morris, nor that the deed from Clark and wife to Ball was so made at the request of Kelly, nor that said deed was executed as the first step in <em>the process\u2019 of vesting </em>the title in the plaintiff covered by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-8\">4. The positions taken in the last point are more peculiarly applicable to the first prayer on the part of the plaintiff; with very little modification in circumstance, they apply to the second of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers. The common vice of both prayers lies in assuming, that the mere variance between the case stated in the writing of the 7th of August, 1852, and the case made out by the proofs, is \u201cirrefragable,\u201d \u201cclear and overwhelming\u201d proof of mistake in the writing, and assuming thus the fact of mistake, the jury are charged to find a variety of circumstances, which, if they existed, would render the alleged mistake probable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>but in reference to which, no sufficient evidence was offered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-5\">5. If evidence was admitted on the part of the plaintiffs to correct a mistake in the agreement of 7th of August, 1852, in regard to the supposed deed from Clark and wife to Withers, the evidence offered by the defendants to show that the loan was made to Kelly, or to Kelly, Ball <em>&amp; </em>Criss, and that Wilson <em>&amp; Go. </em>and Y/oodward <em>&amp; </em>Go., were sureties only, ought to have been admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-6\">Upon the whole evidence, this fact of suretyship was clearly made out. Bat if the evidence rendered on the part of the defendant was properly excluded, the jury might have found that fact from the evidence introduced on the part of the plaintiff, It is to be assumed, therefore, in discussing ih'e merits of the instruction given to the jury, that the fact of suretyship was made out, and indeed the second instruction expressly assumes, that the loan was to Kelly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-7\">6. Assuming that the loan was made to Kelly, or to Kelly, Ball <em>&amp; </em>Cries, and that the firms of Wilson &amp; Co. and Woodward &amp; Co., were sureties merely, the agreement roust be adjudged void as against those firms for want of sufficient consideration to support it. It is not shown that the signatures of those other firms to the agreement were made prior to or contemporaneously with the advance to Kelly, or to Kelly, Ball <em>&amp; </em>Cries. Oh the contrary, it is apparent that the advance was made before the date of the agreement sued oa, and before the signatures of those other firms were attached. The ease is, therefore, within <em>Aldridge vs. Turner, </em>1 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>427. <em>Nabb vs. </em>Koontz, 17 <em>Md. Rep., </em>283. <em>Wyman vs. Gray, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>409.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-8\"><em>J. Mason Campbell, D. M. </em>Thomas, and <em>B. B. Taney Campbell </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The counsel for the appellee will contend, that the action of the Court below was correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-5\">1st. Because the identity of the property referred to in the deeds and instruments of writing offered in evidence by the appellee, with that referred to in the agreement declared on, is sufficiently established to warrant the question of identity being submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-6\">It was a piece of land situated in the city of Baltimore, and subject to a mortgage not then due, of which William Morris was the holder, as stated in the agreement. John Clark also was, on the day of the date of the agreement, the legal holder of the land, and Alexander D. Kelly, Jr6 had the beneficial interest intit, as appears by the bond of conveyance from Clark to him, which was offered in evidence. The deed from Clark to Ball, on the 7th of August, 1852, (the date of the agreement,) being fora nominal consideration, (ten dollars,) was void as against the rights of third parties, and therefore, standing by itself, ivas void as against A. D. Kelly, Jr., who held a bond of conveyance for the property. And we should be at a loss to un-* derstand why Kelly should waive his rights under the bond of conveyance from Clark to him and accept a new bond of conveyance from Ball, whose title he had a right to ignore, by which new bond he could only get a deed for the property on the payment of an additional sum of &lt;\u00a1&gt;10,000, but for the explanation afforded by the agreement of the 7th of August, 1852, and by the deed from Ball to Withers made on the 30th of the same month, by which deed the same property was conveyed to said Withers, subject to the bond of conveyance to Kelly. But by these two papers the explanation is apparent. For by the agreement it will appear, that said Withers, as a security for the loan made by him, of ten thousand dollars, with interest from the 15th of July, 1852, was to hold the piece of land which Clark, at the request of Kelly, was to convey to him, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u2018ilie effect of the deed from Clark to Ball, the bond of conveyance from Ball to Kelly, and the deed from Ball to Withers, was to vest the land in Withers in exact conformity with this agreement, for Withers was thereby entitled to hold the land only until the said sum of ten thousand dollars was paid, when Kelly\u2019s bond of conveyance would require a conveyance to him. It thus appears that Ball did not take the land from Clark adversely to Kelly\u2019s rights, but in recognition of them, and for the purpose of doing with it what Clark himself was bound to do. He, in other words, acted as Clark\u2019s agent, and Withers\u2019 title was derived, not from Bali, but from Clark acting through the agency of Ball. And these deeds, therefore, substantially gratify the statement in the agreement, that the property was conveyed to Withers by Clatk, as what was done by his agent may be correctly described as done by by himself. <em>Eckell vs. Jones, </em>8 <em>Barr., </em>501. And as Wilbers\u2019 title is to be referred back to Clatk\u2019s deed to Bal3s of the 7th ot August, 1852, we also think there is no substantial discrepancy between the deeds given in evidence and the agreement, in respect to dates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-5\">But apart from this, it .was a perfectly legitimate deduction from the papers, that C!a\u00a1k intended Ball to execute the bond to Kejly and the dead to Withers on the same day on which lie received the deed from Clatk, and if so, Withers ought not to be prejudiced by the failure of one of the defendants to do his duty, and over which failure he had no control. The misrecital ia the agreement as to the date of the conveyance to Withers, was, at the most, a mistake by which none of the defendants were in any way prejudiced. And that a mistake of this sort in the recital of an instrument may be corrected, is clearly established by the authorities <em>Hall vs. Cazenove, </em>4 <em>East., </em>477. <em>Man vs. McDowell, </em>3 <em>Barr., </em>357. <em>Franz vs. Smith, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>280. <em>State, use Wilcoxen, vs. Wooten, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>21. <em>Wood vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>Fulton &amp; Stark, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>329. <em>Johns vs. Church, </em>12 <em>Pick., </em>557. 1 <em>Metc., </em>180. 1 <em>Greenleaf's Ev.. sec. </em>301. <em>Boardman et al. vs. Lessees of Reed, </em>6 <em>Peters, </em>328. <em>Barr-vs. The Broadway Ins.

Because the evidence offered or relied upon by the defendants to show that the firms of Wm. Woodward <em>&amp; </em>Go. and J. G, Wilson <em>&amp; Co. </em>were sureties and not principals, was not admissible to contradict the terms of the agreement, and was properly rejected, as were also the prayers offered by them and based on the theory of those firms being collateral and not original parties to the agreement. All the parties who signed the agreement agreed ( whether the fact was so or not) to assume the position of original contractors, and the plaintiffs, by their own admission, dealt with them as such. Therefore, it does not now lie in their mouths to say they were'not what they represented themselves to the plaintiff to be, for the purpose of giving a different effect to the contract from what it bears on its face. <em>Sprigg vs. Bank of Mount of Pleasant, </em>10 <em>Peters, </em>257. <em>Same vs. Same, </em>14 Peters, 201. <em>Hurn vs. Soper, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>276-283.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-11\">And there being no ambiguity about this instrument, <em>in </em>this respect, parol evidence is not admissible to contradict its clear and certain terms. <em>Watkins vs. Stockett, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>J., </em>444, 435. <em>Wesley vs. Thomas, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>24. <em>Mc-Elderry vs. Shipley, </em>2 <em>Md.

It is true that Mr. Bayne says the money was loaned in the month of July, whereas, the agreement says the loan was made on the 7th of August; and in one sense it is prohable that the loan was made on the 15th of July, that is to say, that the loan was on that day agreed upon, to be perfected afterwards, and the money being then set apart and specially appropriated to this purpose, interest was charged upon it from that day, as appears by the agreement, and in this respect the loan might properly be-spoken of aa made on that day ; but this, if true, in no way conflicts with the fact of the money only having been paid over on the 7th of August, which is the sense in which the agreement speaks of said loan having been made on that day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-6\">if this view of the testimony be correct, it will then appear that all the parties signed the agreement at the \u00a1une when the loan was made, (the 7th of August.) And if will then, on the authority last cited, be immaterial to inquire whether or not any of the parties to the agreement were only sureties, as all signing at the same time, whether principals or sureties, would be equally aifocted by the consideration moving fo any one of them.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 Ibis ease should have appeared in 23 lid.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\">after stating the facts of the case, as on pages 554 to 560, delivered the opinion of the Court as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The admission of the evidence offered by the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>and the instructions of the Court, at his instance, based upon that evidence, virtually decide that the recitals in the agreement, were not so material to the obligation of the contract, that a variance in any part of it would invalidate it; but that such variances were susceptible of explanation by parol, and the identity of the thing which was the subject matter of the agreement, being thus established, the plaintiff might recover for the breach, of the contract respecting fhe mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The subject matter of the contract in this instance, was a mortgage of a certain William Morris, for the sum of $1,000, executed by a prior owner, on a lot of ground in the city of Baltimore, which was described as conveyed to John Withers on the day of the date thereof, (7th of Angus*, 1852,) by J,hn Clark and wife at the request of Alexander Kelly, to <em>whom </em>the same belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The obligors reciting that John Withers had loaned them the sum of $10,000, payable in ten years, to the 15th of July, 1852, etc., and holds as security therefor \u201ca piece of land in the city of Baltimore, which was conveyed,\u201d etc ; and whereas, there now exists a mortgage on said land in favor of William Morris for fhe sum of $1 000, executed by a prior owner thereof, and not yetdue, and which the present holders of said mortgage refuse to receive prior to its maturity, in consideration of the premises, and of the said sum of $10,000, so loaned to them as aforesaid, thereby promised that at the maturity, or earlier if possible, to pay or take up the said mortgage debt, and procure a release of the same. The testimony offered on the part of the plaintiff, proved all the leading and important features of the description ; the mortgage was the principal in this instance, and the land the incident. The ex-tinguishment of the mortgage was the object of the promise, the breach of that promise the cause of action, and the variation in the time or mode of conveyance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>land affected in no way the rights of the parties. It is a case of <em>\u201cfalsa demonstration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\u201cEvery application of the maxim, implies that a mistake has occurred in the use of language. In all such cases the legal question is, conceding a mistake, is the intent clear upon the whole language employed? <em>(Wigrarn on </em>Ext. <em>Ev., </em>99.) If, notwithstanding the mistake, the intent remains clear, the mistake is to be disregarded even at law, and there is no occasion to seek a correction of the instrument, by the aid of equitable principles.\u201d <em>Barr vs. The Broadway Ins. Co., </em>16 <em>N. Y. Rep </em>, 269, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Neither <em>Wesley vs. Thomas, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>27, nor <em>Newcomer vs. Kline, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>471, cited by the appellants to the contrary, bear the remotest relation to the case fore us. Those were clear cases of equitable jurisdiction, in the former of which, it was held that the deed given for a fixed consideration, was not to be impeached by parol proof, without an allegation of fraud : and the latter sustained an application, to reform a single bill, by inserting the word \u201cdollars,\u201d because the complainant had not an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The admissibility of the evidence excepted to by the defendants, explaining the recitals of the agreement, and proving the identity of the subject matter, is sustained by the general rules of evidence and a number of adjudged cases. <em>Vide </em>1 <em>Greenlf. Ev., ch. </em>15, <em>sec. </em>285, 282. <em>Frantz vs. Smith, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">That a part of the description may be rejected eg surplus-age, is shown by the case of <em>Jackson, ex dem McNaughton, vs. Loomis, </em>18 <em>John. Rep., </em>86. 19 <em>John. Rep., </em>448, where the words \u201cLot No. 51,\u201d part of the description were rejected, the description being sufficiently certain without those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The tendency of the testimony thus offered by the plaintiff was not to contradict, alter or vary the written con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tract, but explain that which was uncertain and obscure, and identify its subject.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b580-8\"><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>( Decided July 12th, 1865.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The testimony offered on the part of the defendants, bad a directly opposite tendency ; its object as indicated by the prayers based upon and offered in connection with it, was to convert a contract, which was a \u00a1trimary, absolute obligation, into a secondary and collateral one. In other words, to show that a contract purporting to be originally and equally binding on all the obligors, entered into for a consideration enuring to the benefit of all, was in fact., only an original obligation as to the first obligors, and without consideration as to the rest. Such testimony certainly conflicts with the elementary principles of evidence. 1 <em>Greenlf. </em>Ev., <em>ch. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>87. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>435, 444. <em>Wesley vs. Thomas, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>24. 2 <em>Md.
