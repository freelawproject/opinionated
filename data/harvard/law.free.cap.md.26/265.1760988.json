That in construing a will, you must put yourself in the position which the testator occupied at the time ; and that the evidence contained in the agreement of facts was admissible for that purpose. <em>Wigram on </em>Wills, 1 <em>Vol.gsec. </em>9. <em>Proposition </em>5, <em>head note, and sec. </em>76, 96.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">2nd. That the important facts relied on to prove the charge, may be inferred from the will itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-7\">3rd. The legacy is given upon condition that Burgess should obtain a valid title to the land, a sufficient reason why he should pay, hut scarcely any reason why some other person not interested in such title should. <em>Sands vs. Chaplin, </em>1 <em>Story\u2019s Rep., </em>377. <em>Miles vs. Leigh, </em>1 <em>Atkyns, Crawford vs. Severson, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>443. <em>Spence vs. Robins, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>516. <em>Harris vs. Fly, </em>7 <em>Paige, </em>429.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-8\">4th. The legacy upon any other theory was a mere nugatory act, since it only took the money from John, William and Sarah, as distributees, and gave it, in the event of a certain determination of a litigation in which they were not concerned, to them as legatees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-9\">5th. The negative words, that they should not have the legacy in case the title to the land should prove invalid, show, that the testator could not have intended the legacy to come out of any other portion of his estate, for he would in that case have made a further disposition of the $3,000, which he thus declared his next of kin should not have,</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-10\">6th. In this instance, the estate of the testator is given away from his own relatives, the natural object of his bounty, and in such cases the rule is, that that construction of the will shall prevail which most tends to secure legacies in favor of relatives. <em>Van Winkle vs. Van </em>Horlin, 2 <em>Green\u2019s Ch. Rep., </em>172. <em>Lypert vs. Carter, </em>1 Vesey., <em>Senr., </em>499. <em>Elliot vs. </em>Hancock, 2 <em>Vernon, </em>143. <em>Webb vs. Webb, 2 Eq. Ca.

The legacy being only payable when the event should happen, which event might not, and in point of fact did not, happen for many years, the reasonable presumption is, that the testator did not design to keep his estate in an unsettled condition and answerable for this event, but regarded the property which was kept in suspense by the claim of third parties, as the proper fund to meet the legacy dependent on its result.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-5\"><em>F. Stone </em>and <em>Thos. G. Pratt, </em>for the appellees, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\">1st. 1 hat the personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of legacies, and as between the devisee of the real estate and the legatee, is the only fund to which the legatee can look for payment, unless the testator, by his will, has in direct words or by necessary implication, not only charged the real estate devised with its payment, but clearly indicated his intention that his personal estate should not be so applied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-7\">It is insisted, that in this case there is no direct charge of this pecuniary legacy upon the real estate devised, nor is there any necessary implication that it should be so charged. The bequest is simply conditional upon the validity of the.title of the devisee, and upon this alone is predicated the theory that it is a charge upon the lands devised. <em>Dulce of Ancaster vs. Mayor, </em>1 <em>White &amp; Tudor Le.

That parol evidence will not be admitted to shew the intention of testator to give his personal estate free from debts ; nor will any inference be drawn of the testator\u2019s intention by consideration of relative amount of the personal estate and debts, nor of the inadequacy of personal estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Stephenson vs. Heathcote, </em>1 <em>Eden, </em>38. <em>Tait vs. Lord Northwick, </em>4 <em>Ves., </em>816. 1 <em>White &amp; Tudor Le.

That in this case, the question arises between the devisee of the real estate and the appellant as pecuniary legatee, whether the legacy is to he paid from the land or from the personal estate undisposed of by the testator ; and the appellees\u2019 counsel submit, that assuming the real estate to he charged in this case with the payment of this legacy, that no case can he found in which the Court has held that the charge upon the land would exempt the personal estate not disposed of by the will, from its primary liability, unless the personal estate is in terms exonerated, or the legacies declared to be charged upon the real estate exclusively. <em>White &amp; Tudor Lc.

Ca., </em>144. <em>Story Eq., sec. 572.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">4th. That the appellant\u2019s third point answers in substance, that the devisee is to pay the pecuniary legacy, because no one else is directed to pay. Our position is that the personal estate is appropriated by law to pay, unless some -other fund is expressly or by necessary implication set apart for the payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\">It is insisted that the Maryland cases referred to by the appellant, in 5 <em>Gill, </em>443, and 6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>516, do not sustain the position for which they are cited, and that our position is established by the authorities heretofore referred to. 10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>143.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-11\">5th. That the devise to the appellee shows that th\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>testator regarded him at least as much the object of his bounty as bis nephew and nieces, to whom the pecuniary legacy is given, and that the rule of construction set forth in the appellant\u2019s sixth point is not applicable. 1 <em>White &amp; Tudor\u2019s Le. Ca., </em>185.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-5\">Goldsborough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AH1\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The appellant filed his bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Charles county, to recover a legacy of $3,000, conditionally bequeathed by the will of William Budd to him, his brother, William, and his sister, Sarah Ann Budd, to be equally divided between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">William and Sarah survived the testator, but have since died, leaving the appellant, as he alleges, their only next cf kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201cIt is agreed by the parties litigant that their object is to ascertain whether, by the true construction of the will of William Budd, the land willed to William <em>F., </em>Burgess, under whom the appellees claim, is liable for, or chargeable with, the legacy of $3,000 left to the appellant and his brother and sister ; all questions as to how the appellant is to receive or to be entitled to the portions of his deceased brother and sister, whether by survivorship or ctherwise, is waived, as that is a matter in which the respondents have no interest or concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The Circuit Court, upon final hearing of bill, answer, exhibits and agreements, dismissed the bill, and from its decree this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">In reviewing William Budd\u2019s will, we find that he says he is desirous to settle his worldly affairs, and with that intent he gives to his wife all his estate, both real and personal, during her life, she to be at liberty to devise all the negroes and their increase, that came by her with the plantation on which his uncle, Lott Mason, lived and died, together with the stock, furniture left by him, and the cro'p <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>on hand. After her death, he devises the several tracts of land named in the second clause of his will, to William F. Burgess and his heirs. By the fourth clause, he gives to his brother, John Budd\u2019s children, viz: William, John and Sarah Ann, after his wife\u2019s death, all his negroes, (except one given to Ann Burgess,) to be equally divided between them ; and then provides \u201cin case the title to the land willed to William F. Burgess should prove a valid one, I give, devise and bequeath to the aforesaid William Budd, John Budd and Sarah Ann Bndd, the sum of $3,000 to be equally divided between them or their heirs, but should the title to the land as aforesaid bequeathed and given to William F. Burgess, called Honesuch, or to laud attached thereto constituting the Ferry Plantation, prove not valid, the above legacy of three thousand dollars is not given to the said William, John and Sarah Ann Budd, as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Lastly, the testator constituted his wife and his friend, William F. Burgess, his executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Burgess survived the testator, but died in the lifetime of Iris widow. After her death, the real estate descended to the appelleo, Elizabeth Ann Williams, as the heir-at-law of Burgess. After the death of the widow of the testator, the appellee took possession of the estate. The title thereof was in litigation at the time of the execution of Budd\u2019s will in 1840, and was finally settled in 1853, in favor of the testator or those claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">It is agreed that on the final settlement of the personal estate of William Budd in 1842, there was a balance of $12,316.89, subject to distribution amongst the next of kin of the testator, and that the children of John Budd named in the will were the next of kin.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">As the true construction of the will can be arrived at more certainly by an analysis of it, it may conduce to thai end to noto the items seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The testator expresses his desire to settle his worldly affairs. He then gives all Ms estate, both real and personal, to his wife during her life. Here, it is to be observed, that with the exception of his negroes, he gave to her the power of disposition of the general personal estate, and the most of that would be embraced by the principle laid down in the case of <em>Evans vs. Iglehart, </em>6 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 171, viz., when any article of personalty bequeathed to a legatee for life, is of such a nature that its use is its consumption, the legatee takes the absolute property in the thing bequeathed. In the absence of any inventory of the personal estate of William Budd, we are left to infer that the negroes bequeathed to the Budds, and the one to Ann Burgess, constituted the bulk of the personalty embraced in the balance for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">While the law is too well established to need a citation, of authority to support it, that the personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of debts and legacies, and to exempt that estate from the payment thereof, there must be either express words or a plain intention, still, the intention may be found, not only in the mode in which the personal estate is given, but also in the manner in which the real estate is given. See 1 <em>White &amp; Tudor\u2019s Leading </em>Cases, 451. Looking, then, to the fourth clause of the will under consideration, we find that the legacy of the negroes to the Budds is positive and absolute. If the testator be presumed to know the testamentary laws of the State, it would be difficult to account for his conduct (if he did not intend to charge the real estate) in giving to Ms nephews and neice the positive legacy of the negroes and then give them a contingent legacy of $8,000, which, according to the theory of the appellees, was to be paid out of the personal assets. Such a theory would present the anomaly of taking from the legatees their negroes to pay their contingent, legacy, when in fact they had the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>demand their negroes in a due course of administration. Such a result would have left the personal estate unadministered from 1842, when the final account was passed, until 1853, when the title to the land was settled. It is equally difficult to conceive what motive the testator had in so intimately associating the legacy of $3,000 with the title to the land devised to Burgess, if he did not intend to make it a charge on the land. The legacy is void If Burgess gets no title. If he gets it, he does so to the prejudice of the heirs-at-law, of the testator, and though it does not distinctly appear that the children of his brother, John, were the heirs-at-law. yet it may be inferred that such was the case, and if so, the legacy may have been presumed to have been left to them as a compensation for the loss of the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">If this construction be not put upon the fourth clause of the will, the provision which makes the legacy dependent on the contingency of Burgess\u2019 obtaining the title, is wholly without meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Bearing in mind that the will is inartificially drawn, allowance must he made for the failure of the testator to use specific terms by which to charge the real estate. It is, however, conceded by the appellees, that a charge upon real estate may be by necessary implication, especially where the testator clearly indicates his intention that his personal estate should not he so applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We think the intention of the testator in this case is so obvious to charge the legacy upon the real estate and to regard that as the primary fund, that in conscience the personal estate ought to be exonerated because only auxiliary. Bee 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., sec. </em>574.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">It is insisted by the appellees, that whore there is a sufficiency of personal estate to pay all debts and legacies undisposed of by the testator, the land is exempt from ike charge upon it. We have before said, that in the contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>plation of the testator he designed to dispose of the whole-estate, both real and personal.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b284-9\">( Decided January 23rd, 1867.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Had the testator directed the devisee of the real estate to pay the legacy of $3,000, this case would have been in strict accordance with the case of <em>Crawford vs. Severson, </em>5 <em>Gill, 443. </em>We think the implication is so strong as to amount to a positive obligation. In the case in 5 <em>Gill, </em>the-infant heirs of John Severson, in their answer, urged that Thomas Severson left a large personal estate, much mor\u00a9 than sufficient to pay all his debts and legacies, and yet this Court found, from the context of the will, enough to sustain the claim of Sarah Denny as a charge upon th\u00a9 seal estate devised tq John and Samuel Severson.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">After a careful consideration of this ease, we think that Burgess took the lands devised to him with the condition clearly implied, that if he obtained a good title he should pay the legacy of $3,00\u00ae, and that it was a charge- on the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">This Court will sign a decree reversing the decree of th\u00a9 \u25a0 Circuit Court with the costs of this appeal to the appellant, and remanding the cause for further proceedings in conformity to- our \u00a9pinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
