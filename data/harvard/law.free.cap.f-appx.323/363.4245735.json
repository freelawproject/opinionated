Gleason, Louisiana prisoner #452467, appeals the dismissal as frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>lous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and 1915A(b)(l) of his time-barred 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019-20 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">No specified federal statute of limitations exists for \u00a7 1983 actions; therefore, federal courts borrow the forum state\u2019s' personal injury limitations period. <em>Rodriguez v. Holmes, </em>963 F.2d 799, 803 (5th Cir.1992). Louisiana Civil Code article 3492\u2019s one-year prescriptive period applies to \u00a7 1983 actions. <em>Elzy v. Roberson, </em>868 F.2d 793, 794 (5th Cir.1989). Gleason argues pursuant to <em>Hardin v. Straub, </em>490 U.S. 536, 109 S.Ct. 1998, 104 L.Ed.2d 582 (1989), that the one-year statute of limitations should be tolled until he is released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>Hardin </em>held that a federal court applying a state statute of limitations to an inmate\u2019s federal civil rights action should give effect to the state\u2019s statutory provision tolling the limitations period for prisoners. 490 U.S. at 542-44, 109 S.Ct. 1998. Louisiana, however, does not have a statute to that effect. <em>Lambert v. Toups, </em>745 So.2d 730, 733 (La.Ct.App.1999); <em>Hampton v. Kroger, Co., </em>658 So.2d 209, 211 (La.Ct.App.1995). Gleason has therefore not shown the district court\u2019s time-bar determination to have been an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Gleason\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Gleason is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis in imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
