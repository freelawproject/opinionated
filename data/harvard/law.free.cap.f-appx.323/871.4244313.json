On appeal, Ferguson concedes that our precedent forecloses his argument, but, in order to preserve the issue, argues that the district court erred in denying his motion. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Ferguson correctly concedes that our holding in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008), controls the outcome of the case. Because Ferguson\u2019s guideline range was based on the statutory minimum sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, rather than the guideline section applicable to drug offenses, Amendment 706 did not affect the range and he was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (holding that a defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because he \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
