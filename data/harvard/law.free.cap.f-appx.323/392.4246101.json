By moving for IFP, Jones is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into Jones\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-22\">Because Jones\u2019s brief does not address the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision or the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal, it is the same as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Jones has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Accordingly, Jones\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see How</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>ard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, his appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Jones\u2019s motion for preparation of the transcript at government expense is denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f); <em>Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jones has one prior strike. <em>See Jones v. Smith, </em>234 Fed.Appx. 249, 250 (5th Cir.2007). We caution Jones that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
