Armendariz argues that counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to adequately explain the implications of the plea agreement. He also challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny a mitigating role adjustment and safety role adjustment. The Government argues that the appeal should be dismissed because Armendariz waived his right to appeal and the waiver is valid and enforceable. The Government also asserts that Armendariz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">This court reviews the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. <em>See United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). Our review of the record shows that Armendariz\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Armendariz\u2019s safety valve and mitigating role arguments do not fall within the exceptions to the waiver. Thus, Ar-mendariz cannot raise these claims on appeal. Armendariz also asserts an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which does implicate an exception to the appeal waiver. Although this court generally declines to review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, the record is sufficiently developed for the court to address the claim. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 159, 172 L.Ed.2d 116 (2008). Because the record reflects that counsel explained the implications of the plea agreement to Armendariz, Armendariz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Armendariz argues, as he did in the district court in a motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), that his base offense level should be reduced by two levels pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 706. In general, Amendment 706 reduced the base offense levels set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. However, the base offense level for offenses involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine is unchanged. Armendariz was held accountable for 9 kilograms of crack cocaine and his original base offense level was 38. Under the new amendments to \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), Armendariz\u2019s base offense level remains 38. Thus, his base offense level is unaffected by Amendment 706 to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and, concomitantly, the applicable guidelines range of imprisonment was not lowered as a result of the amendment. Because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a sentence reduction only when the sentencing range is lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Armendariz\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
