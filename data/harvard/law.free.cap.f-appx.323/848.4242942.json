For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">In 1993, Holmes pled guilty to: possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count Two); and possession of a firearm during a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count Three). The district court sentenced Holmes to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 2 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 3, to run consecutively, and it imposed a 5-year period of supervised release. The following year, upon a motion filed by the government, the district court reduced Holmes\u2019s sentence on Count 2 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Holmes\u2019s five period of supervised release began upon his release from custody in January 2000. Over three years later, in May 2003, the district court found that Holmes violated a condition of his supervision, revoked his supervised release, and sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">On March 25, 2008, Holmes filed the instant motion for a sentencing reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Relying on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which retroactively reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine, Holmes requested the court to reduce his term of supervised release from 5 years to 3 years, which, in turn, would effectively nullify the 18-month sentence he received upon the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">The district court denied the motion, explaining that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.4(A)) prohibited the court from reducing a term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of supervised release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction, however, must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statement located at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">In this case, Holmes ultimately seeks to vacate the 18-month sentence that he received upon the revocation of supervised release. Essentially, he argues that, because the crack-cocaine amendments to the Guidelines retroactively reduced his underlying base offense level, the district court was authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his term of supervised released from five years to three years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Holmes, this would effectively nullify his 18-month sentence because he did not violate his supervised release until more than 3 years after he was released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>However, the district court was not authorized to modify the sentence that it imposed upon revoking Holmes\u2019s supervised release. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.4(A)) (\u201cOnly a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d). Although Holmes technically seeks only to reduce the term of his supervised release, not the actual 18-month sentence imposed upon its revocation, this is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent Application Note 4(A), and Holmes should not be permitted to \u201cdo indirectly what he cannot do directly.\u201d <em>United States v. Hembree, </em>381 F.3d 1109, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Holmes relies on <em>United States v. Etherton, </em>101 F.3d 80, 81 (9th Cir.1996), which held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorized the district court to reduce a sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release where a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines reduced the defendant\u2019s underlying base offense level. However, as the Seventh Circuit has recently noted, <em>\u201cEtheHon </em>sought to answer a question left open by the guidelines in effect at the time. One year later, in 1997, the Sentencing Commission filled the gap with Application Note 4(A), and no court has relied on <em>EtheHon </em>since.\u201d <em>United States v. Forman, </em>553 F.3d 585, 588-89 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Thus, we conclude that the district court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify the sentence imposed upon the revocation of Holmes\u2019s supervised release. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-10\">. Holmes has abandoned any argument on appeal that the district court had authority to modify his term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that arguments not raised on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
