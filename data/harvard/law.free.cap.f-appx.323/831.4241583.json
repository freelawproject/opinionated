For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">In 2000, a jury found Johnson guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), and possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The probation officer prepared a presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and determined that Johnson was accountable for at least 2.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, giving him a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Johnson also received a 2-level aggravating-role enhancement, giving him a total offense level of 40. The probation officer then found that Johnson was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because, <em>inter alia, </em>he had prior felony conviction for carrying a concealed firearm, which was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Significantly, the probation officer noted that, although Johnson\u2019s status as a career offender gave him a total offense level of 37, his otherwise applicable offense level of 40 was to be used because it was greater. The probation officer then found that Johnson had a criminal history category of V based on his prior convictions, but, because Johnson was a career offender, he automatically received a criminal history category of VI. An offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of VI gave Johnson an applicable guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. After adopting the factual findings and guideline calculations in the PSI, the district court sentenced Johnson to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">On April 4, 2008, Johnson filed a motion for a sentencing reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court appointed counsel for Johnson, and counsel argued that Johnson was not a career offender because, under this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), carrying a concealed firearm was no longer a crime of violence. Assuming that he would no longer automatically be subject to a criminal history category of VI, Johnson also challenged the calculation of his criminal history score and argued that he should have received a criminal history category of IV. He contended that this new criminal history category of IV, coupled with a reduced offense level of 38 as result of Amendment 706, gave him an amended guideline of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The district court concluded that Johnson was ineligible for a sentencing reduction. Relying on, <em>inter alia, </em>this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), the court explained that Johnson was ineligible for a reduction because he was a career offender. The court also found Johnson\u2019s contention that he was no longer a career offender to be without merit because <em>Archer </em>was not made retroactive, and, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, all original sentencing determinations remained unchanged except for the guideline that is amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which similarly provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that a sentencing reduction is not permitted where the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The district court in this case erroneously concluded that, under Moore, Johnson was not eligible for a sentencing reduction because he was a career offender. In <em>Moore, </em>we addressed whether certain defendants who were convicted of crack-cocaine offenses and who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for a sentencing reduction based on Amendment 706. We determined that, \u201calthough Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to the defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. This was so because, under \u00a7 4B1.1, the defendants\u2019 guideline ranges were ultimately determined by the statutory maximum penalty for the offense, not the base offense levels reduced by Amendment 706. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) (providing for superseding offense levels based on the statutory maximum penalty where those levels are \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable\u201d). This case is not controlled by <em>Moore </em>because, although Johnson was sentenced as a career offender, his applicable guideline range <em>was </em>determined by his base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Nonetheless, the district court ultimately reached the correct conclusion that Johnson was ineligible for a sentencing reduction. This is so because, although Amendment 706 would reduce Johnson\u2019s total offense level from 40 to 38, the amendment would not affect Johnson\u2019s criminal history category of VI. And an offense level of 38, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, would give Johnson an amended guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment, the same applicable guideline range upon which his original sentence was based. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, pt. A. Thus, Amendment 706 would not have the effect of lowering Johnson\u2019s applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Johnson seeks to avoid this result by challenging his career-offender status and his attendant criminal history category of VI. However, he may not do so in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that \u201cthe court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). We have confirmed this directive. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cIndeed, we have held that <em>all </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201c[0]nly the amended guideline range is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In sum, Johnson was not eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 would not have the effect of lowering his sentencing range. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
