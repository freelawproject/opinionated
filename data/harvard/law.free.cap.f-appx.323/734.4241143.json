Orozco asserts that she suffered threats, mistreatment, and the kidnaping of her brother for defying the FARC, and the newspaper article she submitted corroborated her testimony. She argues that her brother\u2019s kidnaping was evidence of her imputed political opinion and established that she had a well-founded fear of persecution. Moreover, she argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in finding that it was unreasonable for her and her family to leave Colombia after her brother\u2019s kidnaping because they reacted to the situation as any reasonable family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>would have. According to Orozco, the IJ failed to articulate any decisional standard in reference to her persecution claim. Or-ozco claims that she showed that a reasonable person in her circumstance would fear persecution if returned to Colombia. Accordingly, Orozco asserts that the IJ erred in not granting her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not explicitly adopt the IJ\u2019s findings, and thus we will review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. In order to carry this burden, the applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish \u201c(1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">In the case of persecution on account of political opinion, the political opinion must be held by the victim, not the persecutor. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). In <em>Elias-Zaca\u00f1as, </em>the Supreme Court held that persecution due to the refusal to cooperate with a guerilla group is not persecution on account of political opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 816. Rather, the persecution must occur because the persecutor knows that the victim\u2019s refusal to cooperate was due to political beliefs. <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 822 (11th Cir.2007). Persecution based on failure to cooperate with an alleged persecutor is not sufficient to show this nexus. <em>See Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (addressing withholding of removal political opinion claim based on FARC\u2019s actions against Sanchez). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Additionally, persecution based purely on retribution is also not persecution on account of political opinion. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, the applicant must show that his life or freedom would be threatened based on a protected ground. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. \u201cThe burden of proof for withholding of removal, however, is \u2018more likely than not,\u2019 and, thus, is \u2018more stringent\u2019 than the standard for asylum relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). An applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">To be entitled to relief under the CAT, an applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbDp\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Or-ozco failed to show the required nexus between what happened to her in Colombia or what she fears will happen to her upon her return to Colombia and her political opinion. She testified that her problems, namely the FARC\u2019s threatening her with death and kidnaping her brother, were both the result of her refusing to provide them with information. She also testified that the FARC targeted her specifically because she had access to bank account information, not because of her political opinion. While she argued that her brother\u2019s kidnaping showed her imputed political opinion, she never asserted that his kidnaping was a result of her political opinion. The record supports a finding that the FARC threatened Orozco and kidnaped her brother because she would not help them in a bank scheme, and refusing to cooperate with a guerilla group is not persecution on account of political opinion. Accordingly, Orozco failed to demonstrate that she was persecuted on account of a protected ground and thus failed to meet the standard for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Orozco failed to meet the standard for relief under the CAT because she did not testify or assert that the mistreatment she feared upon returning to Colombia would be at the instigation or with the acquiescence of the Colombian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
