On appeal, Brewster argues that he should have received a two-level sentence reduction, despite his status as a career offender, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may not reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant unless that defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a guideline range \u201cthat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">Amendment 706 provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for certain crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. This amendment was effective retroactively as of March 3, 2008. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court struck down the statutory provisions that made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 258-60, 125 S.Ct. at 756-67, 764-65. The Supreme Court further clarified that, under the newly advisory Sentencing Guidelines, district courts possess the authority to deviate from the 100-to-l crack-to-powder cocaine ratio during sentencing. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-17\">In addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis: (1) by recalculating the sentence based on the amendment, \u201cleavfing] all other guideline application decisions unaffected;\u201d and (2) by exercising its discretion, based on the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>tors, to impose a new sentence or to retain the original. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1); <em>and see United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). This requirement, however, \u201cis triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.l (A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">For example, \u201ca reduction under \u00a7 8582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A))), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009). Accordingly, we held that Amendment 706, which lowered base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, could not provide relief to defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses who were sentenced as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cplayed no role\u201d in the calculation of their guideline ranges. <em>Id. </em>at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">This rule also applies to career offenders who received departures for substantial assistance pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, where \u201cthe court did not find that the seriousness of [the defendants\u2019] criminal history would be overrepresented by application of \u00a7 4B1.1,\u201d and there was no indication \u201cthat the court based [the defendants\u2019] sentence[s] on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Finally, this court has held that Booker does apply in resentencing pursuant to \u00a7 3582. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">We conclude that Brewster was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. Amendment 706 did not lower Brewster\u2019s applicable guideline range, because his sentence was controlled by the career offender guidelines and the crack cocaine base offense level ultimately played no role in his sentence. While he received a downward departure, it was based on his substantial assistance pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, rather than the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation or a finding by the district court that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 was overly harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Brewster\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
