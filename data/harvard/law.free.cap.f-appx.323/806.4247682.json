Taylor argues that the district court should not have enhanced his sentence for abusing a position of trust, United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.3 (Nov.2005), and his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>the application of the enhancement of a sentence for abuse of a position of trust. <em>United States v. Louis, </em>559 F.3d 1220, 1224 (11th Cir.2009). \u201c We review the district court\u2019s fact findings\u2019 \u201d regarding an abuse of trust \u201c \u2018for clear error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ward, </em>222 F.3d 909, 911 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Mills, </em>138 F.3d 928, 941 (11th Cir.1998)). We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Review for reasonableness is a deferential standard of review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">We reject Taylor\u2019s argument that the district court used double counting to enhance his sentence. Taylor\u2019s base offense level was based on his tax evasion and did not account for his abuse of trust. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.6. Wire fraud also does not require evidence of a fiduciary or other relationship of private trust. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; <em>United States v. Bracciale, </em>374 F.3d 998, 1010 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>The district court also did not err by finding that Taylor abused a position of trust. Taylor, the president of 20/20 Solutions, offered to closely-held businesses payroll and tax services and he often obtained clients through customer referrals. The owners of those businesses relied on Taylor to calculate their tax liability and provided money to Taylor to pay their payroll expenses and federal taxes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 cmt. n. 1 (stating that the enhancement would apply to \u201cembezzlement of a client\u2019s funds by an attorney serving as a guardian\u201d); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1250 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e have explained that \u00a7 3B1.3 applies in the fraud context where the defendant is in a fiduciary, or other personal trust, relationship to the victim of the fraud, and \u2018the defendant takes advantage of the relationship to perpetrate or conceal the offense.\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 838 (11th Cir.1998)). Taylor misappropriated the money to pay personal expenses and invest in real estate. By virtue of his familiarity with the processes of the Internal Revenue Service, Taylor provided to his clients false confirmation of payments from the Revenue Service and told his clients that the Revenue Service had posted payments to incorrect accounts. Taylor concealed his theft by soliciting new clients to pay the tax obligations of existing clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence above the guideline range. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range, but concluded that range of punishment was \u201cnot adequate to capture the seriousness of [Taylor\u2019s] conduct.\u201d <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The district court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that an upward variance to 72 months of imprisonment was necessary to account for the facts and circumstances of Taylor\u2019s crimes, the emotional and monetary loss suffered by Taylor\u2019s victims, the substantial number of victims, and Taylor\u2019s disingenuous testimony regarding his motives to purchase the real estate. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Taylor\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Taylor\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
