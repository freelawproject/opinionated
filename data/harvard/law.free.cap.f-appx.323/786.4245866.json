The motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which retroactively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court sentenced him to the low end of his amended guidelines range, but Nealy argues that the district court should have granted a variance below the amended range in light of the remaining disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses, as identified in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">In a proceeding to modify a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Amendment 706, which reduced the \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels, was made retroactive by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713. \u201c[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d pursuant to a retroactive amendment, the district court \u201cmay reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements provide that, unless the defendant was originally sentenced to a term that was less than the applicable guideline range at the time of sentencing, a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) shall not be' less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) &amp; comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">This Court has recently rejected Nealy\u2019s argument that the district court has the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). Therefore, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
