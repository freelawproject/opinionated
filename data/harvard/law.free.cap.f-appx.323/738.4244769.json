However, we granted Brewster\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability on the following issue only: \u201cWhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992), when it failed to address [Brewster\u2019s] claim that his due process rights were violated where the evidence presented at trial did not support his conviction for bank fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>450 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.2006). Out of \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions,\u201d in <em>Clisby </em>we exercised our supervisory authority over the district courts and instructed them to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for habeas corpus relief, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied. 960 F.2d at 935-36. The procedures for handling habeas petitions were likewise designed to minimize disruption of the state criminal justice system. <em>Id. </em>at 935. A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. When a district court fails to resolve all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Because the record here demonstrates that the district court failed to resolve Brewster\u2019s claim that his constitutional due process rights were violated because the prosecution failed to prove all the elements of the charged offense, the district court\u2019s judgment violated <em>Clisby. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand Brewster\u2019s due process claim for consideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
