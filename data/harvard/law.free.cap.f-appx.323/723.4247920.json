Smith\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels associated with crack cocaine offenses, as well as an argument that the district court could further reduce his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The district court granted the motion in part, recalculated the guideline range applying Amendment 706, and imposed a sentence at the corresponding point near the middle of the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-16\">On appeal, Smith argues that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and that the district should further reduce his sentence after considering his post-sentence rehabilitation and the continuing crack/powder disparity. He argues that the district court should impose a sentence below the amended guideline range, but that, based on the factors he presented, the district court should at least reduce to the low end instead of the middle of the amended guideline range. Smith also argues that he was denied assistance of counsel because the district court ruled on his motion without allowing appointed counsel to present arguments on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-17\">\n<em>Discretion to impose a sentence within the amended guideline range</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-18\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). In addition, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The district court must engage in a two-part analysis when determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The court must: (1) recalculate the sentence under the amended Guidelines, and (2) decide, in its discretion, whether it will choose to impose a new sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. The second part of the analysis \u201cshould be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781. While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applieability-if any-of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may l\u2019educe the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The policy statement applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which instructs courts how to determine the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (2008). The policy statement provides in relevant part that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) ].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">In <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009), we held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only allows a district court to reduce sentences in a manner \u201cconsistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1193. We noted that the policy statement applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings prohibited the district court from reducing a term of imprisonment below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 1192, 1193-94; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). We further held that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and that the district court could not rely on <em>Booker </em>or <em>Kimbrough </em>to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a reduced sentence within the amended guideline range. Furthermore, the district court did not err in declining to reduce Smith\u2019s sentence further pursuant to <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kim-brough </em>because <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\n<em>Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">Proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdo not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3), or a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(a)(3) and (b)(4), we have held that, although the defendant must be present at his initial sentencing, he \u201cneed not be present at proceedings involving the correction or reduction of sentence under ... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Parrish, </em>427 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">Because Smith was not entitled to a hearing, and the district court granted his motion for a reduced sentence, we conclude that Smith was not denied assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
