On review, Sarmiento-Ulloa argues that the BIA and IJ erred in finding him not credible on the basis of a discrepancy in his testimony regarding the year of his cousin\u2019s death. He explained the discrepancy by stating that the year of death did not go to the heart of his claim, and he did not intend to deceive the immigration court, but felt \u201cpressured and nervous.\u201d In addition, he argues that the cumulative effect of the evidence was to show that he experienced past persecution and had a well-founded fear of countrywide future persecution, and, therefore, he established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. Although he states that the BIA and IJ erred in denying CAT relief, he presents no related arguments on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we also review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The U.S. Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG0T\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. An applicant may not show merely that he can establish a listed factor, but must show a causal connection between the persecution, or feared persecution, and a listed factor. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). We have held that not all \u201cexceptional treatment\u201d constitutes persecution. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y General, </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). We have described persecution \u201cas an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the IJ [and the BIA] must consider the cumulative effects of the incidents.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (quotation omitted). Alternatively, an applicant can establish a well-founded fear of persecution by establishing that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated on account of the statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Under the INA\u2019s provisions for withholding of removal, the Attorney General \u201cmay not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). Because the eviden-tiary burden for withholding of removal is greater than that imposed for asylum, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ or BIA. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-8\">[T]he IJ [or BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-9\"><em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">If an alien fails to challenge or argue a determination in his appeal to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider the challenge upon a petition to review. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">After reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s determinations that Sarmiento-Ulloa (1) was not credible, (2) did not show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, and (3) therefore, was not eligible for asylum. The record does not compel a contrary conclusion. Because Sarmiento-Ulloa did not establish eligibility for asylum, he also did not meet the higher burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal. We lack jurisdiction to review Sarmiento-Ulloa\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to argue the issue to the BIA. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
