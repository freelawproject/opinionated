He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and, thus, it was substantively unreasonable. Salinas-Garcia concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because the 16-level enhancement he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>pirically supported. As he did not raise this argument below, plain error review applies. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Salinas-Garcia further argues that the guidelines do not take into account that he has health problems and that the purpose of his return to the United States was to visit his sick father. He contends that in light of these factors a 33-month sentence would be reasonable. We review the sentence for reasonableness with regard to these issues because Salinas-Garcia raised them in the district court. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The question in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>Kim-brough </em>does not address the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, <em>Campos-Maldonado </em>supports the continued applicability of the appellate presumption to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences. The district court considered Salinas-Garcia\u2019s sentencing arguments and imposed a sentence near the top of the guidelines based on his extensive recidivist criminal history. Salinas-Garcia\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Because Salinas-Garcia has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
