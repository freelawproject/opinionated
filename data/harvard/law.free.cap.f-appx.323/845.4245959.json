That motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. Holman contends that the district court erred by applying as mandatory an application note prohibiting a reduction where the defendant was sentenced pursuant to the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">The commentary to the applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, instructs as follows: \u201cOnly a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 4(A) (Nov.2008). This commentary is binding, so long as it does not violate the Constitution or a federal statute, and is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the guidelines. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1322 n. 12 (11th Cir.2000). It is none of those things.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">We recently held that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and the district court is bound by the limitations imposed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy-statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d). Accordingly, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>does not have the authority to reduce a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
