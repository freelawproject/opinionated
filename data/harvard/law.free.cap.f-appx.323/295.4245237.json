We </em>affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Ollie, who was a fifth grade teacher for PISD, asserted claims of racial discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation under Title VII; violation of her civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; age discrimination under the ADEA; and intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract under state law. The district court dismissed all but Ollie\u2019s Title VII and ADEA claims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which were then mediated. This mediation produced a hastily drafted, hand-written settlement agreement signed by all parties and their attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the terms of this agreement, Ollie agreed to settle \u201call claims\u201d in exchange for twenty months paid administrative leave. Ollie subsequently refused to sign a more formal agreement, and PISD filed a motion to enforce the hand-written settlement and dismiss Ollie\u2019s remaining claims with prejudice. After briefing and a hearing on the matter, the district court granted the motion as to Ollie\u2019s Title VII claim but denied it as to her ADEA claim, holding that the agreement lacked certain language required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(f)(1)(B) and (C). The district court later issued an order clarifying that the agreement superceded Ollie\u2019s teaching contract with PISD. Finally, the district court granted PISD\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ADEA claim. Ollie timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Although Ollie\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief is deficient in many ways, we are able to identify the following claims therein: that the district court erred in (1) enforcing the settlement agreement as written; (2) holding that the settlement agreement superceded her teaching contract; and (3) granting summary judgment on her ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">\u201c[Pjublic policy favors voluntary settlement of employment discrimination claims brought under Title VII.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>781 F.2d 452, 454 (5th Cir.1986). \u201cNonetheless, we must closely scrutinize a release waiving rights under Title VII because of their remedial nature.\u201d <em>Smith v. Amedisys Inc., </em>298 F.3d 434, 441 (5th Cir.2002). The interpretation and validity of a release of claims under Title VII is governed by federal law, and such a release is valid only if it is knowing and voluntary. <em>Id. </em>This court has adopted a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test in determining whether a release is knowing and voluntary. <em>Id.; see also O\u2019Hare v. Global Natural Res., </em>898 F.2d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir.1990). Once the employer has established that the employee \u201csigned a release that addresses the claims at issue, received adequate consideration, and breached the release ... [i]t is then incumbent upon the former employee to demonstrate that the release was invalid because of fraud, duress, material mistake, or some other de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>fense.\u201d <em>Amedisys Inc., </em>298 F.3d at 441 (quotations omitted). The following factors are relevant in determining whether the employee has established a defense to the validity of the release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">(1) the plaintiffs education and business experience, (2) the amount of time the plaintiff had possession of or access to the agreement before signing it, (3) the role of [the] plaintiff in deciding the terms of the agreement, (4) the clarity of the agreement, (5) whether the plaintiff was represented by or consulted with an attorney, and (6) whether consideration given in exchange for the waiver exceeds employee benefits to which the employee was already entitled by contract or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>O\u2019Hare, </em>898 F.2d at 1017). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings following a hearing on this issue for clear error, <em>see Lee v. Hunt, </em>631 F.2d 1171, 1177 (5th Cir.1980), and we review the interpretation of the agreement de novo, <em>Advocare Int\u2019l LP v. Horizon Labs., Inc., </em>524 F.3d 679, 685 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Ollie first contends that when she signed the settlement agreement, it did not contain the paragraph settling her claims in exchange for twenty months\u2019 paid leave. This contention was contradicted by several witnesses, including her own attorney, and the district court did not clearly err in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Ollie also contends that the parties\u2019 true agreement was to give Ollie enough paid administrative leave to allow her to retire with full benefits, and that the twenty month figure was an estimate to be revisited (and was later determined to be insufficient). The district court rejected this argument, stating that \u201c[i]f Ms. Ollie miscalculated the number of points that she needed to reach her full retirement, then that was a unilateral mistake on her part and she is still bound by the settlement agreement that she signed.\u201d If PISD had agreed to twenty months\u2019 leave without intending or believing that it would allow Ollie to retire with full benefits, then we would agree that Ollie\u2019s mistake was unilateral. However, in ruling that the settlement agreement was intended to \u201coverride and replace\u201d Ollie\u2019s existing teaching contract, the district court specifically found that \u201cthe intent of the parties was for the 20 month time frame to enable Ollie to draw full retirement benefits.\u201d Since both parties intended that the leave allow Ollie to retire with full benefits, the mistake as to whether twenty months was sufficient for this purpose was mutual, not unilateral. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 152(1) (1981) (\u201cWhere a mistake of both parties at the time a contract was made as to a basic assumption on which the contract was made has a material effect on the agreed exchange of performances, the contract is voidable by the adversely affected party unless he bears the risk of the mistake under the rule stated in \u00a7 154.\u201d); <em>compare id. </em>at \u00a7 153 cmt. c, illus. 5 (\u201cA writes B offering to sell for $ 100,000 a tract of land that A owns known as \u2019201 Lincoln Street.\u2019 B, who mistakenly believes- that this description includes an additional tract of land worth $30,000, accepts A\u2019s offer. If [and only if] the court determines that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, it is voidable by B.\u201d), <em>with id. </em>at \u00a7 151 cmt. b, illus. 3 (\u201cA contracts to sell a tract of land to B. Both parties understand that B plans to erect an office building on the land and believe that he can lawfully do so. Unknown to them, two days earlier a municipal ordinance was enacted requiring a permit for lawful erection of such a building. There is a mistake of both A and B.\u201d). Nor does the fact that it was Ollie who provided the twenty month figure necessarily preclude relief. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 157 (\u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>mistaken party\u2019s fault in failing to know or discover the facts before making the contract does not bar him from avoidance or reformation under the rules stated in this Chapter, unless his fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Because the district court erred, as a matter of law, in characterizing the mistake in this case as unilateral, it did not make the necessary findings to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, Ollie has established the defense of mutual mistake. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 152 (mistake must be a \u201cbasic assumption on which the contract was made\u201d and have a \u201cmaterial effect on the agreed exchange of performances\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at \u00a7 154 (\u201cWhen a Party Bears the Risk of a Mistake\u201d). We do not conclude today that she has. Rather, we vacate the dismissal of Ollie\u2019s Title VII claim and remand to the district court to allow it to make those findings in the first instance. Because the district court must consider on remand whether the settlement agreement is valid, we do not reach the question of whether that agreement supercedes Ollie\u2019s employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Ollie also contends that the district court erred in granting PISD\u2019s motion for summary judgment on her ADEA claim. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d 802, 805 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is proper when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). \u201cThe evidence and inferences from the summary judgment record are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ant.\u201d <em>Minter v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>423 F.3d 460, 465 (5th Cir.2005). Under the ADEA, it is \u201cunlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). \u201cA plaintiff can demonstrate age discrimination in two ways, either through[ ] direct evidence or by an indirect or [circumstantial] method of proof.\u201d <em>Rachid v. Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff who relies on circumstantial evidence \u201cmust put forth a prima facie case, at which point the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment decision.\u201d <em>Berquist v. Wash. Mut. Bank, </em>500 F.3d 344, 349 (5th Cir. 2007). If the defendant meets this burden, the \u201cpresumption of discrimination created by the plaintiffs prima facie case\u201d is eliminated, and \u201cthe plaintiff must meet its ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Machinchick v. PB Power, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir.2005) (footnote omitted). The \u201cplaintiff may meet this burden by producing evidence tending to show that the reason offered by the defendant is pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d), \u201c[n]o civil action may be commenced by an individual under this section until 60 days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed\u201d with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). \u201cAnd \u00a7 626(d) establishes time limits for filing the EEOC charge. For cases arising in Texas, a complainant must file within 300 days of the last act of discrimination.\u201d <em>Julian v. City of Houston, </em>314 F.3d 721, 725-26 (5th Cir.2002) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Here, Ollie filed a charge with the EEOC on January 20, 2005. Most of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>alleged discriminatory conduct occurred more than 300 days prior to this filing and therefore cannot support Ollie\u2019s claim. In any case, we agree with the district court that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Ollie has put forth a prima facie case, she has not produced evidence raising a question of fact as to whether PISD\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the purported employment decision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 complaints about Ollie\u2019s professionalism from faculty and parents \u2014 was, in fact, a pretext. <em>Evans v. Houston, </em>246 F.3d 344, 350 (5th Cir.2001). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Ollie\u2019s ADEA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">. As we understand her <em>pro se </em>brief, Ollie does not appeal the dismissal of her \u00a7 1983 and state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AMNi\">. Although she brings this appeal <em>pro se, </em>Ollie was initially represented by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-16\">. PISD argues that Ollie has not suffered an adverse employment action for the purposes of an ADEA claim. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on other grounds, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
