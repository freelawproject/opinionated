On appeal, Bolden argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because: (1) that denial constituted a reimposition of his sentence, which created error under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (2) it should have exercised its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reduced his sentence based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-23\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted, however, that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). Notably, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court properly denied Bol-den\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment was not affected by Amendment 706. The record indicates that Bolden was held responsible at sentencing for 7.9 kilograms of crack cocaine, rendering him ineligible for a sentence reduction because his base offense level, total offense level, and guideline range remained unchanged by Amendment 706.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the defendant was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because he was responsible for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and, accordingly, his offense level of 38 was unchanged), <em>cert, denied, </em>including constitutional claims, during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings; <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220-21 (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent jurisdictional basis for an ineligible defendant to receive a sentence reduction). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Bolden\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-18\">. Even assuming, as the district court found, that Amendment 706 reduced Bolden\u2019s offense level two points, from 41 to 39, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction because his criminal history was VI and his guideline range remained unchanged at 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that career offenders whose guideline ranges were unaffected by Amendment 706 were not eligible for sentence reductions even though their base offense levels had changed), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied. </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-26\">.
