Cone appeals his convictions for conspiracy to violate federal bankruptcy laws and two counts of bankruptcy fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 157. On appeal, he argues that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(c)(l)\u2019s prohibition on judicial participation in plea negotiations. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Cone and two codefendants, charging him with: conspiracy to violate federal bankruptcy laws, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 152, and 157 (Count One); wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (Count Two); making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (Count Three); and two counts of bankruptcy fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (Counts Five and Six).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Cone and the government entered into a written plea agreement, whereby Cone agreed to plead guilty to Counts One and Two in the indictment, and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. The plea agreement advised Cone that the statutory maximum sentence for Count 1 was 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, and the statutory maximum sentence for Count 2 was 30 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">A magistrate judge conducted a standard plea colloquy with Cone in which the magistrate, <em>inter alia, </em>reviewed the terms of the plea agreement, explained the applicable statutory maximum penalties, and ensured that Cone was pleading guilty voluntarily. At one point in the hearing, the magistrate indicated that he would not accept Cone\u2019s guilty plea on Count One because, in attempting to ensure that there was a sufficient factual basis for the plea, Cone denied having knowledge that his actions were illegal. Cone then reassured the magistrate that he wished to plead guilty and Cone admitted to having knowledge of his illegal activity. Cone ultimately pled guilty to both Counts One and Two, and the district court subsequently accepted his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">Three months later, Cone, through a new attorney, filed an \u201cagreed motion\u201d to substitute his guilty plea on Count Two for the entry of a guilty plea on Counts Five and Six. Defense counsel explained that he was not satisfied that there was a sufficient factual basis establishing the \u201caffect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>ing a financial institution\u201d element in Count Two or that Cone was aware of this element at the time he entered his guilty plea. Although the government disagreed on that point, counsel explained that the government had nonetheless agreed to resolve the issue by having Cone \u201center guilty pleas to Counts Five and Six ... in return for the Government\u2019s agreement to dismiss Count Two.\u201d Cone simultaneously filed a \u201cmotion to modify or withdraw\u201d his guilty plea to Count Two. However, defense counsel subsequently clarified that this was not an independent motion, but was rather intended as an exhibit \u201cso that the Court could see what the basis was for the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The court held a status hearing, at which time the parties confirmed the terms of the proposed plea agreement. The government also noted that \u201cunder the new plea agreement that\u2019s proposed by the parties, [Cone\u2019s] base offense level would start off as six instead of seven.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cone informed the court that he had discussed the proposed agreement with his attorney and wished to proceed under that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The government then filed an Addendum to the original plea agreement, describing the terms of the proposed agreement and clarifying that the Addendum did not otherwise affect the terms of the original plea agreement. In addition to setting out the elements of the offense in Counts Five and Six and the statutory maximum penalties, the government described the factual basis supporting those two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The district court held a plea hearing and first recognized that Cone\u2019s attorney had filed a motion to withdraw. Counsel recognized that his motion was \u201cvague,\u201d but thought it would become clear as the hearing proceeded. The district court began by twice asking Cone whether he in fact wished to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six in exchange for withdrawing his guilty plea to Count Two, and Cone responded affirmatively. Cone then explained that the \u201cprocess ha[d] bogged down a little bit\u201d because some of the facts in the government\u2019s Addendum were not accurate, and Cone wanted to make sure that they were correct. The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">Well, now, just understand, I don\u2019t really care. If it got down to nuts and bolts, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d let you withdraw your plea to Count Two. The only reason I\u2019m doing it is because both sides have agreed to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">It was a late motion to withdraw the plea. I\u2019m not sure that I would allow the plea to be withdrawn if it wasn\u2019t agreed to. So don\u2019t mess with me this morning. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-11\">You \u2014 you\u2014you proceeded in this manner throughout this entire litigation. You did this in front of [the magistrate], there was a problem, and I\u2019ve read the transcript so, you know, this is \u2014 this is the \u2014 this is the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-12\">If we\u2019re going to do this, we do it this morning. If not, then there \u2014 I\u2019m going to \u2014 no withdrawing of the plea, is that clear?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>The government explained that it had met with defense counsel the previous day regarding \u201cCone\u2019s apprehensions on some of the facts\u201d and, based on that discussion, it was unclear to the government whether Cone would admit to facts sufficient to support a guilty plea. The court decided that it would \u201cgo through the plea colloquy as to Five and Six. If that is sufficient, then I will take up the motion to withdraw the plea to Count Two. If it\u2019s not successful, then we\u2019re back to where we were.\u201d At that point, Cone asked for a five-minute recess, and the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">Okay. I have a trial at- \u2014 I have a trial at 9:30, okay? So I had allotted an hour for this. And I will give you [approximately 15 minutes]. And then you come back in, and if you feel you can\u2019t proceed with this, then that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll proceed with the sentencing on Counts One and Two on the date in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">When the hearing reconvened, the court asked Cone how he wished to proceed, as it did not \u201cwant to take a lot of time going through a plea colloquy if in the end you have no intentions of admitting to the necessary facts to support the plea.\u201d Cone responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">Your Honor, what I\u2019d like to do is accept responsibility for, uh, Counts No. Five and Counts No. Six. And I\u2019d like to, uh, agree to the overt acts that were included with in the, uh \u2014 within the Indictment, specifically as it relates to Counts No. Five and Six. And I\u2019d like to accept responsibility and \u2014 and ask that the plea be changed from Count Two to Counts No. Five and No. Six.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The court then asked Cone to explain his concerns about the factual basis for Counts Five and Six, and Cone responded by disputing several of the facts in the government\u2019s Addendum. The court then stated: \u201cOkay. Well, I\u2019m not going to proceed with the \u2014 the plea to Counts Five and Six. And we\u2019ll just stay where we are. You pled guilty to Counts One and Two ... [and] the sentencing is set for March.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">CONE: [T]here are some overt acts that relate to Five and Six that \u2014 that I don\u2019t have issues with. And it\u2019s just that ... I didn\u2019t want to ... execute this if it doesn\u2019t appear that ... is factually correct. I didn\u2019t want to ... get myself in some sort of trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-10\">COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-11\">Well, I will tell you that I\u2019ve set this off for a number of days, first, so that we wouldn\u2019t be in this position when we got here this morning and the issues could be worked out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-12\">I\u2019ll rule on the motion [filed by counsel] that I have which I have not ruled on. I\u2019m not going to proceed with the plea. It doesn\u2019t seem to me that you are accepting responsibility to the facts in the ... factual basis of the ... amendment to the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-13\">CONE: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-14\">COURT: You know, I \u2014 that\u2019s f\u00edne. I don\u2019t really care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-15\">CONE: Your Honor, may I \u2014 I want to accept responsibility. There\u2019s issues in the overt acts that I \u2014 I completely claim responsibility for. May I ask that I have 24 hours to submit my overt acts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-16\">COURT: No, I\u2019m not doing that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">The court then discussed defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, the basis of which had become clear, and defense counsel acknowledged that he had received the government\u2019s Addendum several weeks earlier. When asked to respond to counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, Cone complimented his attorney and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>And, you know, I\u2019d certainly like to\u2014 and I think what [counsel\u2019s] position is is that we made a commitment to go to Five and Six instead of Two. And I\u2019d like to see us fulfill that commitment. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to put my name on something that I know is\u2014 by a word or two is off changes the meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">After the court suggested continuing the hearing until the following morning, the government responded that Cone was not disputing one or two words in the government\u2019s factual proffer, but was rather making \u201cflat out bold assertions\u201d which were \u201ccompletely contrary to the evidence we have, and I would see no need to try to reset this because candidly we wouldn\u2019t accept any plea [where] he would be failing to acknowledge, uh, the truth of it.... So I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of admitting and accepting his guilt.\u201d Though the court expressed \u201cgreat trepidation ... as to whether it [would] do any good,\u201d it reset the hearing for the following morning at Cone\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">At the plea hearing the following morning, Cone reiterated his desire to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six and withdraw his guilty plea to Count Two in return. The court reminded Cone that the prior plea hearing had broken down because of his inability to admit some of the facts in the Addendum, and Cone informed the court that, after speaking to his attorney, that no longer posed a problem. The court then conducted a full, standard plea colloquy with Cone, at the end of which Cone pled guilty to Counts Five and Six. The government then set out the factual basis for Counts Five and Six, and the court asked whether Cone had any objections, at which point Cone again disputed many of the details included in the government\u2019s factual proffer. However, after several back-and-forth discussions with the court, Cone ultimately acknowledged acting with illegal intent with respect to certain incidents. At that point, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">Mr. Cone, I\u2019m going to accept the plea. I\u2019ll accept the plea to both Count Five and Count Six. You know, I \u2014 I think that you have continually attempted throughout the plea process to undermine your responsibility here, and all along I think it\u2019s been somewhat difficult for you to accept responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-10\">But you have accepted, I think, sufficient facts to substantiate a factual basis for a plea to Counts Five and Six. So I will \u2014 I will accept the plea. I find that you are competent to enter the plea, and find there is a factual basis for the pleas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The court subsequently sentenced Cone to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1, 5, and 6, to run consecutively, and it dismissed Counts 2 and 8. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Rule 11(c)(1) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn attorney for the government and the defendant\u2019s attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement. <em>The court must not participate in these discussions.\u201d </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) (emphasis added). \u201cThe primary purpose of [this rule] is to avoid the danger of an involuntary guilty plea coerced by judicial intervention.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>138 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cWe have interpreted [this rule] as a bright line rule prohibiting the participation of the judge in plea negotiations under any circumstances; it is a rule that ... admits of no exceptions.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>89 F.3d 778, 783 (11th Cir.1996) (quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Cone did not object on this ground below, and thus, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen a defendant ... fails to object to a Rule 11 violation in the district court, this Court reviews under the plain-error analysis.\u201d). Instead of conducting the normal four-prong plain-error analysis, however, we have stated that \u201cjudicial participation [in plea negotiations] is plain error, and the defendant need not show actual prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d 1132, 1135 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">On appeal, Cone argues that the district court, at the first plea hearing, \u201cintimidated him into pleading guilty by threatening to deny his motion to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Two unless he pled guilty to Counts Five and Six.\u201d The premise of Cone\u2019s argument is disingenuous because he did not file an independent motion to withdraw his guilty plea on Count Two. Instead, Cone entered into an agreement with the government whereby he would plead guilty to Counts Five and Six and, in exchange, the government would allow him to withdraw his guilty plea on Count Two. This proposed plea agreement was the only basis upon which Cone sought to withdraw his guilty plea on Count Two. Thus, the only reason why the court indicated at the initial plea hearing that it would not allow Cone to withdraw; his guilty plea on Count Two was because it anticipated \u2014 correctly\u2014that Cone would contest the government\u2019s factual proffer supporting Counts Five and Six. In other words, the court simply recognized that if it declined to accept Cone\u2019s attempt to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six, then there would be no basis to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Furthermore, nothing in the record otherwise supports Cone\u2019s assertion that the court impermissibly participated in plea negotiations. First, it is doubtful that Cone may invoke Rule 11(c)(1) because he and the government had already executed the proposed plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Telemaque, </em>244 F.3d 1247, 1249 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he written plea agreement was already executed. No case that Telemaque cites, or that we have located, holds that a court\u2019s posi-agreement remark can violate the Rule.\u201d); <em>Diaz, </em>138 F.3d at 1363 (\u201cThe district court\u2019s role under Rule 11 is to evaluate a plea agreement once it has been reached by the parties and disclosed in open court. Prior to that time, a court should not offer comments touching upon proposed or possible plea agreements ....\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">This fact further highlights that the district court in this case did nothing more than fulfill its obligation under Rule 11 to ensure that there was a sufficient factual basis to support Cone\u2019s proposed guilty plea on Counts Five and Six. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3) (\u201cBefore entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d); <em>Johnson, </em>89 F.3d at 783 (stating that the court did not impermissibly participate in plea negotiations where it \u201cwent to some lengths\u201d to ensure, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was a factual basis for the plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Furthermore, this case is distinguishable from our other cases in this area, as Cone was not confronted with the weighty decision of whether to proceed to trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Casallas, </em>59 F.3d 1173, 1177-78 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that there was a violation of the prohibition on judicial participation in plea negotiations where the court contrasted the 15-year sentence that the defendant would face if he went to trial with the 10-year he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>face if he pled guilty); <em>Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d at 1133-36 (same, where the court told the defendants that if they went to trial and were convicted, they would receive a \u201cfairly high\u201d sentence). Instead, Cone was merely attempting to substitute his guilty plea on Count Two for a guilty plea on Counts Five and Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In addition, this proposed substitution was, by all accounts, a favorable one for Cone, as it reduced the statutory maximum penalty from 30 to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and provided a 1-level reduction in his base offense level. Cone presumably recognized this benefit, as he repeatedly expressed a persistent and unequivocal desire \u2014 at the status hearing and throughout both the first and second plea hearings \u2014 to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six; there is simply nothing in the record to support Cone\u2019s assertion that he ever \u201cwavered\u201d in this regard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">While the fact that the proposed plea agreement was favorable to Cone could have led the district court, as in <em>Casallas </em>and <em>Corbitt, </em>to encourage Cone to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six, the court, contrary to Cone\u2019s assertion, made no mention of this benefit at either of the plea hearings. <em>See Johnson, </em>89 F.3d at 783 (\u201cThe statements made by the district court here did not touch on the sentence Johnson might receive....\u201d). To the contrary, rather than encouraging Cone to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six, the court did precisely the opposite, resolutely refusing to accept Cone\u2019s plea until he sufficiently accepted the government\u2019s factual proffer. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the district court could fairly be accused of coercing Cone to plead guilty to Counts Five and Six. Accordingly, we affirm Cone\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">. Cone's base offense level would have been 7 in connection with Count 2 because the statutory maximum penalty for that offense was in excess of 20 years imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(1); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (providing for a statutory maximum penalty of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment). However, Cone\u2019s base offense level would have been 6 in connection with Counts 5 and 6 because the statutory maximum penalty was less than 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (providing for a statutory maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. Cone's refusal to accept the government's factual proffer for Counts Five and Six is not inconsistent with his unequivocal desire to plead guilty; rather, Cone made clear that he felt compelled to dispute the government's factual proffer because he did not want to put his name on something that was inaccurate and risk getting himself into trouble.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
