Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim for relief. <em>Greenhill v. United States, </em>275 Fed.Appx. 315, 317 (5th Cir.2008). Greenhill has moved to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certification, pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997), that his appeal from the denial of Rule 60(b) relief is not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">Greenhill\u2019s argument that the denial of his motion was an abuse of discretion under <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007), is frivolous. The decision not to hold a Spears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing to allow Greenhill to amend his complaint to add claims against new defendants was within the discretion of the district court. See <em>Gov\u2019t Fin. Servs. One Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Peyton Place, Inc., </em>62 F.3d 767, 770 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s certification that Green-hill\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, and Greenhill\u2019s motion for IFP is denied. Because this appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), it is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Greenhill that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
