Saunders moved to reduce her sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may modify a sentence for a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence modification is not consistent with the policy statements when an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-19\">Saunders\u2019s argument is foreclosed by precedent. In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we held that, when a defendant\u2019s base offense level is calculated under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 706 does not lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range and the defendant is ineligible for a sentence modification under section 3582(c)(2). 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). Saunders was sentenced as a career offender. We affirm the denial of Saunders\u2019s motion to reduce her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
