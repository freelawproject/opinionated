In July 2008, Eason, proceeding pro <em>se, </em>filed a \u201cnunc pro tunc motion based on defendant\u2019s \u2018actual innocence\u2019 of the illegal sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4).\u201d Ea-son did not appeal his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court summarily denied his motion. He now appeals the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-22\">At sentencing, the district court enhanced Eason\u2019s base offense level because it determined that his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon constituted a crime of violence. He claims that the court erred in doing so because, after our decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), carrying a concealed weapon does not constitute a violent felony for sentencing purposes. Eason argues that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the \u201cillegal sentencing enhancement\u201d he received, and requests that we remand his case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-23\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Consequently, we construe Eason\u2019s motion as a request for relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-24\">A district court may not modify a defendant\u2019s sentence except in limited circumstances, which are set forth in 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (addressing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion).
