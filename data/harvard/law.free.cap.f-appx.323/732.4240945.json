After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). Shuler\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The district court did not err in concluding that Shuler was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. At his original sentencing, Shuler\u2019s initial guidelines range, based on \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u2019s drug quantity table, was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because Shuler was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Shuler\u2019s guidelines range became 120 to 121 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c). The district court imposed the statutory mandatory minimum 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">Shuler\u2019s 120-month sentence was not based on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him under \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) to calculate his base offense level, but rather upon the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that a defendant sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence is not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 because Amendment 706 had no effect on the statutory mandatory minimum sentence).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, even though Amendment 706 lowered the base offense level for Shu-ler\u2019s crack cocaine offense by two levels, it did not lower Shuler\u2019s ultimate sentencing range by virtue of the statutory mandatory minimum. Because Amendment 706 had no effect on Shuler\u2019s sentencing range, Shuler was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.
