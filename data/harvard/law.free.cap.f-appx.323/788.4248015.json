He appeals, nevertheless, arguing (1) his presence was required at a hearing and (2) <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Kimbrough<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allow a reduction beyond the two-level reduction he received. After review, we affirm Willing-ham\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Legal questions are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">On appeal, Willingham argues he had the right to be heard to present mitigating arguments at his resentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide a defendant need not be present for a proceeding \u201cinvolv[ing] the correction or reduction of sentence under [ ] 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4). Willingham\u2019s argument that he was entitled to an oral heai'ing to present mitigating arguments prior to his \u00a7 3582(c) resentencing fails. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4); <em>see also United States v. Taylor, </em>11 F.3d 149, 152 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cthere is a distinction between modifications of sentences and proceedings that impose a new sentence after vacation of the original sentence\u201d; \u201c[i]n the former instance, the defendant\u2019s presence is not required\u201d); <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>241 Fed.Appx. 625, 629 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(b)(4), a defendant\u2019s presence at a \u00a7 3582(c) sentence correction proceeding is <em>not </em>required.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">At his original sentencing, Willing-ham\u2019s offense level was 42, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The sentencing court imposed a 360-month sentence, at the low end of the range. After Amendment 706, Willingham\u2019s offense level was reduced by two levels, yielding a new Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. Upon Willingham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court imposed a 292-month sentence, at the low end of the new, amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">Willingham argues the district court should have sentenced him below the amended Guidelines range. He argues the district court was permitted to apply the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to give him a downward variance from the Guidelines range after the range had been lowered to account for the crack-cocaine amendments. It is Willingham\u2019s position that his Guidelines range should be recalculated using a 20:1 crack cocaine ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-18\">A \u201cdistrict court must make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). First, the court must determine the sentence it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and holding all other guideline findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant. <em>Id.; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Second, the court must consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and then determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760; <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.1(B)(i)).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">\u201c[A] sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant, to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo resentencing. All original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The applicable policy statements, moreover, provide that, unless the defendant was originally sentenced to a term that was less than the applicable Guidelines range at the time of sentencing, a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) shall not be less than the minimum of the amended Guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B), and cmt. (n.3). Willingham\u2019s original '360-month sentence was within the then-applicable Guidelines range of 360 months to life. Accordingly, the district court was not permitted under \u00a7 1B1.10 to sentence Willingham to a term below the amended Guidelines range of 292 to 265 months. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the district court complied with the law when it resentenced Willingham to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the amended Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2009) (holding <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Based upon our holding in <em>Melvin, </em>Will-ingham\u2019s argument that the district court should have sentenced him below the amended Guidelines range is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The district court did not err by resen-tencing Willingham pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) without holding a hearing at which he could argue in mitigation. The district court also did not err by resentenc-ing Willingham within the amended Guidelines range. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\">. <em>United States v.
