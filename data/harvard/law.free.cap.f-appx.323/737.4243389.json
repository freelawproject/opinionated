Lemon, a federal prisoner convicted of conspiracy to distribute fifty or more grams of crack cocaine, appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied his motion because Lemon was sentenced as a career offender and Amendment 706 did not affect his guidelines range. On appeal, Lemon contends that his sentence was actually based on the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence that was based on a guideline sentencing range which the Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Although Amendment 706 reduced the base offense levels under \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) for certain crack cocaine offenses, it did not impact the career offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). Consequently, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentence reduction for defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Contrary to Lemon\u2019s assertion, the record reveals that Lemon\u2019s sentencing guideline range was based on his career offender status, not the amount of drugs involved. The pre-sentence investigation report initially set Lemon\u2019s base offense level at 32 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) based on the amount of crack cocaine involved in the offense. However, the district court classified Lemon as a career offender based on his two prior felony convictions and determined his total offense level was 34 under \u00a7 4B 1.1(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court then granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based on Lemon\u2019s substantial assistance, and reduced his total offense level to 31. Combined with his criminal history category, Lemon\u2019s advisory guideline range was 188 to 235 months of imprisonment. The court sentenced Lemon to the minimum term of 188 months of imprisonment, followed by ten years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Because Lemon\u2019s sentencing range was predicated on the career offender tables under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), rather than the drug quantity tables under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Amendment 706 does not alter his guidelines range. The district court therefore correctly determined that Lemon was not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Lemon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">. This total offense level reflected a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
