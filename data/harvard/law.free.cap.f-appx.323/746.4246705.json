For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">In 1995, James pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), in which she calculated James\u2019s applicable guideline range as follows. She determined that James was responsible for 79.98 grams of crack cocaine, giving him a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. However, she found that James was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because he had \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d She explained that James had two convictions for the \u201csale\u201d of cocaine and a prior conviction for aggravated battery. James\u2019s status as a career offender gave him a new offense level of 37, which was then reduced to 34 after he received a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. James had a criminal history category of VI which, when coupled with his offense level of 34, produced an applicable guideline range of 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. James did not raise any objections to the PSI, and the district court sentenced him to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment in January 1996. James did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-18\">In April 1997, the government filed a motion to reduce James\u2019s sentence based on his substantial assistance, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. Before the court ruled on the government\u2019s motion, James filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. James argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his sentence was imposed \u201cin violation of the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d and that his attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ney was ineffective at sentencing by failing to explain that his cocaine convictions would subject him to the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The district court then granted the government\u2019s Rule 35 motion and, in June 1998, entered an amended judgment re-sentencing James to 202 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding that James could no longer attack his original sentence, the district court then denied James\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Nearly ten years later, in February 2008, James filed the instant pro <em>se </em>\u201cNunc Pro Tunc Motion Based on Defendant\u2019s \u2018Actual Innocence\u2019 of the Illegal Sentence Enhancement.\u201d Insofar as categorizing the motion, James noted that \u201cfederal courts must look beyond the labels of motions filed by <em>pro se </em>inmates to interpret them under whatever statu[t]e would provide relief.\u201d At the same time, however, James stated that his motion was <em>\u201cnot </em>to be construed as a 28 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 2241, or a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, nor a Application for a Successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d Later in the motion, however, James suggested that his motion was in fact a \u00a7 2255 motion, as he discussed the actual innocence exception to the procedural default doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">With respect to James\u2019s substantive argument, he submitted that he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 because his two prior convictions for the sale of cocaine did not qualify as controlled substance offenses under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). James explained that while \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) defined a controlled substance offense as one involving the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensation of a controlled substance, he was convicted only for the \u201csale\u201d of a controlled substance, which was substantively different from distribution and thus outside the scope of \u00a7 4B1.2. Accordingly, James requested that he be resentenced without the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Construing James\u2019s motion as a motion for a sentencing reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2), the district court ordered the government to respond. In response, the government construed James\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and it argued that James was ineligible for a sentencing reduction because he was sentenced as a career offender. Furthermore, the government argued that James could not \u201cget around this bar\u201d by arguing that he was convicted of selling, rather than distributing, cocaine, because \u201c[t]he words sale and distribution are interchangeable .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">James replied by repeating his argument that his convictions for the sale of cocaine did not qualify as controlled substance offenses because, contrary to the government\u2019s argument, \u201csale\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d were not interchangeable. James again requested that the court construe his motion in whatever manner would afford him relief. He also repeated his discussion about the actual innocence exception to the procedural default doctrine but, notably, did not argue that his motion should not be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">On April 1, 2008, the district court entered two orders summarily denying James\u2019s motion. The first order treated James\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and the second order simply referred to James\u2019s motion as an \u201cactual innocence\u201d motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">James filed a motion for clarification, requesting that the court reinstate his motion because the court erroneously construed it as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. James explained that he never intended to file a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but rather intended only to file a an \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim. The court summarily denied the motion, stating that James\u2019s motion had been \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>viewed and readdressed in the order dated April 1, 2008.... \u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\u201cWe review whether a court has jurisdiction as a question of law subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cFederal courts are obligated to look beyond the label of a <em>pro se </em>inmate\u2019s motion to determine if it is cognizable under a different statutory framework.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1322 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In this case, James did not specify the statutory basis upon which he requested the court to correct his sentence. Nonetheless, James\u2019s \u201cmotion could be construed as an appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 motion, or a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. None of these constructions, however, aid [James].\u201d <em>Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2; <em>see also United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1317-19 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that a district court has no inherent authority to modify a sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">First, \u00a7 3742(a) allows a defendant to file a direct appeal from his sentence if it was, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cimposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2). However, James waited nearly 10 years to file such an appeal, well beyond the 10-day deadline. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i); <em>Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Second, \u201cRule 35 only allows sentence modification for: (1) correcting arithmetical, technical, or other clear error within 7 days after sentencing, or (2) reducing a sentence for substantial assistance to the government.\u201d <em>Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2 (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a)-(b). In this case, James \u201cis not entitled to relief under either option because he filed his motion well after the 7-day limitation period and his claim did not involve substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Third, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a defendant to obtain a sentencing reduction where his guideline range has been subsequently lowered by a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). James, however, explicitly stated below that he was not relying on \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Indeed, it is clear that James seeks to challenge \u201cthe <em>application </em>of the guidelines ... and does not reference any guideline amendment, making \u00a7 3582(c)(2) inapplicable.\u201d <em>Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">Finally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 permits a defendant in federal custody to collaterally attack his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). In this case, James specifically instructed the court not to construe his actual innocence motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion. On the other hand, James repeatedly instructed the court to construe his motion under whatever statute might afford him relief, and he discussed the actual innocence exception to the procedural default doctrine, implying that he was in fact bringing a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Regardless of these mixed signals, the government contends the court could not have liberally construed James\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion because James did not obtain authorization from this Court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. However, it does not appear that James was required to obtain authorization from this Court because the district court denied James\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 as moot, not with prejudice. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) (\u201cBefore a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tion.\u201d); cf. <em>Walker v. Crosby, </em>341 F.3d 1240, 1245 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cAppellant\u2019s 2001 application was not a second or successive application under \u00a7 2244(b) because Appellant\u2019s 1998 application was dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Nonetheless, even if the court could have construed James\u2019s motion as an original \u00a7 2255 motion, James would not have been entitled to relief. This is so because James\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion would have been untimely, as there is \u201ca one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, which begins to run following one of four events, the relevant trigger in this case being \u2018the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Drury v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1295, 1296 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 159, 172 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). James\u2019s judgment of conviction became final, at the very latest, in 1998 when he failed to appeal from the court\u2019s amended judgment. <em>See Mederos v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1252, 1253 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that the mov-ant\u2019s judgment of conviction became final ten days after it was entered because he did not file a timely notice of appeal). Thus, the district court would have dismissed James\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely had it been construed as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In sum, there is no statutory basis upon which the district court could have granted James relief. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">. The other three triggering dates in \u00a7 2255 have no application to this case, as there is no indication of any impediment created by unlawful governmental action, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(0(2), James is not attempting to capitalize on a right newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactive to cases on collateral review, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2255(0(3), and there is nothing to suggest that James was previously unable to discover the facts supporting his claim through the exercise of due diligence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2255(0(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
