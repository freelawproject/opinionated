After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Tate\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 516 to the Sentencing Guidelines,, which reduced the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to offenses involving marijuana plants. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 516 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">However, Tate already filed one \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 516 in 1996. The district court denied that motion because Tate\u2019s sentencing range was based on the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and thus was not affected by Amendment 516. This Court affirmed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Tate, </em>No. 97-2603, 134 F.3d 386 (11th Cir. Dec. 31, 1997) (unpublished). This ruling became the law of the case and precludes Tate\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion on the same ground. <em>See United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cUnder the law of the case doctrine, both the district court and the court of appeals are bound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case.... \u201d). In any event, our recent case law reconfirms that Tate\u2019s Amendment 516 claim is meritless for the reasons previously given by this Court and the district court. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that, where a defendant is sentenced as a career offender and his base offense level is set by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, an amendment that changes the base offense levels in the drug quantity tables of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), has no effect on the sentencing range and the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">To the extent Tate argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), entitles him to a sentence reduction, <em>Booker </em>does not present us with an opportunity to circumvent the law of the case doctrine. <em>See Stinson, </em>97 F.3d at 469 (outlining three exceptions to the law of the case doctrine, none of which apply to Tate\u2019s present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). As the district court correctly concluded, <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-25\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\" <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">.
