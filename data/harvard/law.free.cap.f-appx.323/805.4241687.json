His motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, McDuffie argues the district court erred by denying his motion based on its finding that he was sentenced as a career offender, and it should have considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in evaluating his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-26\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number><em>v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted, however, that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">McDuffie\u2019s arguments on appeal are foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant sentenced as a career offender, whose Guidelines range is not affected by Amendment 706, is not eligible for sentence reductions), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and </em>cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent jurisdictional basis for an ineligible defendant to receive a reduction). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
