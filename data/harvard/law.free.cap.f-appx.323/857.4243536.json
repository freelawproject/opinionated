On appeal, Eastmond argues that (1) the BIA erred in finding that his conviction, which was not a drug trafficking crime, was an aggravated felony, and (2) the IJ abused its discretion and violated his due process rights by not granting him a continuance in his immigration hearing in order to resolve a \u201csituation\u201d in his criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have jurisdiction to consider a petition for review. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal when the alien is removable for having committed a criminal offense covered in Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii), (a)(2)(B). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2006). We have held, however, that, under \u00a7 1252, we retain jurisdiction to review whether the petitioner meets the qualifications for the jurisdictional bar, which require a finding that he (1) is an alien, (2) who is removable, (3) by reason of having committed a crime covered by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1311. Additionally, notwithstanding \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1311. We do not have jurisdiction, however, to consider claims that were not raised before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1227, an alien is removable if he is convicted of (1) an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), or (2) violated a law related to a controlled substance, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). An offense is an aggravated felony for immigration purposes if it involves the trafficking of a controlled substance, including a \u201cdrug trafficking crime,\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(A)(43)(B). \u201cDrug trafficking crime\u201d is defined as any felony punishable under the CSA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). A crime is a felony if the statutory maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>term of imprisonment is more than one year. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a). Pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, <em>et seq, </em>it is unlawful for an individual to knowingly possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The maximum sentence for a crime involving cocaine is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">The IJ did not err in finding that East-mond\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony because his violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) was a felony punishable under the CSA. We lack jurisdiction to consider Eastmond\u2019s argument that the IJ abused his discretion and violated Eastmond\u2019s due process rights by not granting a continuance because he did not raise this issue before the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-16\">.
