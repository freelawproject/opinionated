On appeal, Baxter, who was sentenced based on his status as a career offender, argues that the district court erred in refusing to reduce his sentence, on the ground that <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory and, thus, gave the district court discretion to reduce his sentence despite the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-22\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-23\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence modification is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-24\">Lowe\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. In <em>Moore, </em>we held that where a defendant\u2019s base offense level is calculated under the career offender provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Amendment 706 does not operate to lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range and, therefore, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). 541 F.3d at 1330. Moreover, in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>we held that a district court\u2019s discretion to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is limited by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. 556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that it lacked authority to reduce Lowe\u2019s sentence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
