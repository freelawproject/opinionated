Because Garcia had a prior conviction for a felony drug-trafficking offense, Garcia\u2019s base offense level was increased 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The district court sentenced Garcia within the applicable guidelines range to 80 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of non-reporting supervised release. Garcia filed a timely notice of appeal and now challenges the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">Garcia concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-18\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201c \u2018a sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u2019\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Garcia also contends that his 80-month sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Garcia points out that the instant offense did not involve violent conduct and did not pose a danger to others. He contends that the offense was not inherently evil and \u201cwas, at bottom, an international trespass.\u201d He contends also that the guidelines range did not account for his age, his personal history of substance abuse, or his motivation for reentering the United States. The district court heard Garcia\u2019s argument for leniency, but the court pointed out Garcia\u2019s extensive criminal history and ultimately determined in its discretion that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate. Garcia has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in selecting a sentence or, consequently, that the within-guidelines sentence imposed is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
