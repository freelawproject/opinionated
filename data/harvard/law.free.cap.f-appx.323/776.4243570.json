Wilder, through counsel, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion for a reduced sentence, filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Wilder\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Wilder argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on his status as a career offender because he received a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and was not sentenced \u201cwithin the career offender sentencing range.\u201d He also submits that the district court erred by not considering the reasonableness of his sentence and the racial disparity created by the crack-to-powder-cocaine ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), we held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a'career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and the range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then the sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d We noted that the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of the career offender range for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. Thus, even though Amendment 706 was retroactive, the district court was not authorized to reduce the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. We held that this result was the same when a defendant received a downward departure for his substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), stating that there was \u201cno basis for concluding that the reduction of [the defendant\u2019s] base offense level lowered the sentencing range relied upon by the district court in determining his sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Just as in <em>Moore, </em>Wilder\u2019s sentencing range was determined by his career offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and his crack cocaine base offense level played no role in his ultimate sentence. Thus, Wilder was not sentenced under the otherwise applicable base offense level in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and he is ineligible for relief under Amendment 706. <em>See. Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327, 1330; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d). This outcome is not changed by the fact that Wilder received a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because there is no indication that the court based his sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Moreover, the district court did not have authority to reduce Wilder\u2019s sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), based on its reasonableness or the crack-to-powder-cocaine ratio. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that <em>Booker </em>itself does not render a defendant eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Wilder\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
