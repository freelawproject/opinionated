The district court denied IFP and certified that Gonzalez^-Longoria\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Gonzalez-Longoria is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">On appeal, Gonzalez-Longoria does not addresses the threshold issue of whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider his motion to show cause. Gonzalez-Longoria\u2019s motion to show cause was an unauthorized motion that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Gonzalez-Longoria\u2019s appeal is from the denial of that unauthorized motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">'Gonzalez-Longoria\u2019s appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits, and it is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Gonzalez-Longoria\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
