Kwee sought asylum alleging that she suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution by Indonesia\u2019s Muslim majority based upon her status as an ethnic Chinese Christian. The IJ denied her request concluding that she had not established past persecution and also that she failed to show a nexus between her religious beliefs and her fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-27\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without a separate opinion, thus we review the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). We will not reverse a factual determination unless the records compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). To be eligible for asylum, the applicant must prove that she is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the INA. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish refugee status, the applicant must show, with specific and credible evidence, either past persecution or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[A]n applicant can establish eligibility for asylum as long as he can show that the persecution is, <em>at least in part, </em>motivated by a protected ground.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1232 (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) (requiring in post-REAL ID Act cases that the claimed protected ground \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant\u201d). A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">If an applicant fails to establish past persecution, he can prove eligibility for asylum by showing (1) a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i); <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007. The subjective component can be satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that she genuinely fears persecution. <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1007. The objective prong can be satisfied by establishing that the applicant has a good reason to fear future persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that Kwee has not shown that the incidents which she alleges constitute past persecution, e.g. being in a group of people who were pulled off of public transportation by Muslims, being run out of her pastor\u2019s home, and receiving threatening phone calls, were \u201con account of\u2019 her religious beliefs or ethnicity. As to the phone calls and the incident at her pastor\u2019s house, she was unable to identify who the perpetrators were or why they targeted her. Kwee also testified that Muslims tried to prevent her neighbors from using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>public transportation, but this applied to both Christians and Muslims. Thus, even were we to conclude that these incidents constitute past persecution, which we need not do, Kwee has not presented- evidence linking them to a protected ground. Likewise, we conclude that she has not shown a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
