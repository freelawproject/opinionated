The district court denied Bagby IFP status on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith under \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Bagby is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Bagby argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because he can prove all the \u201cfacts\u201d in support of his complaint and because \u201che is not a lawyer.\u201d However, he fails to address the district court\u2019s findings that his slander claim was not cognizable in a federal action and that the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 were lacking. Bagby'has thus abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of IFP on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). To the extent that Bagby argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend his complaint, there was no error inasmuch as Bagby\u2019s proposed amendment would have been futile. <em>See Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-23\">Bagby has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Bagby\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-24\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Bagby\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bagby is- warned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g). Bag-by\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
