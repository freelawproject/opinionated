In 2006, the district court granted Robinson\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) lowering his original life sentence to a 400-month term of imprisonment. Robinson now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal as successive of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. He asserts that the instant motion was not successive because it raised a challenge to the 2006 sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">To the extent that Robinson is challenging the fact that his sentence was enhanced based on facts not admitted by him or found by a jury, those factual findings were made by the district court in conjunction with the original sentencing, and those claims thus constitute a successive \u00a7 2255 challenge to the original criminal proceeding. <em>See United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, </em>211 F.3d 862, 869 (5th Cir.2000). In his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, however, Robinson argued that the district court improperly applied the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion during the 2006 resentencing. As the Government concedes, this issue could not have been raised in conjunction with the original sentencing and it is thus not successive. Nevertheless, Robinson <em>could </em>have raised this claim in a direct appeal from his resentencing, but because but he did not do so the claim is procedurally barred from collateral review absent cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result. <em>See United States v. Kallestad, </em>236 F.3d 225, 227 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">When the movant has been given notice of a procedural default and an opportunity to argue against the procedural bar, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the Government has not intentionally waived the bar, we may raise the issue <em>sua sponte. See Smith v. Johnson, </em>216 F.3d 521, 523-24 (5th Cir.2000). , We therefore requested supplemental briefs on the procedural default issue from Robinson and the Government, and both parties have complied. As cause for failing to file a direct appeal from his resentencing, Robinson argues that he was resentenced in absentia, he lacked appointed counsel, he received the court\u2019s resentencing order over two weeks after it was entered, and the district court did not advise him of his right to appeal. To show cause for a procedural default, a movant must \u201cshow that \u2018some objective factor external to the defense\u2019 prevented him from raising on direct appeal the claim he now advances.\u201d <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>94 F.3d 989, 993 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Robinson\u2019s allegations do not establish \u201ccause\u201d for his procedural default, <em>see id., </em>and we find no waiver of the procedural bar by the Government. Robinson was resentenced in January 2006, yet he did not even file the instant motion until nearly a year later in January 2007. Moreover, Robinson is also required to demonstrate actual prejudice by demonstrating \u201cnot merely that the errors ... created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Quarterman, </em>530 F.3d 336, 341 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Robinson does not even address, much less show, prejudice in his supplemental brief, and the issue is therefore waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Because Robinson fails to overcome the procedural bar, he is not entitled to relief even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that his claim is not successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
