Kelley was sentenced in 2003 to 188 months of imprisonment for distributing five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Kelley concedes, and the record confirms, that his sentence ultimately derived from his designation as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He further acknowledges that his case is controlled by <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), in which we concluded that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines if his sentence was based on the career offender provision under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than on the amount of drugs attributable to him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-22\">We reject Kelley\u2019s invitation to reconsider our decision in <em>Moore. </em>We also reject his argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), renders the guidelines advisory in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. We have previously held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>pet. </em>for cert. filed (Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Kelley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on his ineligibility for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
