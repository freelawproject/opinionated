The following facts are not in dispute. Cardenas was convicted in California in 1993 on one count of unlawful sexual contact with a minor while occupying a position of special trust, and his sentence included a lifelong obligation to register as a sex offender. Between 1993 and 1999, Cardenas filed various updates to his registration in California, all of which provided that his responsibility to register was a lifelong requirement. In early February 2007, Cardenas traveled from California to Palm Beach County, Florida. From that time until his arrest in May 2007, Cardenas neither updated his California registration nor filed a new registration in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">On appeal, Cardenas argues that we held in <em>United States v. Madera, </em>528 F.3d 852 (11th Cir.2008), that an individual convicted of a sex offense prior to SOR-NA could not be prosecuted for failing to register during the gap period between SORNA\u2019s enactment and the Attorney General\u2019s ruling that SORNA applied retroactively to all sex offenders, regardless of when they were convicted. Therefore, Cardenas asserts, because the material facts of <em>Madera </em>and this case are essentially identical, his conviction is due to be reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1118 (11th Cir.2006). We also review issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Anton, </em>546 F.3d 1355, 1357 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">The Adam Walsh Child and Safety Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587, was enacted on July 27, 2006. Title I of the Act, SORNA, created a national sex offender registry law. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-248, \u00a7\u00a7 101-55,120 Stat. 587, 590-611. SORNA\u2019s registry requirements provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-15\">(a) In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-16\">A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-17\">(b) Initial registration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-18\">The sex offender shall initially register\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-19\">(1) before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>giving rise to the registration requirement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">(2) not later than 3 business days after being sentenced for that offense, if the sex offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-5\">(c) Keeping the registration current</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-6\">A sex offender shall, not later than 3 business days after each change of name, residence, employment, or student status, appear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and inform that jurisdiction of all changes in the information required for that offender in the sex offender registry. That jurisdiction shall immediately provide that information to all other jurisdictions in which the offender is required to register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-7\">(d) Initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b) of this section</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-8\">The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before July 27, 2006 or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction, and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913. Acting pursuant to \u00a7 16913(d), the Attorney General issued a ruling on February 28, 2007, that \u201c[t]he requirements of [SORNA] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SOR-NA].\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 72.3. Moreover, SOR-NA created a federal crime for whoever:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-10\">(1) is required to register under [SOR-NA];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-11\">(2)(A) is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of [SORNA] by reason of a conviction under Federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice), the law of the District of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law of any territory or possession of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-13\">(B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-14\">(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">We first addressed a timing issue involving a SORNA prosecution in <em>Madera. </em>The defendant was convicted of sexual abuse in New York and moved to Florida, both of which occurred prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment. 528 F.3d at 854. After SOR-NA was enacted, but before the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity ruling, the defendant was indicted under \u00a7 2250 for failing to register. <em>Id. </em>The district court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, finding, prior to the Attorney General\u2019s ruling, that SORNA applied retroactively as of the date its enactment. <em>Id. </em>at 854, 856. On appeal, we reversed and concluded that the district court erred in finding that SORNA was retroactive as of the date of its enactment, because \u201cCongress vested the Attorney General with sole discretion to determine SORNA\u2019s ret-roactivity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858. Moreover, we stated that because \u201cthe Attorney General had sole discretion to determine whether or not SORNA was to be retroactively applied to sex offenders convicted before its enactment date, it only stands to reason that SORNA\u2019s scope was undefined prior to that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858-59. Therefore, we held that \u201c[b]ecause [the defendant\u2019s] indictment concerns his failure to register during the gap period between SORNA\u2019s enactment and the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>he cannot be prosecuted for violating SOR-NA during that time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">We recently revisited SORNA in <em>United States v. Dumont, </em>555 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2009), where the defendant was convicted of a sex offense prior to SORNA, traveled interstate in the gap period between SORNA\u2019s enactment and the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity ruling, and was indicted and convicted after the Attorney General\u2019s ruling for failing to register \u201cfrom in or about February 15, 2007, continuing through on or about May 16, 2007.\u201d We affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction on appeal, concluding that his obligation to register arose on the date of the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity determination, that the defendant thereafter had three business days to register in accordance with \u00a7 16913(c), and that after such time he was in violation of \u00a7 2250. <em>Id. </em>at 1291. We further held that the \u201cfact that [the defendant\u2019s interstate travel] occurred prior to the retroactivity determination does not preclude his prosecution under SORNA,\u201d because \u201c \u00a7 2250 criminalizes a sex offender\u2019s failure to register after traveling in interstate or foreign commerce, and the \u2018travels\u2019 language provides a jurisdictional basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Here, the undisputed facts are essentially identical to <em>Dumont, </em>in that Cardenas was convicted of a sex offense prior to SORNA, traveled interstate in the gap period between SORNA\u2019s enactment and the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity determination, and failed to register as of his arrest on May 9, 2007, which was more than three business days after his obligation to register arose following the Attorney General\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, we conclude that Cardenas committed a violation of \u00a7 2250.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Cardenas\u2019 next three arguments \u2014 that Congress exceeded its constitutional authority by delegating the retroactivity determination to the Attorney General, that SORNA violates the Commerce Clause, and that SORNA violates his procedural and substantive due process rights \u2014 have all recently been rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202 (11th Cir.2009). Therefore, we decline to address them specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">. Although Cardenas presents the issue as an Ex Post Facto Clause violation, his argument is solely that his conviction should be overturned under <em>Madera. </em>Accordingly, he has abandoned any claim under the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\">.
