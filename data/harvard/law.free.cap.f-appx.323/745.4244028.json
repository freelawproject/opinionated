On appeal, Stone argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying him a sentence reduction because the court wrongly considered his juvenile offenses and his post-conviction disciplinary infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-25\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under \u00a7 8582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). In evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted, the district court must first recalculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range under the amended guidelines, and then must consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id,, </em>at 780-81; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)) (2008). The district court also may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Section 3553(a) provides that the court must evaluate, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). While the court must undertake this two-step analysis, its decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence is discretionary. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. We do not require a district court to make specific findings explaining its decision not to resentence a defendant, so long as the court clearly considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and set forth adequate reasons for its refusal to modify the original sentence. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1255 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Here, the record demonstrates that the district court correctly recalculated Stone\u2019s amended guideline range and then properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Stone\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. In exercising its discretion not to reduce Stone\u2019s sentence, the court adequately explained its reasons for denying Stone\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Stone\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
