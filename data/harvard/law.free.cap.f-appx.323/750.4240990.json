Holmes\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The district court did not err. Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Holmes\u2019s sentencing range. Holmes was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.Bd 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d). We affirm the denial of Holmes\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
