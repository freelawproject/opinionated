No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">In April 2003, Matheson was sentenced to a term of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment for his conviction of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, to be followed by a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence imposed for his conviction of possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The total sentence imposed \u2014 -322 months \u2014 was at the high end of the 210 to 262 month guideline range, plus the mandatory 60 months. In March 2008, Matheson filed a motion pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) for retroactive application of Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court determined that Amendment 706 was applicable to Matheson, reduced Matheson\u2019s offense level by two levels, and imposed a new revised total sentence of 270 months (again at the high end of the guidelines range) consisting of 210 months, plus the mandatory 60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Matheson argues \u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that the district court erred by failing to take into consideration his post-sentencing conduct and rehabilitation when crafting the revised sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Matheson, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court has authority to depart from the guidelines when imposing a new sentence under section 3582. Matheson argues that the district court should have requested an updated presentence investigation report to inform the district court\u2019s decision-making process in crafting a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009); if section 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). But arguments raised for the first time on appeal are subject only to plain error review. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">If a district court is authorized to reduce a sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2), it may do so \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. A sentencing adjustment under section 3582(c)(2) allows no full <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3) (\u201cproceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant\u201d); all original sentencing determinations are to remain unchanged with only the amended guideline range substituted for the unamended guideline range used at sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n.2; <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 n. 4 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">We reject Matheson\u2019s post-sentencing-behavior-based claim of error. The policy statement generally applicable to section 3582(c)(2) proceedings allows \u2014 but mandates no \u2014 consideration of post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. n.l(B)(iii). If the district court failed to consider Matheson\u2019s post-sentencing conduct (we do not say), this failure could not support plain error relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">And <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), precludes Matheson\u2019s claim of <em>Booker </em>error. In <em>Melvin, </em>we concluded that <em>Booker </em>and its progeny have no application to section 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Under <em>Melvin, </em>a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by section 3582(c)(2) and the applicable Sentencing Commission policy statements. Resen-tencing under section 3582(c)(2) allows a district court no discretion to impose a non-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-14\">. Amendment 706 revised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by reducing by two levels the offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. Subject to technical changes effected by Amendment 711, Amendment 706 was made retroactive as of 3 March 2008 by Amendment 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\">. Before the district court, Matheson argued only that the district court should revisit the original drug-amount calculation used when his sentence was imposed in April 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
