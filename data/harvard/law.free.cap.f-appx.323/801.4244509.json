Marshall was originally sentenced in 1992 to 360 months of imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Rl-575 at 1. Pursuant to Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court determined he was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendments 706 and 711 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses two levels. Rl-577. The court sentenced Marshall to 324 months of imprisonment \u2014 the minimum term permitted by the amended guideline range. <em>Id.; </em>Rl-572 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">The only issue on appeal is whether the district court had discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to treat the guidelines as advisory and further reduce Marshall\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range. The answer is no. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (\u201cConcluding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, we hold that a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-13\">. <em>Kimbrough v.
