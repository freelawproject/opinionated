Sande are taxpayers suing the United States, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433, in connection with the filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Section 7433 authorizes a damages action if an Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) officer or employee intentionally, recklessly or negligently disregards the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) or IRS regulations \u201cin connection with any collection of Federal tax.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a). The district court granted the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">On December 20, 2004, after conducting an audit, the IRS assessed additional income tax in the amount of $22,019.00 against Plaintiffs for the 1997 tax year. The IRS also imposed a fraud penalty of $16,514.25. On November 30, 2005,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the IRS filed a Notice of Federal Tax Lien against Plaintiffs in conjunction with the 1997 tax-year assessment and penalty in the Volusia County Clerk\u2019s Office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">On November 12, 2007, Plaintiffs filed an administrative claim for damages under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>\u00a7 7438 with the IRS challenging its filing of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien as to the 1997 tax-year assessment. Plaintiffs claimed that the filing of the Notice caused Mr. Sande\u2019s drywall company $1,800,000.00 in lost income and sought $1,000,000.00 in damages. The basis for the Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 7433 administrative claim was that the Notice of Federal Tax Lien was wrongfully filed because the underlying assessment was made more than three years after the filing of their December 30, 2000 amended return for tax year 1997. The IRS denied Plaintiffs\u2019 administrative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Plaintiffs filed this action in district court asserting a \u00a7 7433 claim. After Plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint was dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint repleading their \u00a7 7433 claim. According to the amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\"><em>Because there was no tax liability of the Plaintiffs in this matter </em>and because officer(s) and/or employee(s) of the IRS recklessly or intentionally, or by reason of negligence disregarded IRC \u00a7 6321 [by reason of no tax liability of the Plaintiffs] by filing an unlawful Notice of Federal Tax Lien against the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs have a cause of action for damages against the Defendant as set forth further in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Pis.\u2019 Compl. \u00b6 4 (emphasis added, brackets in original). The amended complaint explained that the assessment for the 1997 tax year was not \u201clawfully collectable from Plaintiffs\u201d because it was \u201ccompleted in excess of the three (3) year statute of limitation period for the assessment\u201d as provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-21. Thus, \u201cany collection activity by the IRS\u201d was also \u201ctime-barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 19. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint did not state any other ground on which the Notice was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The district court granted the United States\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion and dismissed the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint was \u201cseeking to challenge the assessment of their taxes, not the collection, as the only impropriety alleged is that the Defendant is seeking to collect a tax debt that they do not owe.\u201d Because \u00a7 7433 provides a remedy only for improper collection activities, the district court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">As noted above, \u00a7 7433 authorizes a damages claim where an IRS officer or employee intentionally, recklessly or negligently disregards the IRC or IRS regulations \u201cin connection with any <em>collection </em>of Federal tax.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a) (emphasis added). The parties agree that \u00a7 7433 provides a remedy only for improper collection activities, not for an improper assessment of taxes. Thus, courts have not permitted a taxpayer\u2019s \u00a7 7433 damages action when the gravamen of the claim is that the IRS improperly assessed tax liability. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. United States, </em>66 F.3d 220, 222-23 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Shaw v. United States, </em>20 F.3d 182, 184 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Gonsalves v. IRS, </em>975 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>13, 16 (1st Cir.1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The only question presented in this appeal is whether the allegedly wrongful filing of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien was a collection activity cognizable under \u00a7 7433.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Although the act of filing a Notice of Federal Tax Lien is in connection with tax collection, the error Plaintiffs asserted in their amended complaint was not a procedural one. That is, Plaintiffs did not allege that the IRS failed to follow the proper procedures in either the IRC or IRS regulations for filing a lien notice. <em>See, e.g., </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323 (outlining procedural requirements for the filing of certain notices of liens); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6323(a)-l to (j)-l (same).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, Plaintiffs contended that the Notice of Federal Tax Lien was \u201cunlawful\u201d because the underlying tax assessment was barred by the three-year statute of limitations in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the essence of Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that no taxes were owed and not that the procedures used to collect the unpaid taxes were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Plaintiffs cite 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321, which is found in the collection portion of the IRC and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">If any person liable to pay any tax neglects' or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. Plaintiffs argue that by filing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien when Plaintiffs were not in fact \u201cliable to pay any tax,\u201d IRS officials disregarded \u00a7 6321. However, \u00a7 6321 creates a statutory lien that arises automatically once an assessment is made and the IRS gives notice and demands payment. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6303(a), 6322 (providing that the lien imposed by \u00a7 6321 arises \u201cat the time the assessment is made,\u201d after which the IRS gives notice of the amount due and demands payment).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It does not govern the conduct of any IRS official or employee in filing a notice of the tax lien or in attempting to collect the taxes owed and, thus, cannot be the basis for a \u00a7 7433 claim. To hold otherwise would eviscerate the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>tinction between claims for wrongful assessment and claims for wrongful collection. When a taxpayer fails to pay a tax assessment after the IRS gives notice and makes a demand, the mere filing of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien in a manner that conforms to the procedures outlined in the code and regulations is not actionable under \u00a7 7433.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">For the first time on appeal, Plaintiffs offer two alternative grounds for why the Notice of Federal Tax Lien was wrongfully filed: (1) the Notice was premature under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(j) because Plaintiffs had submitted several amended tax returns that resulted in a credit that could have been used to satisfy the tax liability; and (2) the Notice should not have been filed while Plaintiffs\u2019 application to the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7811, for a taxpayer assistance order was pending. Because Plaintiffs did not raise these claims before the IRS, they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect to them. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(d) (imposing a mandatory exhaustion requirement); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-1(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, we do not address arguments that were not raised in the district court. <em>See McGinnis v. Ingram Equip. Co., Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1491, 1495 (11th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we do not address Plaintiffs\u2019 alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, the district court properly concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint failed to state a claim under \u00a7 7433. Thus, the district court did not err in granting the United States\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\">.We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>United Techs. Corp. v. Mazer, </em>556 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2009). In so doing, we accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>Dismissal is appropriate only if the plaintiff's factual allegations \" \u2018raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270 (quoting <em>Bell Atl.

Although Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleges that the Notice of Filing Tax Lien was filed on November 18, 2005, the copy of the Notice attached to the amended complaint is stamped filed on November 30, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-20\">. The Notice of Fedei'al Tax Lien also listed assessments for tax years 1998, 1999 and 2000 totaling $156,432.89; $99,966.44 and $181,505.61, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">. Section 7433(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">If, in connection with any collection of Federal tax with respect to a taxpayer, any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service recklessly or intentionally, or by reason of negligence disregards any provision of this title, or any regulation promulgated under this title, such taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the United States in a district court of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\">. An assessment is made by the recording of a taxpayer's liability in the office of the Secretary of the IRS. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6203; <em>Hibbs v. Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 101, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 2285-86, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004) (defining \u201cassessment\u201d as \u201cthe official recording of liability that triggers levy and collection efforts\u201d). An assessment by necessity precedes any collection activity. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a) (providing that notice and demand for payment, which begins the IRS's collection process, occurs after an assessment is made).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">. Notably, the IRC and IRS regulations provide for an administrative appeal of an erroneous filing of a notice of federal tax lien and judicial review of the agency's determination. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6326(a), 6330(d); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6326-1. It does not appear from the record that Plaintiffs availed themselves of this avenue for review. Instead, Plaintiffs filed an administrative claim pursuant to 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-1, the regulation regarding unauthorized collection actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b841-12\">. The United States argues that \u00a7 6501 (a)'s three-year limitations period did not apply in Plaintiffs\u2019 assessment because it arose out of taxpayer fraud. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(c)(1) (providing that tax may be assessed \u201cat any time\u201d in a case of a fraudulent tax return). Because the validity of the underlying assessment is not at issue in a \u00a7 7433 proceeding, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b841-13\">. Plaintiffs do not argue that the IRS failed to comply with the notice and demand requirements of \u00a7 6303(a), and exhibits attached to the amended complaint indicate that the IRS gave Plaintiffs notice before filing the Notice of Federal Tax Lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">. We reject Plaintiffs contention that these alternative arguments fall within their allegation that the Notice of Filing Tax Lien was \"time-barred.\u201d In both the IRS administrative appeal and the district court proceedings, Plaintiffs' only time-bar argument was in relation to the three-year statute of limitations found in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
