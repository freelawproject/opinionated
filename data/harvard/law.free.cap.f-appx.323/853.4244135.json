Vance contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable under the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-25\">We review the reasonableness of sentences imposed by the district court only for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-26\">Vance was sentenced at the low end of his guideline range. Although we do not presume a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable, we expect that it ordinarily will be. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Still, Vance\u2019s argues that he was entitled to a downward variance by analogizing his case to <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir.2006), where we affirmed the district court decision to vary downward from the guideline range for a defendant convicted of a crack cocaine offense. Like Vance, the defendant\u2019s sentence in <em>Williams </em>was subject to a career offender enhancement. We are unconvinced by Vance\u2019s argument. Just because it was reasonable for the district court to vary downward in the <em>Williams </em>case does not mean that it was required to vary downward in this case. The record reflects that the district court considered the <em>Williams </em>case but ultimately concluded that Vance\u2019s case did not warrant a similar downward variance because of Vance\u2019s more substantial criminal record and the amount of crack cocaine involved in Vance\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Vance also argues that his sentence was unreasonable because of the disparity between powder and crack cocaine sentences and the disproportionate impact that disparity has on minorities. Although those arguments may have been sufficient to justify a downward variance by the district court, they are insufficient to require such a variance. The district court properly considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when determining Vance\u2019s sentence. We are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and quotation omitted). Vance\u2019s within-guidelines sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
