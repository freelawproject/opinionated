The Immigration Judge found, based on the totality of the record and Mytyuk\u2019s demeanor during his testimony, that Mytyuk was not credible and was therefore not entitled to relief, noting specifically the significant inconsistencies between My-tyuk\u2019s written application and his oral testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Like his brief before the BIA, Mytyuk\u2019s brief before this court fails to address the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility finding beyond mere conelusional representations of his truthfulness. He has therefore waived review of that issue by virtue of his inadequate briefing. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Insofar as Mytyuk has adduced additional evidence outside of the administrative record, it is not considered. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 391 n. 15 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">PETITION DENIED; MOTION FOR DISCOVERY DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-4\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
