Littles, </em>66 Fed.Appx. 844 PIN (11th Cir.2003), we affirmed Ben Littles\u2019s conviction and 235 months\u2019 prison sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. On February 29, 2008, Lit-tles moved the district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. The district court, relying on a supplemental presentence report and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, granted his motion and reduced his prison term to 188 months. Littles now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended Guidelines sentence range. He contends that, despite the language of \u00a7 1B1.10, which constrains the court\u2019s authority to vary from the amended sentence range, that section, like all of the Guidelines, is merely advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentence range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Littles\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and thus the court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and does not have the authority to sentence below the amended Guidelines sentence range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
