The case proceeded to a jury trial. After the parties rested, the district court granted AISD\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the Title IX claim under Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Rule of Civil Procedure 50. Howell appeals this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The parties are familiar with the facts of this Title IX case. Our review of Rule 50 motions is <em>de novo, </em>and we use the same standard as the district court. <em>Gomez v. St. Jude Med. Daig Div. Inc., </em>442 F.3d 919, 927 (5th Cir.2006). We consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party \u2014 here, Howell. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, after considering the district court\u2019s judgment, the record, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. The district court did not err in finding that Howell could not, on this record, prove the required elements of a Title IX claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">A Title IX plaintiff seeking damages through an implied right of action must clear a high bar on the issue of the supervisor\u2019s knowledge of the claimed discrimination. \u201c[A] damages remedy will not lie under Title IX unless an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient\u2019s behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient\u2019s programs and fails adequately to respond.\u201d <em>Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>524 U.S. 274, 290, 118 S.Ct. 1989, 141 L.Ed.2d 277 (1998). To merit an award of damages under Title IX, the school\u2019s response \u201cmust amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither the evidence of AISD\u2019s knowledge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the conduct at issue, nor the evidence of AISD\u2019s response, meets these requirements. Howell\u2019s key evidence on this point is that the contractor told the band director that he believed Howell was \u201ccoming out\u201d \u2014 divulging his homosexuality \u2014 to him, and that the band director responded that the contractor should stay away from Howell or he would be dismissed. This evidence constitutes neither the level of notice (actual knowledge of abuse) nor the deliberate indifference to discrimination Howell must show in order to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">Howell also claims the district court erred when, on the basis of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) and a previous order of the court, it barred his treating psychologist from testifying without first submitting an expert witness report. We need not decide whether the court\u2019s order excluding the treating psychologist\u2019s testimony was error, because error if any was harmless. Exclusion of the testimony does not appear to have affected the district court\u2019s Rule 50 ruling on the disposi-tive issue of knowledge (and Howell does not contend otherwise).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-16\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-17\">. Howell also originally asserted state-law claims against the school contractor he accused of committing the abuse. After the district court granted AISD\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, however, Howell dismissed the claims against that defendant. Those claims have not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. The district court ruled that notice to the band director constituted notice to the school district.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
