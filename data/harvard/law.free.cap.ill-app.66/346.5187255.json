Jacob Meyer &amp; Bros.,</p> <p id=\"b343-7\" pgmap=\"343\">Gents : Enclosed order of D. Victor. I had four competitors at Higginsville, two Chicago, one St. Louis, one Kansas City. Mr. Victor gave -me half his order, and bought the other half of Frankenthal, St. Louis, on four months-time, dated October 15th; saw the copy. I expect that you Avill accept this order; you know that I make no use of it, but ask this as a special favor; if necessary will have the bill charged to me; he is a relative of S. Espen, and I want his trade.</p> <p id=\"b343-8\" pgmap=\"343\">Tours respectfully,</p> <p id=\"b343-9\" pgmap=\"343\">S. Ruhstadt.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b343-10\" pgmap=\"343\">The appellants sent the goods ordered by Victor, and charged them to him. October 1, 1890, they took the four months\u2019 note of Victor, for the amount, discounted it in bank, and as Victor did not pay the note,- the appellants charged it to the appellee, without his knoivledge or consent.</p> <p id=\"b343-11\" pgmap=\"343(9) 344(67)\">That conduct was no compliance with the letter. When the appellants filled, the order was the time for them to determine, and then inform the appellee, whether they acted upon his Avords \u201c if necessary will have the bill charged to me.\u201d That Avas a proposition, acceptance of which required notice to the appellee, in order to bind him.
