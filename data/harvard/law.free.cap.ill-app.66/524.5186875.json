Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Sec. 91.</p> <p id=\"b522-7\" pgmap=\"522\">To solicit patronage for any legitimate and laudable business, is a matter of common right, which the ciiv can not prohibit unless the power so to do is plainly given. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Sec. 325.</p> <p id=\"b522-8\" pgmap=\"522\">Sec. 1800 of the city ordinance provides that no person shall solicit any person to ride in any coach, unless he shall have a license for that purpose; so far as is shown by the record here presented, there is no way in which any person can obtain a license so to solicit; the ordinance is thus made prohibitory of a legitimate and laudable occupation. No authority to prohibit this business is given in the charter of the city.</p> <p id=\"b522-9\" pgmap=\"522\">The judgment of the Criminal Court is therefore affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
