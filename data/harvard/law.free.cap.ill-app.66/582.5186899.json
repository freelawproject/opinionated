The two latter do not seem to have been served. The bill of review sought to vacate a decree entered July 16, 1890, in the Superior Court, wherein said Wieczorek was plaintiff and said Adamski defendant. Wieczorek and Jalowski having made a warranty deed to Adamski of lots 51 and 53, in block 31, of S. 19, T. 39 N., R. 14, Chicago, Illinois; on August 5, 1890, Wieczorek filed the original bill against Adamski, claiming this deed to be a mortgage to secure the payment of $3,300 and interest. Adamski answered, denying the allegations of this bill. The case was referred to a master, the evidence of the various parties taken, and the master reported, finding that the deed from Wieczorek and Jalowski and wives to Adamski was not a mortgage, but conveyed the title in fee simple to the property in question. On June 2, 1891, a decree was entered confirming the master\u2019s report and dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill for want of equity at plaintiff\u2019s cost. The bill of review sought to set aside this decree for alleged fraud.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-4\" pgmap=\"579\">Edward J. Walsh and Elmer E.

Frank Adamski, lately pending in this court, numbered 128,446, and ail the proceedings had therein, be set aside, and that the said complainant be granted a rehearing in said suit.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b580-5\" pgmap=\"580\">The above is not a final decree. When a decree finally decides and disposes of the whole merits of the controversy, and reserves no questions, or requires no further directions for the future judgment of the court as between the parties and over the same subject-matter, it is a final decree. Mills v. Hoag, 7 Paige Ch. R. 18; Kane v. Whittick, 8 Wend. 219; Daniell\u2019s Ch. PI. &amp; Pr. 993; Puterbaugh\u2019s Ch. Pl. &amp; Pr. (3d Ed.) page 250; Gardner v. Dwelling House Ins.

Johnson v. Everett, 9 Paige Ch. R. 636.</p> <p id=\"b580-7\" pgmap=\"580\">The original bill of the defendant in error, with the answers thereto, is now before the court; upon it the complainant therein is entitled to and requires a hearing; without such hearing, the decree to reverse which this suit is prosecuted, will be of no benefit to him.</p> <p id=\"b580-8\" pgmap=\"580\">That decree being interlocutory only, a writ of error to reverse the same does not lie. The writ is therefore dismissed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
