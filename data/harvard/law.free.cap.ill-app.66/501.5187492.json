He could not play on it. In 1892 he mortgaged it. The case does not show that in 1892 he had any children, nor that anybody ever played upon the instrument.</p> <p id=\"b498-8\" pgmap=\"498\">The piano was taken from him, without process of law, under the mortgage, and he sued and recovered a verdict of $235, but a T&amp;mittiimr brought the amount down to $150, for which he had judgment. The court refused to instruct the jury, at the instance of the appellant, that the words, \u201c necessary household goods,\u201d do not include a piano, unless the same is used as a means of earning a livelihood.</p> <p id=\"b498-10\" pgmap=\"498\">Applied to this case, that instruction ought to have been given.</p> <p id=\"b498-11\" pgmap=\"498\">What necessity can a man have for a piano that is not used?</p> <p id=\"b498-12\" pgmap=\"498\">There is a great deal more in the case, which on this appeal, need not be considered.</p> <p id=\"b498-13\" pgmap=\"498\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b498-14\" pgmap=\"498\">Shepard, P.
