Dormueil v. Ward, 108 Ill. 216; Detroit, etc., Mills v. Ledwige, 58 Ill. App. 351.</p> <p id=\"b659-6\" pgmap=\"659\">Non constat, such legal claim will never be established. It might easily happen that though a decree as prayed were had, judgment in the attachment suit Avould never be recovered. Phelps v. Foster, 18 Ill. 309; Shufeldt v. Boehm, 96 Ill. 560.</p> <p id=\"b659-7\" pgmap=\"659\">The only equitable element shoAvn by the bill aside from that Avhich may be found in any claim upon a just legal demand, is the alleged, and admitted, fraudulent transfer by the alleged legal debtor, of the real estate in question; but unless the creditor has an ascertained legal claim against his debtor, he has no concern vrith his frauds. Dewey v. Eckert, 62 Ill. 218.</p> <p id=\"b659-8\" pgmap=\"659\">We see no principle upon which the bill could have been sustained, and the decree is accordingly affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
