By an emergency clause, the act was put into effect the same day.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\" pgmap=\"251\">By the first section of the original act (which has been since extended to authorize insurance against lightning (1879) and tornadoes (1891), it was provided that any number of persons, not less than the thirteen, might associate and form an incorporated company to make insurance on dwelling houses, stores and all kinds of buildings, and upon household furniture and other property, and against loss or damage by fire, and the risks of inland navigation and transportation, and that any company declaring its intention to make insurance against loss or damage by the risks of inland navigation or transportation, should have power to make insurance upon vessels, boats, cargoes, goods, merchandise, freights and other property, against loss and damage by all or any of the risks of lake, river, canal and inland navigation and transportation. The sections next following specify the method of organization and government. The nineteenth section of the act is in part as follows :</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\" pgmap=\"251\">\u201c Section 19.

In neither of these proceedings was it attempted to enlarge the powers of the corporation. The Mutual Fire Insurance Company, of Chicago, Illinois, has therefore precisely the same powers as the Libertyville Mutual Insurance Company.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\" pgmap=\"253\">In 1889, the appellant procured two policies of insurance from the appellee, on its saw mills and machinery in Wash-burn, Bayfield county, Wisconsin.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-8\" pgmap=\"253\">In July, 1890, appellant returned its policies to appellee, and the policies were canceled \"by the appellee.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-9\" pgmap=\"253\">In October, 1890, the auditor of the State ordered an examination of appellee\u2019s affairs, pending which (October 28th) appellee made an ineffectual attempt to assign for the benefit of its creditors.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-10\" pgmap=\"253\">In November, 1890, an information was filed by the attorney-general for the appointment of a receiver and for the winding up of the company, under the authority of an act of 1874, entitled \u201cAn Act in Regard to the Dissolution of Insurance Companies.\u201d 1 S. &amp; C. R. S., Ill., p. 1353. To this proceeding appellee and each of its directors were made parties defendant, and were duly served with process, in compliance with section nine of the act above cited;</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-11\" pgmap=\"253(21) 254(23)\">\u201c The mode of summoning parties into court, the rules of practice, course of procedure, and powers of courts, in cases rising under this act, shall be the same as in ordinary proceedings in equity in this State, except as herein otherwise provided.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-4\" pgmap=\"254\">The appellant was not named as party defendant, and no process ever issued against it at any time during the information proceedings.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\" pgmap=\"254\">In February, 1891, Thomas Parker, Jr., was appointed receiver, and an order of reference was had to Jacob It. Custer, as special master, to take proof of claims against appellee, and to state an account of the amount of the assets of the appellee, and of how much should be paid by the makers of the premium notes respectively to discharge the indebtedness of the company.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\" pgmap=\"254\">The master accordingly brought in a report, wherein he listed all persons who then held, or who had recently held, policies of insurance. The report was filed June 5, 1891, and recommended an assessment of sixty-five per cent upon the actual total liability of each policy holder. July 3,1891, an order was entered in the cause confirming the master\u2019s report and ordering the assessment he recommended.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\" pgmap=\"254\">It was not till after this date that any attempt wTas made to notify appellant of the information proceedings.</p><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-8\" pgmap=\"254\">Wood &amp; Oaklet, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\" pgmap=\"254\">A charter granted to a corporation by the legislature of a .

S. is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"AAz\" pgmap=\"257\">u 1. General Rules : Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, that in the construction of all statutes now in force, or which may hereafter be enacted, the following rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or repugnant to the context of the same statute; that is to say:</blockquote> <p id=\"AL3O\" pgmap=\"257\">First. All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the legislature may be fully carried out.</p> <p id=\"b257-9\" pgmap=\"257(37) 258(18)\">The manifest intention of the legislature would seem to have been to empower the company to insure dwelling houses and other property, because the legislature said that the company might do so. If the legislature had not intended to authorize the insurance of other property, it would have stopped with the mention of specific kinds.</p> <p id=\"b258-5\" pgmap=\"258\">Whatever view may be taken of the charter, the insurance of a saw mill, and the contents of a printing office were, in neither case, in manifest and plain excess of powers conferred. In perfect good faith might each policy have been issued. Such being the case, in this proceeding neither of appellants can derive advantage from the doctrine of ultra vires. Each received a policy of insurance from the insurance company; had the benefit of such contract, while the insurance company had the detriment; and each is estopped to deny the validity of the executed contract. McCormick v. Market Nat. Bank, 61 Ill. App. 33-42; Darst v. Gale, 83 Ill. 139-141; Bradley v. Ballard, 55 Ill. 417; Chicago Bldg. Society v. Crowell, 65 Ill. 458.</p> <p id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">The proceeding under which appellants have been assessed was in a court of equity. Appellants had a right there to appear and show what equitable reasons, if any, existed, why they should not be required to do equity, viz., pay what the insurance of their respective properties had cost.</p> <p id=\"b258-7\" pgmap=\"258\">Although a corporation has made a contract in violation of the express terms of its charter, yet it must account for benefits received thereunder. McCormick v. Market Nat. Bank, 61 Ill. App. 33-42; Green\u2019s Brice\u2019s Ultra Vires, 717.</p> <p id=\"b258-8\" pgmap=\"258\">We see no good reason why appellants should not account for benefits received, and we do not understand that by the judgments below they are made to do more than this.</p> <p id=\"b258-9\" pgmap=\"258\">The judgments of the Circuit Court are therefore affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
