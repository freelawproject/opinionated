The controversy is founded entirely upon agreed facts set forth in the stipulation of the parties, which was read in evidence on the part of the plaintiff in the trial court. This stipulation and exhibit disclose the facts narrated below:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\" pgmap=\"219(198) 220(200)\">Early in the year 1893, the International Music Company \u2014sometimes referred to as the International Temple of Music\u2014contracted with the owners of the First Eegiment armory building, situated on the corner of Michigan avenue and 16th street, in Chicago, for the use and occupation of that building by the music company for musical entertainment purposes during the World\u2019s Fair season, beginning May 1, 1893, and ending October 3, 1893. For the purpose of adequately lighting and ventilating the building during that period the music company, on March 9,1893, entered into a contract with the Chicago Edison Company, whereby that company, for the consideration of \u00a713,000, agreed to furnish and install in said building the electric lighting and ventilating apparatus, and the electric power, as required by the plans and specifications made by Adler &amp; Sullivan, the architects employed by the music company. There were two sets of specifications attached to and made a part of the contract; one relating to the electric lighting, and the other to the ventilating apparatus. In the former, it was stated that the lighting plant was to light the building during the World\u2019s Fair; that it would be temporary in its nature, and that the contractor must, at the expiration of the music company\u2019s lease, remove all apparatus furnished under the contract, and restore the building to its original condition. In the latter, it was provided that the ventilation was to be temporary only, and that the fans, motors and belts, with their foundations and connections, were to be removed from the building, \u201c and become the property of the parties furnishing them originally.\u201d The original bid of the Chicago Edison Company, from which the contract resulted, was conditioned upon the materials and apparatus remaining its property, and the contract itself, which included the work called for by both sets of specifications, the electric lighting and ventilating systems, provided that \u201c all the equipment for electric lighting, power and ventilating, is to remain the property of the Chicago Edison Company, and may be removed by said company on or before (after) November 1,1893.\u201d By the terms of the contract, Chicago Edison Company was to be paid in monthly installments, beginning May 1, 1893, but no payments were to be made until the entire work was performed to the satisfaction of the architects.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-4\" pgmap=\"220\">On April 4, 1893, Chicago Edison Company sub-let so much of the work as related to ventilating apparatus (excepting the electric motors) to the plaintiff, Huyett &amp; Smith Manufacturing Company, by entering into the following contract, which is in the form of a proposal by the latter and an acceptance by the former company :</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\" pgmap=\"220\">\u201c Chicago, April 4, 1893.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACP\" pgmap=\"220\">The Chicago Edison Company, City.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\" pgmap=\"220(78) 221(77)\">Gentlemen: For the sum of thirteen hundred and fifty dollars ($1,350), payable thirty (30) days after the completion and acceptance of the installation, we propose to furnish and erect at First Eegiment Armory Building, corner of Michigan avenue and Sixteenth street, Chicago, a ventilating system, including everything excepting electric motors, in accordance with the specifications of Messrs. Adler &amp; Sullivan, architects, which are hereunto attached and hereby made a part of this proposal. We guarantee that the ventilating system, which we propose to install will do the work required by the specifications, and the entire installation will be made satisfactory to Messrs. Adler &amp; Sullivan, architects. We agree that at the time of the expiration of the amusement season, which is not to be later than December 1, 1893, we will, if you desire us to remove the ventilating system from the building, pay you for the same the sum of $400.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-4\" pgmap=\"221\">It is further agreed that this entire installation will be completed and turned over to you in satisfactory working order not later than May 1, 1893.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\" pgmap=\"221\">The above price does not include any work in connection with the electric motors or belts, and it is agreed that the apparatus shall be accepted or rejected within thirty (30) days after the plant has been installed, and that the use of bottom horizontal fans will not be objectionable.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\" pgmap=\"221\">Respectfully,</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\" pgmap=\"221\">Huyett &amp; Smith Mfg.

It is intended that the foul and heated air will ascend through the light shafts and escape to the outside through certain louvers placed in the end wall of the large skylight in the roof.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-4\" pgmap=\"224\">\u201c Bidders must examine the plans and specifications, take their own measurements at the building, and confer with parties figuring for, or engaged \u25a0 upon other portions of the work, to the end that the apparatus may be made to work successfully as a whole. In connection therewith the owners of the building ar\u00e9 to furnish the space only in which to set the fans and motors, two coves with the continuous opening, and do such wiring as may be necessary to deliver the electric current for operating the motors to the starting-device. Bidders must include the necessary iron or wooden ducts connecting the discharge outlet of each fan to its respective cove, all foundations or other supports for the fans and motors, do all cutting and repairing necessary for the proper installation of the work, and provide a suitable opening for admitting the proper amount of air to each of the fans, leaving the apparatus in successful running order and in operation.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\" pgmap=\"224\">\u201c Fans.\u2014Each fan must have not less than a 43\" x 86\" blast wheel, enclosed in a steel plate casing 44\u00a7\" wide x 113\" high, having a 44\" x 44\" down blast outlet; they must be supplied with a full set of compression grease cups conveniently arranged, and such sized pulleys as will give the proper speed when driven by the motors without the intervention of countershafts.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\" pgmap=\"224\">\u201c Each fan must be in perfect running balance, free from all vibrations, noise and other disagreeable-results, and.have a guaranteed capacity to deliver through the continuous opening of the coves not less than 40,000 cubic feet of air per minute when running at not to exceed 240 revolutions per minute and operated in connection with the constructional complications of the building and the connecting ducts.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\" pgmap=\"224\">Then follow the specifications for motors, which are not included in the contract in question.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\" pgmap=\"224\">Then follows the proposition of the Edison company addressed to Adler &amp; Sullivan, architects, for the doing of the work, and also the agreement between the Chicago Edison Company and the International Temple of Music.</p><attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-3\" pgmap=\"225\">Isham, Lincoln &amp; Beale, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-4\" pgmap=\"225\">Bulklet, Gray &amp; More, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b225-5\" pgmap=\"225\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A1BB\" pgmap=\"225\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b225-6\" pgmap=\"225\">The question in this ease is, upon whom, of two equally innocent parties shall a loss by fire fall.</p> <p id=\"b225-7\" pgmap=\"225\">This must be determined by an ascertainment of whose property it was that the fire destroyed. Where property is without fault destroyed by fire, the loss falls upon the owner. Wells v. Calnan, 107 Mass. 514.</p> <p id=\"b225-8\" pgmap=\"225\">Neither of the parties to the contract under consideration owned the building into which the ventilating apparatus was to be put. Appellant had merely a contract to place a certain plant in the building, and sub-let to appellee the making and installing of ventilating machinery.</p> <p id=\"b225-9\" pgmap=\"225\">The articles placed in the building by appellee were such as could easily have been removed therefrom; indeed, the contract recognizes that such removal was feasible if not probable. It containing the following : \u201cWe agree that if at the time of the expiration of the amusement season, which is not to be later than December 1, 1893, we will, if you desire us to remove the ventilating system from the building, pay you for the same, the sum of $400.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b225-10\" pgmap=\"225\">The contract was executory; it was not a sale of specific goods, and therefore no title passed at the making of the agreement. Benjamin on Sales, Sec. 308, p. 248 of 6th Am. Ed.</p> <p id=\"b225-11\" pgmap=\"225\">If, upon the day of the fire, appellee had resolved and proceeded to take out all or any portion of the material before then by it placed in the building, and to devote such goods to other uses, it would have ' had a right to do so; for the material was yet its property.</p> <p id=\"b225-12\" pgmap=\"225\">It had not agreed to put in any specific fan, but a ventilating system.</p> <p id=\"b225-13\" pgmap=\"225\">It was to be paid $1,350 thirty days after the completion and installation of a ventilating system in accordance with certain plans and specifications.</p> <p id=\"b226-4\" pgmap=\"226\">Such being the case, its property in this building was destroyed by fire.</p> <p id=\"b226-5\" pgmap=\"226\">Upon the trial of this cause, at the instance of the plaintiff, the court held as a proposition of law, the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b226-6\" pgmap=\"226\">\u201c The court hold as a proposition of law upon the agreed facts in this case, that the destruction of the building upon which the contract entered into between the parties was to operate, in effect annulled the contract; it excused the plaintiff from performance of it, and it excused the defendant from paying the contract price, and left the parties in exactly the same condition as though no contract had been made, and therefore that the plaintiff is entitled to recover under the common counts for the value of materials furnished and labor performed.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b226-7\" pgmap=\"226\">The court refused to hold as law in the decision of the case the following\" written propositions of law, or either of them, submitted by counsel for defendant:</p> <p id=\"b226-8\" pgmap=\"226\">I. \u201c The court holds, as a matter of law, that under the agreed statement of facts in this case, the contract of April 4,1893, between the plaintiff and defendant, under which the plaintiff furnished the goods and did the work for which it seeks to recover, was a contract for the sale of chattels, and that at the time of the fire the title to said chattels remained in, and the loss thereof must fall upon, the plaintiff, and therefore the plaintiff can not recover.</p> <p id=\"b226-9\" pgmap=\"226\">II. \u201c The court holds, as a matter of law, that under the agreed facts in this case, there was no implied obligation on the part of the defendant that the building in which the ventilating system was to be installed should remain in. existence until the expiration of the time within which the plaintiff was to perform his contract, and that as the facts are that the building was not in the control of defendant^ that the fire was an inevitable casualty which occurred without its neglect or default, or through its agency, that no benefit accrued to the defendant for the goods furnished or the work done under the contract, and that at the time of the fire the plaintiff\u2019s contract had not been substantially performed, or the work accepted, the plaintiff can not recover in this action.</p> <p id=\"b227-3\" pgmap=\"227\">III. \u201c The court holds, as a matter of law, that under the agreed facts in this case, the plaintiff can not recover.</p> <p id=\"b227-4\" pgmap=\"227\">IV. \u201c The court holds, as a matter of law, that as the contract in this case was not performed on the part of the plaintiff, or its performance prevented by or through the act, neglect, default or agency of the defendant, the plaintiff can not recover on the qucmtum meruit.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b227-5\" pgmap=\"227\">Where, from the nature of a contract, the parties have contemplated the continuing existence of some particular specified thing as the foundation of what was to be done, in the absence of any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist, the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes impossible from the accidental perishing of the thing without the fault of either party. Wells v. Calnan, 107 Mass. 554-517; Taylor v. Caldwell, 3 Best &amp; Smith, 826.</p> <p id=\"b227-6\" pgmap=\"227\">Such was a rule of the civil law. Pothier Traites des Obligations, partie 3, Chap. 6, Art. 3, Sec. 668:</p> <blockquote id=\"b227-7\" pgmap=\"227\">\u201c Si Stichus certo die dari promissus, ante diem moriatur; non tenetur promissor.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b227-8\" pgmap=\"227\">It being undertaken that by a certain da,y, Stichus (a slave) shall be delivered, if before the day he dies, the obligation is at an end. Digest lib. 45, tit. 1.</p> <p id=\"b227-9\" pgmap=\"227\">Such is the rule of the common law in respect to promises to marry.</p> <p id=\"b227-10\" pgmap=\"227\">If the promisor dies before the time at which the nuptials were to be celebrated, the executors of the deceased are not liable. Hyde v. The Dean of Windsor, Cro. Eliz. 552, 553.</p> <p id=\"b227-11\" pgmap=\"227\">And such also is the rule with respect to an author who undertakes to compose a work, and dies before completing it; his executors are discharged from the contract, for it was personal in its nature. 2 Williams on Exctrs. 560, 5th Ed.; Hall v. Wright, E. B. &amp; E. 746-749.</p> <p id=\"b227-12\" pgmap=\"227(38) 228(30)\">Ordinarily, he who undertakes to do a thing, not manifestly impossible, must perform, whatever accidents may happen, for it was his folly to have so promised. 1 Roll.

Florsheim, 44 Ill. App. 320-323.</p> <p id=\"A_K\" pgmap=\"228\">In cases where the performance is personal, and therefore, the person dying, the contract is at an end, the party who has partly performed can not recover upon a quantum meruit an amount which never became due. Lee v. Griffin, 1 Best &amp; Smith, 272; Hyde v. The Dean of Windsor, Cro. Eliz. 552, 553; Hall v. Wright, E. B. &amp; E. 746-749.</p> <p id=\"b228-5\" pgmap=\"228\">Where the continued existence of the thing upon which' work is to be done is presupposed by the contract, one contracting to make certain additions thereto is not entitled to be paid the value of the work already performed when the thing whose existence is essential to performance is, without fault, destroyed.</p> <p id=\"b228-6\" pgmap=\"228\">The contract, if thus untimely ended, without fault of any one, gives to the parties thereto, as against each other, neither equities nor rights. \"Neither being at fault, the loss falls on him whose hopes have been dashed or property destroyed.</p> <p id=\"b228-7\" pgmap=\"228\">The woman engaged to marry a prince can not, when he dies before default, recover damages of his executors. The man who has undertaken to place in a house a ventilating system capable of removal, and which, when destroyed by fire, was his property, loses what he had already done.</p> <p id=\"AdI\" pgmap=\"228\">- In contracts in which performance depends on the continued existence of a given person or thing, a condition is implied that performance is excused by the perishing of such person or thing. Taylor v. Caldwell, 3 Best &amp; Smith, 826, 839, 840; Sparrow v. Songate, W. Jones, 29; Williams v. Lloyd, W. Jones, 179; Coggs v. Bernard, 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 171, 5th Ed.; Appleby v.

McCabe, 53 Wis. 250-258.</p> <p id=\"b228-9\" pgmap=\"228(44) 229(35)\">Where a contract amounts to a bargain and sale of a specific chattel, to be delivered by the vendor at a future day, if the chattel, without the fault of the vendor, perish in the interval, the purchaser must pay the price, while the vendor is excused from, a performance which has thus become impossible. The loss falls on him whose property was, without fault of any one, destroyed. Taylor v. Caldwell, 3 B. &amp; S. 837.</p> <p id=\"b229-4\" pgmap=\"229\">It has been held that a party contracting to repair a building, if the work put from time to time thereon is of such a nature that it, as done, becomes a part of the structure, and thus the property of the owner, if the building without fault be destroyed, the entire loss falls upon such owner, and he must pay the value of the repairs already made. Cleary v. Sohier, 120 Mass. 210.</p> <p id=\"b229-5\" pgmap=\"229\">So too, if the contractor for work upon a building at the time of its destruction was entitled to be paid certain amounts, the loss falls upon the owner, who must pay the sum already by him owing.</p> <p id=\"b229-6\" pgmap=\"229\">Of the cases to which attention is called by appellee, in Schwartz v. Saunders, 46 Ill. 18, the contractor, under the terms of the contract to do merely the carpenter work of a building being erected, had earned, and there was due to him, the amount for which he was allowed a lien.</p> <p id=\"b229-7\" pgmap=\"229\">In Clark v. Busse, 82 Ill. 515, the contractor recovered because when the building was destroyed his work was substantially done.</p> <p id=\"b229-8\" pgmap=\"229\">In Rawson v. Clark, 70 Ill. 656, but for the conduct of the owner the contractor would have completed his work before the building was burned.</p> <p id=\"b229-9\" pgmap=\"229\">In Cleary v. Sohier, 120 Mass. 210, the material furnished, lath and plaster, became at once, when put into place upon the building, a part of it, real property, belonging to the owner of the structure.</p> <p id=\"b229-10\" pgmap=\"229\">The case of Cook et al. v. McCabe, 53 Wis. 250, recognizes the principle herein set forth, that the perishing of a thing whose existence is essential to performance, excuses compliance, and that the loss falls upon him whose property is destroyed, \u201c especially,\u201d as is there said, \u201c where he has the same insured at the time for his benefit.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b229-11\" pgmap=\"229(22) 230(45)\">In Niblo v. Binsse, 1 Keys, 476, the owner \"of a building, who had retained possession and control of the same, was made to pay for work done by contract thereon; it being apparent that the owner, who had, as provided by the contract, paid $7,500 for work already done, was, when the fire occurred, the owner of the work which had then been \u25a0 performed.</p> <p id=\"b230-5\" pgmap=\"230\">Siegel, Cooper &amp; Co. v. Eaton &amp; Prince Co., 60 Ill. App. 639, we are now satisfied was wrongly decided as to $150 not due at the time the premises were destroyed; we adhere to the rule under which the amount due, $1,250, was there allowed.</p> <p id=\"b230-7\" pgmap=\"230\">In such a case as the present, where nothing was due, and the premises are destroyed without fault upon either side, it is an equal misfortune, and neither can recover from the other. Appleby v. Myers, L. R., 2 C. P. Cases, 651, 659; The Pike Electric Co. v. The Richardson Drug Co., 42 Mo. App. 272; Fairbanks v. The Richardson Drug Co., 42 Mo. App. 262; Bacon v. Cobb, 45 Ill. 47; Howell v. Coupland, L. R., 9 Q. B. 462.</p> <p id=\"b230-12\" pgmap=\"230\">We are unable to see, admitting that the contract to install this ventilating plant was terminated by the fire, upon what principle there arose therefrom an obligation upon the part of appellant to pay the value of work previously done. Ho one was at fault; all had been transacted in perfect good faith. The property when destroyed was clearly that of appellee. Why, then, should appellant be compelled to pay for what he never owned or owed for, and from which he had derived no benefit %</p> <p id=\"b230-13\" pgmap=\"230\">It is urged that appellant impliedly contracted that the building in which the ventilating apparatus was to be placed, should continue to exist, and be in a fit condition for the reception of such apparatus.</p> <p id=\"b230-14\" pgmap=\"230(71) 231(69)\">Appellant did not own or have control of such building; and why an implication should be made that appellant so contracted and that appellee did not, is not clear. The implied contract in this regard was that appellant could and would give to appellee reasonable access and opportunity to place the ventilating apparatus in said building; that appellant would not in any way or manner hinder or delay appellee in doing the work, and that the building, the continued existence of which was necessary to the doing the work, should neither directly or by negligence of appellant be rendered unfit for the purposes for which appellee was to use it. 2 C. P. Cases, 651, 659, 661; Taylor v. Caldwell, 3 Best &amp; Smith, 826, 832, 839; Howell v. Coupland, 9 Q. Bench, 462, 465, 467.</p> <p id=\"b231-5\" pgmap=\"231\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed. A judgment will be here entered for the defendant.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b231-6\" pgmap=\"231\">Mr. Presiding Justice Gary</author> <p id=\"AfX\" pgmap=\"231\">dissenting.</p> <p id=\"b231-7\" pgmap=\"231\">It may be laid down as universally true that all contracts, not of record nor under seal, whether written or spoken, expressed or implied, are of the same dignity, and of equally binding force; and that every promise accepted, of which performance by the promisor requires the co-operation of the promisee, implies, by such acceptance, a promise of such co-operation.</p> <p id=\"b231-8\" pgmap=\"231\">To the first of the above propositions I cite 1 Ch. Cont. 5; to the second the authorities cited on page 239 in Morier v. Moran, 58 Ill. App. 235. And therefore if one contracts to put repairs or additions to something of which the other, as between themselves, has possession and control, that other, accepting such contract, impliedly' undertakes that the thing to be repaired, or added to, shall be in condition to receive such repairs or additions.</p> <p id=\"b231-9\" pgmap=\"231\">I am therefore of opinion that Siegel v. Eaton, 60 Ill. App. 639, was rightly decided, and that the judgment in this case should be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
