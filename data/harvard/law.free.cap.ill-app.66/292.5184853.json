No part of the fixtures had been delivered by May 1, 1893. About the 15th of that month a first delivery of a part of the fixtures was made, and all were delivered before the close of June, except a combined counter and show case, which was not delivered till the 19th of July. All of the fixtures were placed in position by July 20th, and were secured to the walls and floor of the store with screws and nails. As the fixtures were placed in the store, they were appropriated to the uses for which they were intended. On the 15th of July, James J. Mullen, secretary of the appellee, called on Mr. Wells in reference to a settlement. Mr. Mullen testified: \u201cMr. Wells had then made an assignment. Wells said tome: 6 You put your goods in place and we will make a settlement.\u2019 We hadn\u2019t the entire work completed, and he insisted that we complete the job, and we did complete it; then I called upon him and wanted him to carry out his agreement, and he refused to do it. He refused to give me any money, refused to give me any satisfaction or settlement of- any kind. I made a demand on him for the money. When he would not give me that, I made a demand on him for the goods; he refused to give me the goods, and we then swore out the writ of replevin and got the goods back. This interview was on the day we swore out the writ or the day before. (The writ was taken out July 21st.) When the demand was made the goods were in place, complete in every detail. No money has been paid me or the company on these goods.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\" pgmap=\"290\">It is insisted by appellant that when demand was made on him, Edgar L. Wells, as appellant\u2019s vendee, was in possession of the store, and was there represented by Clarence S. Wells, a druggist, in his employ as manager of the business. Appellant claims to have sold the store, fixtures, good will and lease to Edgar L. Wells June 17, 1893, and that Clarence S. became manager for Edgar L. between the 17th and 20th of that month. Prior to the sale Clarence S. had managed the drug business for appellant. .</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\" pgmap=\"290\">Appellant, Edgar L., and Clarence S. Wells are brothers. June 27, 1893, appellee\u2019s secretary, Mr. Mullen, saw a notice in the newspapers that appellant had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. July 21st appellee replevied the property.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-7\" pgmap=\"290\">Matthew P.

If there is no term of credit expressed or implied in the dealing, the delivery in such cases is deemed to be conditional and subject. to revocation on the refusal or failure of the purchaser to pay the price.

Cole, 23 Vt. 114.</p> <p id=\"b293-4\" pgmap=\"293\">In the present case it is insisted that there was a waiver of contemporaneous payment.</p> <p id=\"b293-5\" pgmap=\"293\">Whether there was such waiver is a question of fact. As to what will be treated as a waiver, see Martin v. Wirtz, 11 Ill. App. 567; Peabody v. Maguire, 79 Maine, 572; Seed v. Lord, 66 Maine, 580; Stone v. Perry, 60 Maine, 50; Whitney v. Eaton, 15 Gray, 225.</p> <p id=\"b293-6\" pgmap=\"293\">This question the jury determined against appellant.</p> <p id=\"b293-7\" pgmap=\"293\">There was no unrestricted delivery of the goods.</p> <p id=\"b293-8\" pgmap=\"293\">Appellee had contracted to make, place and set up, in appellant\u2019s store, certain fixtures. In the nature of things, appellee could not do this without, from time to time, as the work required, leaving the property in the custody of appellee and fastening it in place, as was necessary. So soon as the work was complete, appellee demanded payment. He was not before entitled to be paid, and when so entitled, he insisted upon his right; payment not being made, he immediately demanded a return of the goods; this being refused, he, without delay, sued out a writ of replevin.</p> <p id=\"b293-9\" pgmap=\"293\">Appellant claims to have sold to his brother the goods obtained from appellee, pending their delivery; that is, that a sale was made, in part, of property contracted for and yet to arrive; and in this suit appellant insists that the goods belong to his brother; yet appellant, having, as he claims, thus sold the goods June 17th, July 7, 1893, wrote to appellee the following letter:</p> <p id=\"b293-10\" pgmap=\"293\">\u201c Chicago, July 7, 1893.</p> <p id=\"b293-11\" pgmap=\"293\">Merle &amp; Heaney Mfg. Co., City.</p> <p id=\"b293-12\" pgmap=\"293(11) 294(83)\">Gentlemen : I am surprised, on my return to the city, to find that you have failed to furnish and put in position a considerable portion of the fixtures purchased from you. I demand that you at once proceed to finish these fixtures according to contract, and place them in position, and I shall hold you responsible for any damages that may result from your delay in putting these fixtures in shape. I have been greatly delayed and incommoded since the first of May by your failure to keep the terms of xmur contract.</p> <p id=\"b294-4\" pgmap=\"294\">Bespectfully yours,</p> <p id=\"b294-5\" pgmap=\"294\">B. A. Wells.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b294-6\" pgmap=\"294\">According to the unmistakable terms of the contract, appellant had only, at the most, a conditional title to these goods at the time he claims to have sold them.</p> <p id=\"b294-7\" pgmap=\"294\">The goods were not shown to have been attached to the building, other than is customary in the case of removable trade fixtures. All of the articles are such as are easily movable, and while sustained in place by nails and screws, are such as it is customary and easy, without affecting the realty, for tenants to put in and remove; they do not appear to have been affixed in such a way as to make them a part of the realty.</p> <p id=\"b294-8\" pgmap=\"294\">The contract was for the manufacture and sale of chattels, which never became else.</p> <p id=\"b294-9\" pgmap=\"294\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
