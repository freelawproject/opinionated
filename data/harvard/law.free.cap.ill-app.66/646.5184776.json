The plaintiffs filed a special count (first indorsee v. maker) upon a note, together with the common counts and an affidavit of claim. The defendant, Robert Thacker, filed a general demurrer to the declaration. The court below overruled the demurrer. Appellant says that thereupon the court entered a rule on the defendant to plead instan ter; that the defendant thereupon filed a plea of the general issue, properly verified; that on motion of plaintiffs, the court struck this plea of the general issue from the files, on the ground that theaffidavit attached to the same was improper, anl rendered judgment against the defendant; that the defendant therefore prayed and was allowed an appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-4\" pgmap=\"643\">Alfred D.

If this be so, he should, by bill of exceptions, have presented a record of what he and the court did in this regard. Bowlan v. Lambka, 57 Ill. App. 334; Van Cott v. Sprague, 5 Ill.
