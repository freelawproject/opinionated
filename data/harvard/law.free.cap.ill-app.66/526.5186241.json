He deserted her nine months later, and she has not seen him since.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523\">Appellee filed her bill for divorce from Salmansohn March 25, 1887, and a decree was' entered by the Circuit Court of Cook County, granting such divorce June 2,1887. On April 2, 1887, the ceremony of marriage of the parties to this cause was performed by the JEtev. Doctor J. 1. With-row. This marriage, appellee testifies, was entered into by appellant with full knowledge of the previous marriage. This he denies.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\" pgmap=\"523\">Appellant testifies that a copy of the decree of divorce from Salmansohn was handed him by appellee on June 2, 1887. He continued to live with appellee, apparently as her husband, for more than seven years afterward, holding her out to the world as his lawful wife.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\" pgmap=\"523\">Appellant recognized himself as the father of a child born as the fruit of such union, notwithstanding this, he brought suit against her, insisting that he had never been her husband, and wished a decree of court establishing such fact. She then asked for decree for separate maintenance.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-9\" pgmap=\"523\">W. S.

Appellee was then a marriageable woman, and however invalid the previous undertaking between appellant and appellee may have originally been, appellant\u2019s conduct in continuing for seven years thereafter to live with and hold her out to the world as his wife, must be taken as a ratification of the marriage ceremony, performed with all solemnity by the Rev. Doctor Withrow. Post v. Post, 70 Ill. 484.</p> <p id=\"b524-5\" pgmap=\"524\">It is not shown that Salmansohn was living April 2,1887. In the absence of proof of this, the presumption of appellee\u2019s innocence prevails over the presumption of the existence of the former husband. Breier v. Weier, 33 Ill. App. 386; Johnson v. Johnson, 114 Ill. 611.</p> <p id=\"b524-6\" pgmap=\"524\">Under the circumstances the court was justified in awarding to appellee a decree for separate maintenance.</p> <p id=\"b524-7\" pgmap=\"524\">The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
