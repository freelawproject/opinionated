He is no longer a trustee in the sense that term is used in the older cases. He is an officer of the court, the right arm of the court, with power and obligations and character strictly analogous to those of a receiver. Freydendall v. Baldwin, 103 Ill. 325; Davis v. Chicago Dock Co., 129 Ill. 180, 193, 194.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-12\" pgmap=\"468\">The removal of a receiver rests in the sound discretion of the court and is not re viewable by appeal or writ of error.

There is no longer in that court anything to which a remand of this cause could attach. Under such circumstances, we content ourselves with saying that a County Court can remove an assignee only for statutory causes. Munroe v. People, 102 Ill. 406.</p> <p id=\"b469-4\" pgmap=\"469\">The order is reversed at the costs of the defendants in error, but without remanding anything anywhere.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
