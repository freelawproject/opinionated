The defendant filed three additional pleas, to the first of which a demurrer was sustained. The second plea sets up that the note of Barker was endorsed and delivered by McElwee &amp; Carney to the defendant for value, before maturity, and before he had any notice or knowledge of the assignment to the Union National Bank of the note sued on, and alleges that there is $5300 due on the note, and offers to set off that amount. The third plea sets up that the set-off is on the same note, and that the said note was endorsed and delivered by McElwee &amp; Carney to the defendant on its date and before maturity, and also before the alleged assignment to the Union National Bank of the note described in the declaration, and before defendant had any notice of that assignment.</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465(46) 466(284)\">To the second and third pleas the plaintiff filed five replications, in substance as follows: (1) That before the defendant had received the note offered as set-off, the Union National Bank had taken from S. B. Barker, by due assignment and for valuable consideration, the note on which this action was brought; (2) that the uote tendered as set-off was one of five notes given for a bill of lumber of which a sufficient amount was never delivered, and said note was not assigned until after the 16th day of June, 1893, and not until after the other four notes had been assigned and delivered to one certain Edward P. Hines, so that the consideration upon which the note was given has failed to the extent of $1693.57, etc.; (3) that the note tendered as set-off was one of five notes given for a bill of lumber of which a sufficient amount was never delivered, and said note was assigned to defendant without the payment of any consideration therefor, so that the consideration upon which the note was given has failed to the extent of $1693.57, etc.; (4) that the note tendered as set-off was one of five notes given for a bill of lumber of which a sufficient amount was never delivered, and said note was assigned to the defendant without payment of any consideration therefor, and not until after the other four notes above mentioned had been assigned and delivered to a certain-Edward P.

The defendant then filed three rejoinders to said replication, the first of which was, that the defendant received the note described in the plea of set-off without notice of the assignment by Barker to the Union National Bank of the note described in the declaration. The second, that the note described in the pleas of set-off was endorsed and delivered by McElwee &amp; Carney to the defendant on the day of its date, for value, and without notice to the defendant of any of the matters set up in the replications. The third of which was, that the purchase price of the lumber for which the notes were given, and which was not delivered, was, prior to the assignment of the note to the Union National Bank, by agreement between Barker and 'McElwee, applied upon an account owing by Barker to McElwee &amp; Carney, other than on the notes mentioned in the replications, and that the consideration for none of the notes failed. The plaintiff filed rebutters to the defendant\u2019s rejoinders; that as to the plea of tender the plaintiff did not refuse to accept the tender, but did accept it and credited the amount paid on the causes of action, and to that extent they are satisfied, and filed a similiter to the other rejoinders:</summary><attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">Tenney, McConnell, Coffeen &amp; Harding, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">Barth having obtained the Barker note while the bank held his note, and with knowledge of its rights, as admitted by the pleadings to the first cotint, cannot use the Barker note as a set-off to the prejudice of the bank.

This note was taken by Mr. Odell, president of the Union National Bank, with other paper, the other paper being endorsed. This note was not endorsed, and there was no agreement that it should not be endorsed and no express agreement that it should be. Barth bought the Barker note June 5 or 6, 1893, for $750. He had no notice of the bank having the Barth note until after May 4, 1895. The Barker note was dated March 16,1893, due June 16,1893. Suit was brought May 16, 1895. As the bank only took an equitable title to the Barth note, it was its duty to give notice to Barth to protect itself against payment or after-acquired cross-demands against Barker, and having failed in this, Barth was entitled to his set-off.</p> <p id=\"b469-6\" pgmap=\"469(175) 470(29)\">Plaintiff in error insists that defendant was not entitled to credit on account of the Barker note in excess of $750,\u2014the amount paid by Barth for the note. The holder of a note regularly endorsed is presumed, in law, prima facie a holder for value, and this presumption continues until fraud is shown in the procurement of the signature or execution of the note. Then a purchase for value must be proven. Barth is shown to have given value for the note. There is no evidence showing the note was obtained from the maker by fraud, or that he had any defense to it had it been sued upon by the payees. It is true, a plea of partial failure of consideration was insisted upon; but the trial and Appellate Courts found adversely to the plaintiff as to that, and we must accept the finding. \u201cNegotiable securities once put in circulation for value may be transferred for less than their face, but the maker and those claiming under him cannot limit the right of a subsequent holder to a recovery of what he may have paid therefor.\u201d Wade v. Chicago, Springfield and St. Louis Railroad Co. 149 U. S. 327.</p> <p id=\"b470-5\" pgmap=\"470\">Barth purchased this note before maturity, for value and without notice of the equities of the plaintiff, and is entitled to the benefit of his bargain. The bank having taken the note by mere delivery, and without any agreement that it should be endorsed, it could have no equity superior to that of Barth until he had notice that the bank had and claimed to own the note.</p> <p id=\"b470-6\" pgmap=\"470\">This suit was broug'ht May 16, 1895, and while pending, in June, 1896, a chancery suit was brought by the bank against Barth relative to the stock that was assigned as collateral to the note held by the bank, praying for a sale of the stock pledged to pay the note sued on here. Plaintiff then moved to dismiss this suit and urged the pendency of the chancery suit brought by the bank as ground therefor. A plea of set-off had been filed by defendant and the court properly overruled the motion to dismiss.</p> <p id=\"b470-7\" pgmap=\"470(168) 471(135)\">It is insisted by the plaintiff that this case should be reversed because the court sustained a demurrer to two replications to defendant\u2019s plea of set-off to the first count of the declaration. ' The declaration did not count upon an endorsed note within the statute, but upon an assigned note or chose in action, as at common law. The lang'uage used is, \u201cassigned, transferred and delivered the same to said Union National Bank.\u201d If the note had been endorsed the declaration would have so alleged, and the suit would have run in the name of the bank, as plaintiff. Upon the face of the declaration, then, this note was subject to equities and defenses between the original parties existing at the time of the assignment, or arising after the assignment and before Barth had notice of the assignment. Barth pleaded as set-off the note of Barker obtained by him by endorsement for value before the bringing of the suit. Plaintiff replied, first, that defend-' ant obtained the note described in his plea after he had notice that his note had been assigned by Barker to the bank for value; second, that defendant obtained the note described in his plea after maturity and after the Barth note had been assigned to the bank for value. The first replication above was good, and the demurrer should have been overruled. The demurrer was properly sustained to the second replication. The Barker note was negotiable by endorsement, and the allegation that it was due would only let in defenses existing against it in favor of Barker, the maker, at the time of the endorsement. Such allegation would not let in defenses in favor of the mere holder by assignment, whether obtained before or after the endorsement, unless Barth had notice.</p> <p id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471\">If this suit had been brought by Barker alone, for his own benefit, no one can question but that Barth would have had the right to set off Barker\u2019s note set up in the plea. Being sued by Barker, for the use of the bank, did not deprive Barth of his right of set-off, unless Barth had notice at the time he took the note of the bank\u2019s equities. The second replication did not allege notice, and was bad.</p> <p id=\"b471-6\" pgmap=\"471(163) 472(60)\">The Barker note in the hands of the bank without endorsement or any agreement to endorse, was no more than a simple chose in action held by assignment, and the debtor, in such case, can set off existing or after-acquired demands against the payee obtained before notice. \u201cAnd this appears to be the true distinction between the endorsement of a note over-due and the assignment of a chose in action. In the latter case, notice of the assignment must be given by the assignee to the debtor to prevent him from making payment to the assignor. * * * The assignee takes an equitable interest, only, which must be enforced in the name of the assignor, and until notice he has no equity against the debtor which can be recognized and protected by a court of law or equity. The endorsee of a note over-due takes a legal title, but he takes it with notice on its face that it is discredited, and therefore subject to all payments and off-sets in the nature of payments.\u201d (Baxter v. Little, 7 Metc. 7; 39 Ain. Dec. 707.) Neither payment nor anything in the nature of payment was being insisted upon by these replications, but an equity arising out of another note in a third party whose duty it was to give notice.</p> <p id=\"b472-5\" pgmap=\"472\">The question still remains, should the case be reversed for the error in sustaining the demurrer to the first replication to the plea of set-off above discussed? Courts of appeal do not reverse cases that have been tried upon their merits simply for the correction of pleadings. Unless the plaintiff has been prejudiced in his defense against the plea of set-off by the ruling of the court in this respect the judgment should not for that reason be disturbed. The court will look into the pleadings and evidence to determine such matters. There is no claim that any other note than the one described in the second count was held by the bank or sought to be collected in this suit. It will be observed that in the second count of the narr., after averring the assignment and delivery of the Barth note by Barker to the bank on May 1, 1892, the further allegation, \u201cof which assignment so made as aforesaid said defendant * * * on the same day and year had notice,\u201d is contained. Defendant replied that he obtained the Barker note by endorsement from McElwee &amp; Carney, for value, before maturity and before he had any notice or knowledge that the note sued on was assigned to the Union National Bank. Thus the only proper issue tendered by the replication to which the demurrer was sustained was presented and the plaintiff given the benefit on the trial.</p> <p id=\"b472-6\" pgmap=\"472\">We have carefully examined the refused instructions and find no error in their refusal.</p> <p id=\"b472-7\" pgmap=\"472\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b472-8\" pgmap=\"472\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
