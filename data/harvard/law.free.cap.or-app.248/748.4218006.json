On appeal, defendant first contends that the trial court plainly erred in imposing concurrent terms of 75 months\u2019 incarceration, plus 10 years\u2019 post-prison supervision, on each of the two sexual abuse counts. The state concedes that error and, as explained below, we accept the state\u2019s concession, exercise our discretion to correct the error, and remand for resentencing. Defendant also argues that the court erred in giving a nonunaimous jury instruction. We reject that argument without further discussion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cobb, </em>224 Or App 594, 596-97, 198 P3d 978 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Under ORS 144.103(1), a defendant sentenced to a term of imprisonment for committing certain sexual offenses, including first-degree sexual abuse, \u201cshall serve a term of post-prison supervision that continues until the term of the post-prison supervision, when added to the term of imprisonment served, equals the maximum statutory indeterminate sentence for the violation.\u201d The maximum statutory indeterminate sentence for first-degree sexual abuse, a Class B felony, is 10 years. ORS 163.427(2); ORS 161.605(2). Thus, it follows that the court erred in imposing a 10-year period of post-prison supervision. We have previously treated similar errors as apparent on the face of the record. <em>See, e.g., State v. Johnson, </em>212 Or App 135, 157 P3d 295 (2007) (holding that imposition of excessive term of post-prison supervision under ORS 144.103 was plain error). Moreover, for the reasons we articulated in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>220 Or App 504, 507-08, 187 P3d 742 (2008), we elect to exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The remaining question is disposition. The state argues that instead of remanding the case for resentencing, as defendant requests, we need only remand for entry of a corrected judgment. We have previously rejected that argument in this context, <em>see, e.g., State v. Angell, </em>200 Or App 244, 246-47, 113 P3d 988 (2005), and we decline to revisit it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Reversed and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
