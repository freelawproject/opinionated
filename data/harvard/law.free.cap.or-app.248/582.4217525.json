J.</author>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Wife appeals a general judgment of dissolution, contending that the trial court erred in (1) awarding husband his interest in a family trust and two investment accounts valued at $10.3 million as his separate property;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) setting the duration and amount of maintenance spousal support; and (3) denying her request for attorney fees before reviewing it. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3) (2007),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we modify the trial court\u2019s property division because, although husband rebutted the presumption of equal contribution with regard to the disputed property, it is just and proper for wife to receive an equalizing judgment of $2 million. Further, in light of our modification to the property award, we reject wife\u2019s contentions concerning spousal support and vacate the trial court\u2019s decision concerning attorney fees. Accordingly, we modify the judgment to award wife an equalizing judgment of $2 million and vacate and remand the attorney fee decision for reconsideration but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Although our review is <em>de novo, </em>we defer to the trial court\u2019s express and implied credibility findings. <em>Tomos and Tomos, </em>165 Or App 82, 87, 995 P2d 576 (2000). Here, husband contends that the trial court\u2019s disposition of the disputed property was predicated on credibility findings and that, \u201c[w]here Husband\u2019s testimony differs from Wife\u2019s on material issues, [we] should accept the trial court\u2019s explicit and implicit findings that Husband\u2019s account was more credible than Wife\u2019s.\u201d As we explained in <em>Olson and Olson, </em>218 Or App 1, 3, 178 P3d 272 (2008), \u201c[w]e take a cautious approach in that regard because, beyond its express findings, we cannot discern to what extent the trial court\u2019s decision may have depended on implied findings of fact.\u201d For that reason, \u201cwe defer only to credibility determinations that the trial court necessarily made in connection with its express findings of fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>This case involves a long-term marriage of over 30 years. At the time that the marriage was dissolved, husband was a 63-year-old ophthalmologist practicing in the Corvallis area, and wife was a 60-year-old homemaker and bookkeeper living in California. The parties have two adult children.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">As general background, husband and wife met in 1974 while husband was completing his internship and wife, who was a nurse practitioner, was working at the same hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the parties married in 1975, husband completed his residency and fellowships, one of which took them to London for a little over a year. When the parties returned from London in 1980, they moved to Corvallis, where they lived until they separated in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Initially, husband worked for a clinic in Corvallis, and wife worked as a nurse practitioner for the county health department. In 1980, the parties purchased a farm, and, in 1982, about the time that their daughter was born, they moved into the home that they had recently built there. Although wife planned to continue working in her profession, by the time that the parties\u2019 son was born in 1983, she chose to be a homemaker rather than to continue working as a nurse practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">However, in addition to her homemaking responsibilities, wife also managed the parties\u2019 farm, which was set up as a business so that they could contribute to an individual retirement account for wife. Specifically, wife explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201cI was a full-time parent for these two children, I was also an accomplished seamstress so I upholstered our furniture, I made our window coverings, I painted, I wallpapered, I cooked, I cleaned, I carpooled. I was totally involved in all their activities, I was in charge of \u2014 volunteered in their schools, I was the after school enrichment coordinator at their schools, I was on all the boards and committees within their schools, followed all their activities. I was president of * * * the Benton County Medical Society Alliance which was supporting physicians and teaching health education in the community, I belonged to the Assistance League, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>other philanthropic organizations.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] We had as I said a 78 acre farm. We developed a herd of 22 cows and a bull, we had chickens and ducks, we had to grow and maintain hay, we had Christmas trees at one time which we did have a manager doing that and I oversaw him and the trees and the sale and the fertilizer and the grooming of those trees[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Wife considered reentering the workforce in 1991.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, when husband decided to leave the clinic and open his own medical practice, wife became directly involved in its operation. As wife explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cin the beginning I hired the help, I bought the supplies, I set up the bookkeeping, I conferred with the accountant about what I needed to do, I conferred with other people as far as what was necessary for a business as far as office policy manuals, what should be in it, what were the legal ramifications and necessity things. I then worked in the office and worked doing the bookkeeping and the payroll, * * * recruited, hired, trained, supervised the employees, developed a team approach with a mission statement so that * * * what we offered different from Costco or any of those other places was service, quality of service, so I worked with them very carefully to make sure that that was carried out, that we had a high standard of quality, and so interfaced with the community, going to small business meetings within the community to promote our institution and to learn how to do in the highest quality possible, and when our employees were sick or on vacation or getting married or some other thing then I actually physically was the nurse or was the front office person or helped fix broken glasses or took contact lens prescriptions, refills or whatever, did the pre-exam for my husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Despite wife\u2019s significant contributions to the ophthalmology practice, for many years, she did not draw a salary in order to, as husband noted, \u201cbetter [their] tax situation.\u201d Specifically, husband explained that, on the advice of the parties\u2019 accountant, wife did not draw a salary so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>parties would not have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes related to her work in the practice. That arrangement, in turn, maximized the amount of husband\u2019s earnings that were ultimately deposited into joint accounts and used for family purposes. In other words, husband\u2019s earnings effectively included wife\u2019s compensation for her contributions to the ophthalmology practice. However, for a few years immediately preceding the parties\u2019 separation in 2006 \u2014 after the tax laws had changed and the practice modified its retirement plan \u2014 wife drew enough salary to maximize her retirement contributions to that plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">According to husband, after the parties separated in 2006, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t keep the books and do all the billing and everything in our practice.\u201d Ultimately, in 2007, husband\u2019s practice was purchased by another physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">At the time of trial, husband continued working part time for that physician, earning approximately $11,000 per month, and wife was employed part time as a bookkeeper, earning approximately $2,300 per month. However, wife planned to retire in the near future, and husband planned to retire within a couple of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">By all accounts, the parties had a very comfortable, but not overly extravagant, standard of living during the marriage. Husband noted that he and wife \u201creally never talked about money.\u201d As wife explained, \u201c[m]oney wasn\u2019t a problem\u201d and she could make \u201c[a]ny purchases that [she] want[ed].\u201d In fact, through their efforts, the parties acquired assets \u2014 including real property<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and retirement and investment accounts \u2014 worth approximately $5 million at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The parties\u2019 standard of living was supported primarily through the income generated by the medical practice and the parties\u2019 joint investments. However, husband had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>other assets \u2014 that is, the disputed property \u2014 that he would periodically use to supplement that income.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Because the nature and ultimate division of the disputed property is the focus of the parties\u2019 contentions on appeal, we describe it in some detail. In particular, at the time of trial, husband had an interest in the EFLOW trust as well as two investment accounts \u2014 which we refer to as \u201cthe Smith Barney account\u201d and \u201cthe UBS account.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As explained below, all three of those assets originated from a single <em>source </em>\u2014 viz., a devise of, <em>inter alia, </em>stocks, bonds, and real property from husband\u2019s grandfather, who died in the 1950s when husband was a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In particular, on his death, husband\u2019s grandfather left, as pertinent here, certain stocks, bonds, and real property to husband\u2019s father to hold in trust for the use and benefit of husband and his two siblings. Husband\u2019s father managed the property held in the testamentary trust, and, at some point, placed husband\u2019s earnings in an investment account in husband\u2019s name. Although husband\u2019s interest in the testamentary trust was to terminate when he reached 25 years of age \u2014 that is, approximately five or six years before the parties\u2019 marriage \u2014 our understanding is that the trust did not terminate and husband\u2019s father continued to manage the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">At the time of the parties\u2019 marriage in 1975, husband \u201cknew that there was some family money there\u201d (i.e., in the testamentary trust) but he did not know the extent of that money. Moreover, before the marriage, husband and wife had not discussed their individual financial interests, generally, or the value of husband\u2019s interest in the testamentary trust, specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Several years after the parties\u2019 marriage, three significant events relating to the assets of the testamentary trust occurred. <em>First, </em>in 1981, the EFLOW trust was created. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The EFLOW trust document indicates that (1) husband and his parents and siblings transferred their interests in several pieces of real property to the EFLOW trust and (2) \u201c[c]ertain property interests listed [in the trust document were] already held by [husband\u2019s father] for the benefit of himself, and [his children] in his capacity of Trustee of other trusts.\u201d <em>Second, </em>in 1983, husband\u2019s father transferred to husband the investment account into which husband\u2019s earnings from the testamentary trust had been placed. That account became the Smith Barney account. Husband\u2019s initial investment in the Smith Barney account was approximately $50,000. <em>Third, </em>at some point after the Smith Barney account was opened in 1983, husband withdrew some money and opened the UBS account.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The disputed property \u2014 that is, the EFLOW trust and the Smith Barney and UBS accounts \u2014 was essentially managed by third parties. With regard to the EFLOW trust, husband\u2019s father, as trustee, managed the trust assets\u2014 without any assistance from husband or wife \u2014 until his death in 2004. Although there had been family discussions concerning the EFLOW trust over the years, husband and wife knew little about husband\u2019s father\u2019s management of the trust assets or the value of husband\u2019s interest in them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With regard to the investment accounts, which were in husband\u2019s name only, husband essentially left their management to others. Specifically, Schupp, an investment advisor, managed the Smith Barney account from its inception until a few months before trial, and Lipps, one of husband\u2019s college roommates, who had become a financial advisor, managed the UBS account.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Earnings from the disputed property were reinvested. Significantly, none of the parties\u2019 earned income was ever invested in the disputed property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the disputed property appreciated in value during the marriage, that appreciation was passive and did not result through the efforts \u2014 either direct or otherwise \u2014 of husband or wife.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">During the marriage, husband periodically used funds from what he referred to as his \u201cseparate money\u201d\u2014 which included the Smith Barney account \u2014 to supplement the parties\u2019 earned income. Most substantially, husband used that money to (1) help finance the acquisition of the parties\u2019 farm and the construction of their home; (2) annually make maximum contributions to both parties\u2019 individual retirement accounts; and (3) pay for some incidental vacation expenses. Husband\u2019s use of those funds within his control occurred in an overarching context in which the parties generally made financial decisions together based on what was in the best interests of their family.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Beyond husband\u2019s direct application of funds from his \u201cseparate money\u201d for joint family purposes, the existence of husband\u2019s interest in the disputed property influenced \u2014 at least to some extent \u2014 financial decisions during the course of the marriage. For example, a few years after the parties married, husband decided that he no longer needed life insurance because, if he had died, his wife and children would have received the benefit of all of his assets \u2014 including the disputed property. Further, as husband testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201cIn the early days by virtue of having potentially the other money I was able to make maximal contributions at a time when say some of my compatriots were having to not put as much money into their retirement funds as we could. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>could always make a maximal contribution, you know, because I could draw on that other money if we had to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">It was against that historic and financial backdrop that the parties framed their respective positions concerning the division of property and spousal support to the trial court. With regard to the property division, the parties were in general agreement that, other than husband\u2019s interest in the disputed property, the remaining $5 million in property should be divided equally between them. Thus, their contentions in the trial court focused on the disputed property.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In that regard, wife contended that (1) husband\u2019s interest in the disputed property was a marital asset; (2) husband had not rebutted the presumption of equal contribution with regard to that property in light of wife\u2019s contributions to the ophthalmology practice and as a homemaker; and (3) in all events, a just and equitable division \u201cdictates that the parties in this case leave the marriage on equal footing.\u201d Wife also requested spousal support \u2014 the amount of which would \u201cdepend on the court\u2019s determination of how the assets are to be divided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Conversely, husband contended that the disputed property was a premarital asset because it originated from the devise from his grandfather in the 1950s. Alternatively, husband contended that, to the extent that a portion of the disputed property was a marital asset, he had rebutted the presumption of equal contribution by demonstrating that the disputed property was managed by third parties and that any appreciation was essentially passive. In all events, husband contended that it was just and equitable to award him the $10.3 million in disputed assets because he had intended to retain them as his separate property and because the assets were not sufficiently commingled into the parties\u2019 financial affairs. In terms of spousal support, husband contended that an award was unnecessary because the property division, without reference to the disputed property, would generate sufficient income to enable wife to be economically self-sufficient and to enjoy a standard of living not overly disproportionate to the one that the parties enjoyed during the marriage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In the dissolution judgment, the trial court awarded wife approximately $2.6 million in assets, and awarded husband approximately $2.4 million in assets. Further, the trial court awarded husband the disputed property valued at $10.3 million as his separate property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The court explained that, \u201c[e]ven though [its] distribution of marital assets is not equal, it is just and equitable\u201d in light of \u201call [the] circumstances,\u201d noting that \u2018Wife will not be required to pay an equalizing judgment to Husband in any amount.\u201d Further, with regard to its award of the disputed property to husband, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\u201cThe joint assets of the marriage are substantial and will allow each party to be economically self-sufficient. Husband inherited and owns interest in several family trusts which have been invested and managed by Husband\u2019s father and recently by Husband. Rental income from real property and dividend and interest earnings from separate accounts have been reinvested in the original investments. Maintenance and taxes on the properties and investments have been paid from separate accounts. The increase in value of Husband\u2019s inherited property is due to market appreciation, independent of the efforts of Husband and Wife. Husband has rebutted the presumption of equal contribution of Wife relating [to] these assets and it is just and proper to award these assets to Husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">With regard to spousal support, the trial court determined that wife was entitled to support until she reached full retirement age. For that reason, the court awarded wife maintenance support of $2,000 per month for two years, followed by $1,000 per month for three years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Finally, over wife\u2019s objection, the trial court determined that each party was responsible for his or her respective attorney fees and costs and disbursements. Wife appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>On appeal, wife raises three assignments of error which, respectively, are predicated on the following contentions: (1) The trial court erred in awarding the $10.3 million in disputed assets to husband. (2) The trial court erred in the amount and duration of its award of maintenance spousal support, which, wife contends, should be increased to $10,000 per month indefinitely. And (3) the trial court erred in denying her request for attorney fees before reviewing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">We begin with the property division. Our resolution of that matter is guided and circumscribed by ORS 107.105(l)(f) (2007),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as construed in <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 92 P3d 100 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">ORS 107.105(l)(f) (2007) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\u201cWhenever the court renders a judgment of marital annulment, dissolution or separation, the court may provide in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">\u00ab\u00edj&lt; \u2021 &amp; \u00edfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\u201c(f) For the division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property, or both, of either or both of the parties as may be just and proper in all the circumstances. * * * The court shall consider the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker as a contribution to the acquisition of marital assets. There is a rebuttable presumption that both spouses have contributed equally to the acquisition of property during the marriage, whether such property is jointly or separately held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Under the statute, our initial inquiry is to determine when a disputed asset was acquired. As we explained in <em>Hanscam and Hanscam, </em>247 Or App 207, 216, 268 P3d 715 (2011),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201c[i]f the asset was acquired during the marriage, we apply the statutory presumption, unless either party has rebutted it. <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 134. If the presumption of equal contribution is effectively rebutted,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">\u201c \u2018then the court decides how to distribute that marital asset without regard to any presumption and, instead, considers only what is \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances,\u201d including the proven contributions of the parties to the asset. <em>Massee [and Massee, </em>328 Or 195, 205, 970 P2d 1203 (1999)].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\"><em>\u201cKunze, </em>337 Or at 135.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">(Second brackets in <em>Hanscam.) </em>Accordingly, we begin by determining whether and to what extent husband\u2019s interest in the disputed property was acquired during the marriage\u2014 that is, whether and to what extent the disputed property is a \u201cmarital asset\u201d to which the presumption of equal contribution applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Although that inquiry is straightforward in many cases, it is not here. On this record \u2014 candidly\u2014it is impossible to make that determination with any degree of precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">As previously indicated, 248 Or App at 588, the disputed property originated from a devise from husband\u2019s grandfather in the 1950s. However, on this record, we cannot ascertain the specific configuration or \u201cmix\u201d of devised property in which husband had an interest at any time after its original acquisition \u2014 including at the time of the parties\u2019 marriage in 1975 \u2014 nor can we know the value of that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Moreover, after the parties married, the configuration of property was continually evolving. For example, our understanding is that real property was commonly sold or exchanged, and new properties were acquired. New stocks were purchased, and others were sold. Although it is clear that there was significant appreciation in the Smith Barney and UBS accounts during the marriage and that earnings from the disputed property were reinvested, the record does not disclose when earnings were distributed, the amount of those earnings, or their disposition <em>(e.g., </em>acquisition of new stock or real property). <em>See Massee, </em>328 Or at 197 (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>that appreciation of a separately held premarital asset during the marriage is a marital asset); <em>see also Lind and Lind, </em>207 Or App 56, 63, 139 P3d 1032 (2006) (holding that marital assets include new shares in an investment portfolio that are purchased during the marriage). Thus, we are unable to precisely determine the extent to which the disputed property is a marital asset or, concomitantly, to quantify its corresponding value.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Nevertheless, at least, it is patent that wife did not contribute to the initial devise of property to husband from his grandfather decades before the parties\u2019 marriage. Moreover, and in all events, to the extent that some portion of the disputed property is, doubtless, a marital asset, husband rebutted the presumption of equal contribution. That is so for two interrelated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">First, the earnings from the disputed property were reinvested, and none of the parties\u2019 earned income was deposited into the Smith Barney or UBS accounts. Under those circumstances, husband\u2019s entire interest in the disputed property at the time of trial is traceable to his premarital interest in the property. <em>See Lind, </em>207 Or App at 64 (where the husband acquired an investment portfolio before the marriage and where \u201call of the portfolio holdings that [the] husband acquired during the marriage were generated by the portfolio itself\u2019 and \u201ctraceable back to the holdings that [the] husband brought into the marriage as his separate property!,]\u201d the husband had rebutted the presumption of equal contribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Second, to the extent that a portion of the disputed property is a marital asset \u2014 through either the acquisition of new property or appreciation \u2014 neither husband nor wife contributed to the acquisition of that property during the marriage. Instead, the disputed property was essentially managed by third parties, who reinvested the earnings. Under those circumstances, the acquisition of new property and the appreciation during the marriage occurred passively and independent of any contribution of either husband or wife.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>See Kunze, </em>337 Or at 135 (reasoning that the presumption of equal contribution is rebutted with regard to the acquisition of a marital asset \u201c[w]hen a party has proved that a marital asset was acquired free of any contributions from the other spouse\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 143 (holding that the presumption of equal contribution may be overcome by evidence that the appreciation of a marital asset was passive \u2014 that is, that the property required \u201cminimal attention from either of the parties during the marriage\u201d and the appreciation involved no contribution by either spouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Accordingly, husband has rebutted the presumption of equal contribution as to any portion of the disputed property that is a marital asset. We proceed then to determine \u201chow to apportion the property in a manner that is just and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>218 Or App at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In <em>Kunze, </em>the Supreme Court explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\u201c[b]y contrast to the focus upon the parties\u2019 respective contributions under the statutory presumption, the court\u2019s final inquiry as to the \u2018just and proper\u2019 division concerns the equity of the property division in view of all the circumstances of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">337 Or at 135. The equitable considerations that guide a court include (1) \u201cthe social and financial objectives of the dissolution\u201d; (2) \u201cthe preservation of assets\u201d; (3) \u201cthe achievement of economic self-sufficiency for both spouses\u201d; (4) \u201cthe particular needs of the parties and their children\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe extent to which a party has integrated a separately acquired asset into the common financial affairs of the marital partnership through commingling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">With respect to the \u201ccommingling\u201d consideration, in <em>Olson, </em>we explained that commingling \u201cdepends to a large extent on intent, that is, on whether a spouse had intended to retain the separately acquired asset as separate property or whether, instead, that spouse\u2019s treatment of the separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>acquired asset demonstrated an intent for that asset to become a joint asset of the marital partnership.\u201d 218 Or App at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the court instructed in <em>Kunze, </em>a variety of considerations may bear on a spouse\u2019s intent, including \u201c(1) whether the disputed property was jointly or separately held; (2) whether the parties shared control over the disputed property; and (3) <em>the degree of reliance upon the disputed property as a joint asset.\u201d </em>337 Or at 141 (emphasis added). In sum, \u201c[i]ntent * * * depends not on what a spouse might privately contemplate or even publicly declare; it depends on how a spouse <em>acts, </em>that is, on what the spouse\u2019s treatment of the asset demonstrates.\u201d <em>Lind, </em>207 Or App at 67 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\">Commingling is a relative, not an absolute, concept, which may vary according to a spouse\u2019s treatment of a particular asset. As we explained in <em>Tsukamaki and Tsukamaki, </em>199 Or App 577, 586, 112 P3d 416 (2005),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">\u201c[b]ecause it is an equitable consideration, commingling is not an all or nothing proposition. Instead, commingling falls along a spectrum. In some cases, a particular asset may be commingled to such an extent that it would be inequitable to divide it in any manner other than equally. In other cases, an asset may be less commingled and therefore subject to a split into unequal shares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Here, two equitable considerations \u2014 neither of which appears to have been considered by the trial court\u2014 guide our review of the just and proper distribution of the disputed property. First, we consider the \u201csocial and financial objectives of the dissolution.\u201d <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 135. Second, we consider the extent to which husband has integrated his interest in the disputed property \u201cinto the common financial affairs of the marital partnership through commingling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">With respect to the first consideration, we have previously explained that, \u201cin a long-term marriage, * * * \u2018the parties should separate on as equal a basis as possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd and Boyd, </em>226 Or App 292, 299, 203 P3d 312 (2009) (quoting <em>Stice and Stice, </em>308 Or 316, 327, 779 P2d 1020 (1989)). That is so because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u201c[w]hen couples enter marriage, they ordinarily commit themselves to an indefinite shared future of which shared finances are a part. Acquisitions are made, forgone or replaced for the good of the family unit rather than for the financial interests of either spouse. Property is bought, sold, enhanced, diminished, intermixed and used without regard to ease of division upon termination of the marriage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><em>Jenks and Jenks, </em>294 Or 236, 242, 656 P2d 286 (1982). In fact, this long-term marriage was marked by the dynamic contemplated in <em>Boyd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">With respect to the second consideration, as previously indicated, 248 Or App at 590, the parties generally made financial decisions together based on what was in the best interest of their family as a whole. For example, wife contributed to the ophthalmology practice without drawing a salary to reduce the parties\u2019 tax burden and to maximize the amount of money available to the family unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Moreover, as husband acknowledged, the existence of the disputed property influenced \u2014 at least to some extent \u2014 financial decisions that were made during the marriage. As husband noted, \u201cwe would call on it if we needed it.\u201d In particular, the funds in the Smith Barney account were easily accessible by husband during the marriage, and, when necessary, he used funds from that account for family purposes. <em>See Kunze, </em>337 Or at 141 (stating that one consideration that bears on a spouse\u2019s intent is \u201cthe degree of reliance upon the disputed property as a joint asset\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Significantly, husband used money from the Smith Barney account to make maximum contributions to one of his and wife\u2019s retirement accounts each year and, within a few years of the parties\u2019 marriage, decided that he no longer needed life insurance, in part, because wife and their children would receive the benefit of the disputed property if he predeceased them. Those acts demonstrate that, despite the fact that the disputed property was separately held by husband and that wife had no control over that property, husband intended \u2014 at least until the marriage deteriorated \u2014 for the disputed property as a whole to be available to the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>unit when necessary.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Husband\u2019s intent in that regard is not negated by the fact that the parties did not need to use the disputed property to pay for their daily expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">On balance, in light of husband\u2019s limited commingling of the disputed property and the long-term nature of the parties\u2019 marriage, it is just and proper for wife to receive a portion of those assets. In reaching a contrary determination, the trial court appears to have focused only on the fact that wife would achieve economic self-sufficiency without sharing in the disputed property. However, in a case such as this, in which the parties have more than ample assets, economic self-sufficiency is not the dispositive factor in the equitable calculus. Accordingly, a just and proper division of property requires a recalibration of the trial court\u2019s award. <em>See Hanscam, </em>247 Or App at 217-18 (noting that a trial court\u2019s determination of what property division is just and proper is a matter of discretion and reasoning that \u201c[w]e examine the trial court\u2019s decision based on the pertinent statutory and equitable considerations * * *, and we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s award unless we conclude that the court misapplied those factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In sum, it is just and proper for wife to receive an additional $2 million in property. In the end, wife will leave the marriage with approximately $4.6 million in assets, and husband will leave the marriage with $10.7 million in assets. In order to effectuate that award, we will not disturb any portion of the trial court\u2019s property division other than to award wife an equalizing judgment in the amount of $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In light of that recalibrated property division, we turn to wife\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in the amount and duration of its award of spousal support. The trial court awarded wife maintenance support of $2,000 per month for two years followed by $1,000 per month for three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>years \u2014 that is, support until wife reaches full retirement age. On appeal, wife contends that, if she is not awarded half of the disputed property, she is entitled to $10,000 per month in indefinite maintenance support in light of the substantial income that husband\u2019s investment property will generate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">\u201cThe loadstar of a court\u2019s charge is to make a spousal support award that is just and equitable,\u2019 ORS 107.105(l)(d), and the ultimate decision concerning the amount and duration of a maintenance spousal support award is a discretionary one.\u201d <em>Bailey and Bailey, </em>248 Or App 271, 276, 273 P3d 263 (2012). ORS 107.105(1)(d)(C) (2007)[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] identified a nonexclusive list of factors that a court should consider in awarding maintenance support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201c(i) The duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201c(ii) The age of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201c(in) The health of the parties, including their physical, mental and emotional condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201c(iv) The standard of living established during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201c(v) The relative income and earning capacity of the parties, recognizing that the wage earner\u2019s continuing income may be a basis for support distinct from the income that the supported spouse may receive from the distribution of marital property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201c(vi) A party\u2019s training and employment skills;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201c(vii) A party\u2019s work experience;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\u201c(viii) The financial needs and resources of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">\u201c(ix) The tax consequences to each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">\u201c(x) A party\u2019s custodial and child support responsibilities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201c(xi) Any other factors the court deems just and equitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Although no single factor is dispositive, \u201cthe primary goal of spousal support in a long-term marriage such as this is to provide a standard of living roughly comparable to the one enjoyed during the marriage.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>226 Or App at 301. In short, under the circumstances of this case and in light of the recalibrated property award, wife will receive assets that will generate income sufficient to allow her to enjoy a standard of living that is not overly disproportionate to the one that the parties enjoyed during the marriage. Accordingly, we reject wife\u2019s contentions but otherwise affirm the trial court\u2019s spousal support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, we turn to wife\u2019s contention that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in denying [her] attorney fee request prior to reviewing it.\u201d Because we have significantly modified the trial court\u2019s property division, we vacate the trial court\u2019s decision concerning attorney fees and remand for reconsideration on that issue. <em>See Proctor and Proctor, </em>204 Or App 250, 252, 129 P3d 186, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 672 (2006) (\u201cIn light of our decision to reverse and remand the property division for reconsideration, we vacate the trial court\u2019s decision on attorney fees and remand for reconsideration of that issue as well.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Judgment modified to award wife an equalizing judgment of $2 million; attorney fee decision vacated and remanded for reconsideration; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> Throughout this opinion we refer to those three assets collectively as \u201cthe disputed property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> ORS 19.415 was amended in 2009 to make <em>de novo </em>review discretionary in domestic relations cases.

To avoid misunderstanding, for purposes of this opinion, \u201cthe Smith Barney account,\u201d \u201cthe UBS account,\u201d and \u201cthe EFLOW trust\u201d refer, respectively, to the assets listed at lines 40, 38 and 39, and 80 to 83 of the trial court\u2019s asset distribution spreadsheet, which was incorporated into the dissolution judgment as an exhibit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b609-6\"> In fact, after husband\u2019s father died in 2004, husband \u2014 and wife until the parties separated in 2006 \u2014 spent a great deal of time attempting to learn about the EFLOW trust assets and their management and, eventually, took over the management of the trust. Compensation for those efforts was placed into separate accounts \u2014 the division of which is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> We also note that, during the marriage, the parties filed joint tax returns. To the extent that the parties incurred tax liability that was attributable to the disputed property itself, husband satisfied that liability with funds from the Smith Barney account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> Wife testified, contrary to husband\u2019s account, that, during the marriage, she and husband were involved in the management of the disputed property. However, the trial court found that either husband\u2019s father or husband managed the disputed property. Further, on <em>de novo </em>review, with regard to the investment accounts, we find that any management by husband was extremely limited. Husband testified that he \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d the UBS account and that his involvement with the Smith Barney account was limited. In particular, with regard to the Smith Barney account, husband had a long-term investment philosophy in which he preferred to buy and hold stocks and he would occasionally suggest the purchase of particular stocks. Thus, consistently with the trial court\u2019s finding, we find that the increase in value of the disputed property occurred independently of the parties\u2019 efforts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> Husband\u2019s contention in that regard was supported by the testimony of a financial planner. That witness testified that, if wife invested an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>approximately $2.6 million in assets, she could \u2014 depending on whether she wanted to leave the principal intact \u2014 generate annual, disposable income of $112,000 to $127,000 (inclusive of Social Security benefits), with corresponding annual increases of 3.2 percent for inflation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> The Smith Barney account valued at approximately $4.9 million and the UBS account valued at approximately $5.1 million comprised the bulk of the $10.3 million.

Because husband received the pertinent devise from his grandfather decades before the parties married in 1975, the 2011 amendment is inapposite here. For that reason, we need not decide whether the 2011 amendment to ORS 107.105(l)(f) applies to a dissolution judgment that is on appeal.
