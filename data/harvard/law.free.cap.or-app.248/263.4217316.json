J.</author>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Defendant appeals from her convictions for one count of driving under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010, four counts of recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195, and one count of reckless driving, ORS 811.140. Defendant asserts that the trial court erred by denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the state failed to adduce evidence proving that the charged conduct took place in Jackson County and, thus, that Jackson County was the proper venue for her trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Because defendant was convicted by a jury, we state the facts in the record, including reasonable inferences derived from those facts, in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Defendant was observed by two eye witnesses entering a restaurant in Medford, Oregon. The witnesses testified that defendant, who had four children with her, appeared intoxicated. According to one witness, defendant was having trouble ordering and eating her food and was falling asleep at the table. When defendant left the restaurant and got into her pickup truck, two of the children got into the cab of the truck, and the other two sat in the bed of the truck. One of the witnesses called the Medford Police because she was concerned that defendant would drive while intoxicated. Medford Police Officer Vollrath responded to the call. He testified that the call had come in from a restaurant \u201cat 4th and Jackson * * * right in the middle of town. I was on the west side of town so it was going to obviously take a little time to get where I was going.\u201d Vollrath received updates on defendant\u2019s movements while he drove across town, and he testified that \u201cthe updates that were being provided to me via the dispatcher were that the vehicle was \u2014 had left [the restaurant] and was travelling towards Central Avenue.\u201d Vollrath also talked to one of the witnesses, who had followed defendant in her own car, and the witness told Vollrath that \u201c[defendant] came to an empty intersection of Barnett and Riverside * * * [and] [e]ventually [defendant] made a left turn onto Barnett and then drove towards the freeway.\u201d Vollrath intercepted defendant as she was \u201cnorth bound on 1-5 from Barnett.\u201d He activated his overhead lights and stopped defendant \u201cjust south of the viaduct, the bridge that goes over East 12th street and that area.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Vollrath determined that defendant was intoxicated and arrested her. He then took her to the Medford Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">After the close of the state\u2019s evidence,' defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state had not adduced evidence establishing that defendant\u2019s conduct took place in Jackson County. The trial court denied the motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cBut, in this particular case I\u2019m not going to \u2014 I\u2019m going to allow that to go to the jury. And because of the amount of time and effort that the officers and the state put into this case and the fact that they did say that it was in Jackson County on 4th Street and they did say that they made enough reference to [the restaurant] in Medford and what not, I find that there is sufficient evidence that the jury can infer from those statements that this occurred in Jackson County, in the light most favorable to the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Defendant was convicted by the jury, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Defendant renews her argument on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to allow the jury to infer that her conduct had taken place in Jackson County. Defendant urges that this case is controlled by our decisions in <em>State v. Means, </em>213 Or App 268, 160 P3d 1001 (2007), and <em>State v. Tirado, </em>118 Or App 294, 846 P2d 1201 (1993), where we held that the evidence was insufficient to allow a jury to infer that venue had been proved. The state replies that <em>Means </em>and <em>Tirado </em>are distinguishable and that the evidence in this case was sufficient to allow the jury to infer the existence of venue. Alternatively, the state argues that this court should take judicial notice under OEC 201 that Medford is located in Jackson County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Venue is not an element of an offense, but it is a material allegation that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cervantes, </em>319 Or at 125. The state is not required to prove venue by direct evidence; instead, venue may be established by inferences drawn from circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 125-26. However, \u201c[t]here is a difference between inferences that may be drawn from circumstantial evidence and mere speculation.\u201d <em>State v. Vaughn, </em>175 Or App 192, 201, 28 P3d 636 (2001). The line between a reasonable inference and impermissible speculation is not always easy to describe with precision. <em>State v. Bivins, </em>191 Or App 460, 467, 83 P3d 379 (2004). We have attempted to explain the distinction in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\">\u201c \u2018The line is drawn by the laws of logic. If there is an experience of logical probability that an ultimate fact will follow a stated narrative or historical fact, then the jury is given the opportunity to draw a conclusion because there is a reasonable probability that the conclusion flows from the proven facts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tose v. First Pennsylvania Bank, N.A., </em>648 F2d 879, 895 (3d Cir), <em>cert den, </em>454 US 893 (1981)). In a similar vein, we have described an impermissible inference as one that \u201crequires too great an inferential leap,\u201d <em>State v. Lopez-Medina, </em>143 Or App 195, 201, 923 P2d 1240 (1996), or that requires a \u201cstacking of inferences\u201d that is \u201ctoo speculative.\u201d <em>State v. Piazza, </em>170 Or App 628, 632, 13 P3d 567 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Here, we conclude that there was a logical probability that the ultimate fact that defendant\u2019s conduct took place in Jackson County followed from the facts that the state adduced. In particular, the evidence showed that defendant had been seen in a restaurant at a specific address in Medford. Vollrath testified that the restaurant was \u201cright in the middle of town\u201d and that, because he was on patrol in west Medford when he received the call, \u201cit was going to obviously take a little time to get where I was going.\u201d Vollrath also testified that defendant had been observed \u201ctravelling towards Central Avenue\u201d and had come \u201cto an empty intersection of Barnett and Riverside\u201d before making \u201ca left turn onto Barnett and then drove towards the freeway.\u201d Vollrath also stated that, when he made contact with defendant she was \u201cnorth bound on 1-5 from Barnett\u201d and that he stopped defendant \u201cjust south of the viaduct, the bridge that goes over East 12th street and that area,\u201d and he ultimately took her to the Medford Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The foregoing evidence is analogous in inferential weight to the evidence of venue that was adduced in <em>Cervantes. </em>In that case, which was prosecuted in Coos County, the direct evidence showed that the defendant had raped the victim at a particular motel. However, no witness testified that either Coos Bay or the motel was located in Coos County. <em>Cervantes, </em>319 Or at 123. The Supreme Court nevertheless concluded that the jury reasonably could infer that the crime occurred in Coos Bay, because the law enforcement agency that investigated the crime scene and arrested the defendant at the motel was the Coos Bay Police Department. <em>Id. </em>at 126. The court further concluded that the jury could infer that Coos Bay is located in Coos County</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">\u201cbased on the fact that the coordinator for the Coos County Victims\u2019 Assistance office, who acts as a liaison between the police, the prosecutor, and the victim, had contact with the victim while acting in her official capacity, where both the victim and the law enforcement agency were located in the City of Coos Bay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Although, unlike in <em>Cervantes, </em>the prosecutor here did not present evidence from a Jackson County employee, we nevertheless conclude that, based on Vollrath\u2019s and the other witnesses\u2019 testimony set out above, the jury had direct evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct took place in Medford and could have inferred that Medford is located in Jackson County.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The cases on which defendant relies are not to the contrary. In <em>Tirado, </em>the defendant was stopped by a \u201cfederal law enforcement officer * * * on Avenue \u2018G,\u2019 one-half mile from the White City Veteran\u2019s Administration Domiciliary,\u201d and later was arrested by an Oregon state officer assigned to patrol Highway 62.\u201d The prosecutor failed to present evidence showing that those locations were in Jackson County. 118 Or App at 296. The defendant appealed, and the state argued that it had presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to prove venue. We disagreed, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">\u201cThe state did not prove that Avenue \u2018G,\u2019 the Veteran\u2019s Administration Domiciliary and Highway 62 are in Jackson County or that defendant drove in Jackson County. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>state argues that there is only one such domiciliary in Oregon, that it is in White City, that White City is near Medford and that it is common knowledge that Medford is in Jackson County. None of those facts was proved through evidence at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In <em>Means, </em>the defendant was charged with six counts of identify theft and fraudulent use of a credit card.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201cThe state introduced evidence, including store receipts and credit card receipts, showing that, on December 18, 2004, defendant, using the stolen credit card, made one purchase at the Fred Meyer store on North Interstate Avenue in Portland at 10:05 a.m. and two purchases, at 10:43 a.m. and 10:48 a.m., respectively, at the Hollywood Game Crazy at Lombard and Interstate. Employees from the two stores testified that both are located in Multnomah County. The owner of the motel where defendant was staying on December 18 testified that the motel is located in Multnomah County, as well. With respect to the Tri-Met transactions, * * * the state offered no evidence beyond Ferree\u2019s testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">213 Or App at 271. The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the Tri-Met charges, arguing that the state had failed to prove that the Tri-Met location\u2014 \u201cOverlook, in Portland, Oregon\u201d \u2014 was in Multnomah County, where she was tried. The trial court denied that motion, and the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We reversed, concluding that \u201cthe state did not adduce sufficient evidence to establish that the three Tri-Met transactions occurred in Multnomah County.\u201d Id. at 272. We explained that \u201cthe involvement of the Portland Police Bureau says nothing about the county in which the Tri-Met transactions occurred,\u201d and we also noted that \u201c[t]here [was] no evidence showing where Overlook is in relation to Multnomah County, or even that it is a neighborhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we rejected the state\u2019s argument that \u201cthe Multnomah County jury could rely on its own experience to infer the location of the Tri-Met transactions,\u201d explaining that \u201c[a]lthough it is certainly possible that some of the jurors were familiar with the location of the Overlook area and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>relation to Multnomah County, we reject as speculative reliance on such information to establish venue beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Unlike in <em>Tirado, </em>here the jury was not required to \u201cstack inferences\u201d to conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct took place in Medford and that Medford is located in Jackson County. In <em>Tirado </em>the jury had to infer (1) that the Veteran\u2019s Domiciliary was in White City; (2) that White City is near Medford; and (3) that Medford is in Jackson County. Here, by contrast, the jury only had to infer that Medford is located in Jackson County, because the state proved by direct evidence that defendant\u2019s conduct took place in Medford. And, unlike in <em>Means, </em>here there is no dispute that defendant\u2019s conduct took place in Medford. In <em>Means, </em>there was no direct evidence that an Overlook neighborhood was located in Portland or that any such neighborhood existed, much less existed in the part of Portland that is located within Multnomah County. There, the jury would have been required to infer the existence of the neighborhood, its relation to Portland, and its relation to Multnomah County. Here, by contrast, the jury only was required to infer that Medford was located in Jackson County. That inference, unlike the cascading inferences required in <em>Tirado </em>and <em>Means, </em>did not require so \u201cgreat an inferential leap\u201d from the evidence set out above as to be impermissible. <em>Lopez-Medina, </em>143 Or App at 201. Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\"> Because of our conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to infer venue, we do not reach the state\u2019s alternative reliance on judicial notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
