At trial, the state sought to admit into evidence a drawing of a robbery that was found in defendant\u2019s backpack. Defendant contended that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudice under OEC 403. The court concluded that the evidence was relevant and was admissible under OEC 404(4) as \u201cevidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts,\u201d and declined to engage in OEC 403 balancing. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in not engaging in balancing under OEC 403, because it was constitutionally required. We conclude that defendant did not preserve his constitutional argument, and we therefore do not address it and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">It is undisputed that defendant participated in a robbery with three other men while they were all wearing face masks, hooded sweatshirts, and bandanas. One of the men held what the victim believed to be a real gun<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the victim\u2019s head and demanded money, bongs, and marijuana. The victim gave the men $800 in cash, and the men also took a pipe, hats, bongs, belts, and a video game controller. The four men left and divided the cash; defendant received $200 as his share.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">When the car in which the men were riding was stopped for a traffic infraction, the men fled on foot. A search of the trunk turned up a backpack. Inside the backpack were items belonging to defendant, including a school paper. On the paper was a drawing of a masked man pointing a gun at a woman and saying, \u201cGimme tha jewlery bitch\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Other participants in the burglary implicated defendant, and he was charged with burglary and robbery. The state sought to introduce the drawing into evidence, and defendant objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201cWhat I would direct the Court to look at is in the middle drawing the \u2014 cartoon or doodle here. We would object, on the grounds that under 403; it is more prejudicial than probative. * * * I do object to the jury see[ing] that drawing. You know, there\u2019s the prejudice aspect aside, I also don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any \u2014 I think an assumption could be drawn that [defendant] didn\u2019t actually draw that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The state argued that the evidence was relevant and admissible under OEC 404(4) (\u201cother crimes, wrongs or acts by the defendant\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the court was not required to engage in balancing under OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The trial court noted that it appeared from the requested jury instructions that defendant\u2019s defense would be that he was present at the robbery but did not participate. The court ruled that the drawing was relevant to show that defendant\u2019s involvement was greater than simply being present at the time of the robbery, and \u201cthe balancing test is not the issue that we have.\u201d The drawing was admitted over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">On appeal, defendant argues only that the trial court erred in admitting the drawing without considering whether its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We review the trial court\u2019s ruling for legal error. <em>State v. Sewell, </em>222 Or App 423, 428, 193 P3d 1046 (2008), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>225 Or App 296, 201 P3d 918, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 258 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Only relevant evidence is admissible at trial. OEC 402; <em>State v. Mayfield, </em>302 Or 631, 644, 733 P2d 438 (1987). Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401. Even though evidence may be relevant, it \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury[.]\u201d OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">However, as we have held in several cases, in the absence of due process considerations, no OEC 403 balancing is required in the context of relevant evidence admissible under OEC 404(4). <em>See, e.g., State v. Wyant, </em>217 Or App 199, 204, 175 P3d 988 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 558 (2008) (\u201cOEC 404(4) * * * does not permit * * * balancing under OEC 403, unless it is required by due process considerations.\u201d). <em>In State v. Moore / Coen, </em>349 Or 371, 389, 245 P3d 101 (2010), the Supreme Court held that OEC 404(4) is not unconstitutional, because the text itself prohibits the introduction of evidence that would violate the state and federal constitutional standards. Defendant contends that a weighing of the probative value of the drawing against its unfair prejudice was required by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. However, defendant did not preserve that constitutional argument below, and we therefore decline to address it. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (a party must \u201cprovide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> The gun was an Airsoft submachine gun.
