In some circumstances, however, firefighters do not have the burden to prove causation. Instead, the \u201cfirefighters\u2019 presumption\u201d deems certain medical conditions to presumptively have been caused by employment when those conditions are suffered by individuals who have worked as firefighters for at least five years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cDeath, disability or impairment of health of firefighters of any political division who have completed five or more years of employment as firefighters, caused by any <em>disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, hypertension or cardiovascular-renal disease, </em>and resulting from their employment as firefighters is an \u2018occupational disease.\u2019 Any condition or impairment of health arising under this subsection shall be presumed to result from a firefighter\u2019s employment. * * * Denial of a claim for any condition or impairment of health arising under this subsection must be on the basis of clear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment is unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">ORS 656.802(4) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">This case requires us to determine the meaning of the term \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d as it is used in ORS 656.802(4). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board interpreted that term as referring to \u201can impairment of the body or any of its components that interrupts or modifies the heart and blood vessels.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Consequently, the board ruled, claimant \u2014 a firefighter \u2014 proved that she had an occupational disease simply by establishing that she suffered from a condition that affected the <em>function </em>of her heart by causing it to beat too slowly, even if the underlying condition was a \u201cnervous system disorder,\u201d rather than a disease of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>heart itself. On review, employer contends that \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d does not \u201cencompass just any disease that may have symptoms in the heart\u201d; rather, \u201c[t]he disease itself must be of the heart, vessels and kidneys.\u201d Although we do not fully adopt employer\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease,\u201d we agree with employer that the board\u2019s interpretation of that term erroneously conflates symptoms and diseases, thus expanding the definition of \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d to encompass more than the legislature intended. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\">The pertinent historical facts are undisputed and we take them primarily from the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) factual findings, which the board adopted, and from the board\u2019s order on review. Claimant is a physically fit firefighter. She plays rugby and soccer, and she has a history of \u201cnumerous concussions\u201d that may have resulted in short-term memory loss. In December 2006, claimant vomited heavily, lost consciousness, and experienced seizure-like activity after drinking several glasses of wine. A neurologist who examined claimant soon after that event noted that \u201cclaimant had a history of chronic bradycardia,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a slow heartbeat, \u201cbut had no prior episodes of syncope,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>fainting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Results from EEG and MRI testing were within normal limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Several cardiologists also examined claimant, including Ashley, who reported that claimant had experienced additional episodes of \u201cnear syncope where she felt like she was going to pass out.\u201d Ashley and her partner, Dr. Reddy, evaluated claimant repeatedly in 2007. In March 2008, both of those physicians signed a letter that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201c[Claimant] is a patient in Oregon Cardiology since December of 2006. She has been treated for a number of conditions, the most dominant of which is a chronic vagal syndrome manifest by [symptomatic] bradycardia, syncope and palpations. Although the exact underlying etiology of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>symptoms are unclear, there is little doubt that she has cardiac manifestations dominated by symptomatic bradycardia now, although previously manifest by syncope.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">As another doctor later explained, the word \u201cvagal\u201d refers to the vagus nerve, which \u201ccomes down from the brain through the skull and into the lungs, stomach and the right atrium predominantly.\u201d The vagus nerve is \u201cnot part of the structural anatomy of the heart,\u201d but it produces chemicals that activate the heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Letters and deposition testimony from several physicians revealed that, although they used varying terminology to refer to claimant\u2019s condition (including \u201cvagal syndrome,\u201d \u201cvasovagal syncope,\u201d \u201cneurocardiogenic (vaso vagal) syncope,\u201d and \u201cdysautonomia,\u201d), they all agreed that the condition related to claimant\u2019s nervous system signaling her heart to beat too slowly. As Reddy explained, \u201cbradycardia is a symptom of dysautonomia,\u201d in which \u201cthe brain slows down the heart excessively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">At least three doctors opined that claimant\u2019s heart is sound. Ashley reported in early 2007 that claimant had a strong and healthy heart. Ashley later testified at deposition that she had ruled out cardiovascular disease as a possible diagnosis. Dr. Girod, an infectious disease specialist who had looked for evidence of myocarditis (and found none), noted that claimant\u2019s echocardiogram showed that she had \u201cessentially normal heart function.\u201d Dr. Semler, a cardiologist who reviewed claimant\u2019s records, reported that claimant had \u201cno signs of heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, myocarditis or infectious heart disease.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Relatedly, multiple physicians explained that claimant\u2019s dysautonomia is not a cardiovascular disease. Ashley stated that claimant\u2019s low heart rate was a \u201cfunction of the nervous system\u201d that only \u201cresulted in cardiovascular effects.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Reddy similarly opined that claimant\u2019s dysautonomia is not a cardiovascular process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Semler agreed, stating that the vagus nerve is not part of the heart, but only activates the organ, comparing the relationship between the nerve and heart to the relationship between a television and its remote control.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">One physician, Dr. Kron, disagreed. Kron, a board-certified cardiac electrophysiologist, opined that neurocardiogenic syncope \u201cis a cardiovascular disease of the nervous system in the heart,\u201d which involves \u201cthe brain, the heart [and the] blood vessels that are all integrated in a feedback loop.\u201d Because cardiologists see and treat the condition, he asserted, it \u201cfalls within the scope of cardiovascular disease.\u201d Semler disagreed with Kron\u2019s description of claimant\u2019s condition, stating that \u201cthe heart is just an innocent bystander\u201d of the nervous system disorder. Instead, Semler \u201cagreed that the heart was affected by the disorder of the autonomic nervous system in the same way that a pinched nerve in the lumbar spine would result in radicular pain in the foot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Claimant had a pacemaker implanted in April 2008. Reddy explained that a pacemaker can treat a slow heart rate, which is \u201cthe symptom of dysautonomia,\u201d but it does not help the underlying problem itself. After claimant received the pacemaker, Reddy released her for all normal recreational and occupational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Claimant filed a claim for autonomic dysfunction, which employer denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The claim was heard by an ALJ, who agreed with employer that claimant\u2019s dysautonomia was not a \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d for purposes of the firefighters\u2019 presumption because it did not \u201ccause any pathology to her heart \u2014 nor frankly to her blood vessels or nerves.\u201d Because claimant\u2019s claim was based entirely on application of the firefighters\u2019 presumption, the ALJ affirmed employer\u2019s denial of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Claimant requested review before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, which reversed the portion of the ALJ\u2019s order that upheld employer\u2019s denial of her dysautonomia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>claim. As explained above, the board interpreted the statutory term \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d to mean \u201can impairment of the body or any of its components that interrupts or modifies the heart and blood vessels.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Applying that definition, the board found that claimant\u2019s condition was a \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease,\u201d for purposes of the firefighters\u2019 presumption, because it modified or interrupted the <em>performance </em>and <em>function </em>of her heart and vascular system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board also concluded that employer had not overcome the presumption that claimant\u2019s condition resulted from her employment. <em>See </em>ORS 656.802(4) (\u201cDenial of a claim for any condition or impairment of health arising under this subsection must be on the basis of clear and convincing medical evidence that the cause of the condition or impairment is unrelated to the firefighter\u2019s employment.\u201d). Accordingly, the board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order. Employer seeks judicial review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">On review, we determine the meaning of the statutory term \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d as a matter of law, not as a question of fact. <em>Karjalainen v. Curtis Johnston &amp; Pennywise, Inc., </em>208 Or App 674, 681, 146 P3d 336 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 473 (2007) (construing the statutory term \u201carthritis or an arthritic condition\u201d). In doing so, we examine the statutory text in context, \u201calong with any helpful legislative history and, if necessary, other aids to construction.\u201d <em>Young v. State of Oregon, </em>246 Or App 115, 119, 265 P3d 32 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Considering solely the statutory text, one might conclude that the term at issue \u2014 \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d \u2014 comes into play only when a firefighter suffers a disease of the cardiovascular <em>and </em>renal systems, that is, when the disease is \u201cof the heart, vessels and kidneys,\u201d as employer contends. The record in this case includes no indication that claimant suffers from any disease that has a renal component. We decline, however, to resolve the case on that basis. Previous opinions of this court and the Supreme Court implicitly equate \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d with heart disease, without discussing the significance of \u201crenal\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>statutory term. <em>See, e.g., Wright v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 323, 332, 613 P2d 755 (1980) (presumption applied to claimant who suffered \u201cboth heart related and lung related conditions or impairments of the kind described in the statutes\u201d); <em>Long v. Tualatin Valley Fire, </em>163 Or App 397, 399-400, 987 P2d 1267 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 412 (2000) (characterizing the firefighters\u2019 presumption as applying where a firefighter has \u201cheart or lung disease\u201d). Given that we readily can resolve this case on the other grounds discussed below, we decline to decide whether, despite the cases noted above, the term \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d applies only where a claimant proves that his or her cardiovascular disease has a renal component. Instead we assume, only for purposes of this opinion, that the legislature intended the term to encompass all cardiovascular diseases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">We turn, then, to what it means for a claimant to have a cardiovascular disease. Because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not specifically define that term, we look first to dictionary definitions. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201ccardiovascular\u201d as \u201cof, relating to, or involving the heart and blood vessels.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>338 (unabridged ed 2002). It defines \u201cdisease\u201d (as pertinent here) as \u201can impairment of the normal state of the living animal * * * or any of its components that interrupts or modifies the performance of the vital functions * * <em>Id. </em>at 648. Medical dictionary definitions are similar.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Those dictionary definitions of the noun \u201cdisease\u201d and the modifying adjective \u201ccardiovascular\u201d can be read together in two ways that carry two very different meanings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>First, \u201ccardiovascular\u201d could be read to modify the \u201cimpairment\u201d that constitutes the disease. Understood that way, \u201ccardiovascular disease\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-3\">\u201can <em>impairment of the normal state of the heart and blood vessels </em>that interrupts or modifies the performance of the vital functions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">(Emphasis added.) Alternatively, one could read \u201ccardiovascular\u201d to modify \u201cthe vital functions\u201d whose performance is affected by the underlying impairment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201can impairment of the body, or any of its component parts, that <em>interrupts or modifies the performance of the vital functions of the heart and blood vessels.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">(Emphasis added.) The board\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccardiovascular disease\u201d mirrors the second possible definition set forth above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cCombining [various dictionary] definitions, we conclude that the term \u2018cardiovascular disease\u2019 refers to an impairment of the body or any of its components that <em>interrupts or modifies the heart and blood vessels.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u00ab\u2021 \u2021 <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201c[Claimant\u2019s heart beats too slowly and * * * not enough blood is circulating, which causes her to faint. Thus, claimant\u2019s abnormal heart rate impairs the performance of the heart by adversely affecting its ability to function at a rate that is sufficient for good circulation of the blood. Because claimant\u2019s slow heart beat modifies the <em>function </em>of her heart and blood vessels, her condition qualifies as a \u2018cardiovascular disease^]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">With respect, we believe that the board\u2019s interpretation overlooks the statutory context in which the term \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d is used \u2014 a context in which the heart cannot be said to be \u201cdiseased\u201d simply because its <em>function, </em>although not its physical health, has been affected by some underlying ailment. We find contextual clues to the meaning of \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d in three aspects of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law: (1) use of the word \u201ccondition,\u201d which encompasses \u201cdisease,\u201d to refer to the body\u2019s physical status; (2) the distinction between diseases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>symptoms; and (3) inclusion of hypertension among the ailments that trigger the firefighters\u2019 presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">First, although the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not define the word \u201cdisease,\u201d it repeatedly uses the word \u201ccondition\u201d as an umbrella term that encompasses both diseases and injuries. <em>E.g., </em>ORS 656.012(2)(e). The plain and ordinary meaning of \u201ccondition\u201d is \u201cthe physical status of the body as a whole or of one of its parts.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 473 (defining \u201ccondition\u201d); <em>see SAIF v. Stephens, </em>247 Or App 107, 113, 269 P3d 62 (2011) (noting our approval of that definition of \u201ccondition\u201d). Considering the definitions of \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201ccondition\u201d together, we conclude that a \u201cdisease\u201d must be an impairment of the <em>physical status </em>of the body or one of its parts that interrupts or modifies the performance of the vital functions. The board\u2019s definition of \u201ccardiovascular disease\u201d conflicts with our understanding of the term \u201ccondition\u201d to the extent it focuses on whether something has affected the heart\u2019s <em>function </em>rather than whether the heart\u2019s <em>physical status </em>is impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Second, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law distinguishes diseases from symptoms. <em>See Young v. Hermiston Good Samaritan, </em>223 Or App 99, 104-06, 194 P3d 857 (2008) (explaining distinction between \u201cconditions\u201d (including diseases) and \u201csymptoms\u201d). Because a symptom generally is not itself a disease, any workable definition of \u201cdisease\u201d must, at least for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, exclude mere \u201csymptoms,\u201d that is, abnormalities in \u201cstructure, function, or sensation, experienced by the patient and indicative of disease.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1742 (27th ed 2000). <em>Cf. Young, </em>223 Or App at 101, 107 (radiculopathy, defined by the evidence as \u201cpain that radiates along the course of a nerve root that exits from the spine,\u201d is a symptom, not a condition). Thus, an organ is not diseased merely because its function is affected in a way that indicates the presence of some other, underlying disease. The board\u2019s focus on the heart\u2019s function \u2014 in this case, claimant\u2019s slow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>heart rate \u2014 is inconsistent with the statutory distinction between symptoms and diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Third, we also find significance in the word \u201chypertension\u201d in the statute that creates the firefighters\u2019 presumption, which covers \u201cany disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, hypertension or cardiovascular-renal disease.\u201d ORS 656.802(4). If any underlying condition that affected the <em>function </em>of the heart and blood vessels counted as \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease,\u201d the word \u201chypertension\u201d (high blood pressure) would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Our previous decisions also shed light on the correct interpretation of the word \u201cdisease,\u201d even though we most frequently have discussed its meaning in the context of distinguishing \u201cdisease\u201d from \u201cinjury.\u201d In drawing that distinction, we have reasoned that \u201cdiseases are gradual, rather than sudden, in onset.\u201d <em>Dynea USA, Inc. v. Fairbanks, </em>241 Or App 311, 316, 250 P3d 389 (2011). A phenomenon like a slow heart rate is not, itself, a condition that appears gradually. Rather, like other symptoms, it is something that is measured or perceived at a particular point in time. The underlying condition that <em>causes </em>the heart to beat slowly \u2014 here, autonomic dysfunction \u2014 may be a disease that has a gradual onset, but the resulting bradycardia is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Taking all of the above factors into consideration, we conclude that \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d is a physical impairment of the heart or blood vessels, gradual in onset, that interrupts or modifies the performance of the body\u2019s vital functions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That definition excludes mere symptoms of underlying disease, like modified heart rate, so long as those symptoms do not impair the physical structure of the heart or blood vessels themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The importance of the disease/symptom distinction is highlighted by the logical consequences of defining \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d so broadly that it encompasses all conditions that affect the heart\u2019s function, but not the physical structure of the heart itself. Under the board\u2019s definition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>any </em>condition that triggered a problem with the heart would count as \u201ccardiovascular disease.\u201d Thus, as claimant acknowledged at oral argument, even such conditions as eating disorders, stage fright, or nicotine addiction would qualify as \u201ccardiovascular-renal diseases\u201d if the person who suffered from those conditions experienced a slower or higher heart rate as a result. Such a broad definition of \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d would conflict with the statutory distinction between diseases and symptoms, and it would expand the firefighters\u2019 presumption far beyond what the statutory text and context suggest the legislature contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In short, we disagree with the board\u2019s interpretation of the statutory term \u201ccardiovascular-renal disease\u201d for the reasons set forth above. We remand so the board may reconsider the case applying the correct statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> \u201cThe firefighters\u2019 presumption was added to ORS 656.802 in 1961.
