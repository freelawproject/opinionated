Employer denied the claim, asserting, among other things, that claimant\u2019s work was not the major contributing cause of the claimed disease. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board set aside the denial after finding that claimant had been diagnosed with \u201cchronic muscular tension pain\u201d that was caused by long hours of computer work. Employer seeks judicial review. It argues that the board failed to address whether claimant proved the existence of a disease caused by work, as opposed to proving merely that work caused symptoms of some underlying disease, and failed to make findings necessary to establish the existence of an occupational disease. We are unable to determine from the board\u2019s order whether it found that claimant proved the existence of an occupational disease, not just symptoms. We therefore remand to the board so it may address that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. Over the course of several years, claimant was examined by a number of doctors, including Dr. Graham, who conducted an independent medical evaluation (IME) at employer\u2019s request. Graham reviewed claimant\u2019s medical history and conducted a physical examination, which included a number of diagnostic tests. All of the test results were normal. In a November 2008 IME report, Graham stated that the examination had revealed \u201cno evidence of any objective findings of abnormality.\u201d Nevertheless, based on claimant\u2019s medical history, Graham diagnosed \u201c[c]hronic muscular tension pain, bilateral forearms and trapezii, secondary to chronic work exposure.\u201d Graham stated that claimant\u2019s \u201csymptoms of chronic forearm and trapezial pain are related to chronic muscular tension in the forearms as a result of chronic and prolonged keyboard computer work.\u201d He went on to reiterate, \u201cIn my opinion, the etiology of the condition is the prolonged exposure to long hours of repetitive keyboarding and computer mouse work,\u201d that claimant\u2019s \u201ccurrent condition is due in whole to the worker\u2019s job duties,\u201d and that claimant\u2019s job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>duties were \u201cthe major contributing cause of the present complaints and diagnosis.\u201d Graham was asked to provide the equivalent \u201cICD-9-CM\u201d code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for his diagnosis. He stated, I believe the closest I can come would be either musculoneuralgia (729.1) or overexertion (994.5).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">After Graham made his IME report, employer\u2019s attorney spoke with him about claimant\u2019s case. She later sent Graham a letter summarizing their discussion and asking Graham to sign it if it accurately reflected his opinion. Among other things, the letter stated that Graham had \u201cfound no objective findings of a diagnosable condition at the time of [his] examination\u201d and that, although he had \u201cused the words \u2018musculoneuralgia\u2019 and \u2018overexertion\u2019 in [his] report, they are descriptive terms and not diagnoses.\u201d Graham signed the letter in February 2009. At least two other doctors who examined claimant reported that they could not determine that claimant\u2019s job duties caused the condition underlying his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Employer denied claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim on the grounds that work activities were not the major contributing cause of a disease and that there was a lack of objective findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) set aside employer\u2019s denial. The board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order, relying primarily on Graham\u2019s report. It found that Graham had diagnosed claimant with \u201c[c]hronic muscular tension pain, bilateral forearms and trapezii, secondary to work exposure\u201d and had attributed that \u201ccondition\u201d to his long hours of computer work.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Employer seeks judicial review, arguing that substantial reason does not support the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant proved the existence of a disease that was caused by work. Claimant responds that this is merely a \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>evidence\u201d case. He contends that at least three of the doctors who examined him, including Graham, opined that claimant had a condition that was caused by his work activities. Thus, he argues, substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">ORS 656.802 governs occupational disease claims under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">\u201c(l)(a) As used in this chapter, \u2018occupational disease\u2019 means any disease or infection arising out of and in the course of employment caused by substances or activities to which an employee is not ordinarily subjected or exposed other than during a period of regular actual employment therein, and which requires medical services or results in disability or death * * *[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201c(2)(a) The worker must prove that employment conditions were the major contributing cause of <em>the disease.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The word \u201cdisease\u201d in ORS 656.802 is significant, and is not synonymous with \u201csymptoms.\u201d <em>See generally Young v. Hermiston Good </em>Samaritan, 223 Or App 99, 104-06, 194 P3d 857 (2008) (explaining distinction between \u201cconditions\u201d \u2014 including diseases \u2014 and \u201csymptoms\u201d). Consequently, proof that a claimant\u2019s work caused his or her symptoms does not by itself suffice to prove that work caused a disease, unless medical evidence establishes that the symptoms themselves are the disease. <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Warren, </em>103 Or App 275, 278, 796 P2d 1246 (1990), <em>rev den, </em>311 Or 60 (1991) (citing <em>Weller v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>288 Or 27, 33, 602 P2d 259 (1979)). Whether something is a disease or a symptom is a question of fact that must be resolved based on medical evidence. <em>Cf. Young, </em>223 Or App at 107 (applying that standard to the distinction between \u201cconditions\u201d and \u201csymptoms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">As we understand it, employer\u2019s position is that the board\u2019s order is insufficient because the board did not make findings as to what Graham meant by the word \u201ccondition\u201d when he reported that claimant\u2019s condition was \u201cdue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>whole\u201d to his job duties. Employer seizes on Graham\u2019s acknowledgment that he used the words musculoneuralgia\u201d and \u201coverexertion\u201d as \u201cdescriptive terms and not diagnoses.\u201d Employer infers that Graham intended <em>all </em>of his \u201cdiagnoses\u201d only as descriptions of claimant\u2019s symptoms, and it concludes, therefore, that all of Graham\u2019s references to claimant\u2019s \u201ccondition\u201d related only to symptoms \u2014 not to a disease. Nonetheless, employer acknowledges the possibility that some evidence in the record might support a finding that claimant suffered from an occupational disease. Employer therefore does not argue that the board\u2019s order lacks substantial evidence. Rather, employer contends that the order does not adequately <em>explain </em>whether claimant\u2019s work caused a compensable disease <em>condition,\u201d </em>as opposed to only \u201cprompting] a symptomatic response from an unidentified underlying condition.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Consequently, employer concludes, the order lacks substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In short, employer does not contend that its view of the facts is the only view supported by substantial evidence\u2014 that is, the only view that the board could have adopted. Rather, it argues that the board did not adequately address either the distinction between diseases and symptoms or that distinction\u2019s significance to the occupational disease determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We cannot tell from the board\u2019s order whether it considered the distinction that employer highlights. The board\u2019s conclusion that \u201cDr. Graham\u2019s persuasive opinion\u201d establishes \u201ca compensable upper extremity condition\u201d is susceptible to more than one interpretation. On one hand, the order easily may be read to suggest that the board understood Graham\u2019s report merely to opine that claimant\u2019s symptoms were attributable to his work, and it nonetheless concluded\u2014 erroneously \u2014 that the link between symptoms and work activities was sufficient to establish that claimant had an occupational disease. That reading is plausible given Graham\u2019s February 2009 explanation that he had used the terms \u201cmusculoneuralgia\u201d and \u201coverexertion\u201d in his November 2008 report only in a descriptive sense, not as diagnoses. On the other hand, the order also leaves open the possibility that the board inferred something different from Graham\u2019s opinion: that, despite his later disclaimers, his initial references to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>claimant\u2019s \u201ccondition\u201d still related to a disease \u2014 diagnosed or otherwise. If the board did draw that inference, it needs to say so, and it needs to explain how Graham\u2019s report supports that inference. <em>See City of Roseburg v. Roseburg City Firefighters, </em>292 Or 266, 271, 639 P2d 90 (1981) (as part of their review for substantial evidence and reason, courts review agency orders \u201cfor the existence of a rationale,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwhether there is a basis in reason connecting the inference to the facts from which it is derived\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We recognize that the board\u2019s report acknowledges Graham\u2019s February 2009 letter, stating that Graham \u201cat one point agreed \u2018that he found no objective findings of a diagnosable condition\u2019 and that \u2018musculoneuralgia\u2019 and \u2018overexertion\u2019 were \u2018descriptive terms and not diagnoses.\u2019 \u201d The board explained away those statements by asserting that \u201cthe determination of whether \u2018objective findings\u2019 are present is a legal issue, so a physician\u2019s opinion that no objective findings are present is not controlling if findings satisfying the statutory definition are nevertheless present.\u201d That explanation misses the point. As employer notes, it did not dispute the existence of \u201cobjective findings,\u201d which are statutorily defined as \u201cverifiable indications of injury or disease,\u201d during the board review process. ORS 656.005(19). In other words, employer did not then (and does not now) contend that claimant\u2019s symptoms are so irreproducible, incapable of measurement, or unobservable that they do not qualify as \u201cobjective findings.\u201d The question, however, is not whether claimant\u2019s symptoms are capable of objective and verifiable observation \u2014 the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that they are \u2014 but whether those \u201cverifiable indications\u201d led Graham to conclude that claimant had a <em>disease </em>caused by work, as opposed only to symptoms. <em>See </em>ORS 656.802(2)(d) (objective findings must support medical evidence that establishes the existence of an occupational disease). The board did not make findings on that issue. We remand so the board may (1) make findings about whether Graham or other physicians who examined claimant determined that he had a disease caused by his work, not merely symptoms, and (2) provide and explain an ultimate conclusion about whether claimant met his burden of proving that he suffered an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> \u201cICD-9-CM\u201d stands for \u201cInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification,\u201d which is the \u201cofficial system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States.\u201d National Center for Health Statistics, <em>Classification of Diseases, Functioning, and Disability, </em>http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm (last updated Sept 23, 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> Employer also contended that the claim was untimely.
