The two complainants, E and K, were defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s grandchildren, who were living with defendant and his wife when defendant allegedly committed the crimes. Because it is dispositive in this case, we address only one of defendant\u2019s assignments of <em>error </em>\u2014 viz., that the trial court committed plain error in admitting an expert\u2019s diagnosis that one of the complainants, K, had been sexually abused, because the diagnosis was not based on any physical evidence of abuse. In that assignment, defendant contends that, because the erroneously admitted diagnosis affected the jury\u2019s decision to convict him on the charges involving E, who had not been diagnosed as having been sexually abused, all of defendant\u2019s convictions, not just those involving K, should be reversed. We agree with defendant, exercise our discretion to correct the court\u2019s plain error, and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We take the facts from the pertinent portions of the record. As a result of E and K\u2019s mother\u2019s inability to adequately care for them, E \u2014 who was about five years old at the time \u2014 and K \u2014 who was about three years old \u2014 began living with their maternal grandmother and defendant. E and K testified at trial that, shortly thereafter, defendant began sexually abusing each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">According to E, defendant\u2019s alleged abuse of her began with him touching her breasts and vagina and forcing her to touch his penis and later escalated to him forcing her to perform oral sex on him weekly; the incidents of alleged abuse occurred both in the home and outside of it, including in defendant\u2019s truck while he was hauling garbage for his garbage-disposal business. E testified that, on one occasion in particular, defendant brought E into a shop building that defendant had recently built, set her on a bucket, and forced her to perform oral sex on him and that, because defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>had failed to adequately lock the shop\u2019s door, K walked in and saw defendant with his pants down and E kneeling in front of him, which the children\u2019s grandmother later explained to K was merely defendant showing E a spider bite on his leg.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to E\u2019s testimony, defendant eventually began engaging in sexual intercourse with her once or twice a week when she was about 10 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">E also testified that, throughout the years that defendant had abused her, he sought to prevent her from disclosing his actions by buying her various gifts, including a horse, and by threatening to kill the children\u2019s grandmother and K if E told anyone about the abuse. Despite those threats, E eventually disclosed the alleged abuse in 2005 when she was 18 years old; however, she never talked with K about the alleged abuse that she had suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Defendant\u2019s alleged abuse of K began in a similar fashion according to K\u2019s testimony; defendant began touching K\u2019s penis when K was about five years old. Eventually, according to K, defendant forced him to perform oral sex on defendant \u201chundreds of times\u201d in defendant\u2019s shop and in defendant\u2019s truck while he was hauling garbage. The alleged abuse persisted until K was 12 years old, and, according to K, throughout that time, defendant threatened to kill the children\u2019s grandmother if K ever disclosed the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">After K learned from police investigations that E had disclosed being abused by defendant and, notwithstanding that disclosure, defendant had not killed their grandmother, K, who was then roughly 16 years old, disclosed defendant\u2019s alleged abuse of him about a month after E\u2019s disclosure in 2005. Shortly thereafter, Lustig-Butts, a medical examiner at Klamath Lake CARES \u2014 a child-abuse assessment center \u2014 conducted a physical evaluation of K to determine if he had been physically or sexually abused by defendant. Despite a lack of physical findings indicating that K had been abused, Lustig-Butts nonetheless diagnosed \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty that [K] had been the victim of child sexual abuse\u201d based on K\u2019s history and the disclosures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that K had made to a forensic child interviewer about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The state charged defendant with five counts of first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration, one count of first-degree sodomy, and one count of first-degree sexual abuse involving E; it charged defendant with three counts of first-degree sodomy and four counts of first-degree sexual abuse involving K. The pivotal issue at trial was the credibility of E and K \u2014 a point that the prosecutor highlighted in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cTo this day these kids are still messed up; they are still screwed up by what happened to them. And it is all the Defendant\u2019s fault * * *. These kids told CARES \u2014 you [watched] the video \u2014 they came in here * * * and they looked you in the eye and they told you. Either they are telling the truth or the Defendant is telling the truth. You have to decide which of those it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cHe is saying, T am not ever alone with kids \u2014 maybe twice in my life.f] They are saying, This man repeatedly sexually abused me.\u2019 * * * [Defendant has] to have you believe that they are lying; that they decided together * * * to make up this lie and they just had a really, really bad time of it because they cannot tell you the specifics * * *. No. It is exactly what the experts told me; repeated child abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Following the trial, a jury convicted defendant on all of the counts save <em>one </em>\u2014 viz., a first-degree rape count involving E.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">On appeal, defendant argues that, although he did not object at trial to the admission of Lustig-Butts\u2019s testimony regarding her diagnosis of K as having been sexually abused, the court nevertheless committed plain error under <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009), in admitting that testimony and, therefore, his convictions should be reversed. In response, the state contends that, even if the admission of the diagnosis was plain error, the erroneously admitted diagnosis only affected defendant\u2019s convictions involving K \u2014 not those involving E \u2014 and, therefore, the convictions involving E should be affirmed. As explained below, defendant has the better of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>We begin with the convictions involving K. In <em>Southard </em>\u2014 decided about eight months after defendant\u2019s trial \u2014 the Oregon Supreme Court held that a diagnosis of sexual abuse without physical evidence of abuse is generally inadmissible under OEC 403 because the prejudice to a defendant resulting from the admission substantially outweighs the probative value of the diagnosis. 347 Or at 142. The admission of Lustig-Butts\u2019s diagnosis squarely violates that holding, and, because the diagnosis directly related to the credibility of K \u2014 and thereby likely affected the jury\u2019s decision to convict defendant for the crimes involving K \u2014 we exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 &amp; n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to correct the court\u2019s error in admitting it. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 512-14, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (rejecting state\u2019s argument that the defendant made a tactical decision not to object to admission of diagnosis of sexual abuse without physical evidence of abuse and exercising <em>Ailes </em>discretion to remedy trial court\u2019s plain error in admitting the diagnosis); <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 522, 228 P3d 666 (2010) (same). Accordingly, we reverse and remand the convictions involving K.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We turn to the remaining issue, <em>viz., </em>whether the erroneous admission of K\u2019s diagnosis requires reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions involving E. Absent physical findings of abuse, an expert\u2019s diagnosis of child sexual abuse is inevitably the product of the expert\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the child and the child\u2019s story. <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 362, 234 P3d 117 (2010); <em>see also State v. Kelly, </em>244 Or App 105, 111, 260 P3d 551 (2011) (\u201c[E]ven where an expert does not explicitly vouch for the child victim\u2019s credibility, a diagnosis of sexual abuse made in the absence of physical evidence constitutes impermissible vouching.\u201d). Therefore, in keeping with the general principle that a trial witness may not testify about the credibility of another trial witness, <em>State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 284-85, 844 P2d 195 (1993), the effect of an expert\u2019s assessment of credibility resulting from a diagnosis of sexual abuse is not limited to the child being diagnosed. <em>See State v. Freitas, </em>243 Or App 231, 238, 259 P3d 46 (2011) (stating that reversal of convictions involving two victims in <em>Southard, </em>despite the fact that the erroneously admitted diagnosis of sexual abuse involved only one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>victims, was proper because \u201cthe risk of prejudice that was of concern in <em>Southard </em>\u2014 that the diagnosis may have caused the jury to inappropriately defer to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that [one victim\u2019s] reports of abuse were credible\u2014 inhered in the jury\u2019s disposition of the charges relating to both victims in that case\u201d). Accordingly, the critical inquiry with regard to defendant\u2019s convictions involving E is whether Lustig-Butts\u2019s erroneously admitted diagnosis \u2014 and her implicit expert opinion underlying that diagnosis that K\u2019s report of abuse was credible \u2014 also constituted impermissible vouching for E\u2019s testimony about her alleged abuse, such that the diagnosis likely caused the jury to inappropriately defer to Lustig-Butts\u2019s credibility determination in deciding whether defendant was guilty of the charges involving E. Put differently, because \u2014 as we concluded above \u2014 K\u2019s diagnosis likely affected the jury\u2019s conclusion about the credibility of K\u2019s testimony concerning his abuse, did that conclusion have the ancillary consequence of affecting the jury\u2019s determination of whether E\u2019s testimony about her abuse was also credible?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Here, for at least three reasons, K\u2019s credibility was inextricably tied to E\u2019s credibility and, thereby, likely served an important role in the jury\u2019s determination of the truthfulness of E\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, K testified to a pattern of abuse that mimicked in a number of respects the abuse to which E had testified: (1) the alleged abuse of both happened around the same time when the victims were similar ages; (2) the alleged abuse occurred in similar locations, including defendant\u2019s shop and in defendant\u2019s truck while he was hauling garbage; (3) the alleged abuse progressively escalated from defendant touching their respective genital areas on numerous occasions to each victim eventually performing oral sex on defendant \u2014 a typical \u201cgrooming\u201d pattern of abuse; and (4) defendant allegedly made threats to both of the victims that he would kill their grandmother if they disclosed his actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, the prosecutor\u2019s comments during his closing argument purposely joined K and E\u2019s credibility into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>single consideration for the jury and strongly suggested that Lustig-Butts\u2019s diagnosis showed that both victims were telling the truth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\">\u201cEither <em>they </em>are telling the truth or the Defendant is telling the truth. You have to decide which of those it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201c* * * [Defendant has] to have you believe that <em>they </em>are lying; that <em>they </em>decided together * * * to make up this lie and <em>they </em>just had a really, really bad time of it because <em>they </em>cannot tell you the specifics * * *. No. <em>It is exactly what the experts told me; repeated child abuse.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">(Emphasis added.) Finally, and most importantly, K\u2019s testimony cross-corroborated various aspects of E\u2019s testimony regarding her abuse; he recounted at trial one of the incidents during which E was allegedly abused by defendant\u2014 viz., when K walked in on E performing oral sex on defendant in his shop \u2014 and testified that he had witnessed defendant calling E \u201cbaby girl\u201d and slapping her bottom.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">For those reasons, we conclude that the erroneously admitted diagnosis impermissibly prejudiced the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of both K and E \u2014 a conclusion that does not conflict with our recent decision in <em>Freitas. </em>In <em>Freitas, </em>the defendant was convicted by a jury of numerous sexual crimes that he had committed against his daughters, B and C. 243 Or App at 233. On appeal, he argued that the trial court had committed plain error in admitting the testimony of a CARES doctor diagnosing B as having been sexually abused by the defendant, because the doctor had not found any physical evidence of abuse. We agreed that the admission of that testimony was erroneous under <em>Southard </em>and exercised our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s plain error in admitting it. As a result, we reversed the convictions regarding the crimes committed against B.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">However, because the crimes involving B and C had been tried together, we then had to address whether the erroneous admission of the diagnosis about B also required the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions for crimes committed against C \u2014 who had not been evaluated for sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 234. Focusing on whether the erroneously admitted diagnosis affected the jury\u2019s decision to convict the defendant for the latter crimes, we concluded that the error did not require reversal of the convictions involving C because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">\u201cthe state relied on C\u2019s own in-depth and emotional testimony, other testimony that corroborated C\u2019s allegations, and [expert] testimony explaining why it is common for children like C to delay disclosure of, or to even initially deny but later disclose, childhood sexual abuse. In other words, the state\u2019s case as it related to C would not have been different had the inadmissible evidence been excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 237 (footnote omitted). Importantly, we further noted that, because B\u2019s disclosures to the CARES staff during her evaluation did not include any reference to C and neither B nor C testified about any knowledge of the abuse of the other \u2014 and, in fact, B was not aware that C had been abused until C disclosed the abuse roughly seven years after B\u2019s disclosure \u2014 the CARES doctor\u2019s vouching for B\u2019s credibility resulting from the erroneous admission of B\u2019s diagnosis did not present <em>\u201ca </em>substantial risk that the jury was prejudiced by that testimony in evaluating the credibility of <em>both </em>B and C.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The circumstances presented in this case are materially distinguishable from those in <em>Freitas. </em>Importantly, in contrast to <em>Freitas, </em>K testified about the alleged abuse that E had suffered when he recounted the incident during which he had walked into the shop when E was performing oral sex on defendant; the alleged abuse of K and E occurred for a number of years while both were living with defendant and displayed a number of material similarities, including the locations in which the alleged abuse occurred; and the prosecutor argued that the credibility of K and E were inextricably linked.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Therefore, the erroneously admitted diagnosis in this case presented a substantial risk that the jury was prejudiced in evaluating the credibility of both K and E, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>accordingly, we exercise our discretion to correct the court\u2019s plain error as it pertains to all of defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> K also testified that he had observed defendant calling E \u201cbaby girl\u201d and slapping her on her bottom, and had overheard defendant and E talking about him having impregnated her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\"> As mentioned above, the case against defendant reduced to a \"swearing match\u201d that hinged on the jury\u2019s determination of the credibility of the victims\u2019 testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> The consistency of the testimony of K and E takes on additional weight as a consideration favoring our conclusion that the erroneously admitted diagnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>likely affected the jury\u2019s decision to convict defendant for the crimes involving E, because E reported her alleged abuse a month before K reported his and E testified that she had never talked to K about her alleged abuse. Therefore, it is even more likely that the jury would consider the credibility of K\u2019s testimony as being indicative of the credibility of E\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
