J.</author>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Child appeals a juvenile court order denying his motion for a judgment of nonpaternity as to C, a man who claims to be his biological father. ORS 419A.200(1); ORS 419A.205(1)(d). On appeal, child contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that, because C\u2019s paternity had not been previously established\u2014 the legal consequence of which was that child had no \u201clegal father\u201d pursuant to ORS 419A.004(16) \u2014 the juvenile court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of nonpaternity. As amplified below, we conclude that the juvenile court erred in determining that it had previously established C\u2019s paternity and, as a consequence, erred in treating child\u2019s motion as an untimely motion to set aside a prior paternity determination. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the court to consider the merits of child\u2019s motion under ORS 419B.395, the statute authorizing the issuance of judgments of paternity and nonpaternity during the pendency of a juvenile proceeding, such as this one, where a child has no \u201clegal father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Before turning to the facts and the parties\u2019 contentions, it is necessary to provide some statutory orientation. Under the operative statutes, the ultimate issue in this matter is whether C is child\u2019s \u201clegal father.\u201d A \u201clegal father,\u201d as pertinent here, is defined to mean \u201c[a] man * * * whose paternity has been established or declared under ORS 109.070 * * * or by a juvenile court[.]\u201d ORS 419A.004(16)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">ORS 109.070(1), in turn, provides, as pertinent to this case, that a person\u2019s paternity may be established in one of two ways. First, ORS 109.070(l)(e) provides that paternity may be established \u201c[b]y filing with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form as provided for by ORS 432.287.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ORS 109.070(l)(g) provides that paternity may be established \u201c[b]y paternity being established or declared by other provision of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">During the pendency of a juvenile proceeding, when a child has no \u201clegal father\u201d because paternity has not been established, ORS 419B.395 authorizes the court to enter a judgment of paternity or nonpaternity. Specifically, ORS 419B.395(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201cIf in any proceeding under ORS 419B.100 or 419B.500 the juvenile court determines that the child * * * has no legal father[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] * * *, the court may enter a judgment of paternity or a judgment of nonpaternity in compliance with the provisions of ORS 109.070, 109.124 to 109.230, 109.250 to 109.262 and 109.326.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Proceeding within that legal context, we turn to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">We \u201care bound by the court\u2019s findings of historical fact so long as there is any evidence to support them.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 655, 238 P3d 53 (2010). Accordingly, \u201cwe state the facts consistently with those findings and augment them where necessary with uncontroverted background and procedural facts.\u201d <em>DHS v. Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, </em>236 Or App 535, 542, 238 P3d 40 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The circumstances material to our review span a period of roughly 20 months, between child\u2019s birth in September 2009 and the juvenile court\u2019s denial of child\u2019s motion for a judgment of nonpaternity in May 2011. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>circumstances involved not only the interactions between C and mother and child, but also, as significantly, the tortuous course of dependency proceedings before the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">When child was born in September 2009, both he and mother tested positive for methamphetamine. No father was identified on child\u2019s birth certificate. Within days of child\u2019s birth, Sarah Fancey, who was child\u2019s initial Department of Human Services (DHS) caseworker and who the court found to be \u201cvery credible,\u201d spoke with mother about child\u2019s paternity. During that conversation, mother told Fancey that she was unable to identify child\u2019s biological father. Mother also signed a DHS questionnaire indicating that she was unable to identify child\u2019s father.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Mother entered in-patient drug treatment but was allowed to go to the hospital every day to bond with and care for child, who remained hospitalized for some time. C was present at the hospital for at least some of those visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">When Fancey asked mother about C\u2019s visits, she did not identify him as child\u2019s father but, instead, described him as providing \u201cemotional support.\u201d According to Fancey, her impression, as well as the impression of the in-patient treatment providers and hospital staff, was that, \u201cgiven [mother\u2019s] in-patient status, she had no opportunity to spend time with [C] unless it were at the hospital during her time outside of treatment.\u201d In sum, Fancey testified that, to the extent that C was identified as child\u2019s father, it was for \u201ca self-serving purpose to be able to spend time with his romantic partner\u201d and not because he was \u201cinterested in * * * establishing paternity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In October 2009, DHS filed a petition to obtain jurisdiction over child as to mother only. That petition indicated that child had no legal father. Thereafter, in January 2010, the juvenile court entered a jurisdictional judgment as to mother. Although mother initially had physical custody of child, on March 8, child was placed in nonrelative foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>About a week later, mother \u2014 who had, as noted, originally signed a DHS questionnaire stating that she was unable to identify child\u2019s father \u2014 completed a second DHS questionnaire, identifying C as child\u2019s father. In that questionnaire, mother noted that (1) C had come to the hospital for <em>\u201c4 </em>weeks\u201d and to her in-patient treatment center \u201capproximately] 2 times\u201d; (2) C had provided clothes and bottles to child; (3) C had told her and others that he is child\u2019s father; and (4) neither she nor C had established child\u2019s legal paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">On March 22, a DHS caseworker met with C. According to the case notes, C said that (1) mother had told him that he is child\u2019s biological father and \u201ccalled him when [child] was placed in foster care and told him to call DHS\u201d; (2) he and mother had been living together in his van when she became pregnant and lived there during her pregnancy but broke up about two months before child\u2019s birth; and (3) his \u201cfamily knows about [child,] and they are encouraging him to get \u2018custody of some kind\u2019 \u201d even though \u201cthey haven\u2019t met [child] or [mother] yet.\u201d Further, C expressed an interest in visiting child and being involved in child\u2019s case plan. Blood testing was not conducted \u2014 and has never been conducted\u2014 to determine whether C is, in fact, child\u2019s biological father.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Thereafter, on March 30, the state filed a second jurisdictional petition that concerned C only and identified him as child\u2019s \u201cputative father.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On March 31, at a shelter hearing concerning that petition, DHS\u2019s attorney told the court that mother and C had signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, <em>see </em>ORS 109.070(l)(e), and asked the judge to notarize it, which he did. Immediately thereafter, at the request of DHS, the court amended the petition concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>father to delete any reference to his alleged \u201cputative\u201d status. In response, C\u2019s attorney indicated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">\u201c[C] intends to work with the agency. He\u2019d also like the agency to look at relatives. They have assured me they will be doing that, but he does want that to happen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">At the conclusion of the March 31 shelter hearing, the court set a jurisdictional hearing for May 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Following the shelter hearing, child\u2019s caseworker, Catie Reich, sought to file with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that mother and C had executed. However, she was unable to do so. According to Reich, -within a couple of weeks, she knew that the acknowledgment had been \u201ckicked back because it was the old form dated incorrectly.\u201d Nonetheless, Reich did not inform the court that the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity had not been filed \u2014 the consequence of which was that the acknowledgment was not legally effective to establish C\u2019s paternity. <em>See </em>ORS 109.070(l)(e) (providing generally that \u201cfiling\u201d the voluntary acknowledgment \u201cestablishes paternity for all purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Father failed to appear at the May 18 jurisdictional hearing after having received proper notice. Subsequently, on June 10, the court entered a default jurisdictional and dis-positional judgment as to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Meanwhile, on May 26, following the jurisdictional hearing but before entry of judgment, C had met with Reich and signed a second voluntary acknowledgment of paternity and an action agreement. However, DHS was unable to file that acknowledgment because mother, whose whereabouts were unknown to DHS, had not signed it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reich also arranged for a visit between C and child, but, according to Reich, C was a no-show.\u201d Further, although C began drug and alcohol treatment at some point during the summer, he was no longer engaged in treatment as of early October.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>On January 14, 2011, the court entered a permanency judgment changing the case plan from reunification to adoption. In that judgment, the court noted that mother had not visited child since May 2010, had failed to engage in court-ordered services, and had not maintained contact with DHS. The court also noted that C had failed to comply with the terms of his probation, had not engaged in court-ordered services, and had failed to maintain contact with DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">On January 19, five days after the permanency judgment had been entered, DHS filed a third jurisdictional petition. That petition identified a new man, W, as child\u2019s \u201cpresumed legal father\u201d because child had been born within 300 days of W and mother\u2019s divorce.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That petition denominated C as child\u2019s \u201cputative father,\u201d rather than \u201cfather.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On February 4, DHS filed (1) a motion for a judgment of nonpaternity as to W and (2) petitions to terminate mother\u2019s and C\u2019s parental rights. The court granted the former, and, ultimately, on March 21, entered a judgment dismissing the third jurisdictional petition concerning W.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On March 31, 2011, child filed the motion for a judgment of nonpaternity that is the subject of this appeal. Specifically, child contended that C\u2019s paternity had not been previously established because the original (March 31, 2010) voluntary acknowledgment had not been filed and that, \u201c[although [C] has been portrayed as the legal father of [child], at the present time the child is without a legal father.\u201d For those reasons, child asserted that the court should entertain his motion and enter a judgment of nonpaternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Child acknowledged that a petition to terminate C\u2019s parental rights was pending. Nevertheless, child asserted that a judgment of nonpaternity was necessary because, without one, C would be considered child\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d and DHS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>would be required to give C\u2019s relatives preference as placement resources, which was something that child opposed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In its response to child\u2019s motion, DHS \u201cagree[d] that [C] ha[d] not been established as the child\u2019s legal father by any of the processes described in [the pertinent] statutes.\u201d Further, DHS acknowledged that it \u201cis required by statute and administrative rule to make diligent efforts to place children with relatives, which includes a number of relationships to the child through the child\u2019s parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Nonetheless, DHS contended that C was child\u2019s biological father and that it was too late in the process for child to raise the issue of his paternity. Specifically, DHS explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cIt\u2019s the agency\u2019s position that this is the biological father of the child. Now, to what standard we can demonstrate that is questionable, Your Honor, but it\u2019s noted in the case file from way back that this child resembles [C]. [C] states that it is his child. He visits the child in the hospital. He and mom both signed voluntary Affidavits of Paternity, so there is evidence in the record to suggest that he is the biological father of this child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">\u201c* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">\u201c* * * He\u2019s been found by the Court in jurisdiction, and disposition to be a party to this case, and he has repeatedly signed documents stating that he is the biological father of the child and attempted to become a legal father of this child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Moreover, DHS contended that it \u201cis incredibly far into a case and permanency planning for this child to raise this issue.\u201d In particular, DHS noted that \u201cwe got jurisdiction on him and disposition early on\u201d and that \u201c[t]his isn\u2019t some case where he came up late in the process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The juvenile court denied the motion on the ground that it was untimely. The court determined that \u201c[C] ha[d] been made the father by this court.\u201d According to the court, by the time that it had entered the jurisdictional judgment as to father, the court had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">\u201cdutifully said, okay, we have a father and this is how we are going to proceed from here. I think once the court did that, the Court ratified that mistake in conclusion, and I just don\u2019t think it can be attacked now, after the fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The court acknowledged that child\u2019s attorney at the time had \u201craised this issue probably as soon as she kind of took a look at all of the Discovery[.]\u201d Nevertheless, the court explained that, \u201csince the child was the moving party and the child was always represented, this was just not a timely Motion and that\u2019s the basis for my Ruling against the Motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">As we understand it, the court\u2019s ruling was predicated on its determination that, when it entered the June 10 jurisdictional judgment as to father, based on the mistaken assumption that paternity had been previously established by the filing of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, the court itself established C\u2019s paternity \u2014 the legal consequence of which was that C is child\u2019s \u201clegal father\u201d pursuant to ORS 419A.004(16). Proceeding from that premise, the court appears to have (1) treated child\u2019s motion not as one for a determination of nonpaternity but, instead, as a request to set aside a previous paternity determination effected by the jurisdictional judgment, and (2) deemed child\u2019s motion, so characterized, to be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Child appeals, contending that the court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of nonpaternity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, child contends that, because \u201cthe juvenile court in fact never entered a judgment of paternity, nor was paternity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>legally established in any other way,\u201d the court had not made C child\u2019s \u201clegal father\u201d and the court should have granted his motion for a judgment of nonpaternity. Alternatively, child contends that, if the June 2010 jurisdictional judgment as to C \u201cdid make [C] the legal father, the juvenile court erred in finding that the child\u2019s motion was not timely enough to set [it] aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">DHS remonstrates that the juvenile court correctly concluded that C\u2019s paternity had been established by the June 10 jurisdictional judgment. Further, DHS contends that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">As framed by the parties\u2019 contentions, the striking point for our analysis is the legal propriety of the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion that C is child\u2019s \u201clegal father\u201d as defined by ORS 419A.004(16), which, in turn, was predicated on the juvenile court\u2019s determination that it had established C\u2019s paternity when it entered the June 2010 jurisdictional judgment. That is so because, if the juvenile court had previously established C\u2019s paternity such that C is child\u2019s \u201clegal father,\u201d the court properly treated child\u2019s motion as one to set aside a previous paternity determination. However, if the court had not previously established C\u2019s paternity, so that child has no \u201clegal father,\u201d the court erred in treating child\u2019s motion as one to set aside a previous paternity determination and the case must be remanded for the court to consider the merits of child\u2019s motion under ORS 419B.395(1) \u2014 the statute authorizing the issuance of judgments of paternity and nonpaternity during the pendency of juvenile proceedings where there is no \u201clegal father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">As previously explained, 248 Or App at 24, a \u201clegal father\u201d is one \u201cwhose paternity has been established or declared under ORS 109.070 * * * or by a juvenile court[.]\u201d ORS 419A.004(16)(a). As pertinent to this case, in order for C to be child\u2019s \u201clegal father\u201d his paternity must have been established or declared in one of three <em>ways </em>\u2014 viz., (1) C\u2019s paternity must have been established by the filing of a proper voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, as provided in ORS 109.070(1)(e); (2) C\u2019s paternity must have been \u201cestablished or declared by other provision of law,\u201d as provided in ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>109.070(l)(g); or (3) C\u2019s paternity must have been established or declared by the juvenile court, as provided in ORS 419A.004(16)(a). None of those requirements has been satisfied under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Here, it is undisputed that C attempted to establish his paternity in only one way \u2014 that is, he attempted to establish his paternity through a voluntary acknowledgment as described in ORS 109.070(1)(e). As noted, his attempt failed because a proper voluntary acknowledgment of paternity was never filed. DHS was aware that C\u2019s paternity had not been legally established pursuant to ORS 109.070(1)(e). However, the court was not so aware. Thus, at the time that the juvenile court entered the June 10 jurisdictional judgment, it was operating under the mistaken assumption that C\u2019s paternity had been previously established through a voluntary acknowledgment, as provided in ORS 109.070(1)(e). At no point did the juvenile court seek to establish C\u2019s paternity under any other provision of law, as provided in ORS 109.070(1)(g), nor did the court seek to independently establish or declare C\u2019s paternity, as provided in ORS 419A.004(16)(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Accordingly, the juvenile court erred in determining that C\u2019s paternity had been established and, for that reason, that C was child\u2019s \u201clegal father.\u201d That legal error, in turn, led to the juvenile court\u2019s erroneous treatment of child\u2019s motion as a motion to set aside a prior paternity determination \u2014 and yet again, in turn, to the court\u2019s denial of child\u2019s motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Because of those errors, the court failed to evaluate child\u2019s motion under the operative statute \u2014 ORS 419B.395, which by its terms authorizes the juvenile court to determine paternity during the pendency of a juvenile proceeding such as this one when child has no \u201clegal father.\u201d For that reason, we must remand the case to the juvenile court to determine the merits of child\u2019s motion under ORS 419B.395.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> <em>See </em>ORS 432.287(1) (providing, in part, that \u201c[t]he Director of the Oregon Health Authority shall adopt by rule a form of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that includes the minimum requirements specified by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Further, the hospital\u2019s birth announcement referred to C as child\u2019s father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> <em>See </em>ORS 109.250 to 109.262 (the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\"> <em>See </em>ORS 419B.875(3) (\u201cA putative father who satisfies the criteria set out in [ORS 419B.875(1)(a)(C)] * * * shall be treated as a parent, as that term is used in this chapter * * *, until the court confirms his paternity or finds that he is not the legal or biological father of the child * * *.\u201d); ORS 419B.875(1)(a)(C) (providing, in part, that a \u201cputative father\u201d is one \u201cwho has demonstrated a direct and significant commitment to the child <em>* * </em>* by assuming, or attempting to assume, responsibilities normally associated with parenthood\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> According to Reich, at some point after her May 26 meeting with C, a case note indicating that C had signed a new acknowledgment \u201cwent out in Discovery to all parties on the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\"> <em>See </em>ORS 109.070(l)(b) (\u201cA man is rebuttably presumed to be the father of a child bom to a woman if he and the woman were married to each other and the child is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment or dissolution or after entry of a judgment of separation.\u201d). Apparently, DHS was unaware of W\u2019s existence until shortly before it filed the third jurisdictional petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\"> <em>See </em>ORS 419A.004(16) (defining \u201cparent\u201d to include a child\u2019s \u201clegal father\u201d); <em>see, e.g., </em>OAR 413-120-0720 (providing that DHS\u2019s \u201cpreference for placement of a <em>child </em>for the purpose of adoption is placement with relatives and placing siblings together\u201d (emphasis in original)); OAR 413-120-0730(1) (providing for the identification and assessment of adoptive resources in a particular order of preference in which certain relatives are evaluated first); OAR 413-120-0710(12) (defining \u201crelative\u201d to include, among others, a parent\u2019s blood relatives). The proper application of those rules is not at issue in this appeal, and we imply no view on that matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\"> Before child filed his notice of appeal, the court entered a judgment terminating C\u2019s parental rights \u2014 a judgment that child did not appeal. Child asserts that, even though C\u2019s rights have been terminated, this appeal is not moot because a collateral consequence <em>exists </em>\u2014 viz., that DHS \u201cis required to give preference to relative placements, including extended family of parents, under both statute and regulation.\u201d We agree with child that, in light of that collateral consequence, this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">We also note that, after child filed his notice of appeal, the juvenile court entered a judgment terminating mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b53-5\"> DHS contends that, even if the jurisdictional judgment did not expressly determine the issue of C\u2019s paternity, it did so \u201cby inference.\u201d In other words, as we understand it, DHS contends that, even if the juvenile court had not expressly determined the issue of C\u2019s paternity in the jurisdictional judgment, it necessarily determined C\u2019s paternity when it asserted jurisdiction over him. In support of that contention, DHS points to ORS 109.072(l)(b), which defines the term \u201cpaternity judgment\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201ca judgment or administrative order that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201c(A) Expressly or <em>by inference determines </em>the paternity of a child, or that imposes a child support obligation based on the paternity of a child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201c(B) Resulted from a proceeding in which blood tests were not performed and the issue of paternity was not challenged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">We reject DHS\u2019s contention without extended discussion, noting only two salient observations. First, a determination of paternity does not appear to be a prerequisite to every jurisdictional judgment. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.875(3) (\u201cA putative father who satisfies the criteria set out in [ORS 419B.875(l)(a)(C)] * * * shall be treated as a parent, as that term is used in this chapter * * *, until the court confirms his paternity or finds that he is not the legal or biological father of the child * * *.\u201d). Second, under the circumstances of this case, in which the court mistakenly assumed that paternity had been previously established by operation of ORS 109.070(l)(e), the June 10 jurisdictional judgment did not <em>determine </em>the issue of C\u2019s paternity expressly or otherwise. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>616 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201cdetermine\u201d to mean, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cto settle a question or controversy about: decide by judicial sentence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\"> Our analysis and disposition obviates the need to consider any of child\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
