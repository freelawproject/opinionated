(CC) with violating OAR 437-003-1501<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by not ensuring that fall protection systems were provided, installed, and implemented when employees were exposed to a hazard of falling 10 feet or more to a lower level. Because this was a repeat violation, the citation proposed a $25,000 penalty. CC denied the allegation and requested a hearing. An ALJ issued an order that vacated and set aside the citation, and OR-OSHA seeks judicial review. The question that OR-OSHA presents on review is whether the ALJ misallocat\u00e9d the burden of proof by including the efficacy of CC\u2019s safety program as a consideration in determining whether CC had knowledge of the violation rather than treating it as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The underlying facts are largely undisputed. CC, a roofing contractor, was cited for a serious violation, as defined in ORS 654.086(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after an OR-OSHA compliance officer saw two employees, Bryum and Tatum, working more than 10 feet above the ground without using fall protection equipment. Tatum was the \u201clead man\u201d on the job. The inspector determined that both Tatum and Bryum had been adequately trained in the use of fall protection equipment and that, as the lead man, Tatum\u2019s violation of the safety rule, as well as his allowance of Byrum\u2019s violation, could be imputed to CC. The inspector thus issued a citation for violation of safety standards involving the use of fall protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Because the charged violation is classified as \u201cserious,\u201d OR-OSHA was required to establish that CC had either actual or constructive knowledge of the violation. ORS 654.086. In its request for hearing, CC asserted that it did not have actual knowledge of Tatum\u2019s violation and, further, that it should not be held to have had constructive knowledge of the violation, in light of Tatum\u2019s misconduct in failing to comply with CC\u2019s safety requirements. The ALJ found that Byrum and Tatum had been exposed to a significant hazard as a result of not having used adequate fall protection equipment. The ALJ found, however, that OR-OSHA had failed to establish that CC had actual knowledge of the violation. The ALJ further found that CC had done everything that it could to supply, train, and prepare its employees to work in compliance with OR-OSHA\u2019s rules and had exercised reasonable diligence to ensure that its workers adhered to company policy and OR-OSHA rules regarding fall protection. He found that Tatum\u2019s failure to wear fall protection was willful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The ALJ reasoned that, under Oregon case law, <em>OR-OSHA v. Don Whitaker Logging, Inc., </em>329 Or 256, 264, 985 P2d 1272 (1999),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">\u201cif the evidence shows that an employer did everything an employer could do in the exercise of reasonable diligence to ensure its workers\u2019 adherence to company and OR-OSHA rules, the willful misconduct by a supervisory employee should not be imputed to the employer unless the employer actually knew of the conduct and did not take action to stop it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Tatum\u2019s conduct should not be imputed to CC and that OR-OSHA had therefore failed to establish either CC\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the violation, and he set aside the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">There is no contention on review that CC had actual knowledge of the safety violation. Both parties acknowledge, however, that <em>Don Whitaker Logging </em>holds that evidence that a supervisor knowingly violated a safety standard is sufficient to meet OR-OSHA\u2019s initial burden of production on constructive knowledge \u2014 that is, to make a <em>prima facie </em>case. OR-OSHA also agrees that, under <em>Don Whitaker Logging, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the \u201cparticular circumstances,\u201d including supervisor misconduct, may be offered to prevent an employer from being held responsible for a safety violation. However, OR-OSHA contends that, under a correct view of the law, evidence of supervisor misconduct is not considered in the determination of whether the employer had constructive knowledge; rather, it may be offered as an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d to the employer\u2019s liability. Thus, on judicial review, OR-OSHA takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s analysis and asserts that, in concluding that OR-OSHA had failed to establish constructive knowledge because the evidence showed that Tatum\u2019s violation constituted misconduct, the ALJ improperly conflated the \u201cemployer knowledge\u201d requirement of ORS 652.086(2) with what OR-OSHA considers to be the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d of employee misconduct. OR-OSHA contends that the employer\u2019s constructive knowledge is established with proof of a violation by the supervisor, and that, if the employer seeks to avoid liability based on an employee\u2019s misconduct, it bears the burden of proving the mi sconduct as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\">We have previously rejected OR-OSHA\u2019s argument in <em>OR-OSHA v. Tom O\u2019Brien Construction Co., Inc., </em>148 Or App 453, 456, 941 P2d 550 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>329 Or 348, 986 P2d 1171 (1999), in an analysis essentially upheld by the Supreme Court in <em>Don Whitaker Logging. </em>In <em>Tom O\u2019Brien Construction, </em>OR-OSHA contended that a supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a safety violation should be imputed to the employer in order to establish the employer\u2019s constructive knowledge of the violation. At the hearing, the employer had introduced evidence that it had exercised reasonable diligence to assure compliance with safety standards and to discover employee noncompliance and had invited the inference that any violation was due solely to the supervisor\u2019s unauthorized act. 148 Or App at 457. OR-OSHA contended that that evidence should have been excluded, because it was relevant only to what OR-OSHA characterized as an affirmative defense, which had not been asserted by the employer. We rejected OR-OSHA\u2019s contention, stating that, \u201cin substance[,] it is not [an affirmative defense], because it negates the knowledge element of a serious violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cWe have previously held, and OR-OSHA concedes, that, for an employer to be liable for a serious violation, OR-OSHA must prove that employer knew, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence could have known, of the violation. * * * Because it is an element of the violation, OR-OSHA bears the burden of persuasion on employer knowledge. See <em>Skirvin v. Accident Prevention Division, </em>[32 Or App 109, 112-15, 573 P2d 747, <em>rev den, </em>282 Or 385 (1978)] (reversible error to shift burden of persuasion to employer to show that it <em>lacked </em>knowledge of the violation). Thus, employer knowledge is a <em>prima facie </em>element of a serious violation, and OR-OSHA retains the burden of persuasion on that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cRogue supervisor evidence tends to show that an employer had no reason to know of a supervisor\u2019s violation, <em>i.e., </em>that it had no constructive knowledge of the violation. Although OR-OSHA characterizes the rogue supervisor defense as an affirmative defense, in substance it is not, because it negates the knowledge element of a serious violation. Thus, the ALJ did not err in admitting employer\u2019s evidence in support of a rogue supervisor defense even though employer did not provide notice that it intended to rely on that defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in original; some citations omitted.) We held, in essence, that the \u201crogue supervisor defense\u201d is not a true affirmative defense, but is evidence that rebuts evidence of constructive knowledge by supporting the inference that the employer did not have reason to know of the violation, that is, that it should not be deemed to have constructive knowledge of it. <em>See OR-OSHA v. Don Whitaker Logging, Inc., </em>148 Or App 464, 470 n 11, 941 P2d 1025 (1997), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>329 Or 256, 985 P2d 1272 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">The Supreme Court affirmed our decision in <em>Tom O\u2019Brien Construction </em>but did not write to address the \u201crogue supervisor defense,\u201d instead referring the reader to its opinion in <em>Don Whitaker Logging </em>and stating that it \u201caddresses an argument similar, if not identical, to OR-OSHA\u2019s argument in this case.\u201d <em>Tom O\u2019Brien Construction, </em>329 Or at 351. Because the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Don Whitaker Logging </em>is central to our analysis, we discuss it extensively here. The court began with a discussion of OAR 437-001-0760, the administrative rule that addresses the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>constructive knowledge of a violation based on the knowledge of a supervisor. OAR 437-001-0760(l)(e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\">\u201cAny supervisors or persons in charge of work are the agents of the employer in the discharge of their authorized duties, and are responsible for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">\u201c(A) The safe performance of the work under their supervision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201c(B) The safe conduct of the crew under their supervision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">\u201c(C) The safety of all workers under their supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">OR-OSHA asserted in <em>Don Whitaker Logging, </em>that, under that rule, a supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a violation will be imputed to the employer in most circumstances, because the supervisor acts as the employer\u2019s agent. We had rejected that contention, holding that a supervisor who violates the employer\u2019s policy by breaking a safety rule is not acting as the employer\u2019s agent. 148 Or App at 468-69. In so concluding, we relied on federal case law interpreting 29 USC section 651(b), explaining that federal law was persuasive in interpreting the Oregon counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The Supreme Court explained why it rejected our view that a supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a violation could not be imputed to the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals summarily concluded that a supervisor\u2019s safety violation could not be imputed to the employer \u2018because, under those circumstances, committing the violation does not fall within the discharge of the supervisor\u2019s authorized duties.\u2019 <em>Don Whitaker, </em>148 Or App at 468. The court then supported its conclusion with citations to nonbinding cases interpreting the federal OSHA, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>responding to OR-OSHA\u2019s argument that, because the federal Act contains no rule analogous to OAR [437-001-0760(l)(e)], those cases are inapposite here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\u201cMore troubling, perhaps, is the fact that, under the court\u2019s interpretation of the rule, it is difficult for us to imagine when a supervisor\u2019s safety violation would fall within the supervisor\u2019s \u2018authorized duties,\u2019 given that almost all employers will have applicable safety policies. Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning, it appears that an employer cannot be liable for a supervisor\u2019s safety violation so long as the employer has a policy prohibiting the individual act or acts which led to the safety violation. To us, that interpretation of the rule defeats its purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cWe conclude that the Court of Appeals\u2019 assumption that adopting OR-OSHA\u2019s interpretation of OAR [437-001-0760(l)(e)], in effect, would make employers strictly liable for any OSHA violation is not well-taken. OSHA is a fault-based system. In this case, OR-OSHA has the burden of proving that: (1) the supervisor personally committed a serious violation of a safety law, regulation, standard, rule, or order; and (2) the supervisor was acting within the scope of his authorized duties. If OR-OSHA proves those elements, under OAR [437-001-0760(l)(e)], then facts that the supervisor knew or reasonably could have known are attributable to employer because of their agency relationship. Of course, OR-OSHA may attempt to prove employer knowledge, or what employer, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have known, in a variety of ways.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Don Whitaker Logging, </em>329 Or at 262-63. The court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\u201cproof that a supervisor, acting in the discharge of his authorized employment duties, personally committed a safety violation, or knew or reasonably could have known of the presence of the violation, establishes knowledge that the ALJ <em>may </em>attribute to the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 264 (emphasis added). Thus, the court held, proof that a supervisor knew or reasonably could have known of the violation may be attributable to the employer in order to prove constructive knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The court then addressed the effect of a different administrative rule\u2019s requirement, now embodied in ORS 654.086(2), that an employer is not responsible for a safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>violation if it \u201cdid not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-3\">\u201cOn the other hand, an employer is not responsible for a safety violation if it \u2018did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u2019 <em>Former </em>OAR [437-001-0015(54)(a)(A)]. If OR-OSHA presents evidence demonstrating employer\u2019s knowledge under OAR [437-001-0760(1)(e)], employer still may offer relevant evidence that, in the particular circumstances, it should not be held responsible. Thus, employer simply is wrong in arguing that OR-OSHA\u2019s interpretation of its rule, in effect, creates an irrebuttable presumption of employer \u2018knowledge\u2019 in <em>all </em>circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">329 Or at 263 (emphasis in original). The court characterized evidence offered by an employer to show that the employer \u201cdid not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation\u201d as evidence that negates the presumption that arises from proof of the supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a violation, and as evidence to be considered in determining whether the supervisor\u2019s knowledge should be attributed to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In explaining his understanding of <em>Don Whitaker Logging, </em>it is clear that the ALJ understood that evidence of the particular circumstances can be considered in the determination of constructive knowledge. The ALJ said that the statutes and administrative rules contemplate that \u201cthe reasonableness of the employer\u2019s efforts in promoting safety and employee adherence to OR-OSHA rules must be considered in determining whether \u2018knowledge\u2019 should be imputed.\u201d As OR-OSHA argues, it is clear that the ALJ treated the efficacy of CC\u2019s safety program and supervisor misconduct as relevant to the determination whether OR-OSHA had established that CC had constructive knowledge of the violation. Contrary to OR-OSHA\u2019s contention, under this court\u2019s and the Supreme Court\u2019s case law, the ALJ properly construed OAR 437-001-0760, and properly considered CC\u2019s evidence of a safety program and the supervisor\u2019s violation of CC\u2019s rules in determining whether OR-OSHA had met its burden of persuasion that CC had constructive knowledge of the violation so as to support a citation for a serious safety violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-5\"> Pursuant to ORS 654.290(2)(b), the ALJ\u2019s order is deemed to be a final order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\"> OAR 437-003-1501 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided * * * when employees are exposed to a hazard of falling 10 feet or more to a lower level, the employer shall ensure that fall protection systems are provided, installed, and implemented according to the criteria in [29 CFR \u00a7] 1926.502.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> A serious violation, as defined in ORS 654.086(2), is one in which there is a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201csubstantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a condition which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations or processes which have been adopted or are in use, in such place of employment, unless the employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\"><em> </em>At the time of the decisions in <em>Don Whitaker Logging </em>and <em>Tom O\u2019Brien Construction, </em>the provision equivalent to subsection (l)(e) of the rule was codified in subsection (3)(c) of it.
