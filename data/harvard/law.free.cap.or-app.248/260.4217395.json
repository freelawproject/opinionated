On appeal, defendant raises several assignments of error. We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, in which he contends that the trial court erred in denying his \u201cmotion to exclude his statements\u201d to an officer on the grounds that they were not voluntary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, defendant also argues that the trial court erred in admitting, in the absence of physical evidence, a physician\u2019s diagnosis that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that the complainant had been sexually abused. <em>See State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). The state concedes, and we <em>agree, </em>that the trial court erred in admitting the diagnosis. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> In addition, we reject without discussion all of defendant\u2019s contentions in his <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> In light of our resolution of the first assignment of error, we decline to address defendant\u2019s second assignment, in which he challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of \u201cscientific evidence of\u2018grooming\u2019 without a sufficient scientific foundation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
