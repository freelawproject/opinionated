On review, petitioner assigns error to EAB\u2019s conclusion that claimant was petitioner\u2019s employee. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Claimant was discharged because he was late for work. The Employment Department determined that claimant had a valid claim for unemployment insurance benefits. Petitioner filed a request for hearing before an ALJ, arguing initially that claimant was not entitled to benefits because he was an independent contractor and, secondly, that he had been discharged for misconduct. After conducting a hearing, the ALJ issued a final order concluding that claimant was petitioner\u2019s employee and was discharged, but not for misconduct. Petitioner appealed to the EAB, and the EAB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On review, petitioner contends that the EAB\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In <em>Register Guard v. Employment </em>Dept., 247 Or App 692, 271 P3d 136 (2012), we recently held that the EAB\u2019s order assuming that the claimant was an employee and not an independent contractor without stating factual findings supporting that conclusion lacked substantial evidence and substantial reason. <em>Id. </em>at 696. In that case, the EAB order affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order that the claimant was the petitioner\u2019s employee and was discharged, but not for misconduct. In affirming the ALJ\u2019s order, the EAB assumed, without deciding, that the claimant was an employee and not an independent contractor: \u201cFor purposes of addressing [petitioner\u2019s] argument that claimant was discharged for misconduct, we assume without deciding that claimant provided services to [petitioner] as an employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. Here, the EAB order provided an identical conclusion: \u201cFor purposes of addressing [petitioner\u2019s] assertion [that claimant was discharged for misconduct], we assume without deciding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>claimant provided services to [petitioner] as an employee.\u201d The order provided no other facts to support the EAB\u2019s assumption that claimant was an employee. Thus, the EAB\u2019s order concerning claimant\u2019s status as an employee lacks substantial evidence and substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
