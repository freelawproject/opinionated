J.</author>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Petitioner Hood River County (the county) challenges a final order of the Employment Relations Board (ERB) in which ERB ruled that the county committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to withhold and remit union dues from union members\u2019 paychecks. The county seeks judicial review of that decision, ORS 183.482(8),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and contends that ERB incorrectly concluded that the county violated ORS 243.672(l)(b) and (f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it refused to comply with a demand by respondent Oregon AFSCME Council 75, Local #2503 (the union), that the county calculate and deduct dues based on a specified percentage of union members\u2019 base salaries. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The following facts are undisputed and are taken from ERB\u2019s order. The union is part of a statewide organization, AFSCME Council 75. In late 2007, AFSCME International and AFSCME Council 75 voted to have all Oregon bargaining units change their dues structure from a flat rate to a percentage of salary pursuant to which the dues paid by each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>employee would be proportional to the employee\u2019s base salary. Such percentage-based dues are common among public sector labor organizations, and some of the largest public sector unions in Oregon have dues structures of this type.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In October 2007, the union sent a letter to the county detailing the new percentage-based dues structure and requesting that deductions in employee pay be made based in accordance with it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201c[Mlinimum Dues Rates for full time employees has been set by AFSCME International and Council 75 to be 1.27% of the base salary for each member with a minimum of $15.00 and a maximum of $55.00 effective January 1, 2008. Local 2503 requests that an additional $3.00 per member be deducted. Please change our deductions to the new rates effective January 1, 2008.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The AFSCME executive director sent an additional letter shortly thereafter explaining the new dues structure. In addition, at least one employee submitted a written request to the county asking that union dues be deducted from his or her paycheck under the union\u2019s new percentage-based dues structure. However, the county refused to implement the change. In a letter to the union, the county cited, in support of its refusal, the administrative burden and cost of doing so. The county stated that, although it would not itself compute the deductions for union dues, it would attempt to work with the union if the union would do dues calculations and provide the county with the annual dues for each employee before December 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Oregon AFSCME consists of a large number of public employee local unions and represents employees in many counties across the state. It also represents employees of numerous state agencies and cities of various sizes. Hood River County was the only employer that refused to implement the new percentage-based dues structure; all other employers agreed to calculate and deduct the dues as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">After the county initially refused to implement the new dues structure, the parties\u2019 legal representatives exchanged correspondence. The county maintained its position that it would not calculate the new dues, and eventually, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in February 2008, the union filed a grievance with the county. The county, however, denied the grievance. As reasons for doing so, the county noted that (1) implementing the percentage-based dues (as opposed to \u201ca uniform amount per employee\u201d) would require a change to the payroll software, which its software vendor priced at $32,000; and (2) calculating the deductions by hand would \u201crequire copious amounts of time and money\u201d and was \u201cnot feasible.\u201d However, it stated that changing the payroll software was viable if \u201cAFSCME is willing to pay for the cost of this programming change.\u201d Further, the county indicated that it would be \u201chappy to receive and directly enter the dues withholding amounts as calculated by AFSCME.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Thereafter, in March 2008, the union filed a complaint with ERB alleging that the county\u2019s refusal to withhold the percentage-based dues as requested constituted an unfair labor practice. Eventually, after receiving briefs and stipulated facts and hearing oral argument, ERB issued its final order in August 2009. ERB concluded that the county had violated ORS 243.672(l)(b) and (f) when it refused to make the dues deductions as requested. The county seeks judicial review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On review, the county contends that ERB erred in its two legal determinations. That is, in its first assignment of error, the county challenges ERB\u2019s conclusion that the county \u201cviolated ORS 292.055(1), and therefore ORS 243.776, and therefore ORS 243.672(l)(f)\u201d by refusing to calculate and deduct the union dues as requested. In its second assignment of error, the county challenges ERB\u2019s conclusion that the county violated ORS 243.672(l)(b) when it refused to calculate and deduct the percentage-based dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We begin with the county\u2019s first assignment of error. As noted, under ORS 243.672(l)(f), it is an unfair labor practice for a public employer such as the county to \u201c[r]efuse or fail to comply with any provision of ORS 243.650 to 243.782.\u201d Furthermore, under ORS 243.776, \u201crights and responsibilities prescribed for state officers and employees in ORS 292.055 shall accrue to employees of all public employers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Taken together, those statutes make a public employer\u2019s violation of ORS 292.055 an unfair labor practice under ORS 243.672(l)(f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">ORS 292.055(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201cUpon receipt of the request in writing of a state officer or employee so to do, the state official authorized to disburse funds in payment of the salary or wages of such state officer or employee each month shall deduct from the salary or wages of such officer or employee the <em>amount of money indicated </em>in such request, for payment thereof to a labor organization as the same is defined in ORS 243.650.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">(Emphasis added.) According to the county, ERB\u2019s conclusion that the county\u2019s actions violated ORS 292.055 is erroneous because it rests on an incorrect interpretation of the word \u201camount\u201d as used in the statute. According to the county, the statute does not obligate a public employer to calculate the dues to be deducted. Rather, under the county\u2019s narrow interpretation, the dues are not an \u201camount\u201d under the statute unless they are a single set dollar value supplied by the union. The union responds that an \u201camount\u201d need not \u201cbe a finite number[;] it can be a number derived through a simple calculation such as the one utilized by the [u]nion in setting its dues amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Thus, as framed by the parties, the issue is whether the percentage-based dues deduction requested from the county was an \u201camount of money indicated\u201d under ORS 292.055. To resolve that issue, which is one of statutory construction, we examine the text of the statute in context, along with any helpful legislative history provided by the parties and, if necessary, by applying relevant canons of statutory construction. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). In the absence of a statutory definition, we give statutory terms their plain and ordinary meanings. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Here, because the term \u201camount\u201d as used in ORS 292.055 is not defined by statute, we turn to the term\u2019s plain meaning. The word \u201camount\u201d is fairly broadly defined. It refers to a \u201ctotal number or quantity: Aggregate * * * Sum, Number * * * the sum of individuals * * * [or] the quantity at hand or under consideration.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>72 (unabridged ed 2002). A sum is, among other things, \u201can indefinite or specified amount of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2289. Rather than referring only to a set quantity, the use of the word \u201camount\u201d may be indicative of \u201caccumulative or combinative processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2289; <em>see also Oregon Cable Telecommunications v. Dept. of Rev., </em>237 Or App 628, 636, 240 P3d 1122 (2010) (The term \u201cnumber\u201d can mean \u201c \u2018an arithmetical total : sum of the units involved\u2019 \u201d and it \u201ccan also mean \u2018an unspecified total[.]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1549-50)). Thus, under its plain meaning, the term \u201camount\u201d does not refer only to a single predetermined number, as opposed to the result of a specified calculation. Instead, the term is a fairly broad one that refers to some quantity. Although a predetermined dollar value \u2014 such as a request for a deduction of $30 for each employee \u2014 would constitute an \u201camount\u201d under the statute, so too would a percentage or clear formula \u2014 such as a request for a deduction of 1.27 percent of each employee\u2019s pay \u2014 the application of which would give rise to a certain dollar value.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Furthermore, the statutory phrase in which the term \u201camount\u201d is used points to a broader definition than that advocated by the county. That is, under ORS 292.055(1), the county was required to deduct from employees\u2019 wages an \u201camount of money indicated\u201d in a written request. To \u201cindicate\u201d means to point \u201ctoward with more or less exactness.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1150. The union\u2019s request for deductions from employee pay to be made in accordance with the simple formula provided to the county \u2014 that is, a deduction of a set percentage of base pay plus $3 \u2014 pointed toward a sum of money to be deducted from each employee\u2019s paycheck. The county, based on information in its possession (each employee\u2019s base pay), had only to apply the formula to come up with the specific dollar value amount of the deduction for each employee. Thus, in our view, the deduction requested was an \u201camount of money indicated\u201d within the meaning of ORS 292.055(1). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>follows that the county was required to deduct the dues as requested and ERB did not commit legal error when it determined that the county committed an unfair labor practice under ORS 243.672(l)(f) when it refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We also reject, without extended discussion, the county\u2019s second assignment of error, in which it asserts that ERB incorrectly concluded that the county violated ORS 243.672(l)(b) when it refused to implement the dues structure specified by the union. As noted, ORS 243.672(l)(b) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for a public employer to \u201c[d]ominate, interfere with or assist in the formation, existence or administration of any employee organization.\u201d ERB concluded that the county\u2019s actions interfered with the existence and administration of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In an argument that hinges on its position that it was not required to implement a percentage-based dues structure, the county contends that its refusal to deduct the specified dues did not interfere with the union because it \u201cdid not necessarily deprive the [u]nion of any financial support from the unit members.\u201d Although the county appears to concede that a refusal to make payroll deductions for union dues would constitute an interference with the union\u2019s existence and administration, the county contends that it did not refuse to make deductions. Rather, in the county\u2019s view, it simply refused to perform the union\u2019s calculations, and any revenue lost by the union was therefore the result of the union\u2019s own actions. However, in view of our conclusion that the county was required to deduct the percentage-based dues as requested, we also conclude that its failure to do so constituted an interference with the existence and administration of the union pursuant to ORS 243.672(l)(b). Contrary to the county\u2019s position, its failure to deduct dues as requested deprived the union of its members\u2019 financial support. Thus, ERB properly concluded that the county\u2019s refusal constituted an unfair labor practice under ORS 243.672(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> Pursuant to ORS 183.482(8),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201c(a) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order.
