Of the four assignments of error raised by defendant, we write to address only his contention that the trial court erred in entering four convictions rather than merging them into a single first-degree arson conviction. Although we agree with defendant that the three first-degree arson convictions should have been merged into a single conviction, defendant did not preserve his merger argument regarding his second-degree arson conviction, and, for that reason, we reject that argument. Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s first-degree arson convictions and remand with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of first-degree arson and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Because defendant was convicted, we state the few necessary contextual facts in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Dasa, </em>234 Or App 219, 221, 227 P3d 228, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 173 (2010). Defendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Weeks, and her new boyfriend, Jacob, were sleeping in Weeks\u2019s bedroom above the garage at her grandparent\u2019s home when defendant \u2014 upset that Weeks was with another man \u2014 and Messick, who was a friend of defendant, decided to throw eggs at Jacob\u2019s car, which was parked below Weeks\u2019s bedroom window. After \u201cegging\u201d the car, defendant and Messick left the house, but, having decided that throwing eggs at the car was not sufficiently vindictive, they later returned to the house to inflict more damage to the car by throwing gasoline on it. Once there, either defendant or Messick eventually set fire to Jacob\u2019s car,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> setting off the car\u2019s alarm and waking up Weeks and Jacob. Weeks called the fire department, and, by the time that the firefighters arrived, the flames had proceeded from merely burning the car to damaging parts of the house itself, filling areas of it with smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The state charged defendant with three counts of first-degree arson, alleging the following in the indictment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cCOUNT 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">\u201cThe defendant * * * did unlawfully and intentionally damage property, to-wit: a car, by starting a fire, thereby recklessly placing protected property of another * * * in danger of damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cCOUNT 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cThe defendant * * * did unlawfully and intentionally damage property, to-wit: a car, by starting a fire, thereby recklessly placing [Weeks] in danger of physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201cCOUNT 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">\u201cThe defendant * * * did unlawfully and intentionally damage property, to-wit: a car, by starting a fire, thereby recklessly placing [Jacob] in danger of physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">(Capitalization in original.) Further, the state charged defendant with one count of second-degree arson. The jury found defendant guilty of all of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">At the ensuing sentencing hearing, defendant argued to the court that, under <em>State v. Luers, </em>211 Or App 34, 153 P3d 688, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>213 Or App 389, 160 P3d 1013 (2007), his three first-degree arson convictions had to be merged into a single conviction because those charges all had been brought under the same subsection of ORS <em>164.325 </em>\u2014 viz., ORS 164.325(l)(a)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of that argument, defendant further contended that the three counts of first-degree arson alleged in the indictment were merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>alternative theories to prove his guilt for committing a single act of that crime, which should lead to a single conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The court disagreed, concluding that, because it was not going to impose consecutive sentences on the three first-degree arson convictions, it did not need to follow <em>Luers </em>as \u201cit is not really going to come [into] play.\u201d Following the sentencing hearing, the court entered three convictions on the first-degree arson counts, imposing three years of probation as the cumulative sentence on those convictions, and one second-degree arson conviction, imposing a sentence of nine months\u2019 imprisonment on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On appeal, defendant reprises his merger argument on the three first-degree arson convictions, and the state concedes that the court erred in failing to merge those convictions. That concession is well taken. <em>See Luers, </em>211 Or App at 67 (concluding that anti-merger statute, ORS 161.067, does not preclude merger of three first-degree arson convictions, all of which were brought under <em>former </em>ORS 164.325(1)(b) (1999), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 164.325(l)(a)(B) (2005), despite allegations in indictment alleging for each count that the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct recklessly endangered different protected property or person).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court erred in failing to merge the three first-degree arson convictions into a single conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Defendant also contends on appeal that the court erred in failing to merge his second-degree arson conviction with his first-degree arson convictions. We will consider that contention only if defendant raised it with the trial court and, thereby, preserved it for appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORAP 5.45(1); <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 548, 258 P3d 1228 (2011). To preserve an issue for appeal, a party must proffer to the trial court the basis for the party\u2019s objection with enough specificity to \u201censure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Here, defendant argues that he adequately preserved at the sentencing hearing his merger argument regarding the second-degree arson conviction because (1) the state argued at the beginning of the hearing that none of the arson counts should merge because \u201ceach of these different counts contain an element that the * * * others do not\u201d; (2) defendant concluded generally, after outlining his merger argument with respect to the first-degree arson counts, that he should \u201cend up with one conviction for sentencing purposes\u201d; and (3) after the court concluded that the first-degree arson convictions should not be merged, it stated that the second-degree arson conviction \u201cinvolve[d] a separate element because it involve[d] proof of damage of property in a certain amount,\u201d and, therefore, that conviction did not merge with the other convictions. In the context of the merger argument that defendant made during the sentencing hearing, which focused solely on his first-degree arson convictions and neither referred to ORS 164.315 \u2014 the second-degree arson statute \u2014 nor to whether second-degree arson requires proof of an additional element from those required for first-degree arson, defendant\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing were insufficient to alert the court to the alleged error with respect to the second-degree arson conviction. Therefore, defendant did not preserve that issue for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Convictions for first-degree arson reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for one count of first-degree arson and for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> During trial, the state proceeded on the theories that defendant either set the fire or assisted Messick in doing so, and the record supports either possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-13\"> ORS 164.325(1) provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">\u201cA person commits the crime of arson in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">\u201c(a) By starting a fire or causing an explosion, the person intentionally damages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-16\">\u00ab\u00a1I: * * \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-17\">\u201c(B) Any property, whether the property of the person or the property of another person, and such act recklessly places another person in danger of physical injury or protected property of another in danger of damage!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-18\">Further, ORS 164.305(1) generally defines \u201c!p]rotected property\u2019 as \u201cany structure, place or thing customarily occupied by people.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> The text of <em>former </em>ORS 164.325(1)(b) (1999) was retained <em>in toto </em>when the statute was reorganized and renumbered as ORS 164.325(1)(a)(B) and has not been amended since; therefore, the case law interpreting the former statute applies in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> Defendant does not advance on appeal an argument that the court committed plain error in failing to merge the arson convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
