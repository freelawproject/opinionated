A detailed statement of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. As to mother, the trial court took jurisdiction over child based on mother\u2019s admission to an allegation in the dependency petition. As to father, the trial court took jurisdiction based on the fourth allegation in the dependency petition that he \u201chas not presented him self as a parenting resource and needs the assistance of the Department of Human [Services (DHS)] to establish a meaningful relationship with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On appeal, father contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that DHS \u201cfailed to prove any of the facts alleged as a basis for jurisdiction, much less that any of those Tacts\u2019 exposed child to a current threat of serious loss or injury that is likely to be realized.\u201d DHS concedes that \u201cthe juvenile court erred in finding that [the fourth allegation in the dependency petition concerning father] had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 419B.310(3) (\u201cThe facts alleged in the petition showing the child to be within the jurisdiction of the court as provided in ORS 419B.100(1), unless admitted, must be established by a preponderance of competent evidence.\u201d). We agree with DHS that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction as to father and accept DHS\u2019s concession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the jurisdictional judgment as to father but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Jurisdictional judgment reversed as to father; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> Father also appeals a judgment entered following a review hearing that continued child\u2019s placement in substitute care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> Our disposition obviates the need to consider father\u2019s other contentions on appeal concerning the jurisdictional and review judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
