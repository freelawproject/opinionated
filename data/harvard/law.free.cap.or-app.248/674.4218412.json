J.</author>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">This case requires us to interpret an insurance policy issued by plaintiff to the owners of a restaurant. The policy contained \u201cliquor liability\u201d coverage insuring the owners in the event that they were found to be liable for serving alcohol to a customer who subsequently harmed others. The dispute arose after a customer who drank to intoxication, allegedly at the restaurant, caused an automobile accident in which two persons were killed. Defendants are the personal representatives of the estates of the deceased.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The accident occurred while the restaurant\u2019s insurance policy was in effect, four months before the liquor liability limit was raised from $1 million to $3 million. The estates contend that the amended policy limits applied retroactively to the start of the policy period, including the date of the fatal accident, so as to cover the full amount of the damages, which, the parties agreed at settlement, were $3 million. Plaintiff maintains that the policy amendment applies only prospectively from the date of the policy change endorsement. Like the trial court, we conclude that the estates\u2019 interpretation of the policy change endorsement is not plausible; the enhanced coverage applied prospectively only. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. On March 24, 2007, plaintiff issued an insurance policy to the owners and operators of the Golden Star Restaurant and Lounge in Portland. The policy declarations pages contained a caption stating the policy number and the \u201cPOLICY PERIOD,\u201d specified as \u201c3/24/2007 [to] 3/24/2008.\u201d (Uppercase in original.) The policy provided, among other things, that plaintiff \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies[,] if liability for such \u2018injury\u2019 is imposed on the insured by reason of the selling, serving[,] or furnishing of any alcoholic beverage.\u201d Further, such \u201cinjury\u201d must have \u201coccur[ed] during the policy period * * The liquor liability policy limit was $1 million. The policy also insured the restaurant building.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>On April 29, 2007, decedents of the estates were killed in an automobile accident. The estates claim that the accident was caused by excessive alcohol consumption at the Golden Star by the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Four months <em>after </em>the accident, on September 14, 2007, plaintiff and the restaurant owners agreed on a Policy Change Endorsement that added $2 million in \u201cumbrella coverage\u201d to the liquor liability coverage. That change, the parties agree, raised the coverage to $3 million for claims for injury arising out of the sale of alcohol. The revised policy contained a \u201cPolicy Change Endorsement\u201d that had a caption that was identical to the caption on the original declarations page, including the same policy number and the same policy period. Below the caption and the names of the insured and the agent, the endorsement stated, \u201cEFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGE: 8/27/2007\u201d (uppercase in original). That date was some four months after the fatal accident involving the estates\u2019 decedents. Below the \u201ceffective date of change\u201d information, the endorsement contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201c$290 Annual Return Premium</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201c$166 Return Premium Due</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201c.5730 Pro Rate Factor\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The parties agree that the \u201creturn premium due\u201d is .5730 times $290 and that the amount of time remaining in the \u201cpolicy period\u201d after the effective date of the change endorsement is approximately .5730 of the period. The same page of the policy change endorsement also contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\u201cBELOW IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201cDELETING THE BUILDING COVERAGE FOR LOCATION #1, BLDG #1 IN ITS ENTIRETY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">\u201cADDING UMBRELLA COVERAGE TO THE POLICY FOR LOCATION #1, BLDG #1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">\u201cTHIS CHANGE ENDORSEMENT WILL NOT BE USED TO AMEND POLICY CONDITIONS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">(Uppercase in original.) The parties agree that \u201cLocation #1\u201d refers to the Golden Star.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>In 2009, the estates filed wrongful death claims against the owners of the Golden Star and, pursuant to a settlement agreement, obtained a judgment awarding each estate $1.5 million in damages. Also pursuant to the settlement, plaintiff then filed this action, seeking a judicial declaration that the $2 million umbrella coverage did not apply retroactively to the date of the accident. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The estates argued that the umbrella coverage was retroactive to the beginning of the policy period, March 24, 2007. They relied, first, on the fact that the headings on the endorsement and declarations pages unambiguously stated the \u201cpolicy period\u201d was \u201c03/24/2007 [to] 03/24/2008,\u201d which encompassed the date of the accident, and that the policy provided coverage for injuries that occur during the \u201cpolicy period.\u201d Second, they relied on the statement in the policy change endorsement that \u201cThis change endorsement will not be used to amend policy conditions,\u201d which, they maintained, meant that the policy change endorsement did not alter plaintiffs obligation to cover damages resulting from any injuries during the policy period. Plaintiff, for its part, relied primarily on the statement that the \u201cEFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGE\u201d was after the accident that killed the estates\u2019 decedents, and on the presumption against retroactive application of insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The trial court concluded that the policy had only one plausible interpretation: plaintiffs. The court then granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, denied the estates\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and entered a general declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiff, from which the estates now appeal. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In an appeal from a judgment that results from cross-motions for summary judgment, if both the granting of one motion and the denial of the other are assigned as error, then both are subject to review. <em>Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&amp;L Excavating &amp; Trucking, Inc., </em>178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002). Where there are no issues of material fact, as in this case, we review a trial court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on each motion for errors of law. <em>Hazell v. Brown, </em>238 Or App 487, 495, 242 P3d 743 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>350 Or 573 (2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The issue on appeal, therefore, is the interpretation of the umbrella insurance contract, which presents a question of law. <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469, 836 P2d 703 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In interpreting an insurance policy, we seek to ascertain the intent of the parties, <em>id. </em>at 469, as interpreted from the perspective of the \u201cordinary purchaser of insurance.\u201d <em>Totten v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>298 Or 765, 771, 696 P2d 1082 (1985). We determine the parties\u2019 intent by examining the terms of the insurance policy. <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 469. If the policy expressly defines the term in question, we apply that definition. <em>Gonzales v. Farmers Ins. </em>Co., 345 Or 382, 387, 196 P3d 1 (2008). If the policy does not define the term, we first look to the term\u2019s ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We also consider \u201cthe particular context in which that term is used in the policy and the broader context of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>313 Or at 470. If the term has only one plausible interpretation, we apply that interpretation and conduct no further analysis. <em>Gonzales, </em>345 Or at 387. If, after those steps, the term remains susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations, we resolve any doubt as to the meaning of that term against the insurer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Neither of the provisions on which the estates rely can carry the weight with which the estates would burden them. It is true, as the estates argue, that the term \u201cpolicy period\u201d is unambiguous; it means the chronological period during which the policy at issue is operative. But the fact that a policy is in existence and forms a contract between the insured and the insurer does not, by any means, necessarily mean that every type of coverage or every policy limit that is in existence at one time during the policy period remains in existence during the entire period and cannot be changed by the mutual agreement of the parties. Thus, there is no conflict between the provision stating the term of the policy period and the policy change endorsement that lists mutually agreed-upon changes and states when they take effect. Indeed, if the estates\u2019 reading of the policy \u2014 and there is only one policy, identified on both the original and the change endorsement by the same policy number \u2014 were correct, then the change endorsement not only retroactively increased the liquor policy limit, but also retroactively deleted the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>insurance. No \u201cordinary purchaser of insurance,\u201d <em>Totten, </em>298 Or at 771, could possibly believe that that was the meaning of the policy change endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The estates\u2019 argument based on the statement that \u201cTHIS CHANGE ENDORSEMENT WILL NOT BE USED TO AMEND POLICY CONDITIONS\u201d is also implausible. Indeed, it is difficult to discern just how the estates believe that the statement helps their argument. They apparently contend that the statement means that defendant remains obligated to cover all occurrences during the policy period, notwithstanding the changes. Yet, it is difficult for us to understand how the estates can contend that the language freezes into existence plaintiffs obligation retroactively to cover occurrences without also freezing into existence the very $1 million policy limit that the estates want increased to $3 million. Further, Section IV of the original liquor liability insurance policy, issued March 24, 2007, lists nine separate, numbered conditions, such as bankruptcy and duties in the event of injury, claim, or suit. Neither the policy period nor any liability limit is listed as a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Plaintiffs explanations of the \u201cpolicy period\u201d language and the \u201cnot be used to amend policy conditions\u201d language, on the other hand, are straightforward and plausible. The \u201cpolicy period\u201d information, along with the named insured, the agent, and the policy number, together comprise identifying information for the original policy that was modified by the endorsement, and those modifications went into effect on the \u201cEFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGE: 8/27/2007,\u201d after the fatal accident. The period simply represents the length of the contractual relationship between the insured and the insurer, and not the period during which the policy may not be amended by mutual assent. If the term \u201cpolicy period\u201d had the meaning that the estates attribute to it, then the \u201ceffective date\u201d language could have no meaning at all. Thus, the estates\u2019 interpretation of the policy renders a conspicuous provision superfluous, while plaintiffs interpretation does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Finally, we note that the \u201cpro rate factor\u201d on the change endorsement is also consistent with plaintiffs interpretation of the policy language. The factor \u201c.5730\u201d indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>that a portion of the policy period had already elapsed at the time the umbrella policy was \u201ceffective\u201d on August 27, 2007, and 211 days, approximately 57% of a year, remained until the end of the policy period, March 24, 2008. The prorating of one of the premiums for the change in coverage illustrates the parties\u2019 intent that the umbrella coverage apply prospectively to the remainder of the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Because plaintiffs interpretation that the liquor liability umbrella coverage was intended to cover injuries only after August 27, 2007, is the only plausible interpretation of the policy language, \u201cwe apply that interpretation and conduct no further analysis.\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>345 Or at 387. Therefore, the umbrella policy issued September 14, 2007, did not retroactively fully cover the estates\u2019 damages, and the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> The restaurant owners are also defendants, but they are not parties on appeal. Hereafter, we refer to defendants on appeal as \u201cthe estates.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
