Owens, </em>247 Or App 402, 409, 270 P3d 343 (2011). We explicitly rejected SAIF\u2019s contention that the pertinent statutes merely limit the physicians who may provide impairment findings, but do not otherwise limit the medical evidence that may be considered in determining a claimant\u2019s impairment. SAIF contends that we were wrong in so narrowing the scope of the record that may be considered for purposes of rating impairment and that, even if other physicians\u2019 findings of impairment may not be considered, other physicians\u2019 opinions may be considered in evaluating the findings of those who are authorized by statute to make findings. SAIF has not presented any argument in its petition that leads us to conclude that we were incorrect in our conclusion that no additional medical evidence may be considered, even if only for the purpose of evaluating the attending physician\u2019s findings of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">SAIF also contends that our original opinion failed to make clear that our holding related only to the evidence <em>that may be considered </em>for purposes of rating impairment and erroneously suggested that additional evidence should not be a part of the record. <em>See </em>247 Or App at 407. SAIF is correct. Our opinion relates only to the extent to which other medical evidence may be considered for purposes of rating impairment and should not be understood to require exclusion of any evidence from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion clarified and adhered to as clarified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
