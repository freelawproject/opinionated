Consistent with <em>Sampson v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, we hold that R.C. 2744.09(B) may apply to an employer-intentional-tort claim by a political subdivision\u2019s employee, and we hold that North Ridgeville was not entitled to summary judgment on the intentional-tort claim brought by appellee, Lisa Vacha, here. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">{\u00b6 2} In March 2000, North Ridgeville hired Vacha as a helper in its French Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. As a helper, Vacha\u2019s duties included basic plant maintenance and water testing. North Ridgeville later promoted Vacha to the position of unlicensed operator. An unlicensed operator has the same duties as a helper but is also responsible for meter readings.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">{\u00b6 3} In 2004, North Ridgeville posted a job opening for another helper at the French Creek plant. The North Ridgeville mayor, G. David Gillock, asked Charles Ralston to apply for the helper position at the French Creek plant and asked the plant superintendent, Donald Daley, to grant Ralston an interview. Ralston, the father of two of Mayor Gillock\u2019s grandchildren, was unemployed and in arrears with his child support. Mayor Gillock had known Ralston for about eight years and was aware that his daughter had twice called the police on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Ralston for domestic violence. The mayor did not, however, know that Ralston had a criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 4} Ralston applied for the helper position at the French Creek plant. North Ridgeville inquires about felonies on its employment application, but it does not conduct a criminal-background check before hiring an employee unless the position requires security or leadership. In his employment application, Ralston truthfully answered that he did not have a felony record. Between 1994 and 1999, however, Ralston was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, assault, and disorderly conduct. Daley interviewed Ralston, but did not ask whether Ralston had a criminal record. Daley was pleased with Ralston\u2019s interview, and North Ridgeville hired him for the helper position.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 5} Ralston worked at the French Creek plant from March 2004 to June 2, 2006. During Ralston\u2019s employment at the plant, Vacha worked as an unlicensed operator. At some point, Vacha and Ralston had a verbal altercation after Vacha complained about Ralston\u2019s wife driving onto the plant grounds. After that altercation, however, Vacha and Ralston worked together without incident (until the event underlying this case) and occasionally socialized outside of work. Vacha occasionally drove Ralston to work. From January 2006 to June 2, 2006, Vacha and Ralston worked the 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. shift together, generally alone and unsupervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 6} On June 2, 2006, Vacha picked Ralston up and drove him to the plant for the night shift. During their shift, Vacha permitted Ralston to drive her truck to purchase beer. \u25a0 After returning to the plant, Ralston raped and assaulted Vacha. Vacha fled the plant on foot and reported the rape to the police. Ralston was convicted of rape and sentenced to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 7} In June 2008, Vacha filed this action against Ralston and North Ridge-ville in the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. In her amended complaint, Vacha brought claims against Ralston for damages resulting from the assault and rape and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Vacha alleged the following four claims for relief against North Ridgeville: (1) negligent hiring and supervising of Ralston, (2) vicarious liability for Ralston\u2019s actions, (3) reckless hiring and supervision of Ralston, and (4) intentional, willful, and wanton disregard of the safety of others in selecting, supervising, and controlling Ralston \u2014 an employer intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">{\u00b6 8} North Ridgeville moved for summary judgment, claiming immunity from tort liability under R.C. Chapters 2744 and 4123. The trial court granted summary judgment in North Ridgeville\u2019s favor on Vacha\u2019s vicarious-liability claim, but denied the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim and her claims for negligent and reckless hiring and supervision. North Ridgeville appealed pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), which provides that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>order denying a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability is a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">{\u00b6 9} The Ninth District Court of Appeals held that Ohio workers\u2019 compensation law, R.C. Chapter 4123, precluded recovery on Vacha\u2019s claims for negligent and reckless hiring and supervision, and it reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on those claims. On the other hand, the court of appeals affirmed the denial of North Ridgeville\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Vacha\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim. The court held that because an intentional tort may arise out of the employment relationship between a political subdivision and its employee, North Ridgeville did not establish that it was entitled to immunity as a matter of law on that claim. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals certified that its decision conflicts with <em>Zieber v. Heffelfinger, </em>5th Dist. Richland No. 08CA0042, 2009-Ohio-1227, 2009 WL 695533; <em>Williams v. McFarland Properties, L.L.C., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 490, 2008-Ohio-3594, 895 N.E.2d 208 (12th Dist.); <em>Coats v. Columbus, </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 06AP-681, 2007-Ohio-761, 2007 WL 549462; and <em>Villa v. Elmore, </em>6th Dist. Lucas No. L-05-1058, 2005-Ohio-6649, 2005 WL 3440787. We agreed that a conflict exists and also accepted jurisdiction over North Ridgeville\u2019s discretionary appeal regarding Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim. <em>Vacha v. N. Ridgeville, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 1487, 2011-Ohio-5129, 954 N.E.2d 661; 129 Ohio St.3d 1488, 2011-Ohio-5129, 954 N.E.2d 661. We consolidated the appeals and held them for <em>Sampson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247. <em>Id. </em>Following our decision in <em>Sampson, </em>we sua sponte ordered the parties to brief the certified-conflict question: \u201cDoes R.C. 2744.09 create an exception to Political Subdivision Immunity for intentional tort claims alleged by a public employee?\u201d <em>Vacha v. N. Ridgeville, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 1537, 2012-Ohio-2025, 966 N.E.2d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">{\u00b6 11} This appeal concerns only Vacha\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim, in which she alleged that North Ridgeville \u201cacted intentionally with willful, wanton disregard for the safety of others, in selecting, supervising or otherwise controlling\u201d Ralston. To recover for an employer intentional tort, an injured employee must prove that \u201cthe employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.\u201d R.C. 2745.01(A). As used in that statute, \u201c \u2018substantially certain\u2019 means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u201d R.C. 2745.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">{\u00b6 12} North Ridgeville argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim because it was immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744. The Ohio Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, R.C. Chapter 2744, provides that political subdivisions are generally immune from liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>damages in civil actions: \u201cExcept as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). North Ridgeville is a political subdivision for purposes of the act, and none of the exceptions in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply. The Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, however, does not apply to \u201c[c]ivil actions by an employee * * * against his political subdivision relative to any matter that <em>arises out of the employment relationship </em>between the employee and the political subdivision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2744.09(B). The purpose of R.C. 2744.09(B) is to protect public employees by allowing them to recover against their employers, who would otherwise be entitled to immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. <em>Sampson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 13} North Ridgeville\u2019s entitlement to immunity on Vacha\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim depends upon the applicability of R.C. 2744.09(B). In its motion for summary judgment, North Ridgeville argued that intentional torts do not arise out of the employment relationship between a political subdivision and its employee and that political-subdivision immunity therefore applies. The court of appeals, however, held that Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim \u201cmay constitute a claim within the scope of R.C. 2744.09(B)\u201d and found that North Ridgeville did not establish that it was entitled to immunity as a matter of law. 2011-Ohio-2446, 2011 WL 1992041, at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 14} After the court of appeals issued its decision in this case, we addressed the applicability of R.C. 2744.09(B) to employer-intentional-tort claims by public employees in <em>Sampson. </em>Like this case, <em>Sampson </em>stemmed from a denial of a political subdivision\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Sampson, </em>a plumber employed by the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (\u201cCMHA\u201d) sued CMHA for various intentional-tort and negligence claims. <em>Sampson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, at \u00b6 2, 6. Sampson\u2019s claims arose from his. arrest by CMHA, during work hours and on CMHA property, for felony theft in office and misuse of CMHA credit cards. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 2-4, 6. CMHA terminated Sampson\u2019s employment after a grand jury indicted him. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. After failing to subpoena a witness from the credit-card company, the county prosecutor dismissed the charges against Sampson prior to trial, with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>Following arbitration on a grievance filed by Sampson, CMHA reinstated Sampson to his former position with back wages, benefits, and seniority, but Sampson resigned, finding the atmosphere intolerable upon his return to work. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>{\u00b6 16} CMHA claimed immunity from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744 on all of Sampson\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. With respect to Sampson\u2019s intentional-tort claims, CMHA relied on a principle from workers\u2019 compensation law, set forth in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc., </em>69 Ohio St.2d 608, 433 N.E.2d 572 (1982), that intentional torts necessarily occur outside of, and cannot arise from, the employment relationship. <em>Sampson </em>at \u00b6 12. Based on that principle, CMHA argued that R.C. 2744.09(B) did not strip it of an immunity defense. <em>Id. </em>Sampson responded that his claims, including his intentional-tort claims, arose out of his employment relationship with CMHA and that R.C. 2744.09(B) therefore precluded CMHA\u2019s assertion of political-subdivision immunity. <em>Sampson </em>at \u00b6 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 17} Noting the differences between the policies underlying political-subdivision-tort immunity and workers\u2019 compensation, we refused to incorporate the <em>Blankenship </em>rationale into the political-subdivision-immunity context. <em>Sampson </em>at \u00b6 16. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">1. When an employee of a political subdivision brings a civil action against the political subdivision alleging an intentional tort, that civil action may qualify as a \u201cmatter that arises out of the employment relationship\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2744.09(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">2. An employee\u2019s action against his or her political-subdivision employer arises out of the employment relationship between the employee and the political subdivision within the meaning of R.C. 2744.09(B) if there is a causal connection or a causal relationship between the claims raised by the employee and the employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-9\"><em>Id. </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. <em>Sampson </em>thus clarified that some, but not all, employer-intentional-tort claims against a political subdivision qualify as civil actions \u201crelative to any matter that arises out of the employment relationship,\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2744.09(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">{\u00b6 18} The court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case predated <em>Sampson, </em>but it closely parallels the <em>Sampson </em>holding. The court of appeals noted that in <em>Buck v. Reminderville, </em>9th Dist. Summit No. 25272, 2010-Ohio-6497, 2010 WL 5551003, it had recently overruled its opinion in <em>Ellithorp v. Barberton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>9th Dist. Summit No. 18029, 1997 WL 416333 (July 9, 1997), a case that North Ridgeville cited in its motion for summary judgment. In <em>Buck, </em>at \u00b6 10, quoting R.C. 2744.09(B), the court of appeals held that \u201ca claim by the employee of a political subdivision against the political subdivision for its intentionally tortious conduct may constitute a \u2018civil action[] * * * relative to any matter that arises out of the employment relationship between the employee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the political subdivision\u2019 under [R.C.] 2744.09(B).\u201d This court summarily affirmed <em>Buck </em>on the authority of <em>Sampson. Buck v. Reminderville, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 24, 2012-Ohio-1580, 967 N.E.2d 1218. Based on <em>Buck, </em>and consistent with our subsequent opinion in <em>Sampson, </em>the court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in denying North Ridgeville\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because \u201cVacha\u2019s employer intentional tort claim may constitute a claim within the scope of R.C. 2744.09(B).\u201d 2011-Ohio-2446, 2011 WL 1992041, at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Sampson, </em>which we reaffirm today, answers the eertified-conflict question in this case; \u201cWhen an employee of a political subdivision brings a civil action against the political subdivision alleging an intentional tort, that civil action may qualify as a \u2018matter that arises out of the employment relationship\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2744.09(B).\u201d <em>Sampson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, at paragraph one of the syllabus. But the answer to the certified-conflict question is not dispositive of the discretionary appeal. As in <em>Sampson, </em>the determination that an employer-intentional-tort claim may implicate the R.C. 2744.09(B) exception to political-subdivision-tort immunity does not answer whether that statute applies in a particular case. That determination requires a court to consider whether \u201cthere is a causal connection or a causal relationship between the claims raised by the employee and the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Sampson </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. Because the order on appeal was a denial of a motion for summary judgment, we review the matter de novo, governed by the standards in Civ.R. 56. <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Sampson, </em>the court of appeals considered the evidence presented and held that Sampson\u2019s claims clearly arose out of his employment relationship with CMHA, and we agreed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. We concluded that reasonable minds could find that Sampson\u2019s claims arose out of his employment relationship with CMHA and that they were, therefore, excepted from immunity under R.C. 2744.09(B). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 21} To resolve the discretionary appeal here, <em>Sampson </em>requires consideration of whether there is a causal connection or causal relationship between Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim and her employment relationship. If there is, then Vacha\u2019s claim arises out of the employment relationship and the city may not claim political-subdivision immunity. If, on the other hand, there is no causal connection or causal relationship, then the city may be entitled to immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">{\u00b6 22} To determine whether there is a causal connection or a causal relationship between Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim and her employment relationship with North Ridgeville, we must look to the factual basis for Vacha\u2019s claim. North Ridgeville argues that Ralston\u2019s criminal acts are unrelated to Vacha\u2019s employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ment relationship with the city, and this may be true, but Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim is not based on the rape and assault she suffered. Vacha pleaded a separate claim to impose vicarious liability upon North Ridgeville for Ralston\u2019s criminal acts, but that claim is not before this court. Rather, Vacha alleged intentional misconduct by the city in its selection, supervision, and control of Ralston. It is a causal connection or causal relationship between that alleged conduct and Vacha\u2019s employment relationship that governs the applicability of R.C. 2744.09(B) here.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 23} This case does not present the clear causal relationship present in <em>Sampson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, where CMHA had its employee arrested during work hours, on work grounds, and for alleged misconduct in his job duties. A plaintiff need only establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiffs claims are causally related or causally connected to the employment relationship to survive summary judgment. <em>Sampson </em>at \u00b6 19, 22. Here, unlike in <em>Sampson, </em>neither the trial court nor the court of appeals has finally resolved the immunity question in this case. The trial court did not mention political-subdivision immunity, but simply held that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether North Ridgeville committed an intentional tort. The court of appeals addressed North Ridgeville\u2019s summary-judgment argument regarding immunity on Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim: \u201cThe city maintained that, as a matter of law, the \u2018civil actions\u2019 that are within the scope of R.C. 2744.09(B) do not include employer intentional torts.\u201d 2011-Ohio-2446, 2011 WL 1992041, at \u00b6 20. The court of appeals simply held that North Ridgeville did not establish entitlement to immunity as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23. The court did not, however, examine the evidence to determine whether a causal connection or causal relationship exists under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 24} <em>Sampson </em>demands affirmance of the denial of North Ridgeville\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Vacha\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim. The court of appeals appropriately rejected North Ridgeville\u2019s argument that R.C. 2744.09(B) never applies to intentional-tort claims and correctly held that Vacha\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim may constitute a claim within the scope of R.C. 2744.09(B). Neither the trial court nor the court of appeals, however, considered whether the particular evidence in this case established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there is a causal connection or a causal relationship between North Ridgeville\u2019s selection, supervision, and control of Ralston, and Vacha\u2019s employment relationship with the city. We decline to make that determination in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 25} According to North Ridgeville, Vacha argues that merely alleging an intentional tort satisfies the causal-connection requirement. Regardless of whether that is an accurate characterization of Vacha\u2019s argument, our affirmance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment does not constitute a holding that mere allegations of a causal relationship are sufficient to preclude a political subdivision\u2019s assertion of immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. If, however, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a plaintiffs claim is causally related or connected to the plaintiffs employment relationship, a political subdivision will not be entitled to summary judgment on the basis of political-subdivision immunity. That is not to suggest that a political subdivision cannot ultimately demonstrate the absence of the required connection and its entitlement to immunity upon a full presentation of the evidence, despite an earlier denial of summary judgment. Nor do we suggest that there is no such thing as an employer-intentional-tort claim that so clearly lacks a causal relationship or causal connection that it falls outside the scope of R.C. 2744.09(B) as a matter of law. For example, were Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim against North Ridgeville based solely on Ralston\u2019s criminal conduct, and not upon alleged intentional misconduct by the city itself, there might be an argument that her claim would fall outside the scope of R.C. 2744.09(B) as a matter of law. That is not, however, the claim that Vacha asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 26} In conclusion, we answer the certified-conflict question by reaffirming our holding in <em>Sampson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, that a civil action by an employee of a political subdivision alleging an intentional tort against his or her employer may fall within the R.C. 2744.09(B) exception to political-subdivision immunity. We further affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in this case because North Ridgeville did not establish that it is entitled to political-subdivision immunity on Vacha\u2019s employer-intentional-tort claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lanzinger, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b490-8\">O\u2019Donnell and Kennedy, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b490-9\">Kennedy, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVT\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">{\u00b6 27} I reluctantly agree that it might be <em>possible </em>under <em>Sampson v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 418, 2012-Ohio-570, 966 N.E.2d 247, for Lisa Vacha to show that her intentional-tort claim is causally related to her employment relationship with the city, which would mean that the exception to political-subdivision immunity under R.C. 2744.09(B) is applicable. However, even if there is a causal connection and immunity does not apply, Vacha will have to prove her intentional-tort claim against the city. Remanding this cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>determine whether immunity applies is a vain act because there is no evidence that the city acted with deliberate intent to harm Vacha. For that reason, I would dismiss her complaint for failing to establish a claim upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">{\u00b6 28} In the city\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment, the city argued that R.C. 2745.01, the employer-intentional-tort statute, should be applied in determining whether Vacha had established an employer-intentional-tort claim. The court of appeals declined to apply R.C. 2745.01 because the city had not mentioned that statute in its motion for summary judgment. 2011-Ohio-2446, 2011 WL 1992041, at \u00b6 17. Instead, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the city had committed an intentional tort under <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s Inc., </em>59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108 (1991), reasoning that the trial court had had no authority to grant summary judgment on a ground that the city had failed to raise. 2011-Ohio-2446, 2011 WL 1992041, at \u00b6 15,17.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 29} <em>Fyffe </em>espoused a common-law rule whereby an employee could recover in an employer-intentional-tort case if the employee demonstrated that the employer had knowledge of a dangerous working condition and yet required the employee to perform his or her work anyway, knowing with substantial certainty that the employee would be harmed. <em>Fyffe </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. <em>Fyffe </em>required a plaintiff to prove that the employer knew that injuries to employees were \u201c \u2018certain or <em>substantially certain </em>to result.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Englund v. Wendy\u2019s Internatl, Inc., </em>6th Dist. Lucas No. L-95-229,1996 WL 199167, *3 (Apr. 26, 1996), quoting <em>Fyffe </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 30} In 2005, the General Assembly codified the requirements for employer-intentional-tort claims in R.C. 2745.01. By enacting R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly intended to \u201c \u2018significantly curtail an employee\u2019s access to common-law damages for what we will call a \u201csubstantially certain\u201d employer intentional tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Houdek v. ThyssenKrupp Materials N.A., Inc., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 491, 2012-Ohio-5685, 983 N.E.2d 1253, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Stetter v. R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, \u00b627. R.C. 2745.01 \u201c \u2018permit[s] recovery for employer intentional torts only when an employer acts with specific intent to cause injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, \u00b6 56. Accordingly, \u201cabsent a <em>deliberate </em>intent to injure another, an employer is not liable for a claim alleging an employer intentional tort.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 31} To the extent that <em>Fyffe </em>espouses a \u201csubstantially certain\u201d employer intentional tort, it is no longer good law. Applying the common-law definition of intentional tort espoused in <em>Fyffe </em>will create a substantial injustice to the city by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>providing Vacha with a lower threshold of proof than is required by R.C. 2745.01. Therefore, I would apply R.C. 2745.01 as interpreted in <em>Houdek </em>and require that Vacha prove that the city acted with deliberate intent to injure her.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">{\u00b6 32} David Gillock, the mayor of North Ridgeville, told Ralston about the entry-level job opening for a helper at the French Creek water-treatment plant. Gillock asked Don Daley, the superintendent of the plant, to interview Ralston for the position. At the time, the mayor was aware that his daughter had called the police on Ralston twice for domestic violence, but in his deposition, he testified that she had not pressed charges regarding either incident. The city\u2019s employment application asked, \u201cSince your 18th birthday, have you ever pled guilty to, or been found guilty of any offense other than minor traffic offenses.\u201d Daley admitted that when he interviewed Ralston, he did not ask him whether he had a criminal record. The city did not conduct background checks for entry-level positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 33} Although it may be prudent for an employer to conduct a criminal-background check for all employment applicants, it is not required by law. <em>Rozzi v. Star Personnel Servs., Inc., </em>12th Dist. Butler No. CA2006-07-162, 2007-Ohio-2555, 2007 WL 1531427, \u00b6 11. Nevertheless, the discovery of a job applicant\u2019s violent criminal history could make it foreseeable to the employer that the employee has a propensity for violence, and if the applicant is hired anyway and then injures someone while on the job, the victim may have grounds to support a negligent-hiring claim. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 34} When the city hired Charles Ralston, he had no felony convictions, but he did have several misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence and one for assault. While this evidence, combined with the mayor\u2019s knowledge of Ralston\u2019s history, might be sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ralston had a propensity for violence that the city knew or should have known about, possibly supporting a claim against the city for negligent, or maybe even reckless, hiring and/or supervision (claims that are barred by workers\u2019 compensation law), I would hold that it is insufficient as a matter of law to support a claim that the city acted with <em>deliberate intent </em>to injure Vacha. <em>Houdek, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 491, 2012-Ohio-5685, 983 N.E.2d 1253, at \u00b6 29. Consequently, remanding this case for consideration whether immunity applies is a vain act. <em>See State ex rel Kinnear Div., Harsco Corp. v. Indus. Comm., </em>77 Ohio St.3d 258, 263, 673 N.E.2d 1290 (1997). I would dismiss Vacha\u2019s intentional-tort claim against the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 35} Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AOV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>John P.
