The corrupt-activity count was predicated on, inter alia, five first-degree-felony counts of making false representations for the purpose of registering securities in violation of R.C. 1707.44(B)(1). At sentencing, which took place after Willan was found guilty of two counts tried separately, the trial court imposed an aggregate total prison term of 16 years. The trial court determined that R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) required a mandatory ten-year prison term for the corrupt-activity count.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">{\u00b6 3} The court of appeals affirmed the guilty verdicts for the corrupt-activity count and three of the predicate violations of R.C. 1707.44(B)(1), but reversed most of the remaining guilty verdicts based on insufficiency of the evidence. 9th Dist. No. 24894, 2011-Ohio-6603, 2011 WL 6749842, \u00b6 71, 85, 94. The court went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>on to vacate the mandatory ten-year prison term imposed for the corrupt-activity count, declaring R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) ambiguous as to whether the mandatory ten-year term applied to Willan. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 119. Because the statute \u201cdid not identify the offense of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity by its Revised Code section number, R.C. 2923.32,\u201d but did use section numbers to identify several other offenses in surrounding language, the court determined that it was \u201creasonable to infer that the mandatory ten-year prison term * * * was only intended to apply to corrupt activity associated with\u201d those other offenses. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 4} We declined to accept jurisdiction over Willan\u2019s appeal. We accepted jurisdiction over the state\u2019s cross-appeal to consider the following proposition of law: \u201cR.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) establishes a mandatory 10-year sentence where a defendant is found guilty of a corrupt activity where the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity is a felony of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">{\u00b6 5} To decide the scope of R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or any statute, we begin with its text, \u201creading words and phrases in context and construing them according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

If words and phrases \u201chave acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise,\u201d we will construe them accordingly. R.C. 1.42. We will attempt to give effect to \u201cevery word, phrase, sentence, and part of the statute\u201d and to avoid an interpretation that would \u201crestrict, constrict, qualify, narrow, enlarge, or abridge the General Assembly\u2019s wording.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Carna v. Teays Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 478, 2012-Ohio-1484, 967 N.E.2d 193, \u00b6 18. If language in a statute is plain and unambiguous, we will apply it as written. <em>State v. Hairston, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 308, 2004-Ohio-969, 804 N.E.2d 471, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) lists four conditions \u2014 divided into separate clauses and expressed in the disjunctive \u2014 in which a sentencing court \u201cshall impose * * * a ten-year prison term that cannot be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20 or Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code.\u201d At issue here is the third conditional clause, which triggers the mandatory ten-year term \u201cif the court imposing sentence upon an offender for a felony finds that the offender is guilty of corrupt activity with the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the first degree.\u201d The first two clauses pertain to different categories of major drug offender (\u201cMDO\u201d) and require the mandatory prison term if the offender is classified as an MDO by committing certain violations of R.C. 2925.03 or 2925.11, or if the offender is found guilty of an MDO specification in addition to a felony violation of any of the 14 enumerated offenses. The fourth clause (beginning with the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d) applies if an offender is guilty of attempted rape and would have been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without parole had the rape been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) is unambiguous on the question before us. Willan was found guilty of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity under R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), predicated on three first-degree-felony violations of R.C. 1707.44(B). R.C. 2923.32(A)(1) states that \u201c[n]o person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise shall conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity or the collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d R.C. 2923.31(1), in turn, defines \u201c[c]orrupt activity\u201d as \u201cengaging in, attempting to engage in, conspiring to engage in, or soliciting, coercing, or intimidating another person to engage in\u201d any of several enumerated categories of predicate conduct, including conduct constituting a violation of R.C. 1707.44(B). R.C. 2923.31(I)(2)(a). Thus, because Willan was \u201cguilty of corrupt activity with the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the first degree,\u201d R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) required the trial court to impose the mandatory ten-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 8} We discern no support for the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation that to trigger the mandatory ten-year term, the corrupt activity must also be \u201cassociated with\u201d one of the drug offenses and the attempted-rape offense \u201cexplicitly enumerated in R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a).\u201d 2011-Ohio-6603, 2011 WL 6749842, at \u00b6 107. That construction overlooks the fact that R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) lists the four offender categories in the disjunctive, signaling that each has a meaning independent from the others and that the existence of any one is sufficient to trigger the mandatory ten-year prison term. \u201c \u2018[CJanons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Toole v. Denihan, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 374, 2008-Ohio-2574, 889 N.E.2d 505, \u00b6 51, quoting <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979). Here, we discern only the General Assembly\u2019s intent to require increased penalties in four separate offender categories, two of which happen to pertain to MDOs. In that respect, the corrupt-activity clause is no different from the language in R.C. 2929.13(F)(10), which states that \u201cthe court shall impose a prison term * * * for * * * [cjorrupt activity in violation of section 2923.32 of the Revised Code when the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity that is the basis of the offense is a felony of the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">{\u00b6 9} We also reject the premise underlying the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the statute is ambiguous. According to the court of appeals, ambiguity existed \u201cin light of the [statute\u2019s] explicit application of the mandatory sentence to sixteen different offenses identified by their Revised Code section number, and the failure to include any statutory reference to R.C. 2923.32.\u201d 2011-Ohio-6603, 2011 WL 6749842, at \u00b6 107. While we disagree with the characterization of the statute as a simple list of offenses to which the mandatory prison term automatically applies, we fail to see how specifying the code number of the general corrupt-activity statute, R.C. 2923.32, would further clarify which <em>predicate offenses </em>are sufficient to trigger the mandatory prison term. Regardless, R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) already identifies which predicate offense triggers the mandatory prison term: \u201cthe most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the first degree.\u201d To add the requirement that the predicate offense must also be one of the drug offenses or the attempted-rape offense would amount to judicial legislation, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 10} Equally unconvincing is Willan\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of ejusdem generis. Under that interpretive canon, \u201cwhenever words of general meaning follow the enumeration of a particular class, then the general words are to be construed as limited to those things which pertain to the particularly enumerated class.\u201d <em>Akron Home Med. Servs., Inc. v. Lindley, </em>25 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 495 N.E.2d 417 (1986). \u201cCorrupt activity\u201d is not a word of general meaning; we must construe it according to its specific legislative definition set forth in R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>2923.31(1). There is simply no syntactic or contextual canon of construction that allows us to overlook the only possible meaning of \u201ccorrupt activity\u201d or the unambiguous meaning of R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 11} We acknowledge that R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) is, like most sentencing statutes, complex, but \u201cthe mere possibility of clearer phrasing\u201d will not defeat the most natural reading of the statute. <em>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1670, 1682, 182 L.Ed.2d 678 (2012). Nor must the General Assembly draft a law with \u201cscientific precision\u201d before we will enforce it. <em>State v. Anderson, 57 </em>Ohio St.3d 168, 174, 566 N.E.2d 1224 (1991). We hold that there is only one reasonable construction of R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a): a mandatory ten-year prison term is required \u201cif the court imposing sentence upon an offender for a felony finds that the offender is guilty of corrupt activity with the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the first degree.\u201d Because Willan fell squarely within the scope of this provision, the trial court correctly imposed the mandatory ten-year prison term.

This conclusion is a rejection of an alternative and plausible interpretation accepted by the three judges on the appellate panel of the Ninth District \u2014 that there was no legislative intent to \u201cunequivocally impose a mandatory 10-year prison term for any offender found guilty of the general offense of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity set forth in R.C. 2923.32.\u201d 2011-Ohio-6603, 2011 WL 6749842, \u00b6 104. The court of appeals held that the statute does not clearly state \u201cwhether the mandatory ten-year term applied to <em>all </em>convictions of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, or only those that involve the offenses that are explicitly identified in the statute.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\n<em>R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) is ambiguous</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 14} In rejecting the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of the statute, the majority views the statute as unambiguously containing four alternative clauses, each independently calling for a mandatory ten-year prison term. But grammatically, that is not so. Former R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) is a single sentence, consisting of 307 words and containing separate references to over 20 other criminal statutes, none of which is R.C. 2923.32, the critical offense of which Willan was convicted. When examined fully, the statutory language is hardly plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 15} The sentence begins with a compound exception, referring to aggravated murder and rape: \u201c[e]xcept when an offender commits a violation of section 2903.01 or 2907.02 of the Revised Code and the penalty imposed for the violation is life imprisonment.\u201d Then murder is referred to as an alternative exception: \u201cor commits a violation of section 2903.02 of the Revised Code.\u201d The first <em>if </em>clause relates to drug offenses with two conditions: \u201cif the offender commits a violation of section 2925.03 or 2925.11 of the Revised Code and that section classifies the offender as a major drug offender and requires the imposition of a ten-year prison term on the offender.\u201d The second <em>if </em>clause specifically refers to other drug offenses' \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">if the offender commits a felony violation of section 2925.02, 2925.04, 2925.05, 2925.36, 3719.07, 3719.08, 3719.16, 3719.161, 4729.37, or 4729.61, division (C) or (D) of section 3719.172, division (C) of section 4729.51, or division (J) of section 4729.54 of the Revised Code that includes the sale, offer to sell, or possession of a schedule I or II controlled substance, with the exception of marihuana</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u2014but then adds an additional clause relating to a sentencing statute: \u201cand the court imposing sentence upon the offender finds that the offender is guilty of a specification of the type described in section 2941.1410 of the Revised Code charging that the offender is a major drug offender.\u201d The next <em>if </em>clause is a compound alternative with three references to rape and says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">if the court imposing sentence upon an offender for a felony finds that the offender is guilty of corrupt activity with the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the first degree, or if the offender is guilty of an attempted violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code and, had the offender completed the violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Finally, the sentence concludes, stating that a prison term of ten years may not be reduced by judicial release, the Adult Parole Authority, or the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction: \u201cthe court shall impose upon the offender for the felony violation a ten-year prison term that cannot be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20 or Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code.\u201d 2004 Am.Sub.H.B.

It is easy to discern that the omission of any cross-reference to a mandatory ten-year sentence for a violation of R.C. 2923.32(A)(1) means that a mandatory ten-year prison term does not apply in these circumstances.

No. 280. R.C. 2923.32 is now enumerated within the definition of \u201chuman trafficking\u201d in R.C. 2929.01(AAA) and the human-trafficking specification in R.C. 2941.1422. R.C. 2923.32(B)(1) also provides that if an offender is convicted of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity under R.C. 2923.32 and is also convicted of the human-trafficking specification under R.C. 2941.1422, \u201cengaging in a pattern of corrupt activity is a felony of the first degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory prison term as provided in\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B)(7). I agree with the court of appeals that it would be unreasonable to conclude that the legislature understood that such offenses under R.C. 2923.32 were already subject to a <em>more severe </em>penalty under former R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) and current R.C. 2929.14(B)(3) in light of these amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\n<em>The rule of lenity applies to R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 18} The majority opinion discusses canons of construction but omits one important principle to be used in construing criminal statutes: the rule of lenity. We have emphasized that \u201c \u2018where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Young, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 370, 374, 406 N.E.2d 499 (1980), quoting <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201cAmbiguity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe condition of admitting of two or more meanings, of being understood in more than one way, or of referring to two or more things at the same time.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>66 (1986). The rule of lenity is codified in R.C. 2901.04(A), which provides that sections of the Revised Code that define penalties \u201cshall be strictly construed against the state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 20} As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">The rule of lenity is a principle of statutory construction that provides that a court will not interpret a criminal statute so as to increase the penalty it imposes on a defendant if the intended scope of the statute is ambiguous. See <em>Moskal v. United States </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 103, 107-108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 112 L.Ed.2d 449, quoting <em>Bifulco v. United States </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205, quoting <em>Lewis v. United States </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 55, 65, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (\u201c\u2018the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the rule of lenity \u201cis statutory ambiguity\u201d \u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Arnold </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 175, 178, 573 N.E.2d 1079. Under the rule, ambiguity in a criminal statute is construed strictly so as to apply the statute only to conduct that is clearly proscribed. <em>United States v. Lanier </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>State v. Elmore, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 472, 2009-Ohio-3478, 912 N.E.2d 582, \u00b6 38. Thus, Willan was on notice that for a conviction of corrupt activity within the meaning of R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a) specified drug-related offenses or attempted rape, he could be subject to the mandatory ten-year prison sentence. But Willan\u2019s conviction for corrupt activity was based upon false representations in registering securities. Because the defined offense of corrupt activity under R.C. 2923.32 does not cross-reference R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a), the mandatory ten-year prison term is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 21} Perhaps if the statute simply said that a mandatory ten-year prison term was required for an offender \u201cguilty of corrupt activity under R.C. 2923.32 with the most serious offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the first degree,\u201d I could join in judgment. However, it does not. The statute is ambiguous because the court of appeals accepted and explained a second, reasonable interpretation of R.C. 2929.14(D)(3)(a). The rule of lenity requires that we construe this ambiguous statute liberally in favor of the defendant.
