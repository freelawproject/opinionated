Specifically, Oberholtzer was charged with misconduct relating to his (1) representation of David and Brenda Ward in a custody dispute, (2) representation of Carmen Nantwi in a child-support dispute, and (3) failure to cooperate with the investigation of both matters by relator. (Disciplinary counsel also charged a third count of misconduct, but later withdrew that count.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">{\u00b6 3} The parties stipulated that Oberholtzer\u2019s representation of the Wards (Count I) violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client), 1.4(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter), 1.15(c) (requiring a lawyer to deposit advance legal fees and expenses into a client trust account, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred), 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">{\u00b6 4} They also stipulated that Oberholtzer\u2019s representation of Nantwi (Count II) violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(4) (requiring a lawyer to comply as soon as practicable with reasonable requests for information from the client), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">{\u00b6 5} Finally, because Oberholtzer was nonresponsive and failed to cooperate with relator\u2019s investigation of both matters, the parties stipulated to violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to respond to a demand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting or refusing to assist in a disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 6} After a hearing, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline accepted all but one of the stipulations. The panel recommended dismissing the charged trust-account violation, Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c), because it found \u201cno evidence, whether in the record or adduced at hearing, * * * to substantiate the charge[ ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 7} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with the stipulations and panel recommendations, the board recommends that we suspend Oberholtzer from the practice of law for 12 months, with the entire suspension stayed on two conditions: (1) Oberholtzer must fully cooperate with a monitoring attorney, appointed by disciplinary counsel, for the entire period of suspension, and (2) he must complete a three-hour continuing-legal-education course on law-office management. Neither party filed objections to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 8} For the reasons that follow, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and agree that a 12-month suspension, stayed on the two specified conditions, is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 The <em>Ward Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">{\u00b6 9} On August 22, 2009, David and Brenda Ward retained Oberholtzer to represent them in a custody matter involving their granddaughter. At that time, the Wards gave Oberholtzer a $2,500 retainer. According to the stipulations, Oberholtzer negotiated the check but did not deposit it into his trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">{\u00b6 10} Oberholtzer prepared a complaint for legal custody of the granddaughter and a request for oral hearing, two affidavits, and a declaration. He sent the documents to the Wards for signatures on October 1, 2009. The Wards returned the signed documents, along with a check made out to the Auglaize County Juvenile Court, to Oberholtzer for filing with the court. Oberholtzer did not file the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The Wards telephoned Oberholtzer about their case on numerous occasions, leaving messages. Oberholtzer generally returned (or attempted to return) their calls, but was occasionally slow to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 12} As of October 2010, Oberholtzer had still not filed anything for the Wards in court. On October 6, 2010, Mrs. Ward filed a grievance with relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 13} Relator began to investigate. Oberholtzer did not respond to relator\u2019s first letter of inquiry, but he sent a brief facsimile response to relator\u2019s second letter of inquiry. Relator sent three additional letters to Oberholtzer requesting more information. Oberholtzer replied to the first two letters, but he never answered the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 14} In December 2010, Oberholtzer contacted Mrs. Ward to discuss the concerns raised in her grievance. At the end of the conversation, Oberholtzer promised to call Mrs. Ward again the next day. Oberholtzer did not call, but on December 16, 2010, he sent another copy of the documents the Wards had originally signed in October 2009. The Wards again executed and returned the documents to Oberholtzer, but he still did not file anything for the Wards until April 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 15} On April 24, 2012, Oberholtzer filed a motion to terminate or modify the guardianship for the child in an ongoing juvenile case. He later amended the motion and submitted a separate motion to intervene in the juvenile case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">{\u00b6 16} In August 2012, the juvenile court dismissed the Wards\u2019 motion to terminate the guardianship for failure to serve the defendant, the child\u2019s father. Oberholtzer sought to vacate the court\u2019s order and requested leave to serve the defendant by publication. These motions were still pending at the time of the panel\u2019s hearing, on September 18, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">{\u00b6 17} The parties stipulated, and the board found, that Oberholtzer had violated the following rules during his representation of the Wards: Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h). They also found that by failing to respond to relator\u2019s third letter requesting additional information, Oberholtzer had violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G). On the board\u2019s recommendation, we adopt these stipulated findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">{\u00b6 18} We also adopt the parties\u2019 stipulation of Oberholtzer\u2019s violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c). The panel recommended that the board dismiss this charge, stating that \u201cno evidence, whether in the record or adduced at hearing, exists to substantiate the charged IOLTA violation in Count 1.\u201d But the board found clear and convincing evidence of \u201cviolations of all the disciplinary rules charged in the formal complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">{\u00b6 19} We agree with the board. The record indicates that Oberholtzer cashed the Wards\u2019 check on August 25, 2009, but he did not deposit the money in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>trust account. The record contains no other evidence about where the money was deposited or whether it was deposited in the trust account at a later time. Based on this evidence, the record clearly and convincingly establishes a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 The <em>Nantwi Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 20} On January 13, 2011, Carmen Nantwi retained Oberholtzer to represent her in a child-support dispute. She paid him a $1,000 retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 21} That same day, Oberholtzer appeared at a preliminary hearing on Nantwi\u2019s behalf. During the hearing, the court scheduled an evidentiary hearing for March 16, 2011. Oberholtzer and Nantwi discussed a strategy for the evidentiary hearing. Oberholtzer asked Nantwi to send him evidence supporting her position, and she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">{\u00b6 22} When Nantwi arrived for the evidentiary hearing on March 16, 2011, Oberholtzer was not there. Attorney Celeste DeHoff, whom Nantwi had never met, informed Nantwi that Oberholtzer was tied up in another hearing. Nantwi e-mailed Oberholtzer the next day, expressing concern about his failure to appear at the evidentiary hearing. Oberholtzer never replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 23} In April 2011, Nantwi filed a grievance with relator. Relator sent Oberholtzer two letters of inquiry, but he did not respond to either.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">{\u00b6 24} In May 2011, Nantwi contacted relator in an effort to retrieve the evidence she had given Oberholtzer to support her position; Nantwi needed the information for an upcoming hearing. Relator called Oberholtzer, and he promptly sent Nantwi\u2019s case file.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">{\u00b6 25} In July 2011, relator sent Oberholtzer a letter inquiring about Nantwi\u2019s allegations. Oberholtzer again failed to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">{\u00b6 26} Days before the panel\u2019s hearing in this matter, Oberholtzer sent Nantwi a letter of apology and a check refunding her $1,000 fee. Oberholtzer had tried to return Nantwi\u2019s money previously, but his letters had been returned marked \u201cundeliverable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">{\u00b6 27} The parties stipulated, and the board found, that Oberholtzer had violated the following rules during his representation of Nantwi: Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.4(a)(4), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h). They also found that by failing to respond to relator\u2019s three letters, Oberholtzer had violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">{\u00b6 28} On the recommendation of the board, we adopt the stipulated findings of fact and misconduct as to Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">{\u00b6 29} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 30} As to aggravating factors, the board accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation of three aggravating factors: Oberholtzer engaged in a pattern of misconduct, he committed multiple offenses, and he did not initially cooperate in the disciplinary process. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 31} The parties stipulated to three mitigating factors, which we accept. Oberholtzer had no prior disciplinary record, he lacked a selfish or dishonest motive, and he cooperated at later stages of the disciplinary proceedings by agreeing to stipulations, appearing at the hearing, and expressing remorse. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 32} At the hearing, Oberholtzer explained serious personal and family medical issues that affected his representation of the Wards and Nantwi. Oberholtzer is the primary caregiver for his permanently disabled wife. In early 2009, Oberholtzer underwent four spinal surgeries in the span of nine weeks. He then suffered life-threatening staph and MRSA infections. As Oberholtzer and his brother-in-law, attorney Steven Okey, testified, Oberholtzer was in very poor health through 2011. As Okey put it, Oberholtzer attempted to \u201csoldier on\u201d with his law practice during this period, with great difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">{\u00b6 33} Oberholtzer apologized to the hearing panel for his \u201cless than acceptable service.\u201d According to Oberholtzer, he has taken actions to improve his office procedures and client communications. He apologized to Nantwi and the Wards, and he has repaired his relationship with the Wards; indeed, he still represented them at the time of his disciplinary hearing. Oberholtzer also submitted a favorable character reference from another client.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 34} The parties have stipulated, and the board recommends, that the appropriate sanction for Oberholtzer\u2019s misconduct is a .12-month suspension, with the entire suspension stayed on two conditions. First, Oberholtzer must fully cooperate with a monitoring attorney, appointed by disciplinary counsel, for the entire period of suspension. Second, he must complete a three-hour continuing-legal-education course on law-office management.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Az_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacey Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b603-9\">Mattheuw William Oberholtzer, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">{\u00b6 35} Our decisions in cases involving similar violations indicate that a 12-month suspension, stayed upon these conditions, is appropriate here. In other cases in which an attorney has neglected more than one client matter and failed to respond to disciplinary investigations, we have issued six-month suspensions, stayed on conditions. <em>E.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Shuler, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 509, 2011-Ohio-4198, 954 N.E.2d 593; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Norton, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 226, 2007-Ohio-6038, 877 N.E.2d 964. However, in some cases of client neglect, we have issued longer suspensions based on the aggravation and mitigation presented. <em>E.g., Allen Cty. Bar Assn. v. Brown, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 530, 2010-Ohio-580, 925 N.E.2d 112 (12-month suspension, stayed); <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Farah, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 455, 2010-Ohio-2116, 928 N.E.2d 1097 (same). In each case, we tailor the conditions for staying a suspension to the causes of the attorney\u2019s misconduct. <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 16. Given the circumstances of this case, we find that a 12-month suspension, stayed on the conditions recommended by the board, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, we suspend Mattheuw William Oberholtzer from the practice of law for 12 months, and we stay the suspension on the conditions that he serve a 12-month period of monitored probation, in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9), that he complete a three-hour continuing-legal-education course on law-office management within 90 days, and that he commit no further misconduct. If Oberholtzer fails to comply with the conditions of the stay, the stay will be lifted and he will serve the entire 12-month suspension. Costs are taxed to Oberholtzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\">. It is unclear whether the board found a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c). In its report, the board stated that it agreed with all of the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, the board mistakenly believed that \u201cthe panel determined * * * that [Oberholtzer] committed each of the rule violations alleged in the formal complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
