Swift from presiding over any further proceedings in the above-referenced matters, now pending for continuation of trial in the probate division of the Court of Common Pleas of Trumbull County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Setinsek\u2019s affidavit is critical of the court-appointed attorneys, guardians, trustees, and investigators in the underlying matters \u2014 claiming that they are unqualified and have \u201csquandered\u201d his family\u2019s money through \u201ccourt sanctioned billing.\u201d Engler claims that Judge Swift has demonstrated \u201cbias, antagonism, and hostility\u201d toward him by angrily scolding him for filing a public-records request, threatening to report him to disciplinary counsel for filing that request, and denying Engler\u2019s recent motion for an extension of time. Both affiants also state that the spouse of the court-appointed trustee in one of the underlying cases is employed by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Swift has responded in writing to the allegations in Setinsek\u2019s and Engler\u2019s affidavits, offering a detailed account of the underlying cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Swift.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 5} First, it is well settled that \u201cabsent extraordinary circumstances, a judge will not be subject to disqualification after having presided over lengthy proceedings in a pending case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1228, 1229, 763 N.E.2d 598 (2001). Further, when an affidavit is filed after commencement of a trial and after the presentation of evidence has begun, a judge should be disqualified only when the record \u201cclearly and unquestionably demonstrates a \u2018fixed anticipatory judgment\u2019 * * * that undermines the absolute confidence of the public in the fairness and integrity of the proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Kate, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1208, 1209, 723 N.E.2d 1098 (1999), quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). According to Judge Swift, he has presided over the underlying cases since 2008 and 2010, and trial commenced in the declaratory-judgment action in June 2010 and is set to continue on September 3, 2013. Given the length of the underlying proceedings and Judge Swift\u2019s significant involvement in the continued trial, disqualification is warranted only under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that clearly show a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment.\u201d Affiants have failed to adduce sufficient proof to carry this heavy burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 6} Second, even if affiants were not bound by this standard, most of affiants\u2019 allegations are not grounds for disqualification. For example, this is not the appropriate forum for affiants\u2019 complaints about the conduct of court-appointed attorneys. Affidavit-of-disqualifieation proceedings are narrow in scope and \u201c \u2018limited to determining whether a judge in a pending case has a bias, prejudice, or other disqualifying interest that mandates the judge\u2019s disqualification from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>that ease.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Griffin, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1219, 2003-Ohio-7356, 803 N.E.2d 820, \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Kate </em>at 1209. If affiants disagree with an attorney\u2019s bills \u2014 or with Judge Swift\u2019s approval of those bills \u2014 they may have a remedy on appeal or in other courts. But it is well settled that a party\u2019s or lawyer\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction or disagreement with a judge\u2019s rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice and is not grounds for the judge\u2019s disqualification.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b64. Similarly, \u201ca judge\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a continuance is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion and is not, by itself, evidence of bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Suster, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1240, 2009-Ohio-7202, 937 N.E.2d 1026, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 7} Third, affiants\u2019 vague allegations regarding the spouse of the trustee are inadequate to establish bias or prejudice. \u201c[T]he fact that one of the parties is related to an employee of the court is not, by itself, sufficient grounds for disqualification of the judge.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Niehaus, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1240, 2003-Ohio-5488, 798 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 3. Further, an affidavit of disqualification must allege with specificity the purported grounds for disqualification, including specific facts that demonstrate judicial bias. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). Here, affiants have not identified the position that the spouse has with the probate court or how that relationship creates bias or an appearance of bias against them. \u201c[V]ague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 8} Fourth, Engler has waived his objection to Judge Swift based on the incident relating to Engler\u2019s public-records request. An affidavit of disqualification must be filed \u201cas soon as possible after the incident giving rise to the claim of bias and prejudice occurred,\u201d and failure to do so may result in waiver of the objection, especially when \u201cthe facts underlying the objection have been known to the party for some time.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Grady, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1240, 1241, 674 N.E.2d 353 (1996). The incident occurred on June 7, 2013, yet Engler waited until August 22, 2013 \u2014 12 days before the scheduled trial \u2014 to file his affidavit. As nothing in the record justifies the delay in filing the affidavit of disqualification, Engler waived the right to disqualify Judge Swift based on this allegation. <em>See In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 1210, 741 N.E.2d 137 (2000) (affiant waived objections to judge when incidents giving rise to claim of bias occurred \u201cseveral months prior to the filing of the affidavit\u201d and affiant filed affidavit \u201cless than three weeks before the scheduled trial\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Belskis, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1252, 657 N.E.2d 1355 (1993) (denying affidavit when incident giving rise to claim of bias had been known for \u201csome months prior\u201d to filing of affidavit, but affiant waited \u201cuntil a few days before a scheduled hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Even if Engler had not waived this objection, judges are entitled to express dissatisfaction with attorneys\u2019 conduct and tactics inside and outside the courtroom, as long as that dissatisfaction is \u201c \u2018expressed in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity, dignity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Synenberg, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2009-Ohio-7206, 937 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 24, quoting <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10. As Jud.Cond.R. 2.8(B) directs, judges should be \u201cpatient, dignified, and courteous\u201d to parties and their lawyers, even in what they perceive as challenges to the judge\u2019s integrity. The record h\u00e9re includes conflicting accounts of Engler\u2019s and Judge Swift\u2019s conversation on June 7, 2013. Without more \u2014 and given the length of this litigation \u2014 this isolated incident is insufficient for a finding that Judge Swift has clearly reached a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d mandating his removal from these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">{\u00b6 10} In conclusion, \u201c[t]he statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 11} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The cases may proceed before Judge Swift.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-16\">. It appears that affiants identified one of the underlying eases with the appellate-court ease number, rather than the trial-eourt ease number. Even though affiants have not properly identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>the underlying cases, the affidavits will nevertheless be treated as filed in <em>In re Guardianship of Setinsek, </em>case No. 2008 GDP 0169, and <em>Guardianship &amp; Protective Servs., Inc. v. Setinsek, </em>case No. 2010 CVA 005.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
