Appellant, Mark Miller, asserts that he made a public-records request of appellees, the Ohio State Highway Patrol and its employee Jeff Maute (collectively, \u201cthe Patrol\u201d), seeking records related to traffic incidents involving a particular trooper. The Patrol provided some records, but Miller asserts that it continues to withhold video and audio recordings and reports involving the traffic stop and arrest of a particular person on July 15 or 16, 2011. The Patrol acknowledges that \u201cinformation regarding open/pending criminal cases is being withheld\u201d because of the investigatory-work-product exception to the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 2} On motion by the Patrol, the Twelfth District dismissed the action. Although the court found that Miller\u2019s evidence had not been presented in a timely manner or in the required form- \u2014 a fact that mandates dismissal by local rule \u2014 it nevertheless considered the evidence, which includes a letter from the Patrol establishing on its face that the Patrol has refused to release certain documents requested by Miller. Because the Patrol must support its contention that the withheld material falls under the \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory record\u201d exception to the Public Records Act, we remand to the Twelfth District for that court to determine whether the documents fall within the asserted exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">{\u00b6 3} Miller filed a mandamus action in the Twelfth District Court of Appeals alleging that he sent a public-records request to the Patrol on September 9, 2011. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>In support of this allegation, he attached to the complaint a copy of the letter making the request. The letter is undated. Miller also alleged that the letter was sent by certified mail and, as evidence, attached a return receipt to the complaint. Miller asserts that the return receipt indicates that the public-records request \u201cwas received on September 19, 2011,\u201d but the return receipt indicates that the item was delivered on June 3, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 4} The letter requested a number of records, some of which relate to Trooper Joseph Westhoven during the summer of 2011. Miller asserts that none of the records sought in the letter are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 5} As of October 27, 2011, apparently because of a mix-up dealing with an email address, Miller believed that the Patrol had not responded to his public-records request. As a result, he filed a mandamus action in the Twelfth District. The Patrol pointed out that it had provided responsive documents to the e-mail address in the letter, and Miller dropped the mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 6} Miller alleges that while it was true that the Patrol had provided some of the requested documents, it refused to produce several requested records that it claimed were not subject to disclosure. The only records at issue in this action are video and audio recordings from Trooper Westhoven\u2019s cruiser and impaired-driver reports dealing with the traffic stop, detention, arrest, and transport of Ashley Ruberg on July 15 or July 16, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 7} In a letter addressed to Miller\u2019s attorney on March 20, 2012, the Patrol confirmed its refusal to provide the records at issue and explained that the refusal was based on its belief that the documents were investigatory work product for an ongoing criminal investigation and were not subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act, specifically, R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(h) and (2). The March 20, 2012 letter, rather than being a response to the undated request letter as Miller asserts, responded to a February 16, 2012 request that evidently asked more specifically for records regarding Ashley Ruberg. Miller asserts that the records do not constitute investigatory work product, but are public records not subject to any exemption. Miller\u2019s complaint prays for a writ of mandamus compelling the release of these records and the payment of statutory damages, attorney fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 8} Miller\u2019s complaint was filed on May 10, 2012. The Patrol\u2019s answer was filed on June 6, 2012. Under local rules, all evidence must be presented and the relator\u2019s brief filed within four months of the filing of an original action; if these actions are not taken, the action \u201cshall be dismissed\u201d unless good cause is shown. Loc.R. 20(N) of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals. Under these rules, the evidence and Miller\u2019s brief were due no later than September 10, 2012. Loc.R. 20(G) and (H). Counsel for Miller sent an e-mail to counsel for the Patrol on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>September 6, 2012, stating that he was planning on drafting an agreed statement of facts that day. Counsel for the Patrol responded that she would not be able to review the statement with her clients or agree to a statement by the September 10 deadline, less than three business days later. Counsel for the Patrol said that she would not agree to a joint motion for extension of time, but pointed out that counsel for Miller could file such a motion. Miller\u2019s counsel responded that he would simply file the brief on September 10 with no stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 9} However, rather than filing a brief, counsel for Miller filed an affidavit with exhibits on September 10, 2012. The exhibits are the same ones attached to the complaint \u2014 the undated letter, the certified-mail return, and the March 20, 2012 response. The Patrol filed a motion to strike the affidavit and a motion to dismiss. The Twelfth District then issued a show-cause order directing Miller to explain why the action should not be dismissed. The next day, Miller filed a brief on the merits, and a week later, a response to the motion and show-cause order. The Patrol replied to Miller\u2019s response and moved to strike his brief on the basis that Miller\u2019s \u201centire case rests on information that does not comport\u201d with the local rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 10} The Twelfth District determined that although Miller had failed to comply with the local rule requiring that evidence be presented in the form of an agreed statement of facts, stipulations, or depositions, <em>see </em>Loc.R. 20(G), it would nevertheless consider Miller\u2019s affidavit and attachments \u201cfor whatever evidentiary value [they] may have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 11} The court of appeals then found that Miller had not established a clear legal right to relief. In so finding, the court detailed numerous defects in Miller\u2019s case, including procedural defaults, contradictory and unsupported factual claims, and a faulty timeline. The court concluded that Miller had not established a clear legal right, by clear and convincing evidence, to the records involving Ashley Ruberg. \u201cNo evidence, other than the statements in relator\u2019s affidavit, has been submitted indicating that relator\u2019s specific request, which did not even mention the name \u2018Ashley Ruberg,\u2019 was ever denied, improperly or otherwise.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol, </em>12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-05-034, at 5 (Nov. 21, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 12} Miller appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ.

Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriffs Office, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 224, 2010-Ohio-3288, 932 N.E.2d 327, \u00b6 6, the relator must still establish entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief by clear and convincing evidence. <em>State ex rel. Doner v. Zody, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 446, 2011-Ohio-6117, 958 N.E.2d 1235, paragraph three of the syllabus (\u201cRelators in mandamus cases must prove their entitlement to the writ by clear and convincing evidence\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">Clear and convincing evidence is \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u2018preponderance of the evidence,\u2019 but not to the extent of such certainty as is required \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\"><em>State ex rel. Dusted v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 288, 2009-Ohio-5327, 915 N.E.2d 1215, \u00b6 18, quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, the standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d is especially problematic for Miller. Miller\u2019s evidence of his public-records request and of the Patrol\u2019s response to it was incomplete and confusingly presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 16} For example, Miller states that his request was sent on September 9, 2011, but the letter attached as an exhibit is undated. The exhibit purporting to be the return receipt for this letter shows a delivery date of June 3, 2011, which predates the creation of the records Miller claims he wants from the Patrol. The other exhibit attached to Miller\u2019s affidavit is a letter from the Patrol dated March 20, 2012, which is a response to a different records request, although one that pertains to similar subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 17} The Patrol pointed out Miller\u2019s failure to submit evidence and a brief in compliance with local rules. Nevertheless, the Twelfth District \u2014 albeit reluctantly \u2014 considered the evidence and denied the Patrol\u2019s motions to strike, stating, \u201cWhile affidavits are not mentioned in the rule, [Miller\u2019s] affidavit will be considered by the court for whatever evidentiary value it may have.\u201d 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-05-034, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 18} However, given that the evidence was accepted, that court abused its discretion by deciding that Miller presented no evidence that his records request had ever been denied. Regardless of the other contradictory and confusing evidence, the March 20, 2012 letter from the Patrol demonstrates on its face that Miller made a public-records request and that the Patrol partially complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>that request but withheld some records. The existence and authenticity of the letter are not contested by the Patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 19} Specifically, the heading of the March 20, 2012 letter reads, \u201cFebruary 16, 2012 Public Records Request.\u201d The letter also refers to a February 16, 2012 request and a follow-up e-mail on March 13, 2012. It states that records \u201cwere previously provided to you on behalf of your client, Mark Miller.\u201d It quotes the public-records request as asking for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">[a]ny and all video and audio records from the police cruiser operated by Trooper Joseph Westhoven, Batavia Patrol Post, from the beginning of his shift on July 15, 2011 through the end of his shift on July 16, 2011. This audio and video should specifically pertain to and include the stop, detention, arrest and transport of Ashley Ruberg.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 20} A similar quote reflects a request for impaired-driver reports for the same dates, specifically those relating to Ashley Ruberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 21} Thus, the letter shows that the February 16, 2012 public-records request specifically asked for records pertaining to Trooper Westhoven\u2019s stop and arrest of Ashley Ruberg on July 15 through 16, 2011. The letter states that discs containing the recordings and reports were enclosed, but also states that investigative work product \u201cmay be excluded\u201d or \u201cis being withheld.\u201d Miller claims that the portions of the records documenting the Ashley Ruberg incident were withheld, and the Patrol admitted in its answer that those records were not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">{\u00b6 22} In other words, however maladroit Miller\u2019s complaint and presentation of evidence, the letter from the Patrol is clear and convincing evidence that Miller has stated a claim for relief, in that he requested public records and those records have not been produced. In particular, the March 20, 2012 letter is evidence that (1) Miller made, through counsel, a public-records request regarding recordings and impaired-driver reports from Trooper Westhoven for the dates of July 15 and 16, 2011, including those specifically regarding Ashley Ruberg, (2) the Patrol responded by providing most of the requested records, and (3) the Patrol withheld some records under the investigatory-work-product exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">{\u00b6 23} Having refused to provide requested records, the Patrol must show that the withheld records fall squarely within a statutory exception. Exceptions to disclosure under the Public Records Act are strictly construed against the public-records custodian, and the custodian has the burden to establish the applicability of an exception. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Jones-Kelley, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 81, 2008-Ohio-1770, 886 N.E.2d 206, paragraph two of the syllabus, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>State ex rel. Carr v. Akron, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 351, 2006-Ohio-6714, 859 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 30; <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 399, 2004-Ohio-6557, 819 N.E.2d 1087, \u00b6 25. A custodian does not meet this burden if it has not proven that the requested records fall squarely within the exception. <em>Cincinnati Enquirer </em>at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">{\u00b6 24} The exception the Patrol invokes in the March 20 letter is \u201cinvestigatory] work product,\u201d which is not in and of itself an exception, but an element of a larger exception. That exception is codified at R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(h), which excludes \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d from the definition of \u201cpublic record.\u201d A \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory record\u201d is defined in R.C. 149.43(A)(2) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">any record that pertains to a law enforcement matter of a criminal, quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature, but only to the extent that the release of the record would create a high probability of disclosure of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">(c) Specific confidential investigatory techniques or procedures or specific <em>investigatory work product.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 25} Whether a particular record is a \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory record\u201d is determined by a two-part test. \u201c \u2018 \u201cFirst, is the record a confidential law enforcement record? Second, would release of the record \u2018create a high probability of disclosure\u2019 of any one of the four kinds of information specified in R.C. 149.43(A)(2)?\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Musial v. N. Olmsted, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Maurer, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 54, 56, 741 N.E.2d 511 (2001), quoting <em>State ex rel. Polovischak v. Mayfield, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 51, 52, 552 N.E.2d 635 (1990). Thus, the Patrol needs to establish that the withheld records pertain to a \u201claw enforcement matter of a criminal, quasi-criminal, civil, or administrative nature\u201d whose release would create a \u201chigh probability of disclosure\u201d of \u201cspecific investigatory work product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cSpecific investigatory work product\u201d consists of \u201cinformation, including notes, working papers, memoranda, or similar materials, assembled by law enforcement officials in connection with a probable or pending criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Maurer </em>at 56, citing <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson, </em>70 Ohio St.3d 420, 434, 639 N.E.2d 83 (1994). However, \u201cspecific investigatory work product\u201d does <em>not </em>include \u201congoing routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>offense and incident reports.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph five of the syllabus. <em>See also Beacon Journal </em>at 57; <em>State ex rel.

Records \u201c \u2018even further removed from the initiation of the criminal investigation than the form reports themselves,\u2019 \u201d such as 9-1-1 recordings, are also public records. <em>Beacon Journal, id., </em>quoting <em>State ex rel.
