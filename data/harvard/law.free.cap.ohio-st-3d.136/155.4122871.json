Specifically, Adusei was charged with misconduct for (1) collecting an illegal or clearly excessive legal fee, (2) failing to reduce a contingent-fee agreement to writing, and (3) creating a conflict of interest by representing multiple members of Addai\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 3} The parties stipulated, and the panel found, that Adusei\u2019s conduct with regard to Addai\u2019s death violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an illegal or clearly excessive fee) and 1.5(c)(1) (requiring an attorney to have set forth a contingent-fee agreement in a writing signed by the client).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relator withdrew the alleged conflict-of-interest violations, under Prof.Cond.R. 1.7(a) through (c) (generally regulating a lawyer\u2019s representation when a client\u2019s interests will conflict, or when there is a substantial risk that they will conflict, with the lawyer\u2019s own interests or those of another client or former client). The parties stipulated that Adusei should be publicly reprimanded for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 4} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline adopted the parties\u2019 stipulations, but found an aggravating factor, and recommended that we publicly reprimand Adusei for his misconduct. For the reasons that follow, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact, and we agree that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">{\u00b6 5} The parties stipulated that in June 2009, Joseph Addai was killed in an automobile accident in Columbus. Adusei had met Addai through interactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>with members of the Ghanaian community in Columbus, and he had represented Addai on occasional traffic matters in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 6} Soon after Addai\u2019s death, Addai\u2019s niece and nephew, along with two residents of Addai\u2019s village in Ghana (collectively, the \u201cextended family\u201d), approached Adusei to discuss issues involving Addai\u2019s death and estate. Adusei met with the extended family to discuss the possibility of returning Addai\u2019s body to Ghana, cultural issues regarding the distribution of Addai\u2019s assets, and legal issues related to Addai\u2019s estate. At the end of the meeting, the extended family expressed a desire to retain Adusei to assist with funeral arrangements and the possible transportation of Addai\u2019s body to Ghana.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 7} Adusei did not enter into a written agreement with the extended family, but he did raise the issue of compensation. The extended family did not have funds to compensate Adusei, but they verbally agreed that he would receive one-third of any amounts recovered on behalf of Addai\u2019s estate from any source. The remaining two-thirds would be divided among Addai\u2019s legal heirs. Adusei did not discuss this arrangement with Addai\u2019s children or his widow, Mrs. Comfort Addai, all of whom resided in Ghana.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 8} Subsequently, Adusei learned that Addai had a life insurance policy at the time of his death. The policy named Mrs. Addai as the sole beneficiary, entitling her to receive a payout of $23,816. Adusei attempted to arrange for Mrs. Addai and her children to travel to the United States to receive the money. Those efforts proved unsuccessful, so Adusei traveled to Ghana himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 9} Adusei met with Mrs. Addai on November 12, 2009. At the meeting, Mrs. Addai executed a power of attorney in favor of Adusei. Adusei and Mrs. Addai discussed fees, but they did not enter into any written agreement. Mrs. Addai did not agree to pay Adusei\u2019s expenses for traveling to Ghana. However, at the end of the meeting, Adusei believed that Mrs. Addai had agreed to pay a contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 10} On March 29, 2009, Adusei received the proceeds of Addai\u2019s insurance policy (and interest) \u2014 $24,005.10. Of that amount, Adusei retained $7,956.77 as his fee and gave $1,300 to Addai\u2019s extended family. Mrs. Addai received the balance: $14,748.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 11} The parties stipulated, and the panel and board found, that Adusei violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a) by entering into a contingent-fee agreement to collect life-insurance proceeds. In addition, the parties stipulated and the panel and board found that Adusei violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(c)(1) by failing to reduce his contingent-fee agreement to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">{\u00b6 12} On the recommendation of the panel and board, we adopt the stipulated findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"A7V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">{\u00b6 13} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 14} As discussed above, Adusei failed to reduce a contingent-fee agreement to writing. Under that agreement, he collected nearly $8,000 in fees simply for collecting and distributing insurance proceeds. This is clearly excessive for the work Adusei performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 15} As to aggravating factors, the panel and board rejected the stipulation that no aggravating factors are present in this case. Instead, the panel and the board found clear and convincing evidence of a single aggravating factor \u2014 \u25a0 Adusefs actions harmed a vulnerable client. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 16} The parties stipulated to three mitigating factors, and the panel and board found clear and convincing evidence of each one. Adusei had no prior disciplinary record, he cooperated with relator\u2019s investigation, and he expressed remorse and made restitution to Mrs. Addai. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 17} The parties have stipulated, and the panel and board recommend, that the appropriate sanction for Adusei\u2019s misconduct is a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 18} Our decisions in cases involving similar violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.5 indicate that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction here. \u201c[W]e have consistently issued public reprimands to attorneys for charging an excessive fee when the record also includes significant mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Geauga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Martorana, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 19, 2013-Ohio-1686, 997 N.E.2d 486, \u00b6 12. <em>See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Smith, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 49, 2009-Ohio-5960, 918 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 23-29 (attorney publicly reprimanded for charging excessive fees when mitigating factors included lack of prior disciplinary record, cooperation in the disciplinary investigation, and the attorney\u2019s inexperience); and <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Randolph, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 325, 326-327, 708 N.E.2d 192 (1999) (attorney publicly reprimanded for charging excessive fees when mitigating factors included restitution and acceptance of responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">{\u00b6 19} By contrast, we have imposed harsher sanctions for charging an excessive fee when significant aggravating factors \u2014 such as not returning a client\u2019s money \u2014 exist. <em>Martorana </em>at \u00b6 13. For example, we imposed a six-month stayed suspension for charging an excessive fee in <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Carr, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 210, 2012-Ohio-610, 963 N.E.2d 802, \u00b6 19. Like Adusei, the attorney in <em>Carr </em>caused harm to a vulnerable client by charging an excessive fee, had no prior disciplinary record, and fully cooperated in the disciplinary proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. Unlike Adusei, however, the attorney in <em>Carr </em>did not make restitution, failed to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, and was driven by a selfish motive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZa\">Barno Law, L.L.C., and Melissa A. Black; Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff, L.L.P., and James L. Ervin; and Bruce A. Campbell, Bar Counsel, and A. Alysha Clous, Assistant Bar Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b443-11\">James E. Arnold &amp; Associates, L.P.A., and Alvin E. Mathews, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 20} As discussed above, Adusei made full restitution to his client, repaying the entire fee he collected and the amount he distributed to Addai\u2019s extended family. He acknowledged the wrongful nature of his conduct and cooperated with relator\u2019s investigation. Under these circumstances, a public reprimand is an appropriate sanction for Adusei\u2019s violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 21} Adusei\u2019s additional violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(c)(1) does not demand a harsher sanction. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Hackett, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 186, 2011-Ohio-3096, 950 N.E.2d 969, we imposed a public reprimand upon an attorney who not only charged an excessive fee, but also violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.6 (prohibiting a lawyer from offering or participating in an employment agreement that restricts the right of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we publicly reprimand Alexander Yaw Adusei Jr. for collecting an illegal or clearly excessive legal fee and for failing to reduce a contingent-fee agreement to writing. Costs are taxed to Adusei.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-12\">. The stipulations, the hearing panel, and the board all cite Prof.Cond.R 1.5(c) generally, but only the first paragraph of the rule is at issue here. <em>See </em>Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(c)(1). Adusei has not been charged with violating Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(c)(2) (requiring a lawyer entitled to a contingent fee to prepare a closing statement to be signed by the lawyer and the client, detailing the lawyer\u2019s compensation, any costs and expenses to be deducted, and any division of fees with a lawyer not in the same firm).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
