Under the particular facts of this case, we hold that the admission of the alleged accomplice\u2019s statements through the testimony of an investigating officer violated the defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10, of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 2} On March 11, 2008, Calvin Harper was robbed and murdered in his residence in Sandusky, Ohio. Harper was a known drug dealer. Aaron Gipson, a Michigan resident, was an associate of Harper\u2019s in the drug trade. The state alleged that appellant, Thomas Ricks, traveled with Gipson from Michigan and participated in Harper\u2019s murder. Testimony regarding statements that Gipson made to law enforcement about Ricks is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Murder of Calvin Harper</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">{\u00b6 3} Harper\u2019s body was found on March 12, 2008, by Rhonda Farris, who was Harper\u2019s neighbor and who sometimes facilitated his drug-trafficking business by allowing Harper to keep his drugs at her house. The police were called; detectives soon learned that immediately before his murder, Harper was to have participated in a drug deal. They checked Harper\u2019s phone to determine who might have been involved in that deal and were led to Gipson. Gipson\u2019s cellphone records indicated that he was in Sandusky on both March 10 and 11. The murder occurred at some point after 5:42 p.m. on March 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">{\u00b6 4} Witnesses confirmed that Gipson was in Sandusky on March 10 with another man, who the state alleges was Ricks, and that on that day, they visited with Chanel Harper, the victim\u2019s sister, and Chanel\u2019s friend Crystal Pool at Chanel\u2019s residence; both Chanel and Crystal knew Gipson, but neither had previously seen the man who was with him on March 10. Chanel was able to give detectives a description of the man who was with Gipson; Crystal was unable to give a description but said that she would be able to point him out if she were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>see him again. Both later pointed out Ricks in photo arrays as the man who was with Gipson in Sandusky on March 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 5} Cell-phone records show that Gipson went back to Michigan the evening of March 10 and that he returned to Sandusky late the following afternoon. Those records established that Gipson was in Port Clinton, Ohio, about 20 minutes from Harper\u2019s home, when he phoned Harper at 5:15 p.m. on March 11; cell-phone records indicated that at 5:52 p.m. he had begun to leave the Sandusky area and that by 7:06 p.m. he was in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 6} Farris testified that on the day of the murder, a man had come to her house by mistake and told her he was looking for Harper. Farris called Harper to warn him of the stranger coming to his home, but according to Farris, Harper reassured her by saying, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s my dude, he cool, he cool, good lookin\u2019 out.\u201d Phone records indicate that there was a call between Farris and Harper at 5:42 p.m. that day. Farris never heard from Harper again. She was able to give the police a description of the man who had come to her door the day of the murder, and she later picked Ricks\u2019s photo from a photo array. However, Farris was acquainted with every other person in the photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Officer Steckel\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">{\u00b6 7} Sandusky police located Gipson in Canton, Michigan, where he was in police custody for his alleged involvement in another crime. Two Sandusky officers and a detective went to Canton to interview him. The Sandusky police officers did not testify regarding anything that Gipson told them. However, Officer Michael Steckel of the Canton police department testified at the trial regarding statements that Gipson had made to him, and those statements are the focus of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 8} Throughout the trial, Ricks attempted to have excluded as inadmissible Steckel\u2019s testimony regarding Gipson\u2019s statements identifying Ricks. Before the trial, Ricks\u2019s counsel filed a motion in limine regarding \u201cany acts of allegedly Mr. Gipson pointing out this gentleman, Mr. Ricks, to police officers in Michigan.\u201d The court ruled: \u201c[T]he identification procedure, the steps the officers took in their investigation would come in, and I\u2019ll give a curative instruction to the jury at that time, if you want.\u201d The trial court determined that that process would comply with <em>State v. Blevins, </em>36 Ohio App.3d 147, 149, 521 N.E.2d 1105 (10th Dist.1987), which holds that \u201cwhere statements are offered to explain an officer\u2019s conduct while investigating a crime, such statements are not hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">{\u00b6 9} Steckel testified that the Sandusky police officers had interviewed Gipson before he had. Steckel subsequently learned from the Sandusky police that two people had been involved in killing Harper: Gipson and another man, who went by the name \u201cPeanut.\u201d There was no testimony during the trial as to how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Sandusky police came up with the name \u201cPeanut\u201d; in a pretrial suppression hearing, a Sandusky police officer testified that Gipson had told the police that Peanut had killed Harper. No other witness testified that anyone named Peanut was in Sandusky either the day of the murder or the evening before.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 10} Steckel and Sergeant Pomorski of the Canton police department spoke with Gipson, who gave them a general physical description of Peanut. Steckel testified that he, Pomorski, and Gipson traveled by car to Ricks\u2019s neighborhood so that Gipson could point out Peanut\u2019s house. Gipson identified a house on Strathmoor Street as the place where Peanut was staying. By chance, Peanut was in front of the residence at that time. Steckel testified that Gipson had stated, \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut.\u201d Steckel testified that he had been concerned that Peanut might see Gipson in the vehicle and that Gipson, who was \u201cupset and * * * scared\u201d upon seeing Peanut, had dropped down in the seat so that Peanut could not see him. The officers and Gipson were unable to locate Peanut upon subsequent passes through the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 11} Steckel testified that he and Pomorski were able to identify \u201cPeanut\u201d as Thomas Ricks by making a telephone call to the address where they had seen him. Steckel was then able to obtain a photograph of Ricks from another jurisdiction. He testified that he had taken that photograph to Gipson in his cell and that Gipson had said, \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut.\u201d Steckel then forwarded the photograph to the police in Sandusky, and they used it in a photo array they presented to witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 12} After Steckel\u2019s testimony regarding Gipson\u2019s statements identifying Ricks as Peanut, to which 'Ricks had objected, the trial judge gave a limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, one of the things that you just heard a few seconds ago from the State was \u2014 was hearsay, and there\u2019s a concern all the time that statements are made outside of Court and that actual person doesn\u2019t come into Court and testify and is not subject to cross examination. There are certain exceptions in the law and that deals with the Evidence Rules that I spoke about yesterday, that we have to comply with those rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">Sometimes in allowing in information such as that, information that comes in from someone that (inaudible) testify in open Court, there\u2019s a purpose for that, and in this case the evidence about Mr. Gipson going with police detectives and, first off, pointing out a residence; second, pointing out the person on the street known as Peanut, and saying that\u2019s Peanut, and then later showing the photograph to Mr. Gipson and him saying that\u2019s Mr. Ricks, all those are not for the truth of the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>asserted. In other words, they don\u2019t necessarily mean that that was Peanut, that man walking down the street, that that was the residence he lived at or that\u2019s the photograph, but they\u2019re really brought in for the purpose to explain this officer or that department\u2019s investigation, why they were doing what they were doing, and the State has laid a foundation, what was your purpose of going out there and those kinds of things. So understand when you\u2019re hearing this testimony that it\u2019s to describe this officer and that department\u2019s investigation in conjunction with the San-dusky Police Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Verdict and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 13} The jury found Ricks guilty of one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B), one count of aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), one count of complicity to trafficking in marijuana in the vicinity of school premises, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and (C)(3)(c) and R.C. 2923.03, and one count of complicity to trafficking in cocaine in the vicinity of school premises, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and (C)(4)(e) and R.C. 2923.03. The trial judge sentenced Ricks to an aggregate term of imprisonment for life without parole, plus 26 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 14} Ricks appealed. The court of appeals vacated Ricks\u2019s convictions for complicity to trafficking in cocaine and marijuana, finding insufficient evidence to support them. 196 Ohio App.3d 798, 2011-Ohio-5043, 965 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 70-96, 102 (6th Dist.). Further, the court agreed with the parties that Ricks\u2019s firearm-specification convictions should have merged for the purposes of sentencing, and it therefore ordered the trial court to resentence Ricks as to those specifications. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 15} However, the appellate court overruled Ricks\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s admission of Gipson\u2019s statements through the testimony of Officer Steckel violated Ricks\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. The court noted that the trial court had relied upon <em>State v. Blevins, </em>36 Ohio App.3d 147, 521 N.E.2d 1105, in ruling that Steckel\u2019s testimony was admissible. <em>Ricks </em>at \u00b6 67. The court also cited <em>State v. Williams, </em>10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 02AP-730 and 02AP-731, 2003-Ohio-5204, 2003 WL 22232921, another case in which the court allowed a police officer to testify regarding the out-of-court statement of a declarant because the statement involved was offered to explain why officers had acted the way they had rather than for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Ricks </em>at \u00b6 68. The appellate court in this case concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In the present case, we have a co-defendant who identified an individual he believed to be Peanut. There is no evidence that Gipson used the opportunity to exonerate himself and implicate appellant. Once Peanut was identified as appellant, the Sandusky officers were able to compile a photo array. Further, the court issued a lengthy curative instruction to ensure that the jury properly interpreted the testimony. Finally, Gipson was made available for questioning but appellant declined. Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 16} The cause is before this comet upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal. 131 Ohio St.3d 1513, 2012-Ohio-1710, 965 N.E.2d 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">Confrontation Clause and Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59,124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that pursuant to the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \u201c[testimonial statements of -witnesses absent from trial [can be] admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d There is no dispute in this case that Gipson\u2019s statements to police were testimonial \u2014 there was no ongoing emergency and the statements were the result of a police interrogation whose \u201cprimary purpose [was] to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 18} There is also no dispute that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Crawford </em>at 59, fn. 9, citing <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985); <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 2227-2228, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012) (lead opinion). Thus, if Officer Steckel\u2019s testimony regarding Gipson\u2019s statements was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, then it did not violate Ricks\u2019s right to confront witnesses. That is the core issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">{\u00b6 19} The state argues that the testimony at issue was offered not to prove that Gipson was involved in Harper\u2019s murder but instead was offered to show how the Sandusky police had procured a photo of Ricks that they could show to witnesses \u2014 the two witnesses, Chanel Harper and Crystal Pool, who testified that they had seen Ricks in Sandusky with Gipson the night before the murder, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>another, Rhonda Farris, who testified that she had seen him going to Harper\u2019s house around the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Testimony Regarding Out-of-Court Statements That Is Admitted to Explain Police Conduct Is Not Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980), a case involving police-officer witnesses testifying regarding out-of-court statements made by others, this court held that \u201cextrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed.\u201d In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendants had been convicted of gambling and running a gambling house; the trial court had allowed testimony from law-enforcement officials that they \u201chad received information about a \u2018sports bookmaking\u2019 operation \u2018taking place in Roseville, Ohio.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232. This court held that \u201c[t]he testimony at issue was offered to explain the subsequent investigative activities of the witnesses\u201d and was thus not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Id. </em>The testimony at issue in <em>Thomas </em>did not tie the three defendants to the gambling operation \u2014 it provided general background to explain what had led the police to begin an investigation into a possible illegal gambling operation in Roseville.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 21} In this case, both the trial court and the court of appeals relied on <em>Blevins, </em>36 Ohio App.3d 147, 521 N.E.2d 1105. In <em>Blevins, </em>the court held that \u201cwhere statements are offered to explain an officer\u2019s conduct while investigating a crime, such statements are not hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149. In <em>Blevins, </em>the court related that the witnesses\u2019 statements were offered to show how detectives working on a drug-trafficking case had come to know of the defendant. The court concluded: \u201c[The declarant\u2019s out-of-court] statements neither implicated nor cleared defendant. The statements merely described the circumstances of how the detectives met defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">{\u00b6 22} <em>Blevins </em>recognized that the admission of out-of-court statements to explain officers\u2019 conduct in an investigation carries with it the potential for abuse, and it thus established certain conditions that must be met before admitting such statements: \u201cThe conduct to be explained should be relevant, equivocal and contemporaneous with the statements. 6 Wigmore Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. Ed.1976) 267, 268, Section 1772. Additionally, such statements must meet the standard of Evid.R. 403(A).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">{\u00b6 23} <em>Blevins </em>does not provide an exception to hearsay; it instead exemplifies a situation where testimony is offered for a reason other than for the truth of the matter asserted. The state argues that Steckel\u2019s testimony regarding statements made by Gipson is admissible under <em>Blevins </em>because the statements explain police conduct; specifically, they explain what led the police to obtain a photograph of Ricks to show to witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 24} In a case decided after <em>Blevins, State v. Humphrey, </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 07AP-837, 2008-Ohio-6302, 2008 WL 5104775, the Tenth District Court of Appeals highlighted the limits of allowing testimony regarding out-of-court statements that explain an officer\u2019s conduct during the course of investigating a crime. <em>Humphrey </em>warns courts against allowing prosecuting attorneys to use police-officer testimony to introduce unfairly prejudicial out-of-court statements, including testimony that connects the defendant to the crime at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">It is well-established that, where statements are offered into evidence to explain an officer\u2019s conduct during the course of investigating a crime, such statements are generally not hearsay. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232 [400 N.E.2d 401]. There are limits, however, to this general rule because of the great potential for abuse and potential confusion to the trier of fact. See <em>State v. Blevins </em>([10th Dist.] 1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 147, 149 [521 N.E.2d 1105]. For example, a prosecutor may attempt to use a police officer\u2019s testimony regarding his investigative activities as a pretext to introduce highly prejudicial out-of-court statements, while claiming the statements are being offered merely to explain the police officer\u2019s conduct, rather than for their truth. Furthermore, when the statements connect the accused with the crime charged, they should generally be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 25} The court in <em>State v. Richcreek, </em>196 Ohio App.3d 505, 2011-Ohio-4686, 964 N.E.2d 442, \u00b6 26 (6th Dist.), described how trial courts should approach assessing prejudice in a <em>Blevins </em>analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">In short, the well-worn phrase \u201cnot offered for the truth of the matter asserted\u201d is not a talismanic incantation that opens the door to everything said outside the courtroom. For an extrajudicial statement of this type, a secondary assessment under Evid.R. 403(A) is required. The trial court must consider whether the risk that the jury will prejudicially misuse the content for its truth exceeds the probative value of the statement for the nonhearsay purpose. <em>[State v.] Blanton </em>[184 Ohio App.3d 611, 2009-Ohio-5334, 921 N.E.2d 1103 (10th Dist.)] at \u00b6 39; <em>Humphrey </em>at \u00b6 11; Evid.R. 403(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 26} Although a consideration of possible prejudice is involved in an evaluation under <em>Blevins, </em>the ultimate question remains one of hearsay under Evid.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>801. That is, the analysis of prejudice serves the ultimate question of whether the testimony was offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, if the testimony that is ostensibly offered to explain police conduct is more prejudicial than probative, the jury is more likely to rely on the testimony to prove the matter asserted, which tilts the particular testimony into hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">{\u00b6 27} In sum, in order for testimony offered to explain police conduct to be admissible as nonhearsay, the conduct to be explained should be relevant, equivocal, and contemporaneous with the statements; the probative value of statements must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and the statements cannot connect the accused with the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Evaluation of Steckel\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 28} Part of Steckel\u2019s testimony did explain what had led him to obtain a photograph of Ricks. Gipson had pointed out the house that Ricks was staying in, and Steckel returned to the police station and telephoned the house to ask for the real name of the person nicknamed Peanut; upon learning the name Thomas Ricks, Steckel then was able to find a record of Ricks and to obtain a photograph of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 29} But key parts of Steckel\u2019s testimony were not limited to explaining what had led him to obtain a picture of Ricks. Some of his testimony had nothing to do with police conduct but instead focused on statements from Gipson that established that Ricks was Peanut, the second person involved in the killing, and ' that vouched for the evidence that the police had collected. Further, the testimony tied Ricks to Gipson and, thus, to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b6 30} Steckel\u2019s testimony regarding Gipson\u2019s statements falls into two basic categories for the purposes of our analysis: testimony about the ride to Strathmoor Street and testimony regarding Gipson\u2019s statements after Steckel had obtained a photograph of Thomas Ricks.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The Ride</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">{\u00b6 31} Steckel testified that while Gipson was in police custody in Canton, Sandusky police officers told Steckel that Gipson had been involved in a murder in Sandusky and that a second man involved in the crime was nicknamed \u201cPeanut.\u201d There was no testimony during the trial as to how Sandusky police came up with the name \u201cPeanut\u201d; no other witness testified that anyone named Peanut was in Sandusky either the day of the murder or the evening before. Steckel\u2019s testimony created the question \u201cWho is Peanut?\u201d and then provided the answer: \u201cThomas Ricks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">{\u00b6 32} Steckel testified that he and a partner drove Gipson to Strathmoor Street so that Gipson could point out the house where Peanut was staying. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Gipson, who was riding in the back seat, saw Peanut in front of the place he was staying and identified him. Steckel testified that Gipson had said, \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut.\u201d Steckel testified that he had made eye contact with the person Gipson had identified as Peanut, and the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid you observe the emotional reaction that Gipson displayed after this took place?\u201d Steckel responded, \u201cHe was upset and he was scared.\u201d He further testified that Gipson had dropped down in his seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 33} Do the statements explain Steckel\u2019s investigatory path in this case? The police conduct that Steckel\u2019s testimony was meant to explain meets the first three parts of the <em>Blevins </em>test. First, the police actions taken in obtaining a picture of Ricks is relevant. Second, the conduct was equivocal; that is, the conduct required an explanation as to what had led the police to obtain a picture of Ricks. Certainly, without an explanation, it would not be evident to the jury what had led the police to get a picture of Ricks, why the police had gone to Strathmoor Street to try to find Peanut, or how they had determined that the person they encountered on Strathmoor Street was indeed Peanut. Finally, the police\u2019s identification of Peanut was contemporaneous with Gipson\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 34} But even if Gipson\u2019s statements were offered to explain police conduct, the <em>Blevins </em>test also requires a court to consider whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and whether the statements tie the defendant to the crime. In this case, we find that the statements were unfairly prejudicial and that the nonhearsay reason given for introducing the statements was a pretext for the real reason: connecting Ricks to the crime. The out-of-court statements were exceptionally damaging in this case because the declarant was the other suspect in Harper\u2019s murder and much of the evidence introduced by the state tied that suspect to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 35} Again, Steckel testified that he was able to get the name \u201cThomas Ricks\u201d by calling the residence on Strathmoor Street and asking for Peanut\u2019s real name. It was not necessary to admit Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statement \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut\u201d to explain how the police had identified the house where Ricks had been staying. Because of Steckel\u2019s testimony that Gipson had identified Peanut, more evidence was offered describing Gipson\u2019s mental state upon seeing Ricks: \u201cHe was upset and he was scared.\u201d This testimony goes beyond answering what had led the police to obtain a picture of Peanut. It establishes that Gipson was afraid of Ricks or was afraid of Ricks\u2019s seeing him with police officers. That testimony ties Ricks to Gipson and thus to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 36} Steckel had already testified that a person nicknamed \u201cPeanut\u201d was Gipson\u2019s accomplice in Harper\u2019s murder. He then testified that Gipson had identified Peanut by pointing him out in front of the house at which he was staying. The fact that Gipson was the person who made the out-of-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>statements identifying Ricks as Peanut is especially prejudicial in this case because most of the state\u2019s evidence in the case revolves around Gipson. This court has established that an alleged accomplice\u2019s out-of-court statement incriminating a defendant is \u201cparticularly deserving of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 49, 60, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 37} Gipson was not only Ricks\u2019s alleged accomplice \u2014 the state\u2019s case revolved around him. The state presented evidence indicating that Gipson was the person who had set up the drug deal with Harper on the day of the murder. And the state presented Gipson\u2019s cell-phone records, which tracked his movements around the time of the murder and established that he was in Sandusky calling Harper around the time of the murder. Gipson\u2019s establishing a presence at a Detroit-area casino on the night of the murder was used as evidence that he was trying to create an alibi for himself. Thus, the state\u2019s evidence established that Gipson was involved in Harper\u2019s murder. The state then relied on Officer Steckel\u2019s testimony to relay Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements implicating Ricks, thereby allowing the jury to hear Gipson\u2019s statements without Gipson\u2019s having to undergo cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 38} The court of appeals stated in its decision that \u201cGipson was made available for questioning but appellant declined.\u201d 196 Ohio App.3d 798, 2011-Ohio-5043, 965 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 69. But Gipson never testified for the prosecution. It was not the defendant\u2019s job to bring him to the stand: \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 324-325, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 39} Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements connected Ricks to Gipson and to the crime. The state amplified the danger of unfair prejudice by eliciting further testimony from Steckel that Gipson was upset and scared upon seeing Ricks. That testimony encouraged the jury to misuse the content of the out-of-court statement for its truth. That is, the jury would interpret Gipson\u2019s statement \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut\u201d as a statement identifying who had been his accomplice in the murder rather than as evidence to explain why the police had obtained a photograph of Ricks to show to other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The Ricks Photograph</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">{\u00b6 40} Steckel testified that after the ride to Strathmoor Street, he returned to the police station and was able to determine that the person known as Peanut was Thomas Ricks. He was then able to obtain a photograph of Ricks from another jurisdiction. He later sent that photograph to the police in Sandusky, who showed it to Chanel and Crystal \u2014 the women who had been with Gipson and his associate the night before the murder \u2014 and Harper\u2019s neighbor, Farris, who saw a man go to Harper\u2019s house just before the murder. But after Steckel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>described for the jury how the Sandusky police had obtained the picture of Thomas Ricks, the state asked Steckel whether Gipson had identified the person in the photograph as Peanut:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Q. Once again, Officer Steckel, when you showed Aaron Gipson this photo, after obtaining it from Georgia, did he make identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">A. He says that\u2019s Peanut.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 41} Steckel\u2019s testimony went well beyond describing how the Sandusky police had obtained a photograph of Thomas Ricks. The statement \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut\u201d goes to the truth of the matter asserted \u2014 that the person in the photograph, Thomas Ricks, is \u201cPeanut,\u201d the person Steckel had previously established as Gipson\u2019s accomplice. Steckel did not need to testify about Gipson\u2019s statements regarding the photograph of Thomas Ricks to explain how the police had come up with a photograph of Thomas Ricks \u2014 the procurement of the photograph was complete before Steckel showed it to Gipson. Gipson\u2019s statement regarding the photograph \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut\u201d \u2014 served as confirmation that Ricks was Peanut. The state used Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statement as evidence to prove that the person in the photo had committed the crime. Thus, Gipson\u2019s statement did not explain what had led the police to obtain the photograph; it gave value to the photograph as a piece of evidence. It gave an accomplice\u2019s seal of approval on the evidence and identified Thomas Ricks as Gipson\u2019s accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">{\u00b6 42} There was no further police conduct to be explained to the jury through Gipson\u2019s statements once Steckel explained what had led the Canton, Michigan, police to obtain a picture of Ricks. An evaluation under <em>Blevins </em>is not necessary when the testimony was not admitted to explain police conduct. Gipson\u2019s statement regarding the Ricks photograph \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut\u201d \u2014 was offered for the truth of the matter asserted, that the person in the photograph was indeed the person known as Peanut, who had previously been identified as Gipson\u2019s accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">{\u00b6 43} The state returned to Steckel\u2019s testimony about Gipson\u2019s statements in closing argument. Those statements were used not to explain how the police went about their investigation, but rather for the truth of the matters asserted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>[Steckel] testified that Aaron Gipson pointed out a subject by the name of Peanut, later identified as the defendant, Thomas J. Ricks, and he said that that was in front of the home \u2014 and he gave an address, and you have that address, but, more importantly, it was the home and residence of a Deotis Sears. Now, later on we find out that Deotis Sears is the uncle of Thomas J. Ricks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">Now, he also indicated that there was eye contact made with this subject known as Peanut. He indicated that Aaron Gipson was visibly shaken and upset with (inaudible). He said, he also testified that he actually sank down in the back of the seat. He indicated that they then drove around the block because they were afraid that Thomas J. Ricks, or the person then they understood was Peanut, may have spotted them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">He then obtained a photograph of Mr. Ricks from Georgia, had it forwarded \u2014 had it up to his department. At that point in time he took that photograph, which is * * * State\u2019s Exhibit 54, I believe, and actually showed it to Aaron Gipson and Aaron Gipson said that\u2019s him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 44} The closing argument demonstrates that Gipson\u2019s statements were offered not to explain police investigatory conduct, but to tie Ricks to Gipson as an accomplice in the murder. Steckel\u2019s testimony was characterized as evidence against Ricks rather than as an explanation of how the police investigation resulted in obtaining a photograph of Ricks.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Constitutional Error</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 45} We conclude that both instances in Officer Steckel\u2019s testimony when he related that Gipson had stated, \u201cThat\u2019s Peanut,\u201d constituted hearsay because they were offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted rather than to explain police conduct. Since the statements were testimonial, the admission of the statements violated Ricks\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">{\u00b6 46} Although the court committed constitutional error, such error can be harmless in certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">A constitutional error can be held harmless if we determine that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. Whether a Sixth Amendment error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is not simply an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence. Instead, the question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction. Id. at 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705; <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 388, 721 N.E.2d 52.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, \u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 47} In this case, we determine that there is a reasonable possibility that Steckel\u2019s testimony that Gipson pointed out Ricks as \u201cPeanut\u201d contributed to Ricks\u2019s conviction. There was certainly other evidence offered against Ricks\u2014 the identification of Ricks by Farris as the man who mistakenly came to her door looking for Harper near the time of the murder, records of cell-phone calls from Gipson to the house on Strathmoor Street where Ricks was staying, Ricks\u2019s statement that he did not know Gipson, Ricks\u2019s damaging but not quite confessional recorded jailhouse phone calls to his girlfriend, Ricks\u2019s representation that he had been in Atlanta since February 19, 2008, when a March 27, 2008 bus ticket from New Orleans to Atlanta in the name of his known alias belied that claim\u2014 and a jury might have convicted Ricks on that other evidence alone. But the fact that much of the proof in the case was against Gipson makes it reasonably possible that the testimony regarding the statements he made in identifying Ricks would have carried weight with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 48} Accordingly; we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b653-10\">O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b653-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger and French, JJ., concur in judgment only and concur separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b653-12\">French, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AiB\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">{\u00b6 49} I agree that Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements were inadmissible, but I do so based solely on Evid.R. 403. While the majority focuses on whether Gipson\u2019s testimonial statements constituted hearsay, triggering the Confrontation Clause, it is important to note that the trial court explicitly instructed the jury that Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements identifying Ricks as \u201cPeanut\u201d were \u201cnot [offered] for the truth of the matter asserted\u201d and could be considered for only the nonhearsay purpose of \u201cexplain[ing] this officer or that department\u2019s investigation.\u201d Generally, this type of instruction ensures that the jury will consider evidence of limited admissibility for its admissible purpose rather than its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>inadmissible purpose. <em>See </em>Evid.R. 105. We must presume that juries follow limiting instructions, and this presumption \u201cfully applies when rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause are at issue.\u201d <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 415, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985), fn. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{If 50} The fact that a limiting instruction can be given regarding certain relevant evidence, however, does not guarantee its admissibility. When the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence, it is not admissible. Evid.R. 403; <em>see also </em>1980 Staff Note, Evid.R. 105 (noting the \u201cvery close relationship\u201d between Evid.R. 105 and Evid.R. 403 and recognizing the possibility that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to reduce the danger of unfair prejudice). The risk of prejudice is \u201cgrave\u201d in cases such as this one, where a statement is admitted for a nonhearsay purpose, but on its face, the statement \u201casserts facts directly relevant to a critical issue in the case and the declarant would presumably have personal knowledge of the facts.\u201d 1 McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>Section 59, at 409 (7th Ed. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 51} In this case, the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction did little to ameliorate the risk that the jury would misuse Gipson\u2019s out-of-court statements as substantive evidence of guilt. While the statements undeniably satisfied a nonhearsay purpose \u2014 explaining the course of the police investigation, <em>see State v. Thomas, </em>61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980) \u2014 they also constituted direct evidence of identity, supplied by an accomplice with personal knowledge. It is usually possible to explain the course of an investigation without relating historical aspects of the case, and in most cases, testimony that the officer acted \u201cupon information received,\u201d or words to that effect, will suffice. 2 McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>Section 249, at 193-195 (7th Ed. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 52} That was true here, where it would have been possible to explain how the investigation led to Ricks without introducing Gipson\u2019s exact statements or his behavior upon seeing Ricks. Nor was it necessary to inform the jury that it was Gipson \u2014 the alleged accomplice \u2014 who led police to Ricks. That information had little probative value and a high likelihood that the jury would misuse it as substantive evidence of Ricks\u2019s guilt, even with the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 53} Finally, there is no need to consider whether the prosecuting attorney used the nonhearsay aspect of the statements as a pretext for introducing inadmissible hearsay. Whenever a statement qualifies as both nonhearsay and hearsay, standards of relevancy and prejudice should govern admissibility. <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 263, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). Because the probative value of Gipson\u2019s statements was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, I believe that the statements were inadmissible under Evid.R. 403.</p>\n<judges id=\"b654-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ApdR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Kevin J.
