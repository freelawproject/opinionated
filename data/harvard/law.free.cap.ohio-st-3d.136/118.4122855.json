Background</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2009, appellant Maria Marusa was driving her car when it was struck by a police cruiser driven by Officer Michael Canda. Marusa and her daughter Melanie, also an appellant, were both injured in the accident. The parties stipulated that the Marusas\u2019 injuries were proximately caused by Officer Canda\u2019s negligent operation of his police cruiser and that the Marusas \u201cwere not negligent and were not at fault for causing the collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">{\u00b6 3} The Marusas filed suit against appellee, Erie Insurance Company, seeking damages to compensate for, among other claims, medical expenses and pain and suffering. The parties have stipulated that \u201cOfficer Canda and his employer are immune from suit under the Ohio Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act\u201d and that \u201cOfficer Canda qualifies as an \u2018uninsured motorist\u2019 under the terms\u201d of the insurance policy that Maria Marusa has with Erie Insurance. In its answer, Erie Insurance claimed that it was not obligated to pay damages, because even though the policy includes uninsured-motorist coverage and Officer Canda is an uninsured motorist, the Marusas were not \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d citing <em>Snyder v. Am. Fam. Ins. Co., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 239, 2007-Ohio-4004, 871 N.E.2d 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">{\u00b6 4} Erie Insurance moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion, stating that the Marusas are \u201cprecluded from recovery under the terms of the Policy.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed, concluding that <em>Snyder </em>controls. <em>Marusa v. Erie Ins. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 96556, 2011-Ohio-6276, 2011 WL 6145757.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">{\u00b6 5} We granted the Marusas\u2019 discretionary appeal. 131 Ohio St.3d 1552, 2012-Ohio-2263, 967 N.E.2d 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 6} The issue in this case is whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment for Erie Insurance and against the Marusas.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 7} Our review of cases involving a grant of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Bonacorsi v. Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Ry. Co., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 314, 2002-Ohio-2220, 767 N.E.2d 707, \u00b6 24. Summary judgment may be granted only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>M.H. v. Cuyahoga Falls, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 65, 2012-Ohio-5336, 979 N.E.2d 1261, at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">B. Interpreting Insurance Contracts</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe meaning of a contract is to be gathered from a consideration of all its parts, and no provision is to be wholly disregarded as inconsistent with other provisions unless no other reasonable construction is possible.\u201d <em>German Fire Ins. Co. v. Roost, </em>55 Ohio St. 581, 45 N.E. 1097 (1897), paragraph one of the syllabus. The intent of the parties is presumed to be reflected in the language used in the policy. <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co., </em>31 Ohio St.3d 130, 509 N.E.2d 411 (1987), paragraph one of the syllabus. Because the cause before us involves the interpretation of an insurance contract, any ambiguities will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Dominish v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 466, 2011-Ohio-4102, 953 N.E.2d 820, at \u00b6 7. <em>See Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Price, </em>39 Ohio St.2d 95, 99, 313 N.E.2d 844 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">{\u00b6 9} Fortunately, the long and tortured history of this court\u2019s jurisprudence regarding uninsured/underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) insurance coverage need not be retold for us to resolve the case before us. This case is novel, based on the language contained in Erie Insurance\u2019s contract, and recourse to precedent other than <em>Snyder </em>is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">C. <em>Snyder </em>and This Insurance Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Snyder, </em>this court stated that \u201ca policy provision limiting the insured\u2019s recovery of uninsured- or underinsured-motorist benefits to amounts which the insured is \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 is enforceable, and its effect will be to preclude recovery when the tortfeasor is immune under R.C. Chapter 2744.\u201d 114 Ohio St.3d 239, 2007-Ohio-4004, 871 N.E.2d 574, at \u00b6 29. The court also stated that \u201c[o]ur ruling here, of course, does not prevent insurers from responding to consumer demand by offering uninsured-motorist coverage without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>precluding recovery because of a tortfeasor\u2019s immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33. The UM endorsement in this case does just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 11} The UM endorsement provides that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d includes a motor vehicle whose owner or operator \u201chas immunity under the Ohio Political Subdivision Tort Liability Law [OPSTLL].\u201d But Erie Insurance claims that language elsewhere in the endorsement that Erie will pay damages that the insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d makes <em>Snyder </em>dispositive, as that phrase mirrors the language relied upon in <em>Snyder </em>to preclude coverage. We do not agree. We conclude that the language of the definitional provision controls, and it plainly and unambiguously provides UM coverage when an insured is injured by an owner or operator who is immune under the OPSTLL.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 12} The critical distinction between <em>Snyder </em>and this case is that in <em>Snyder, </em>the plaintiff relied on a statutory definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d Here, the Marusas are not constrained by a statutory definition. This court\u2019s decision, therefore, is not controlled by <em>Snyder. </em>Twice at oral argument, Erie Insurance stated that it included the definitional provision because consumers would otherwise not know what an uninsured motorist is. It is interesting that Erie Insurance did not consider it necessary or advisable to similarly define \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d to ensure that consumers would be aware of the potential impact of the <em>Snyder </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 13} Given our conclusion concerning the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d contained in this insurance contract, we cannot conclude, as the <em>Snyder </em>court did when confronted with language from outside the insurance contract, that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d precludes uninsured-motorist coverage when the owner or operator is immune under the OPSTLL. Two courts of appeals have recently reached the same conclusion. <em>See Thom v. Perkins Twp., </em>6th Dist. No. E-10-069, 2012-Ohio-1568, 2012 WL 1154578; <em>Payton v. Peskins, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2010-10-022, 2011-Ohio-3905, 2011 WL 3433027. To give effect to the policy definition of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d it is necessary to consider it an exception to the limiting phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d which the <em>Snyder </em>court foresaw as a possibility. 114 Ohio St.3d 239, 2007-Ohio-4004, 871 N.E.2d 574, at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">{\u00b6 14} Furthermore, the definitional provision is specific and the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision is general. When faced with provisions that are arguably in conflict, we apply the more specific provision. <em>Troyer v. Jams, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 229, 2012-Ohio-2406, 971 N.E.2d 862, \u00b6 15. <em>See Mut. Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Hill, </em>193 U.S. 551, 558, 24 S.Ct. 538, 48 L.Ed. 788 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court granted Erie\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We conclude that the motion was improperly granted. The definitional provision at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>issue operates to expand UM coverage, not to limit or preclude it. Accordingly, we conclude that summary judgment should have been denied to Erie Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">{\u00b6 16} The Marusas also moved for summary judgment on the issue whether the policy provides UM coverage, which the trial court denied. Having concluded that neither <em>Snyder </em>nor the insurance contract precludes UM coverage, we remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-6\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b406-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur in judgment and concur separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b406-8\">O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and French, JJ., dissent and would hold that <em>Snyder v.

Am. Family Ins. Co., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 239, 2007-Ohio-4004, 871 N.E.2d 574. As Judge Stewart remarked in her dissent to the application of <em>Snyder </em>in this case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">The broader principle at issue here, and the one that apparently troubles the majority, too, is the prospect that an insured who specifically pays for UM coverage could be denied that coverage simply because the tortfeasor happened to be immune from liability, despite being fully at fault as is the case here. UM coverage is designed just for these types of situations, yet court decisions have effectively denied a significant number of people insurance coverage that they pay for, and think that they have, but do not. This is an intolerable state of the law and one I hope is quickly rectified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-12\"><em>Marusa v. Erie Ins. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 96556, 2011-Ohio-6276, 2011 WL 6145757, \u00b6 25 (Stewart, P.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">{\u00b6 18} Erie\u2019s policy provides that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d means a motor vehicle \u201cfor which the owner or operator of the \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 has immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>under the Ohio Political Subdivision Tort Liability Law or a diplomatic immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 19} And it also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">OUR PROMISE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">\u201cWe\u201d will pay damages for bodily injury that \u201canyone we protect\u201d or the legal representative of \u201canyone we protect\u201d are <em>legally entitled to recover </em>from the owner or operator of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d or \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 20} The majority opinion holds that Erie\u2019s specific definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d trumps the broader \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d language. This is one way to hold Erie to its coverage promise. But in <em>Snyder, </em>this court held that use of the language \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d excludes recovery of uninsured-motorists benefits when the tortfeasor is immune under R.C. Chapter 2744. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24 and 29. I would forthrightly overrule <em>Snyder </em>rather than simply distinguish it as a case premised on the statutory definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d rather than the policy definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 21} By amending R.C. 3937.18(A) in 2001 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97, the General Assembly made clear that insurers were no longer obligated to offer uninsured- and underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage as part of a motor-vehicle liability policy. 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 779, 779-780. In addition, insurers who now choose to offer UM/UIM coverage within a policy are granted the freedom to limit or exclude UM/UIM coverage under \u201cspecified circumstances.\u201d R.C. 3937.18(1). That section, however, says nothing about modifying statutory definitions. By considering the term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d as a \u201cspecified circumstance\u201d under R.C. 3937.18(1), <em>Snyder </em>allowed an insurance contract containing this language to invalidate R.C. 3937.18(B)(5)\u2019s definition of \u201cuninsured motorist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">{\u00b6 22} Although R.C. 3937.18 no longer contains the term \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d the idea remains that a plaintiff injured by an uninsured motorist must still prove the elements of the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">With respect to the uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages included in a policy of insurance, an insured shall be <em>required to prove all elements of the insured\u2019s claim that are necessary to recover </em>from the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Ahb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Caravona &amp; Berg, L.L.C., Donald E. Caravona, and Aaron P. Berg, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b408-8\">Hanna, Campbell &amp; Powell, L.L.P., Robert L. Tucker, John R. Chlysta, and Emily R. Yoder, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">(Emphasis added.) R.C. 3937.18(D); <em>compare </em>1997 amendment to R.C. 3937.18(A), 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372, 2373 (\u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d means that the insured is able to prove the elements of the claim for damages from the tortfeasor).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 23} I would hold that a policy that defines an uninsured motor vehicle as a vehicle owned or operated by one with political-subdivision immunity does not exclude the promise of UM/UIM insurance coverage by using the term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d in the insuring clause. I do not believe that we can continue to hold that these words effectively demolish the UM/UIM protection that the insured expects to receive in such a policy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
