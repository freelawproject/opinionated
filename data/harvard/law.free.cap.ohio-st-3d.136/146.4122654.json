In each case, the Union County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) apparently ordered a decrease in value, after which the Marysville Exempted Village School District Board of Education (\u201cschool board\u201d) appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d). The school board asked the BTA to order that the original complaints be dismissed in each case because the complaints were allegedly signed by a salaried employee of the corporation who is not himself a lawyer, but who nonetheless purported to act on behalf of the corporate owner. In support, the school board cited <em>Sharon Village Ltd. v. Licking Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 479, 678 N.E.2d 932 (1997), and <em>Worthington City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d 156, 707 N.E.2d 499 (1999). While acknowledging that R.C. 5715.19(A)(1) now explicitly authorizes salaried corporate employees to file on behalf of the corporate owner, the school board argued that the statute cannot be given effect because that kind of filing constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 3} On September 25, 2012, the BTA issued a consolidated decision granting the school board\u2019s motion. The BTA ordered that the appeals be remanded to the BOR to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Connolly Construction has appealed, and we now reverse the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 4} Because the BTA erroneously ordered dismissal, the valuation complaints have not received a determination on the merits from the BTA. We therefore remand to the BTA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 5} The record in this case is sparse. The BTA has certified the transcript of its proceedings to this court pursuant to R.C. 5717.04, but that record does not contain any affidavits or testimony. Moreover, the transcript from the BOR that would ordinarily be certified to the BTA pursuant to R.C. 5717.01 and included in the record before this court is absent. Accordingly, the record does not contain the actual valuation complaints at issue or any other evidence bearing on the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">{\u00b6 6} What the record does contain is the school board\u2019s motion to dismiss filed at the BTA and Connolly Construction\u2019s memorandum in opposition. The motion asserts that \u201c[t]he person who filed the complaints is only a salaried employee of the company, not the owner or a corporate officer with a fiduciary duty to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>company. Likewise, [the filer] is not an attorney and signing and filing the complaints was improper as an unauthorized practice of law.\u201d The memorandum in opposition does not dispute those facts; instead, the memorandum argues that (1) the filing by the salaried employee was proper because the complaint is a fact affidavit and the employee is the person with knowledge, (2) R.C. 5715.19(A)(1) as amended in 1999 specifically permits a salaried employee of a corporate property owner to file on behalf of the owner, and (3) the BTA has no authority to decline to apply the statute on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 7} In its September 25, 2012 decision, the BTA observed that the BOR had failed to certify the transcript of its proceedings, yet held that the record was \u201cadequate to resolve [the school board\u2019s] motion.\u201d <em>Marysville Exempted Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Union Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA Nos. 2011-K-4087 through 2011-K-4096, 2012 WL 4766420, *1 (Sept. 25, 2012), fn. 1. The complaints had been \u201cprepared and filed on behalf of Connolly Construction by its employee, John R. Connolly,\u201d who was neither a lawyer and nor an officer. <em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 8} Relying on <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Union Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>2012-Ohio-3751, 974 N.E.2d 133 (3d Dist.), <em>appeal accepted, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 1489, 2012-Ohio-5459, 978 N.E.2d 909, the BTA concluded that salaried employees who are not lawyers could not be authorized to file a complaint on behalf of the corporation. Accordingly, the BTA ordered remand to the BOR for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">A. Connolly\u2019s admissions permit the jurisdictional issue to be determined</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">{\u00b6 9} The BTA determined that the record was \u201cadequate\u201d to permit it to determine the jurisdictional issue the parties presented. 2012 WL 4766420, *1, fn. 1. At first blush, this finding is puzzling. Apparently, the BTA lacked <em>any </em>record \u2014 and therefore any factual basis for determining whether the asserted jurisdictional issue was in fact presented and, if so, how it should be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">{\u00b6 10} There is a danger in such a situation that the parties are asking the BTA (and on appeal, the court) to render an advisory opinion on an issue that is not actually presented. Nonetheless, the BTA was justified in reviewing the legal issue that the parties presented in spite of any deficiencies of the record. That is so because of the elementary proposition that \u201cwhen jurisdictional facts are challenged, the party claiming jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter.\u201d <em>Ohio Natl. Life Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>922 F.2d 320, 324 (6th Cir.1990). If Connolly Construction believed that a state of facts existed that established the BOR\u2019s jurisdiction over its complaints, it had the burden to assert those grounds in opposition to the motion to dismiss and to offer concomitant proof as necessary in support of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>assertions. <em>See Rapier v. Union City Non-Ferrous, Inc., </em>197 F.Supp.2d 1008, 1012 (S.D.Ohio 2002); <em>accord Oak Hills Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 539, 2012-Ohio-5750, 983 N.E.2d 1295, \u00b6 16-18 (affirming jurisdictional dismissal of appeal to the BTA when appellant failed to produce sufficient evidence of alleged facts supporting jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 11} This burden is very much attendant here because a valuation complaint initiates an administrative proceeding that is specially created by statute. Indeed, we have held that the complainant in a special statutory proceeding must affirmatively plead the jurisdictional facts. <em>See Haskins v. Alcott &amp; Horton, </em>13 Ohio St. 210, 216 (1862) (\u201cwhere a statute, upon certain conditions, confers a right, or gives a remedy, unknown to the common law, the party asserting the right, or availing himself of the remedy, must, in his pleadings, bring himself, or his case, clearly within the statute\u201d); <em>see also S. Christian Leadership Conference v. Combined Health Dist., </em>191 Ohio App.3d 405, 2010-Ohio-6550, 946 N.E.2d 282, \u00b6 28 (2d Dist.). This principle comports with the overarching doctrine that the proponent of jurisdiction must shoulder the burden of showing that the tribunal\u2014 here, the board of revision \u2014 may proceed to hear its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, Connolly Construction never contested the factual assertions made by the school board, nor did it set forth alternative grounds for jurisdiction. Instead, Connolly Construction acquiesced in the school board\u2019s factual assertions as a basis for determining the BOR\u2019s jurisdiction. Indeed, the only basis that Connolly Construction offered in support of jurisdiction was the provision in R.C. 5715.19(A)(1) permitting a salaried employee to file a valuation complaint on behalf of its employer, a corporate property owner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 13} We conclude that under these circumstances, we may proceed to review the BTA\u2019s legal determination that despite R.C. 5715.19(A)(l)\u2019s explicit authorization, a salaried employee may not file a valuation complaint on behalf of a corporation if that employee is not a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>B. The BTA may decline to apply a statute when the board relies on an appellate court decision declaring the statute unconstitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 14} Connolly Construction argues that the BTA has no authority to declare a statute unconstitutional, because the BTA \u201c\u2018is an administrative agency, a creature of statute, and is without jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Castle Aviation, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 290, 2006-Ohio-2420, 847 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 35, quoting <em>Cleveland Gear Co. v. Limbach, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 229, 520 N.E.2d 188 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>accord Global Knowledge Training, L.L.C. v. Levin, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 34, 2010-Ohio-4411, 936 N.E.2d 463, \u00b6 16; <em>see also MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Limbach, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 195, 198, 625 N.E.2d 597 (1994) (in an as-applied challenge, the BTA\u2019s limited role is to \u201creceive evidence for [the court] to make the constitutional finding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 15} While the general proposition Connolly Construction relies upon is true, we do not agree that it applies in this context. To be sure, the BTA\u2019s status as a creature of statute does prevent it from declining to apply a pertinent statute on constitutional grounds based merely upon its own determination of the statute\u2019s constitutionality. But in this case, the BTA pointed to and relied on a decision from the Third Appellate District, <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>2012-Ohio-3751, 974 N.E.2d 133, and the limits on the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction as an administrative tribunal do not preclude it from attending to, and giving effect to, the pronouncements of the courts that review its decisions. Indeed, no one has argued that a ruling issued by <em>this </em>court could be ignored by the BTA; the BTA would not only have jurisdiction to apply this court\u2019s precedent \u2014 it would have a duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 16} We conclude that the BTA had jurisdiction to apply the <em>McDonald\u2019s </em>decision from the Third District and to order dismissal in this case based on the authority of that appellate decision. We now turn to the merits of whether the BTA should have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">C. The potential conflict between legislative power and this court\u2019s duty to regulate the practice of law</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\"><em>1. The </em>Sharon Village <em>doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 17} More than 15 years ago, we issued a consequential decision that addressed whether a corporation that owned real property could authorize a nonattorney to file a valuation complaint on its behalf. In <em>Sharon Village, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 479, 678 N.E.2d 932, the court applied (1) the former version of R.C. 5715.19(A), (2) R.C. 4705.01, a statute prohibiting the practice of law by nonlawyers, and (3) case law defining the practice of law. We held that preparing and filing a valuation complaint on behalf of another constituted the practice of law. As a result, a person who is not a lawyer could not be authorized to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>valuation complaint on behalf of a corporate entity that owned real property because any such filing constituted the unauthorized practice of law and, accordingly, would not validly invoke the board of revision\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 18} <em>Sharon Village </em>relied on case law that had expansively interpreted the practice of law. The practice of law is not \u201c \u2018limited to the conduct of cases in court,\u2019 \u201d but it encompasses as well \u201c \u2018the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings,\u2019 \u201d along with \u201c \u2018the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, quoting <em>Land Title Abstract &amp; Trust Co. v. Dworken, </em>129 Ohio St. 23, 193 N.E. 650 (1934), paragraph one of the syllabus. In addition, \u201c \u2018conveyancing, the preparation of legal instruments of all kinds, and in general all advice to clients and all action taken for them in matters connected with the law\" \u201d fell under this broad definition of the practice of law. <em>Sharon Village </em>at 480-481, quoting <em>Dworken </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. On that basis, <em>Sharon Village </em>held that the preparation and filing of valuation complaints on behalf of others constituted the practice of law. <em>Id. </em>at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>2. </em>Anti-Sharon Village <em>legislation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 19} Significantly, during the time at issue in <em>Sharon Village </em>and its progeny, R.C. 5715.19(A) did not specify persons who may file on behalf of a corporate property owner. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 603, 142 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4583, 4589. But R.C. 4705.01 did expressly prohibit a nonlawyer from \u201cusing or subscribing his own name\u201d to commence, conduct, or defend any \u201caction or proceeding\u201d when the nonlawyer is not a party to the case. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 219, 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 662, 680-681. Thus, at the time <em>Sharon Village </em>was decided, the statutes themselves did not authorize anyone but a lawyer to file on behalf of a corporate entity. That circumstance makes it understandable that the filing of a valuation complaint by a nonlawyer was deemed to constitute a jurisdictional defect in the complaint itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 20} In 1999, however, the General Assembly enacted Sub.H.B. No. 694, which amended R.C. 5715.19(A)(1) to permit certain specified persons to file valuation complaints on behalf of the property owmer without regard to whether those persons are lawyers. 147 Ohio Laws, Part III, 5373, 5375. Permitting nonlawyers to file as the agent of a property owner raised the issue \u201cwhether the legislative enactment can constitutionally be enforced in light of the duty to regulate the practice of law that the Ohio Constitution vests in this court.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 529, 2012-Ohio-5680, 983 N.E.2d 1285, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\n<em>3. This court has upheld two H.B. 694 provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 21} In two cases, this court has addressed different portions of the 1999 amendments to R.C. 5715.19(A)(1). First, in <em>Dayton Supply &amp; Tool Co., Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 367, 2006-Ohio-5852, 856 N.E.2d 926, we considered the statutory provision authorizing nonlawyer corporate officers to file on behalf of the corporate property owner. In that case, we set forth the relevant factors to consider in determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether a particular activity may be performed by nonlawyers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7-13. We concluded that \u201ca corporate officer does not engage in the unauthorized practice of law by preparing and filing a complaint with the board of revision and by presenting the claimed value of the property before the board of revision on behalf of his or her corporation, as long as the officer does not make legal arguments, examine witnesses, or undertake any other tasks that can be performed only by an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 22} Next, in <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 529, 2012-Ohio-5680, 983 N.E.2d 1285, we addressed the amended statute\u2019s provision that authorizes a property owner\u2019s spouse to file on behalf of the owner. Concluding that the legislature did not substantially interfere with this court\u2019s authority to regulate the practice of law by permitting a spouse to file a valuation complaint on behalf of the property owner, the court deferred to the General Assembly\u2019s decision regarding how the jurisdiction of an administrative board may be invoked. We also declined to apply the case-by-case test used in <em>Dayton Supply &amp; Tool </em>to decide who may file on another\u2019s behalf, based on our perception that the legislature did not intend that any such test be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, the decision in <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>provides a roadmap for considering the issue in this case, i.e., whether salaried employees of a corporate property owner may prepare and file a valuation complaint on behalf of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">D. The General Assembly did not exceed its authority when it authorized salaried employees to file complaints on behalf of the corporation</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 24} At the outset, we note that Connolly\u2019s heavy reliance on our decision in <em>Toledo Pub. Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Lucas Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 490, 2010-Ohio-253, 924 N.E.2d 345, is misplaced. In <em>Toledo, </em>a lawyer for a property-management company prepared and filed a valuation complaint on behalf of the property owner, pursuant to an agreement granting the management company that authority. We confronted the issue whether a contractor could act as an agent of the property owner and held that it could. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24, 28, and 30. We specifically noted, however, that the issue of the unauthorized practice of law (which is at the heart of this case) did not arise, because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>lawyer \u2014 the contractor\u2019s lawyer \u2014 had been involved in preparing and filing the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. Accordingly, <em>Toledo </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 25} Because <em>Toledo </em>does not control, we must apply the test articulated in <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>Under that case, three principles guide the court\u2019s determination. First, we decline to adopt an as-applied approach with a multifactor constitutional test that the legislature itself did not enact and did not intend. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>calls for reviewing each of the particular provisions added to R.C. 5715.19(A)(1) by Sub.H.B. No. 694 on an all-or-nothing basis, because \u201c[l]itigants and agencies should be able to rely on the statute at all times or, alternatively, know that they may never rely on it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b626} Second, we accord deference to the General Assembly\u2019s authority to create administrative tribunals such as the boards of revision and to define how their jurisdiction may be invoked. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. It follows that we will invalidate the filing of a complaint that complies with R.C. 5715.19(A)(1) only if we find that enforcing the statute would substantially interfere with this court\u2019s duty to regulate the practice of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b627} Third, we uphold the legislative decision to authorize the filing of a complaint on behalf of the owner if the person so authorized may, by virtue of his or her relationship with the owner, be held accountable by the owner for his or her actions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 28} Applying these principles compels the conclusion that the General Assembly had authority to authorize salaried employees, though not lawyers, to file on behalf of the corporate property owner. Although the salaried corporate employee does not necessarily have the same degree of fiduciary duty toward the corporation that an officer possesses, the relationship of a salaried employee to the corporate employer does \u201ctend to involve an ongoing relationship between the owner and the filer\u201d that \u201callow[s] the owner to hold the filer accountable for his or her actions.\u201d <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 529, 2012-Ohio-5680, 983 N.E.2d 1285, at \u00b6 24. Nor does allowing the salaried employee to file constitute any greater intrusion on our duty to regulate the practice of law than those authorizations that we have already upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, we find the school board\u2019s arguments to the contrary unavailing. The school board first argues that \u201cthe legislature cannot widen the pool of people who may practice law.\u201d It is true that, because this court bears the ultimate constitutional responsibility to oversee the practice of law, the legislature can go no further in authorizing legal practice by nonlawyers than we permit. But it is equally true that we have permitted nonlawyers to engage in a properly limited range of activity, even though that activity falls within the broad definition of legal practice. We have held that \u201c \u2018there are multiple interests to consider in determining whether a particular legal activity is acceptably per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>formed by nonlawyers,\u2019 \u201d so that even though \u201c \u2018all representative conduct at the administrative level falls within the broad definition of the practice of law, yet [we may] still authorize lay representatives to perform certain functions in the administrative setting when the public interest so demands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dayton Supply &amp; Tool Co., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 367, 2006-Ohio-5852, 856 N.E.2d 926, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. CompManagement, Inc., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 168, 2004-Ohio-6506, 818 N.E.2d 1181, \u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>CompManagement, </em>we upheld the standards of Industrial Commission Resolution No. R04-1-01, which defined what certain nonlawyers (third-party administrators and union representatives) may do in connection with assisting claimants and employers with workers\u2019 compensation claims before the Industrial Commission. Those standards authorized nonlawyers, among other things, to assist parties \u201c \u2018in the administration of a claim and the filing of claims and appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21, quoting paragraph (A)(2) of the Resolution. <em>Accord Henize v. Giles, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 213, 217, 490 N.E.2d 585 (1986) (\u201cWith this authority [to control the practice of law] is the concomitant responsibility to protect the public by preventing the unauthorized practice of law, while at the same time not exercising this authority so rigidly that the public good suffers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 31} This background demonstrates that there is ample precedent for exercising deference to laws or policies that, in properly limited contexts, authorize nonlawyers to engage in activities that fall into the broad category of the practice of law. Because the authorization of salaried employees to file on behalf of their corporate employers satisfies the relevant criteria, we uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 32} Next, the school board attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Dayton Supply &amp; Tool </em>by contrasting the duties of a corporate officer and those of a salaried employee. The school board asserts that the person who prepares and files the valuation complaint must have a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d to the corporate property owner and states that unlike corporate officers, salaried employees are not typically regarded as fiduciaries of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 33} We do not find this argument persuasive. It has long been acknowledged that an employee is party to an \u201c \u2018implied agreement * * * that he will faithfully serve and be regardful of the interests of his employer during the term of service and carefully discharge his duty to the extent reasonably implied by the relation of employer and employee.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>Fremont Oil Co. v.

The complaints in this case therefore properly invoked the jurisdiction of the BOR, and dismissal was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b6 35} For the foregoing reasons, the BTA erred by ordering that the valuation complaints at issue be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. We therefore reverse the decision of the BTA and remand for further proceedings. Additionally, the pending motion to consolidate this case with other cases is, with respect to this case, denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">. Our decision in <em>Worthington City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 156, 707 N.E.2d 499, established that even before the 1999 amendments to R.C. 5715.19(A)(1), the complaint did not have to be signed by an attorney as long as an attorney had substantial involvement in preparing and filing it. <em>Id. </em>at 160. This is important in this case in two respects. First, Connolly Construction notably did not assert or offer to prove that the company\u2019s legal counsel was involved in preparing and filing the complaint, which would have constituted an alternative ground for rejecting the motion to dismiss \u2014 one that would obviate any consideration of the constitutionality of the 1999 amendments to R.C. 5715.19(A)(1). Second, the holding of <em>Worthington </em>shows why it does not matter that the Department of Taxation\u2019s complaint form is in the form of an affidavit, which would properly be signed by a fact witness rather than an attorney: under <em>Worthington, </em>the lawyer\u2019s involvement in preparing and filing means that there is no unauthorized-practice problem, even when <em>the client </em>is the one who signs the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
