Relator alleged that Leksan had failed to maintain adequate records of the funds held in his client trust account; had failed to reconcile the account on a monthly basis; had misappropriated client funds for his personal and business expenses, for loans to his friends, and for distribution to clients whose funds he had previously misappropriated; and had improperly deposited his personal funds into his client trust account. Relator further alleged that Leksan\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, was prejudicial to the administration of justice, and adversely reflected on his fitness to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">{\u00b6 3} The parties submitted stipulations of fact and misconduct and of aggravating and mitigating factors and suggested that the appropriate sanction for Leksan\u2019s misconduct is a two-year suspension, with conditions on his reinstatement. They also submitted 26 stipulated exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">{\u00b6 4} A panel of the board conducted a hearing in which Leksan testified about his misconduct, his long-term depression, and his gambling addiction. The panel adopted the parties\u2019 stipulations of fact, misconduct, and aggravating and mitigating factors but rejected the stipulated sanction, finding that an indefinite suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sion with the stipulated conditions on Leksan\u2019s reinstatement is more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">{\u00b6 5} The full board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommended sanction. The board further recommends that we adopt the parties\u2019 stipulated conditions for Leksan\u2019s reinstatement to the practice of law. No objections have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 6} Having reviewed the record, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and indefinitely suspend Leksan from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\"><em>Count One </em>\u2014 General <em>Trust-Account Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">{\u00b6 7} The parties stipulated that since 2009, Leksan has failed to maintain a general ledger or individual ledgers of client funds in his possession, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2) (requiring a lawyer to maintain a record for each client on whose behalf funds are held) and 1.15(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain a record for the lawyer\u2019s client trust account, setting forth the name of the account, the date, amount, and client affected by each credit and debit, and the balance in the account) and has failed to reconcile his client trust account, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(5) (requiring a lawyer to perform and retain a monthly reconciliation of the funds held in the lawyer\u2019s client trust account). From at least February 2009 through at least March 2011, Leksan retained earned fees in his client trust account and withdrew them on an as-needed basis, deposited at least $89,435.55 in personal funds into that account to cover shortages created by his misappropriation of client funds, and used funds from the account to make more than $30,000 in personal loans to two of his friends, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client trust account, separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property) and 1.15(b) (permitting a lawyer to deposit his or her own funds in a client trust account only for the purpose of paying or obtaining a waiver of bank service charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"><em>Count Two </em>\u2014 Misappropriation <em>of Funds Regarding Multiple Clients</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">{\u00b6 8} On February 12, 2009, Leksan opened a client trust account at Park National Bank and deposited there a $50 check from a client trust account he maintained at Huntington Bank. He closed his client trust account at Huntington Bank later that month. Although he should have held more than $36,000 in trust for two clients at that time, he did not transfer any more funds to the Park National Bank account, because he had used his clients\u2019 money to pay his personal or business expenses or to pay other clients whose funds he had previously misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">{\u00b6 9} Over the next two and one-half years, Leksan repeatedly misappropriated funds from clients to satisfy his own financial obligations or obligations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>other clients whose funds he had previously misappropriated. The parties and the board cite five examples of this pattern of misconduct:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 10} A. On August 25, 2009, Leksan deposited an $8,000 settlement check into his client trust account, from which his client David Leach was entitled to receive $5,557.77. Instead of distributing those funds to Leach, he paid another client, April Mills, $5,450.17, leaving a balance of only $112.42 in his client trust account at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 11} B. On August 27, 2009, Leksan deposited a $55,000 settlement check in his client trust account. After attorney fees, costs, and expenses were deducted from that settlement, his clients Judy and Edward Beasley were entitled to receive $25,000. From August 28, 2009, through September 8, 2009, Leksan did not distribute any funds to the Beasleys or their creditors, but used the proceeds of their settlement to pay his client Jennie Moore $31,050.63 and Leach $5,557.77, and to loan his friend Ron Tr\u00edpodo $15,000, leaving just $53.95 in his client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 12} C. On November 25, 2009, Leksan deposited a $36,500 settlement check into his client trust account, from which his clients Mary and Stewart Daniel were entitled to receive $18,643.52. From November 25, 2009, through January 19, 2010, before disbursing any funds to the Daniels, he paid various bills on behalf of himself and other clients and loaned Tr\u00edpodo another $10,000, leaving a balance of just $296.48 in his client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 13} D. On January 22, 2010, Leksan deposited a $19,730 settlement check\u2014 the entire amount of which he was to pay to Toyota Financial on behalf of his client Christopher Seda \u2014 into his client trust account. On January 25, 2009, before paying Toyota Financial, he used the settlement proceeds to pay the Daniels the $18,643.52 they were entitled to receive from their settlement. On February 11, 2010, his client trust account held only $132.96 when it should have held at least $19,730.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">{\u00b6 14} E. On February 19, 2010, Leksan deposited two settlement checks totaling $10,655.24 into his client trust account, from which his client Lila Bumstead was entitled to receive $4,194.24, and his client Victoria Bumstead was entitled to receive $2,794.29. Within days of depositing the settlement checks, Leksan withdrew $8,500 from his client trust account, leaving a balance of $2,288.20 \u2014 $4,700.33 less than he owed the Bumsteads.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">{\u00b6 15} The parties stipulated and the board found that by prematurely withdrawing client funds to satisfy his own personal' obligations and those regarding other clients, Leksan violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Count Three </em>\u2014 The <em>Chasteen Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">{\u00b6 16} On March 2, 2010, Leksan deposited a $137,500 check \u2014 the gross proceeds of a settlement he had obtained on behalf of his clients Kenneth and Alta Chasteen \u2014 into his client trust account. After deductions for attorney fees, costs, and medical expenses, the Chasteens were entitled to receive $84,685.55. However, Leksan used the settlement proceeds to pay $6,988.53 to the Bum-steads and $19,730 to Toyota Financial on behalf of Seda and to loan $6,000 to Tr\u00edpodo.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 17} In mid-April 2010, Leksan issued a partial distribution of $45,000 to the Chasteens from his client trust account and advised them that he would hold the remaining $39,685.55 of their settlement proceeds while he negotiated their outstanding medical bills and insurance-subrogation matters. By July 22, 2010, however, he had withdrawn the remaining proceeds to pay personal or business expenses, leaving just $7.45 in his client trust account. Two insurers agreed to waive their entire subrogation liens, and in August 2010, the last subrogated insurer agreed to accept $5,000 as full and final payment. Leksan paid that insurer on November 2, 2010, using personal funds that he had deposited into his client trust account the previous week.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 18} The Chasteens inquired more than once about the remainder of then-settlement proceeds, and Leksan initially advised them that their subrogation matters were still pending. Once the subrogation matters were resolved, however, he stopped accepting the Chasteens\u2019 calls. He did not distribute the remainder of their settlement proceeds to them until July 29, 2011 \u2014 almost nine months after he had resolved the subrogation issues in their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 19} The parties stipulated and the board found that Leksan\u2019s conduct in the Chasteen matter violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(4) (requiring a lawyer to comply as soon as practicable with reasonable requests for information from the client), 1.15(a), 1.15(d) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver funds or other property that the client is entitled to receive), 8.4(c), 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\"><em>Count Four </em>\u2014 The <em>Hedrick Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">{\u00b6 20} On August 20, 2010, Leksan deposited into his client trust account a $3,750 settlement check that he had received on behalf of his client Michael \u201cLars\u201d Hedrick. The settlement proceeds were to be distributed as follows: $2,114.78 to Hedrick, $1,250 to Leksan, and $385.22 to Boilermakers National Health and Welfare Fund in satisfaction of a lien. Hedrick requested that Leksan pay the $385.22 directly to him so that Hedrick could extinguish the lien. While Leksan issued a $2,114.78 check payable to Hedrick on September 20, 2010, and withdrew his attorney fees from his client trust account on an as-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>needed basis, he did not release the remaining $385.22 to Hedrick until March 5, 2012. The balance in Leksan\u2019s client trust account, however, dropped below that amount on several occasions between August 20, 2010, and July 29, 2011, and the account was overdrawn by $107.54 on March 17, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">{\u00b6 21} The parties stipulated and the board found that Leksan\u2019s conduct in the Hedrick matter violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><em>Count Five </em>\u2014 The <em>Camine Matter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 22} Leksan deposited a $19,000 settlement check into his client trust account on January 28, 2011. He met with his client Jason Camine to distribute the settlement proceeds on January 31, 2011, and issued two checks to himself for fees and expenses totaling $6,612.44 and three checks to Camine (at Carnine\u2019s request) totaling $7,977.35. He also drafted checks payable to five of Carnine\u2019s medical providers, showed Camine the checks, and told him that he would mail them to the medical providers on Carnine\u2019s behalf. Leksan waited about five months \u2014 until June and July 2011 \u2014 to mail the checks, and in the interim he used the funds to pay his personal and business expenses or to pay other clients whose funds he had misappropriated. Although he should have retained at least $4,409.61 in his client trust account during that time, it was overdrawn by $57.54 in February 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 23} The parties stipulated and the board found that Leksan\u2019s conduct in the Camine matter violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a), 1.15(d), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 24} Upon a thorough review of the record, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct with respect to each of these five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">{\u00b6 25} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">{\u00b6 26} As aggravating factors, the parties stipulated and the'board found that Leksan acted with a selfish or dishonest motive, engaged in a pattern of misconduct involving multiple offenses, and committed misconduct that caused harm to his clients. <em>See </em>BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), and (h). In mitigation, the parties stipulated and the board found that Leksan had no prior disciplinary record, made a good-faith effort to rectify the consequences of his misconduct, fully and freely disclosed his conduct to relator and displayed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, and submitted evidence of his good character and reputation apart from the charged misconduct. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (c), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 27} The board also found that Leksan was recovering from a gambling addiction, was struggling with an alcohol addiction, and had been engaged in treatment for these and other problems for more than ten years. Relevant to these considerations, the record contains a letter from psychiatrist John M. Hawkins, M.D., who states that he has treated Leksan for depression and low self-esteem for more than ten years. Dr. Hawkins\u2019s letter states that Leksan has focused on helping people in his law practice, but that Leksan failed to stay on top of his accounts receivable and accepted too many cases in which the clients could not pay him. In Dr. Hawkins\u2019s view, several factors, in particular Leksan\u2019s \u201cdesire to be with people in a higher socio-economic class and spending beyond his means, led to mismanagement of his personal and professional accounts.\u201d Dr. Hawkins\u2019s letter additionally states that Leksan believed that his gambling addiction was a way to resolve his debts and used gambling as a psychological distraction to avoid his feelings of pain and low self-acceptance. Unfortunately, that addiction only worsened Leksan\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 28} Dr. Hawkins states that Leksan began to address his gambling and alcohol addictions in early 2009 with the help of Gamblers Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d). He believes that Leksan has made tremendous strides in the treatment of his psychological problems and addictions, that he has new tools and a support system to assist him, and that he remains committed to his treatment program. He believes that Leksan can successfully and responsibly practice law in the future. Based on Dr. Hawkins\u2019s statements, we find that Leksan\u2019s depression and alcohol and gambling addictions qualify as mitigating factors pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 29} The parties stipulated that the proper sanction for Leksan\u2019s misconduct is a two-year suspension from the practice of law, with reinstatement conditioned on the submission of proof that he has (1) completed 12 hours of continuing legal education (\u201cCLE\u201d) in law-office management, (2) implemented a system to properly manage client funds in his practice, and (3) complied with his OLAP contract as well as the recommendations of his treating professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 30} Disbarment is the presumptive sanction for an attorney who misappropriates client funds, but we have recognized that in some misappropriation cases significant mitigating circumstances may weigh in favor of an indefinite suspension. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Rothermel, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 413, 2004-Ohio-6559, 819 N.E.2d 1099, \u00b6 18, citing <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Dixon, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 490, 2002-Ohio-2490, 769 N.E.2d 816, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>{\u00b6 31} In support of their stipulated sanction, the parties cited <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. King, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 501, 2012-Ohio-873, 974 N.E.2d 1180 (imposing a two-year suspension on an attorney who, over a period of months, used client-trust-account funds to pay his own expenses, deposited personal funds into and failed to keep adequate records of the funds held in his client trust account, fabricated a fee dispute to justify his failure to promptly return a client\u2019s money, and failed to advise his clients that he did not carry malpractice insurance), and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Crosby, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 226, 2009-Ohio-6763, 921 N.E.2d 225 (imposing a two-year suspension on an attorney who used his client trust account for personal and business expenses, failed to maintain adequate records of the funds, and failed to promptly withdraw his earned fees). Neither of these cases, however, involved Leksan\u2019s primary offense \u2014 the misappropriation of substantial client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 32} The board acknowledged that Leksan obtained treatment for his diagnosed depression, as well as his alcohol and gambling addictions, and that he continues to aggressively pursue treatment by meeting with his treating professionals five days per week. He has made his clients whole, having restored most of the misappropriated funds before his misconduct was even discovered. He has confessed his misconduct to all but one of the affected clients and many have written letters of recommendation on his behalf asking for leniency.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also has submitted more than 20 letters \u2014 many from fellow attorneys \u2014 attesting to his honesty, professionalism, and good character apart from the charged misconduct. Two of Leksan\u2019s character-reference letters are from members of Gamblers Anonymous who praise him for the inspiration and assistance he has given them (and others like them) in addressing not only their compulsive gambling but also the legal repercussions of their addictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 33} The board found that Leksan had been cooperative, sincere, and frank with relator and the panel. The board also expressed a belief that he \u201cknowingly\u201d caused his client trust account to be overdrawn (by less than $150) so that the bank would inform relator of the overdraft and bring a stop to his ethical violations. In light of these mitigating factors, the absence of any prior violations, Leksan\u2019s demeanor at the panel hearing, and his efforts to wind down his practice, the panel was persuaded that permanent disbarment was not warranted. But the panel was not convinced that the stipulated two-year suspension was an adequate sanction for Leksan\u2019s misconduct. Therefore, the panel recommended that he be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio and that his reinstatement be subject to the conditions stipulated by the parties. The board concurred in the panel\u2019s analysis and recommendation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aan\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Karen H. Osmond, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b376-9\">Montgomery, Rennie &amp; Jonson, L.P.A., and George D. Jonson, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">{\u00b6 34} Having reviewed the record, including the circumstances of Leksan\u2019s misconduct as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the board, we agree that an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction in this case. We have imposed indefinite suspensions for similar instances of misconduct involving the misappropriation of client funds. <em>See, e.g., Akron Bar Assn. v. Smithem, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 72, 2010-Ohio-652, 926 N.E.2d 274 (indefinitely suspending an attorney for converting client funds on more than 30 separate occasions and for depositing more than $100,000 in client retainers into her personal bank account rather than her firm\u2019s trust account; mitigating factors included more than 20 years of practice without disciplinary violations, cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, an agreement to make full restitution, and gambling and alcohol addictions that were causally related to the attorney\u2019s misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b635} Accordingly, Thomas John Leksan is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio, and his reinstatement is conditioned on the submission of proof that he has (1) completed 12 hours of CLE in law-office management in addition to meeting the requirements of Gov.Bar R. X, (2) implemented a system to properly manage client funds in his practice, and (3) complied with his OLAP contract and the recommendations of his treating professionals. Costs are taxed to Leksan.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-15\">.
