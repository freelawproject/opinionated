The complaint alleged that Bunstine offered to make \u201cother arrangements\u201d for Ashley Holdren to pay his fee in a child-custody matter. During a meeting at his office, Bunstine told Holdren he would come to her home that afternoon and that she should answer the door naked. Holdren believed that Bunstine wanted to have sex with her. Less than one hour after Holdren left the meeting, Bunstine called her cell phone. Holdren told Bunstine not to come to her home, but he did anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">{\u00b6 3} After a hearing, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline found that Bunstine\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.8(j) (prohibiting a lawyer from soliciting or engaging in sexual activity with a client unless a consensual sexual relationship existed when the client-lawyer relationship commenced) and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). The panel declined to find a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">{\u00b6 4} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommends that we suspend Bunstine from the practice of law for one year, with six months stayed. Bunstine filed objections challenging all but a few of the board\u2019s factual findings, both of its findings of misconduct, the aggravating and mitigating factors found, and the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>{\u00b6 5} For the reasons that follow, we overrule Bunstine\u2019s objections, adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, and suspend Bunstine from the practice of law for one year, with six months stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>Factual Findings of the Panel and the Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 6} Based on evidence adduced at the panel hearing, the panel and board found the following facts relating to Bunstine\u2019s charged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 7} On January 7, 2010, a court granted companionship of Ashley Holdren\u2019s two children to the children\u2019s biological father, William Scott. On January 19, 2010, Holdren retained Bunstine to seek relief from that judgment. Bunstine promptly filed a motion for a new trial or relief from judgment. L\u00e1ter he filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because Scott had improperly filed the action in Ross County, rather than Pike County. The court granted the motion to dismiss on May 13, 2010, and Bunstine closed Holdren\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 8} Soon thereafter, Scott filed a companionship action against Holdren in Pike County. Holdren appeared without counsel at a July 14, 2010 hearing and indicated that her potential attorney, Bunstine, could not be present. The court continued the hearing until July 21, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 9} Bunstine received a courtesy copy of the court\u2019s entry continuing Holdren\u2019s hearing. Holdren also separately contacted Bunstine\u2019s office and spoke to Bunstine\u2019s secretary about the matter. The secretary told Holdren that Bunstine would charge her $500 to represent her.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 10} On July 16, 2010, Holdren and Bunstine met for less than one hour in Bunstine\u2019s office. During the meeting, Holdren inquired about arranging payment of Bunstine\u2019s fees. In response, Bunstine suggested that he could come to Holdren\u2019s home. Holdren testified that he had said she could get rid of her fianc\u00e9, find a babysitter for her two children, and answer her door naked.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 11} Holdren testified that she had been disgusted, upset, and scared by Bunstine\u2019s statement and had immediately left his office. Soon after Holdren left, Bunstine called Holdren\u2019s cell phone and asked if he could come to her house. Holdren said no. Bunstine nevertheless drove 35 minutes to her home. Bunstine testified that he had gone to Holdren\u2019s home to see what would happen, but also to obtain documents and take photos \u201cin anticipation of a continued representation of [Holdren].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">{\u00b6 12} When Bunstine arrived at Holdren\u2019s home, he was confronted in the driveway by Holdren\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s father. After a discussion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Bunstine drove away. He returned a short time later and asked if he could return with his wife so that Holdren could explain to her what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">{\u00b6 13} Bunstine left, and Holdren decided to leave with her children before he returned. Before she was able to leave, however, Bunstine returned with his wife. Mrs. Bunstine and Holdren had a conversation inside Holdren\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 14} After speaking with Mrs. Bunstine, Holdren permitted Bunstine to represent her at the hearing scheduled for July 21, 2010. Holdren testified that she did not have sufficient time to hire new counsel between Friday, July 16, 2010, and Wednesday, July 21, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 15} In August 2010, Holdren obtained new counsel. She later filed a grievance against Bunstine.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\n<em>Bunstine\u2019s Objections to Factual Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 16} Bunstine raises numerous objections to the factual findings made by the panel and the board. These objections recycle Bunstine\u2019s testimony at the panel hearing and essentially argue that the panel should have credited his testimony over that of Holdren.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cUnless the record weighs heavily against a hearing panel\u2019s findings, we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, inasmuch as the panel members saw and heard the witnesses firsthand.\u201d <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 24; <em>see also Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Statzer, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 14, 2003-Ohio-6649, 800 N.E.2d 1117, \u00b6 8. Upon reviewing the record, we defer to the panel\u2019s reasonable decision to credit Holdren\u2019s testimony over Bunstine\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">{\u00b6 18} Several of Bunstine\u2019s objections attempt to place blame on Holdren. As at the hearing, Bunstine claims that Holdren willingly participated in any inappropriate conduct and blamed Bunstine only when her fianc\u00e9 \u201ccaught\u201d her. According to Bunstine, Holdren invited him to her home and even drew him a map to the house. He testified that it was only after she invited him to her house that he had asked her whether she would answer the door naked. Bunstine says he never asked Holdren to get rid of her fianc\u00e9 or to take her kids to a babysitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The panel reasonably decided to credit Holdren\u2019s testimony to the contrary. Holdren testified that she had not invited Bunstine to her home or drawn him a map \u2014 indeed, she testified that she had told him not to come and that she had been disgusted by his proposition. She also testified that Bunstine had made the statement about getting her fianc\u00e9 and children out of the house. But even if Holdren had initiated the inappropriate conversation, that would not negate Bunstine\u2019s misconduct. With regard to sexual conduct, we have said that \u201cthe burden is <em>on the lawyer </em>to ensure that all attorney-client dealings remain on a professional level.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Booher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 509, 510, 664 N.E.2d 522 (1996); <em>see also Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Feneli, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 102,103, 712 N.E.2d 119 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 20} In addition, in his objections, Bunstine continues to make excuses for his inappropriate statement. Bunstine has repeatedly claimed that he had only \u201casked a question for the purpose of hearing the response.\u201d He says that it was unreasonable of Holdren to assume that he \u201cwanted her to answer the door naked so that [they] could, thereafter, engage in sexual activity.\u201d According to Bunstine, he did not intend to receive an alternative payment for legal services or to solicit sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 21} Regardless of Bunstine\u2019s motivation, he asked Holdren whether she would answer the door naked if he came to her house. Holdren perceived that comment as a solicitation of sexual activity: \u201c[W]hat else would [Bunstine] be wanting to do, having me come to my door naked?\u201d And Holdren testified that Bunstine had made this statement in response to her inquiry about fee arrangements. This supports the board\u2019s finding that Bunstine solicited Holdren.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, Bunstine objects to the finding that he had an attorney-client relationship with Holdren when he asked her the inappropriate question. The panel and board both concluded that an attorney-client relationship did exist at the time of the incident. We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAn attorney-client relationship may be created by implication based upon the conduct of the parties and the reasonable expectations of the person seeking representation.\u201d <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Hardiman, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 260, 2003-Ohio-5596, 798 N.E.2d 369, syllabus. Here, Holdren believed that Bunstine was her attorney at the time of the incident, and that belief was reasonable under the circumstances. Bunstine had recently represented Holdren in a matter involving the same issue \u2014 Scott\u2019s seeking visitation with Holdren\u2019s children \u2014 and Holdren told the judge on the Pike County court case that Bunstine would be her attorney. She met with Bunstine to discuss the case. Indeed, even Bunstine concedes \u2014 both at the hearing and in his present objections \u2014 that part of the reason he went to Holdren\u2019s house on July 16, 2010, was to get more information for the representation. He wanted to get additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>documentation and to \u201ctak[e] photographs to be used <em>for litigation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) These facts support the panel\u2019s and board\u2019s conclusion that an attorney-client relationship existed at the time of Bunstine\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 24} In light of the above, we overrule Bunstine\u2019s objections and adopt the board\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>Findings of Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 25} We agree with the panel and the board that Bunstine\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.8(j) and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 26} Bunstine also objects to these legal conclusions, arguing that there is insufficient evidence of these violations. We disagree. The above facts provide clear and convincing evidence that Bunstine violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.8(j). The same facts also provide clear and convincing evidence that Bunstine violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h), because we have found that such conduct adversely reflects on an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law. <em>See, e.g., Akron Bar Assn. v. Miller, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 1, 2011-Ohio-4412, 955 N.E.2d 359, \u00b6 17-19; <em>Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Lockshin, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 529, 2010-Ohio-2207, 929 N.E.2d 1028, \u00b6 10-30 (interpreting DR 1-102(A)(6), the predecessor of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h)); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Quatman, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 389, 2006-Ohio-1196, 843 N.E.2d 1205, \u00b6 23 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 27} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 28} The panel and board found three aggravating factors. First, Bunstine acted with a selfish motive. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). Second, his conduct resulted in harm to the victim. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h). Finally, Bunstine has committed a prior disciplinary offense. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a). In 2012, the court suspended Bunstine for six months, all stayed on the condition that he not commit any additional disciplinary violations. <em>See Disciplinary Counsel v. Bunstine, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 302, 2012-Ohio-977, 964 N.E.2d 427, \u00b6 17, 27 (finding violations of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) [prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation], (d), and (h)). Bunstine objects to the board\u2019s finding with regard to all three aggravating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>factors. First, he says that the panel was wrong in concluding that he had a selfish motive; he had asked the question only to hear the answer. Second, Bunstine says his conduct did not harm a \u201cvictim,\u201d because Holdren was not a victim; she had invited Bunstine to her home. Finally, Bunstine urges the court to ignore his prior disciplinary violation because he has been sanctioned only once in his 32 years of practice. We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">{\u00b6 29} As to mitigating factors, the panel and board found none. <em>See generally </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2). Bunstine again objects, claiming that \u201cbeing honest and truthful is a mitigating factor.\u201d But it is difficult to see how Bunstine has been honest and truthful throughout these proceedings. Bunstine\u2019s testimony and arguments throughout this matter have been inconsistent, which belies any claim of truthfulness. For example, Bunstine simultaneously insists that he was not Holdren\u2019s attorney on July 16, 2010, <em>and </em>that he drove to Holdren\u2019s house on July 16, 2010, to get more information to prepare for litigation in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 30} The panel and board recommend that Bunstine be suspended from the practice of law for one year, with six months stayed. Bunstine objects to this sanction, arguing that his conduct was unlike the explicit sexual advances that resulted in harsh sanctions by this court in other cases. We overrule Bunstine\u2019s objection because, as discussed below, our decisions in cases involving similar violations indicate that the recommended sanction is appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 31} When an attorney makes \u201c \u2018unsolicited sexual advances to a client, [the] attorney perverts the very essence of the lawyer-client relationship. Such egregious conduct most certainly warrants discipline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Moore, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 261, 2004-Ohio-734, 804 N.E.2d 423, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Gibson, </em>124 Wis.2d 466, 474-475, 369 N.W.2d 695 (1985). We have issued a wide range of sanctions against attorneys who have solicited their clients, including actual suspension and even disbarment. <em>See Akron Bar Assn. v. Miller, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 1, 2011-Ohio-4412, 955 N.E.2d 359, \u00b6 18 (discussing range of sanctions imposed for this type of misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 32} Sanctions for inappropriate sexual comments or conduct generally range from a six-month to a two-year suspension, with part or all of the suspension stayed, depending on the severity of the misconduct and the aggravating and mitigating factors present. <em>See, e.g., Miller </em>at \u00b6 19-20 (imposing six-month stayed suspension and one year of probation on an attorney who made sexual advances to a client over the telephone but later expressed remorse and sought medical and psychological treatment); <em>Moore </em>at \u00b6 3, 7, 19-20 (imposing one-year suspension, conditionally stayed, and two years of probation on an attorney who had had consensual sex with one client and made graphic sexual comments to another client but later expressed remorse, sought psychological treatment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>submitted character references from local prosecutor and judges); <em>Feneli, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 103-104, 712 N.E.2d 119 (imposing 18-month suspension with six months stayed on an attorney who had had sex with a client and had offered to reduce his legal fees in exchange for sexual acts); <em>Quatman, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 389, 2006-Ohio-1196, 843 N.E.2d 1205, \u00b6 23-24 (imposing one-year stayed suspension and two years of probation on an attorney who had commented on and touched his client\u2019s breasts); <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Williams, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 317, 2004-Ohio-6588, 819 N.E.2d 677, \u00b6 3-6, 16 (imposing two-year suspension with 18 months conditionally stayed on an attorney who had engaged in a sexual relationship with a vulnerable client in lieu of charging her fees for his legal services, then lied about his conduct under oath).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASt\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Heather Hissom Coglianese, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b566-10\">Edward Royal Bunstine, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">{\u00b6 33} Here, the aggravating factors support a sanction in the middle of this range. Bunstine was recently disciplined, and his current misconduct harmed a client in a vulnerable position. We have previously observed that clients who are concerned about child-custody issues \u2014 and especially a client who has a hearing in five days \u2014 are in a particularly vulnerable position. <em>Moore </em>at \u00b6 12; <em>see also Williams </em>at \u00b6 3. And the more vulnerable a client is, \u201cthe heavier is the obligation upon the attorney not to exploit the situation for his own advantage.\u201d <em>Booher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 510, 664 N.E.2d 522. For these reasons, we conclude that an actual suspension is warranted here. However, we decline to sanction Bunstine as severely as attorneys who have engaged in an ongoing pattern of sexual solicitation or activity with one or more clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 34} Accordingly, we suspend Edward Royal Bunstine from the practice of law for a period of one year, with six months stayed on the condition that he commit no further misconduct. Costs are taxed to Bunstine.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b566-8\">O\u2019Neill, J., dissents and would impose an indefinite suspension.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-11\">. In addition, Bunstine seeks to clarify three of the board\u2019s findings. First, he agrees with the board\u2019s finding that Holdren asked him on July 16 what payment arrangements could be made, but he would like that fact supplemented with the fact that Holdren had already been told by a member of Bunstine\u2019s staff that the fee was $500. Second, he asserts that the July 21, 2010 hearing at which he represented Holdren was not continued. Finally, he says that his wife left him on July 16, 2010, not after the July 21, 2010 hearing. None of these clarifications bears on whether Bunstine violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.8(j) and 8.4(h), however.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
