We hold that it must.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-17\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">{112} On August 27, 2009, appellant, Shaun Armstrong, was involved in a motor-vehicle accident while operating a one-ton dump truck within the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>his employment by appellee John R. Jurgensen Company. While stopped at a yield sign on an access ramp to 1-70 east, Armstrong observed a vehicle approaching from behind with increasing speed. Armstrong braced for a collision, afraid he was going to be seriously injured. The approaching vehicle struck the dump truck from behind, pushed it forward, and came to rest \u201cbasically underneath\u201d the dump truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">{\u00b6 3} After the collision, Armstrong was in shock and did not know the extent of his injuries. Looking in his mirror, Armstrong saw the other driver with his head down and observed fluid leaking from the vehicles. Armstrong exited the dump truck, afraid the vehicles would catch fire, and called 9-1-1. Armstrong then noticed that the other driver was not moving and that blood was coming from his nose; he suspected the driver was dead. After being transported to the emergency room, Armstrong was treated for physical injuries and released. He was distressed to learn, while in the emergency room, that the other driver had, in fact, died.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 4} Armstrong filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for his physical injuries, and his claim was allowed for cervical strain, thoracic strain, and lumbar strain. He subsequently requested an additional allowance for posttraumatic-stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). An Industrial Commission staff hearing officer allowed Armstrong\u2019s additional claim, finding his PTSD compensable because it was causally related to his industrial injury and his previously recognized conditions. Jurgensen appealed to the Industrial Commission, which refused the administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 5} After the Industrial Commission refused Jurgensen\u2019s administrative appeal, Jurgensen appealed to the Clark County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. The parties stipulated that Armstrong suffers from PTSD, and the trial court conducted a bench trial to determine Armstrong\u2019s right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 6} Both Armstrong and Jurgensen presented expert testimony regarding the cause of Armstrong\u2019s PTSD. Armstrong presented the videotaped deposition testimony of Jennifer J. Stoeckel, Ph.D., who evaluated Armstrong and diagnosed his PTSD. Dr. Stoeckel testified that Armstrong developed PTSD as a result of the accident and that his physical injuries contributed to and were causal factors in his development of PTSD. Jurgensen, on the other hand, presented the testimony of William L. Howard, Ph.D., who agreed with Dr. Stoeckel that Armstrong suffered from PTSD as a result of the accident, but opined that Armstrong\u2019s physical injuries did not cause his PTSD. Dr. Howard testified that the PTSD was caused by witnessing the accident and \u201cthe mental observation of the severity of the injury, the fatality, [and] the fact that it could have been life-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>threatening to him at some point.\u201d Dr. Howard believed that Armstrong would have developed PTSD even without his physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court held that Armstrong\u2019s PTSD was not compensable, because it did not arise from his physical injuries. The Second District Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the applicable statutory definition of \u201cinjury\u201d includes psychiatric conditions only when they arise from a compensable physical injury. The court of appeals further determined that competent, credible evidence supported the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Armstrong\u2019s PTSD did not arise from his physical injuries. 2011-Ohio-6708, 2011 WL 6884238, \u00b6 39 (2d Dist.).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>Question Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 8} The question before us is whether R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) limits workers\u2019 compensation coverage for psychiatric conditions to those conditions caused by the claimant\u2019s compensable physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 9} The Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 35 vests in the General Assembly the right to establish a workers\u2019 compensation system for the purpose of providing workers and their dependents with compensation for death, injuries, and occupational disease occasioned in the course of employment. Article II, Section 35 \u201cgives the General Assembly the sole authority to determine [workers\u2019 compensation] coverage and to define which occupational injuries will be covered.\u201d <em>McCrone v. Bank One Corp., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-6505, 839 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 34, citing <em>Rambaldo v. Accurate Die Casting, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 281, 288, 603 N.E.2d 975 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">{\u00b6 10} Aside from certain statutory exceptions, R.C. 4123.54(A) provides that every employee who is injured or contracts an occupational disease is entitled to receive compensation for loss sustained on account of the injury or occupational disease. R.C. 4123.01(C) defines \u201cinjury\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation: \u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d Psychiatric conditions are excluded from the general definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cexcept where the claimant\u2019s psychiatric conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease sustained by that claimant.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">{\u00b6 11} This case presents an issue of statutory construction, centering on whether Armstrong\u2019s PTSD qualifies as an \u201cinjury\u201d under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1). Specifically, we must determine what nexus is required between a psychiatric condition and a compensable physical injury for the psychiatric condition to qualify as a compensable injury. Jurgensen maintains that R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>requires a direct and proximate causal relationship between the physical injury and the mental condition, but Armstrong maintains that Ohio courts have always' allowed compensation for mental conditions that arise contemporaneously with physical injury, regardless of a causal relationship between the two. The Ohio Association for Justice (\u201cOAJ\u201d), as amicus curiae, has filed a brief in support of Armstrong\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">{\u00b6 12} A court\u2019s paramount concern in construing a statute is legislative intent. <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, \u00b6 21, citing <em>State ex rel. Steele v. Morrissey, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 355, 2004-Ohio-4960, 815 N.E.2d 1107, \u00b6 21. To discern legislative intent, we first consider the statutory language, reading the words and phrases in context, according to rules of grammar and common usage. R.C. 1.42; <em>State ex rel. Choices for South-Western City Schools v. Anthony, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-5362, 840 N.E.2d 582, \u00b6 40. The court may not delete or insert words, but must give effect to the words the General Assembly has chosen. <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc., </em>91 Ohio St.3d 38, 39-40, 741 N.E.2d 121 (2001). When a statute is unambiguous, a court must apply it as written. <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 4123.95 prescribes that the provisions of R.C. Chapter 4123 \u201cshall be liberally construed in favor of employees.\u201d R.C. 4123.95 does not, however, license alteration of unambiguous statutory language. <em>Kilgore v. Chrysler Corp., </em>92 Ohio St.3d 184, 189, 749 N.E.2d 267 (2001) (Moyer, C.J., dissenting) (\u201cR.C. 4123.95 does not authorize this court to effectively rewrite the statutory system in favor of claimants and their lawyers to assure them favorable results\u201d); <em>Gleich v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 85AP-276,1985 WL 10104, *2 (Aug. 8,1985). The language of R.C. 4123.01(C) is unambiguous, and we must apply it as written. We will not rewrite the statute under the guise of liberal construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 14} Pursuant to the plain language of R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), a claimant must sustain physical injury or occupational disease as a prerequisite to recovering workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a mental condition. A psychiatric condition is not a workers\u2019 compensation injury except when the condition has \u201carisen from an injury or occupational disease sustained by that claimant.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C)(1). R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) \u201cexplicitly codified that \u2018mental-mental\u2019 claims \u2014 psychiatric conditions arising solely from job-related emotional stress \u2014 were not compensable under the system.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>at 44 (Cook, J., dissenting); <em>see also Rambaldo, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 283, 603 N.E.2d 975 (\u201cNo Ohio appellate court has ever recognized a workers\u2019 compensation claim for mental injury or mental disease caused solely by job-related stress which is unaccompanied by physical injury or occupational disease\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Armstrong and OAJ urge this court to adopt a reading of the term \u201cinjury\u201d that embraces the entire episode or accident giving rise to a claimant\u2019s physical injuries. We decline to do so. R.C. 4123.01(C), in its entirety, sets forth a comprehensive definition of \u201cinjury\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation. We must read the term \u201cinjury\u201d in the R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) exception as consistent with the general definition in R.C. 4123.01(C), which focuses on the resulting harm, not on the cause or means underlying the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4123.01(C) requires that an injury be \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d The phrase \u201cin the course of\u2019 relates to the time, place, and circumstances of an injury, and \u201carising out of\u2019 contemplates a causal connection between the injury and the employment. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277-278, 551 N.E.2d 1271 (1990). The \u201cinjury,\u201d however, is distinct from those considerations. While the cause and underlying circumstances are relevant to the question of compensability, once the prerequisites to coverage are met, it is the resultant harm that constitutes the \u201cinjury\u201d received or sustained by the claimant, and it is from that harm that the claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition must arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 17} Beyond requiring physical injury or occupational disease, R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) also defines the required nexus between the physical injury or occupational disease and a corresponding mental condition. As relevant here, to be compensable, the mental condition must have <em>\u201carisen from </em>an injury * * * sustained by th[e] claimant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.01(C)(1). \u201cArisen from,\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), contemplates a causal connection between the mental condition and the claimant\u2019s compensable physical injury. \u201cArise\u201d means \u201cto originate from a specified source[;3 to come into being[;] to become operative.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>117 (1986). \u201cFrom\u201d is \u201ca function word to indicate a starting point: * * * [or] to indicate the source or original or moving force of something as * * * the source, cause, means, or ultimate agent of an action or condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913. Based on the language of R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), the court of appeals held that \u201c[t]o be compensable, a psychiatric condition must have been started by and therefore result from a physical injury or occupational disease the claimant suffered.\u201d 2011-Ohio-6708, 2011 WL 6884238, at \u00b6 35. We agree, reading these terms together in context, that the statute requires a causal connection between a claimant\u2019s physical injury and the claimant\u2019s mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 18} The phrase \u201carisen from\u201d in R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) parallels the language in R.C. 4123.01(C), which states that \u201cinjury\u201d includes any injury \u201creceived in the course of, and <em>arising out of, </em>the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[A]rising out of\u2019 contemplates a causal connection between the injury and the employment. <em>Fisher </em>at 277-278. Armstrong would have us construe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>analogous language in R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) as devoid of a similar causative element, thus setting a broad standard requiring only temporal proximity. We discern no basis for distinction and will not overlook the well-established construction of the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 as relating to causation. The plain language of R.C. 4123.01(C) and (C)(1) requires that to constitute a compensable injury for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, a psychiatric condition must be causally related to the claimant\u2019s compensable physical injury. Accordingly, the statute must be applied as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 19} Despite the plain statutory text, Armstrong maintains that Ohio courts have concluded that under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), psychiatric or psychological conditions with contemporaneous physical injuries are compensable, while psychiatric or psychological conditions without contemporaneous physical injuries are not. Armstrong relies heavily on <em>McCrone, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-6505, 839 N.E.2d 1, which addressed limitations on workers\u2019 compensation coverage for mental conditions in the context of an equal-protection challenge to R.C. 4123.01(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 20} The <em>McCrone </em>claimant applied for workers\u2019 compensation for PTSD, which she developed after two robberies of the bank where she worked as a teller. The claimant suffered no physical injuries in the robberies, and, as a result, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) denied her application for benefits. On appeal, the claimant argued that R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 21} Tracking the statutory language, this court held that \u201cpsychological or psychiatric conditions that do not arise from a compensable physical injury or occupational disease are excluded from the definition of \u2018injury\u2019 under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) and from workers\u2019 compensation coverage.\u201d <em>McCrone </em>at \u00b6 18 and paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>McCrone </em>did not address whether a relationship between the mental condition and the physical injury was necessary because the claimant, unlike Armstrong here, had not suffered a physical injury. Thus, the court considered only whether the requirement of a physical injury or occupational disease in R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) violated equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 22} Based on several sentences in <em>McCrone, </em>Armstrong argues that \u201carisen from\u201d is interchangeable with \u201ccontemporaneous with.\u201d For example, Armstrong cites a portion of the following statement: \u201cThe General Assembly has determined that those who have mental conditions <em>along mth </em>a compensable physical injury or occupational disease are covered within the workers\u2019 compensation system, while those claimants with purely psychiatric or psychological conditions are excluded from coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>McCrone, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-6505, 839 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 30. Elsewhere in <em>McCrone, </em>the court stated that \u201c[psychological or psychiatric conditions, without an <em>accompanying </em>physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>injury or occupational disease, are not compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. Those statements, however, must be read in the larger context of the case, which involved no physical injury at all. The court noted the importance of that factor just prior to those quotations, in its rejection of the appellate court\u2019s reliance on <em>Bailey, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 38, 741 N.E.2d 121, because, unlike in <em>Bailey, </em>\u201c[i]n McCrone\u2019s case, there was no physical injury whatsoever.\u201d <em>McCrone </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>MeCrone, </em>the absence of physical injury, not the nexus between a physical injury and a mental condition, was determinative. In holding that R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) did not violate equal protection, we considered whether there was a rational basis for the General Assembly\u2019s <em>requirement </em>of a physical injury or occupational disease. Because the relationship between mental conditions and physical injuries was not at issue, use of the terms \u201caccompanying\u201d and \u201calong with\u201d to describe that relationship does not constitute a holding that mental conditions arising contemporaneously with a physical injury are compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C) without regard to a causal connection. Likewise, the absence of a specific statement that a mental condition must be <em>caused by </em>the physical injury does not amount to a contrary holding. Instead, it represents this court\u2019s apposite exercise of judicial restraint in not deciding an unnecessary issue. <em>See State ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 246, 2006-Ohio-5202, 855 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 50 (recognizing the cardinal principle that a court must not decide more than is necessary). <em>MeCrone </em>does not answer the question before this court, nor does it compel a different result than we have reached based on the unambiguous statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 24} Like <em>McCrone, </em>the other cases upon which Armstrong relies are not only distinguishable but also silent on the specific question now before this court. <em>Bunger v. Lawson Co., </em>82 Ohio St.3d 463, 696 N.E.2d 1029 (1998), and <em>Rambaldo, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 281, 603 N.E.2d 975, both concerned applications for workers\u2019 compensation coverage for purely psychiatric conditions, when the claimant had not suffered a physical injury. While <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Indus. Comm., </em>92 Ohio St.3d 455, 751 N.E.2d 967 (2001), involved a claimant who suffered both physical injuries and severe stress and anxiety as a direct result of having been held hostage and beaten, the sole issue on appeal was whether the claimant was entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the same period he was receiving hostage-leave benefits under his collective-bargaining contract. Although BWC allowed the claimant\u2019s PTSD as a compensable condition, no party challenged the allowance, and thus the compensability of that condition was not an issue on appeal. Simply put, this court has never held that a mental condition is compensable solely because it developed contemporaneously with a compensable physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Consistent with the plain language of R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), several Ohio courts of appeals have recognized that mental conditions are compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation system only when a physical injury causes them. <em>See Dunn v. Mayfield, </em>66 Ohio App.3d 336, 341, 584 N.E.2d 37 (4th Dist.1990) (\u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted for an emotional disability, an employee must allege either that a physical injury proximately caused the emotional disability * * *' or that the emotional stress proximately caused a physical injury\u201d); <em>Neil v. Mayfield, </em>2d Dist. No. 10881, 1988 WL 76179, * 1 (July 22, 1988), citing <em>Lengel v. Griswold, Inc., </em>8th Dist. No. 53054, 1987 WL 20459 (Nov. 25,1987) (\u201can emotional injury is not compensable, despite a contemporaneous physical injury, unless the physical injury causes the emotional problems\u201d); <em>Karavolos v. Brown Derby, Inc., </em>99 Ohio App.3d 548, 552, 651 N.E.2d 435 (11th Dist.1994) (R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) \u201cprohibits compensation for psychiatric conditions unless they are found to have \u2018arisen from\u2019 a physical injury, <em>i.e., </em>were proximately caused by a physical injury received in the course of employment\u201d); <em>Jones v. Catholic Healthcare Partners, Inc., </em>2012-Ohio-6269, 986 N.E.2d 486, \u00b6 31 (7th Dist.) (rejecting an argument that physical injury must be the sole cause of a mental condition, but affirming summary judgment for a claimant based on the uncontested evidence that a compensable physical injury was a proximate cause of her psychiatric condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">{\u00b6 26} In addition to the arguments asserted by Armstrong, OAJ argues that requiring a claimant to prove a causal connection between a mental condition and a compensable physical injury would make recovery for many claimants \u201cnearly impossible.\u201d While we appreciate and respect OAJ\u2019s concerns regarding the difficulty of proving causation, that argument is more properly addressed to the General Assembly, the branch of state government charged by the Ohio Constitution with making policy choices for the workers\u2019 compensation fund. The General Assembly may determine that mental conditions that develop contemporaneously with compensable physical injuries, or that arise out of the same accident or occurrence as the physical injuries, should be compensable, and amend the statutory language accordingly. Absent a mandate from the General Assembly that such conditions are compensable, however, we will not expand workers\u2019 compensation coverage to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 27} Armstrong\u2019s final argument concerns the effect of the 2006 amendment to R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), which added the following italicized language to the statute: injury does not include \u201c[pjsychiatric conditions except where the <em>claimant\u2019s psychiatric </em>conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease <em>sustained by that claimant.\u201d </em>Am.Sub.S.B. No. 7, 151 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1019, 1046. The parties agree that the purpose of the amendment was to counter the decision in <em>Bailey, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 38, 741 N.E.2d 121, which allowed a claim for depression after the claimant accidentally killed a coworker, even though the claimant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>not suffer any physical injury himself. By amending the statute, the General Assembly clarified that the claimant, not a third party, must sustain the physical injury required under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1). The amendment did not alter the statutory language regarding the necessary nexus between a physical injury and a psychiatric condition, and the sole effect of the amendment here is to preclude Armstrong from establishing the compensability of his PTSD by arguing that it arose from the other driver\u2019s injuries or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals noted Armstrong\u2019s reliance on case law that predated Am.Sub.S.B. No. 7, but it did not suggest that its rejection of Armstrong\u2019s contemporaneous-injury argument was related to the amendment. Rather, the court focused on statutory language that Am.Sub.S.B. No. 7 did not change and concluded that Armstrong did not establish that his PTSD arose from the physical injuries he had sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 29} Armstrong undisputedly suffered compensable physical injuries as a result of the accident, and his PTSD undisputedly arose contemporaneously as a result of the accident. For Armstrong\u2019s PTSD to qualify as a compensable injury under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), however, more is required; he must establish that his PTSD was causally related to his compensable physical injuries and not simply to his involvement in the accident. The record contains contradictory evidence of whether Armstrong\u2019s physical injuries were a contributing cause of his PTSD. Dr. Howard testified that Armstrong\u2019s physical injuries did not cause his PTSD, while Dr. Stoeckel testified that Armstrong\u2019s physical injuries were causal factors in his development of PTSD. The trial court, having heard all the evidence, found Dr. Howard\u2019s testimony more credible. The court of appeals appropriately determined that the record contains competent, credible evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that Armstrong\u2019s physical injuries did not cause his PTSD and that Armstrong\u2019s PTSD is, therefore, not a compensable injury under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 30} For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Kennedy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b350-10\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b350-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0L\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">{\u00b6 31} This case boils down to whether \u201carisen from\u201d means the same thing as \u201ccaused by.\u201d Given that we are required to liberally construe the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>R.C. Chapter 4123 in favor of employees, R.C. 4123.95, I would hold that there is a distinction between the two terms and that the condition in R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) that psychological injuries are compensable only if they have \u201carisen from\u201d physical injuries requires that the physical and psychological injuries be related but does not necessarily require a direct causal link between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>McCrone v. Bank One Corp., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-6505, 839 N.E.2d 1, this court considered whether R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) violated equal protection by excluding psychological or psychiatric injuries from workers\u2019 compensation coverage. This court held that the one substantive reason supporting the continued disparate treatment between workers who suffer psychological injuries in the workplace and workers who suffer physical injuries in the workplace is the issue of proof. That is, it is harder to prove psychological injuries than physical injuries. (The only other rational basis offered in <em>McCrone </em>was that the discrimination saves money.) This court stated, \u201cIn mental injury claims, the problem arises of establishing the existence of the injury itself. <em>Although a physical injury may or may not cause a psychological or psychiatric condition, it may furnish some proof of a legitimate mental claim.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 33} Thus, the court concentrated not on causation, but on the evidence that a contemporaneous physical injury provides that supports the existence of a psychological injury. In this case, we have no issue of proof. Armstrong\u2019s employer <em>stipulates </em>that Armstrong suffers from posttraumatic-stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d), and there is no dispute that the accident occurred while Armstrong was on the clock and performing job-related duties. Armstrong suffered a contemporaneous physical injury, which, in the words of <em>McCrone, </em>may or may not have caused a psychological or psychiatric condition, but furnished proof of that condition. Why shouldn\u2019t Armstrong recover?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 34} Elsewhere in <em>McCrone, </em>this court discounted the requirement of a direct causal link between the physical injury and the compensable psychological trauma. Instead, the physical injury and psychological injury need only have arisen from the same series of events: \u201cPsychological or psychiatric conditions, without an <em>accompanying </em>physical injury or occupational disease, are not compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. This court also stated that \u201cthose who have mental conditions <em>along mth </em>a compensable physical injury * * * are covered within the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. \u201cAccompanying\u201d and \u201calong with\u201d are entirely different from \u201ccaused by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 35} <em>McCrone </em>was decided in 2005; the General Assembly did not make the relevant amendment to R.C. 4123.01(C) until 2006. Thus, the General Assembly knew of this court\u2019s interpretation of the physical-injury requirement for psycho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>logical injuries when amending the statute. The General Assembly knew that this court had written in <em>McCrone </em>that \u201ca physical injury may or may not cause a psychological * * * condition\u201d but may simply furnish proof thereof, that mental conditions are not compensable \u201cwithout an accompanying physical injury,\u201d and that workers \u201cwho have mental conditions along with a compensable physical injury\u201d are covered under the system. Did the General Assembly change the language of the statute to address this court\u2019s interpretation of the statute that there need not be a direct causal connection between a physical injury and a compensable psychological condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">{\u00b6 36} It did not. In neither the present version of the statute nor in its predecessor did R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) require a direct causal connection between physical and psychological injuries. The General Assembly otherwise uses the word \u201ccause\u201d in R.C. 4123.01(C); it uses it in defining \u201cinjury\u201d as including an injury \u201ccaused by external accidental means.\u201d In that same definition, it uses the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 in describing a compensable injury \u2014 the injury must be \u201creceived in the course of, and <em>arising out of, </em>the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In that use of the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d does the General Assembly mean to say that the injury must be <em>caused </em>by the employee\u2019s employment? No \u2014 it means that the employee had to be engaged in activity <em>related </em>to his employment when the injury-causing accident occurred in order to receive compensation. Likewise, R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) allows compensation for psychiatric injuries that have <em>\u201carisen from </em>an injury * * * sustained by that claimant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201carisen from\u201d language has the same meaning as earlier in the statute \u2014 it requires a relationship between the physical and psychological injuries rather than a direct causal link.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc., </em>91 Ohio St.3d 38, 741 N.E.2d 121 (2001), syllabus, this court held, \u201cA psychiatric condition of an employee arising from a compensable injury or an occupational disease suffered by a third party is compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C)(1).\u201d In <em>Bailey, </em>the claimant was operating a tow motor and accidentally ran over and killed a coworker. As a result of the accident, Bailey received treatment for severe depression. In <em>Bailey, </em>there was not a direct causal link between the death suffered by the coworker and the claimant\u2019s depression. Rather, it was Bailey\u2019s involvement in and responsibility for the deadly accident that caused his depression. Thus, his psychological injury was related to the <em>accident </em>that caused his coworker\u2019s death. Likewise, in this case, Armstrong\u2019s psychological injuries are related to the <em>accident </em>that caused his own injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 38} Where does today\u2019s decision leave employees who suffer from PTSD? If an employee is horribly injured in an accident, can he receive compensation only for being depressed over the state of his body but not for psychological injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>due to being haunted by the trauma of the original event? Are those the kind of distinctions the General Assembly really intended \u2014 depression over injuries is compensable but psychological effects arising from the accident causing the traumatic injuries is not? Is it not enough that a worker\u2019s broken body provides the \u201cproof\u2019 of psychological injury that this court said the statute requires in <em>McCrone, </em>proof that a specific traumatic event has occurred? Hasn\u2019t Armstrong paid the required pound of flesh?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, as I set forth in <em>McCrone, </em>I would find that R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions because it allows disparate treatment of persons suffering from psychological injuries. <em>McCrone, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-6505, 839 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 57 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b353-6\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 40} I must respectfully dissent from the well-reasoned majority opinion because this case presents a perfect opportunity to right a wrong in the area of workers\u2019 compensation law. The claimant here was involved in a truly gruesome motor-vehicle accident, in the course and scope of his employment, that left him traumatically psychologically impaired. He witnessed the sudden death of a fellow motorist, and he suffers as a result of that accident to this day. That is what the record reflects. From a legal-analysis standpoint, it is wholly irrelevant whether the psychological condition arose from the accident or from the trauma and drama incident to the allowed physical injuries. Either way, he was injured in the course and scope of his employment. It is that simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 41} As noted by the majority, this issue was addressed, I believe wrongly, to some extent in this court\u2019s earlier decision of <em>McCrone v. Bank One Corp., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 272, 2005-Ohio-6505, 839 N.E.2d 1. In that case, the psychologically injured worker, an employee of a bank that was robbed twice, was denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits because she had not received a contemporaneous physical injury during the traumatic events. That she could not return to work due to having been traumatized at work simply was not enough to entitle her to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 42} Simply stated, the whole theory of workers\u2019 compensation is to ensure that when an injury, whether physical or mental, occurs in the workplace and it is supported by competent medical evidence, it is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. As aptly stated in dissent by Justice Resnick:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">Not only are workers\u2019 compensation claims routinely amended to include psychological injuries resulting from previously allowed physical injuries, but the time has long since passed when denying recoveries for \u201cpurely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>psychological\u201d injuries can be excused on grounds of evidentiary difficulties or illusory claims. We are no longer living in the 19th century when it was considered impossible to accurately diagnose psychological injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 43} On the other hand, if the justification for not allowing psychological injuries is purely economic, drawing the line at psychological injuries that occur simultaneously with a physical injury versus those that occur without a physical injury is arbitrary at best. They are both real injuries. They both result in loss to the worker. And they both are directly related to the incident on the job. As stated by Justice Pfeifer in a dissent in <em>McCrone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">There is no rational basis to treat injured employees differently when both the physically injured and the nonphysically injured employees each can identify the genesis of their psychological condition. A cognizable triggering event, whether resulting in a physical injury or not, is the proper determinant for proof of psychological injury. A professional can evaluate the injury and the event to determine whether compensation is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 44} Reducing government costs, while an admirable goal, is not acceptable when it nullifies the protections of the Ohio Constitution. Justice Resnick asked the question \u201cIs there a specific dollar amount of savings that must be realized before ignoring the Equal Protection Clause is justified?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 50. The answer must be a resounding <em>no. </em>The reality is that there is no constitutionally adequate explanation for the practice of treating psychologically traumatized workers in a distinctly different manner from their counterparts who, for example, break their arm or leg. It is government-sanctioned discrimination with tragic results, as demonstrated by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 45} From an examination of the relevant code section, the conclusion I reach is consistent with the law. R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) allows for psychiatric conditions to be compensable as long as the condition arose from an injury sustained by the claimant. This version of the statute was enacted in 2006 to ensure that compensation was permitted only when the physical injury was sustained by the claimant rather than a third party. However, unlike the majority, I believe it is sufficient that the psychological injury occurred contemporaneously with the physical injury. The record in this matter is clear that the psychological injury happened contemporaneously with the allowed physical injury. Therefore, it was error for the trial court, and then the court of appeals, to disallow the claim. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>happened on the job, it is real, and it is compensable. The Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and the Industrial Commission of Ohio, got it right.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AEq\">Harris <em>&amp; </em>Burgin, L.P.A., and Jeffrey Harris, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b355-7\">Ice Miller L.L.P., Corey V.
