Koustmer, attorney for the defendant, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Pat DeWine from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. B 1103329-1, now pending on an alleged community-control-sanction violation in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">{\u00b6 2} Koustmer alleges that Judge DeWine is biased and prejudiced against defendant Neeco McCants. This bias, according to Koustmer, has resulted in Judge DeWine\u2019s forming a \u201cconclusion of guilt\u201d prior to the hearing on McCants\u2019s alleged community-control violation; \u201cusurping] the authority of the probation officer\u201d by pursuing the community-control violation after the probation department had decided to dismiss it; and infringing upon McCants\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge DeWine has responded in writing to the concerns in the affidavit, offering a detailed account of his handling of the underlying case. Judge DeWine contends that he \u201ccan proceed in this case without prejudice or bias\u201d and that McCants will be \u201cprovided a fair and impartial\u201d community-control-revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established for ordering the disqualification of Judge DeWine.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-16\">Background of the Underlying Case</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">{\u00b6 5} In July 2011, Judge DeWine placed McCants on community control for a period of two years following a guilty plea to a charge of attempting to carry a concealed weapon. On March 29, 2012, McCants was indicted on a separate charge for carrying a concealed weapon, and Judge DeWine was also assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>hear that case. On April 5, 2012, a community-control-sanction violation was filed against McCants in the original case, based on the new indictment. Judge DeWine continued the hearing on the community-control violation until after the trial on the new charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">{\u00b6 6} That trial occurred on June 5, 2012, and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the single charge of carrying a concealed weapon. However, during presentation of the evidence, two police officers testified that they had observed McCants and others huddled around a small bag in a driveway. As the officers approached, McCants ran away and a gun fell out of his pants. One of the officers caught McCants, and McCants threw a bag of marijuana on the ground. Immediately following the jury verdict, Judge DeWine asked counsel for the prosecution whether he would move forward with the community-control violation. The assistant county prosecutor answered: \u2018Yeah, we probably want to add the marijuana that was found on him and things like that to the probation violation.\u201d Judge DeWine subsequently set the community-control-revocation hearing for June 19, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 7} According to Koustmer, prior to the June 19 hearing, he spoke to the county prosecutor and a representative from the Hamilton County Probation Department, who both indicated that they would dismiss the community-control violation. This appears to be confirmed by the transcript of the June 19 hearing, which begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">The Court: Good morning. All right. We\u2019re here today for a probation violation. Anything from the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">Mr. Vick: No, Your Honor. The original charge is Rule 2, carrying a concealed weapon. The probation department declined to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">The Court: Why is that, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">Mr. Vick: He didn\u2019t tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">The Court: Before I dismiss it, I want to see the probation officer in here. Who is the probation officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">Mr. Vick: Nick Kern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">The Court: Tell him I want to see him here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">{\u00b6 8} According to Judge DeWine, the probation officer appeared shortly thereafter, and \u201cthe Court and defense counsel were informed that the State and probation department still wished to proceed with an amended probation violation.\u201d At that time, the parties and the court went back on the record, and the probation department indicated that it would amend the community-control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>violation to include allegations relating to the police officers\u2019 testimony from the separate trial. Judge DeWine allowed a continuance, and the probation department subsequently filed the amended community-control violation, which included the new allegations of marijuana possession, foot pursuit from a police officer, and trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 9} Koustmer thereafter filed two motions to dismiss the amended violation, arguing that the amendment violates the Rules of Criminal Procedure and disrespects the jury\u2019s decision and the grand jury\u2019s decision \u2014 the grand jury had previously ignored these same allegations by refusing to indict McCants on these charges. Judge DeWine denied the motions to dismiss and set the matter for a full hearing on the amended community-control violation. Koustmer subsequently filed this affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Merits of the Affidavit of Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 10} Koustmer\u2019s affidavit lists several allegations of bias and prejudice, which can be grouped into four main categories: (1) Judge DeWine has prejudged McCants\u2019s guilt on the amended community-control violation, (2) Judge DeWine \u201cusurped\u201d the authority of the probation department by pursuing the community-control violation after the department had decided to dismiss it, (3) Judge DeWine is biased and prejudiced against McCants because he presided over the trial on the separate carrying-a-concealed-weapon charge, and (4) Judge DeWine\u2019s actions have violated McCants\u2019s constitutional rights. None of these allegations, however, are sufficient to warrant disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">\n<em>Alleged prejudgment of the issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">{\u00b6 11} Koustmer claims that Judge DeWine has prejudged McCants\u2019s guilt on the amended community-control violation based on two of Judge DeWine\u2019s comments at the June 19 hearing. First, Koustmer points to the following passage, in which Judge DeWine is responding to Koustmer\u2019s request to dismiss the probation department\u2019s motion to amend the violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">At this point, he has been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon. He has been acquitted \u2014 excuse me \u2014 of carrying a concealed weapon; however, there was substantial evidence introduced and that is uncontroverted, that he violated at least some of the laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">The probation department wishes to amend the charge. Pm not sure whether it makes any difference whether it\u2019s continued or dismissed and then a new charge is filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">But I think in this case, the most appropriate thing is to deal with all of those issues at once, and so * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Second, Koustmer claims that the following statement by Judge DeWine similarly demonstrates that he had predetermined McCants\u2019s guilt: \u201cMr. Koustmer, do you want \u2014 Count 2 says that he would obey all laws. There\u2019s clear testimony that he did not obey all laws, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 13} According to Judge DeWine, he made these comments when deciding that \u201cthere was a sufficient evidentiary basis to allow amendment of the probation violation rather than the dismissal sought by Mr. Koustmer.\u201d Judge DeWine repeatedly states throughout his response to Koustmer\u2019s affidavit that he has not expressed any opinion or made \u201cany decision as to Mr. McCants\u2019 guilt or innocence\u201d and that at the eventual revocation hearing, McCants may \u201cpresent whatever evidence he deems appropriate\u201d and \u201csubpoena and examine any witnesses he feels are appropriate.\u201d Finally, Judge DeWine states that he has \u201cevery confidence that Mr. McCants will be provided a fair and impartial trial.\u201d {\u00b6 14} The term \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d \u201cimplies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will * * * with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). In addition, bias or prejudice on the part of the judge will not be presumed. \u201c \u2018In fact, the law presumes that a judge is unbiased and unprejudiced in the matters over which he presides, and bias or prejudice must be strong enough to overcome the presumption of his integrity.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 16, quoting 48A Corpus Juris Secundum, Judges, Section 108, at 731 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 15} Koustmer has failed to overcome those presumptions here, because the two comments do not demonstrate that Judge DeWine has a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d about the alleged community-control violation. Judge DeWine may have formed an initial opinion from evidence presented at the earlier trial, but judges often form conditional opinions about a case during preliminary matters. It is well settled that the formation of these conditional opinions does not counter the presumption of the judge\u2019s ability to preside fairly and impartially over future proceedings. <em>In re Disqualification of Horvath, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1247, 2004-Ohio-7356, 826 N.E.2d 305, \u00b6 8; <em>In re Disqualification of Brown, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1250, 1251, 657 N.E.2d 1353 (1993). Further, Judge DeWine asserts that the comments were made only to support his decision allowing the amendment of the community-control-violation charge, and McCants will have the opportunity to present evidence to dispute the probation department\u2019s claims at a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d revocation hearing. Because nothing in the record contradicts Judge DeWine\u2019s assurances, there is no clear existence of a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment.\u201d Disqualification is therefore not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>\n<em>Judge DeWine\u2019s conduct allegedly \u201cusurping\u201d the authority of the probation department</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 16} Koustmer next alleges that Judge DeWine \u201cusurped the authority of the probation officer\u201d by pursuing the community-control sanction after the probation department had indicated a desire to dismiss the pending violation. Koustmer similarly alleges that Judge DeWine \u201csinglehandedly converted\u201d the community-control-violation claim to include the additional offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 17} In response, Judge DeWine states that to the best of his knowledge, Koustmer\u2019s claim that the prosecution and probation department desired to dismiss the sanction \u201cis <em>not </em>factually correct.\u201d According to Judge DeWine, the prosecutor indicated his desire to amend the community-control violation immediately after the June 5 trial. At the beginning of the June 19 hearing on the community-control violation, a probation officer \u201cwho had not been previously assigned to the case and who apparently had no knowledge of the case\u201d was present. Accordingly, Judge DeWine requested that the probation officer assigned to the case appear in his courtroom, and after he did, \u201cthe Court and defense counsel were informed that the State and probation department still wished to proceed with an amended probation violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 18} Koustmer is making a serious allegation of misconduct against Judge DeWine \u2014 i.e., Judge DeWine somehow pressured or urged the probation department to amend the community-control-violation charge against its wishes. In an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) (requiring an affiant to include specific allegations of bias, prejudice, or disqualifying interest and the facts to support those allegations). Accordingly, the affiant is often required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit itself supporting the allegations contained therein. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Crow, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 1209, 741 N.E.2d 137 (2000) (denying an affidavit when an affiant failed to provide supporting affidavits from participants in allegedly improper conversations). Yet Koustmer offers no third-party affidavits or any other compelling evidence to support his claims of \u201cusurpation,\u201d other than the June 19 hearing transcript. In contrast, Judge DeWine has provided the June 5 trial transcript showing that the prosecutor expressly stated that he would \u201cprobably want to add the marijuana that was found on him and things like that to the probation violation.\u201d Further, Judge DeWine thoroughly explains why he requested the presence of the probation officer at the June 19 hearing, and he explains what occurred when the parties were off the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 19} While the transcript from the June 19 hearing certainly demonstrates indecision and confusion on the part of the probation department, the record here does not demonstrate that Judge DeWine pressured the probation department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>into amending the claim of a community-control violation. In light of Judge DeWine\u2019s explanation, Koustmer\u2019s vague, unsubstantiated, and speculative allegations are insufficient evidence to warrant judicial disqualification. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation * * * are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Cacioppo, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1245, 674 N.E.2d 356 (1996) (\u201cThe hearsay allegations of the affiant will not stand in the face of an affirmative denial by the trial judge of substantive ex parte contacts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">{\u00b6 20} In addition, an element of Koustmer\u2019s allegation is that Judge DeWine is biased because he permitted the probation department to amend the violation, even though such an amendment allegedly violates the Rules of Criminal Procedure. However, an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. A party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. Trial judges are entitled to exercise discretion in ruling on many matters, and it is not the chief justice\u2019s role in deciding an affidavit of disqualification to second-guess each ruling. The remedy for these and other legal claims, if any, lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\n<em>Judge DeWine\u2019s participation in the separate trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 21} Koustmer also alleges that Judge DeWine is biased and prejudiced \u201cby virtue of having presided over [McCants\u2019s] Carrying Concealed Weapons trial.\u201d However, absent a showing of actual bias, the mere fact that a judge presided over prior proceedings involving one or more of the parties presently before him is not sufficient to warrant disqualifying that judge from presiding over a subsequent proceeding involving the same parties. <em>See State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 57 (\u201cA trial judge is not disqualified simply because he acquired knowledge of the facts during a prior proceeding\u201d); <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 616 N.E.2d 909 (1993) (\u201cA judge need not recuse himself simply because he acquired knowledge of the facts during a prior proceeding\u201d). Thus, Judge DeWine is not disqualified merely because he presided over McCants\u2019s June 2012 trial on the separate charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>\n<em>Alleged constitutional violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">(\u00b6 22} Throughout his affidavit, Koustmer alleges that Judge DeWine \u201chas and will discount the mandates of substantive due process as required by the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d An affidavit of disqualification, however, is not the appropriate vehicle for determining whether a judge has violated a party\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>In re Disqualification of Griffin, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1219, 2003-Ohio-7356, 803 N.E.2d 820, \u00b6 8-9. Koustmer has other legal remedies available to his client to challenge Judge DeWine\u2019s actions, including appeal. Koustmer may not litigate these issues in an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 23} The statutory right to seek disqualification is an \u201cextraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 24} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge DeWine.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
