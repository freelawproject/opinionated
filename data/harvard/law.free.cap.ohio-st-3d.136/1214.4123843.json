Conley, counsel for trustee Joan E. Collier, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Dixie Park from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 195704 and from all future cases involving Conley.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">{\u00b6 2} Conley claims that in the underlying probate matter, Judge Park has exhibited bias against him and Collier. Conley also claims that Judge Park has a bias against him \u201carising from other unrelated Stark County Probate Court cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Park has responded in writing to the allegations in Conley\u2019s affidavit. She disclaims any personal bias against Conley and affirms that she is able to preside fairly and impartially in the current matter and all future cases involving Conley.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>\n<em>In re Testamentary Trust of Kathleen B. Conley</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 5} On April 22, 2013, the Fifth District Court of Appeals held that Judge Park had abused her discretion by sua sponte vacating a previous entry approving trustee Collier\u2019s partial account. <em>See In re Testamentary Trust of Conley, </em>5th Dist. No. 2012-CA-00133, 2013-Ohio-1631, 2013 WL 1737856, \u00b6 18. Judge Park claimed that she vacated the account\u2019s prior approval to \u201ccorrect a clerical error\u201d under Civ.R. 60(A), but the appeals court found that she \u201cwent beyond the scope of merely correcting a clerical mistake\u201d and \u201csubstantively changed\u201d her previous approval of the account, which required reversal of the judge\u2019s sua sponte entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his affidavit, Conley speculates that because there was no \u201cclerical error\u201d to correct, as Judge Park had claimed, she \u201cmust have a bias or prejudice\u201d against Collier and Conley. Conley also claims that Judge Park\u2019s failure to rule on Collier\u2019s application for trustee fees further demonstrates bias. It is well established, however, that a judge\u2019s opinion of law, even if later found erroneous, is not by itself evidence of bias or prejudice and therefore not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Kimmel, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 602, 522 N.E.2d 456 (1987); <em>see also In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1249, 2012-Ohio-6336, 986 N.E.2d 10, \u00b6 8 (appeals court holding that trial court abused its discretion does not itself demonstrate bias or prejudice). Similarly, a judge\u2019s inaction on a pending motion is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion and is not evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Eyster, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1246, 2004-Ohio-7350, 826 N.E.2d 304, \u00b6 4. Procedures exist by which appellate courts may review \u2014 and, as here, correct \u2014 rulings made by trial courts. Because nothing in the appeals court opinion indicates that Judge Park\u2019s decision was the product of bias or prejudice against Conley or Collier, Conley\u2019s affidavit pertaining to the underlying proceeding is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Conley\u2019s requested blanket order of disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 7} Conley also claims that Judge Park has a bias against him arising from unrelated cases, and therefore she should be removed from all cases involving Conley. Conley, however, has failed to establish the need for a blanket order of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 8} First, Conley claims that Judge Park has repeatedly referred to him as \u201cthe devil incarnate.\u201d Conley has not explained to whom or when Judge Park allegedly made this statement, and Judge Park flatly denies referring to Conley in such a way. On this record, Conley\u2019s vague and unsubstantiated allegation\u2014 especially in the face of a clear denial by Judge Park \u2014 is insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (\u201cvague, unsubstantiated allegations of the affidavit are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Second, Conley claims that he previously drafted two affidavits of disqualification against Judge Park, resulting in her voluntary recusal from the underlying cases. In response, Judge Park acknowledges recusing herself from those two cases, but she further claims that there was no indication that Conley drafted or was otherwise involved in the filing of the affidavits of disqualification. Both affidavits were filed pro se and did not indicate Conley\u2019s participation as counsel, and Conley was not counsel of record for the affiants in the underlying cases. Moreover, Judge Park states that in each case, her decision to recuse had nothing to do with Conley.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 10} Conley has not established that Judge Park was aware of his involvement in the two previous affidavit-of-disqualifieation cases, and even if she had been aware, Conley has not established that his involvement contributed to the judge\u2019s decision to recuse. More importantly, Conley has not shown how these previous affidavit cases show an ongoing judicial bias against him. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence and argument demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). \u201c[I]t is well established that a judge\u2019s voluntary removal from an earlier case does not, by itself, support disqualification from an unrelated case involving that same party or attorney.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Celebrezze, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1218, 2012-Ohio-6304, 985 N.E.2d 499, \u00b6 7. Without more, these previous affidavit-of-disqualification cases do not support a claim of bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 11} Third, Conley claims that since September 2011, he has been forced to file two extraordinary-writ actions against Judge Park: (1) a public-records mandamus case, which Conley voluntarily dismissed after Judge Park complied with his records request, and (2) a procedendo action, in which Conley was successful. Conley further asserts that Judge Park failed to timely follow the appellate court\u2019s writ of procedendo, which in turn caused Conley to file a motion to show cause against the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[A] judge will not be disqualified solely because a litigant in a case pending before the judge has filed a lawsuit against the judge.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Pokomy, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1268, 2013-Ohio-915, 986 N.E.2d 993, \u00b64. But even more important here, Judge Park has thoroughly explained her actions relating to the two writ cases. For example, Judge Park states that her delay in responding to Conley\u2019s public-records request was due to court-equipment issues, and when the probate court procured the necessary equipment, she responded to the request. Similarly, Judge Park explains why she issued the stay that led to the procedendo action. While the appeals court ultimately did not agree with Judge Park\u2019s decision issuing the stay, the judge\u2019s legal opinion is not evidence of bias against Conley. <em>See In re Disqualification of Light, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 604, 522 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>N.E.2d 458 (1988) (\u201calleged errors of law or procedure are legal issues subject to appeal and are not grounds for disqualification\u201d). Further, Judge Park states that following the remand from the appellate court, the matter was rescheduled for hearing in less than 30 days; therefore, Conley\u2019s claim that the judge disregarded the appellate court\u2019s order is not credible. Based on this record, no reasonable observer would question Judge Park\u2019s impartiality based on her conduct in these two writ cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy * * <em>In re Disqualification of Hunter, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 607, 522 N.E.2d 461 (1988). The significance of that remedy is heightened here because Conley, an admittedly \u201cactive practitioner and litigator in Stark County,\u201d seeks a blanket order of disqualification. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Conley has failed to submit compelling evidence to overcome those presumptions, and therefore he has failed to establish an appearance of impropriety warranting a blanket order of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 14} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Park.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
