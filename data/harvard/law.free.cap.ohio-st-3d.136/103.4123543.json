As part of an educational regional service system, its purpose is to provide support to state and local educational initiatives and to improve school effectiveness and student achievement. R.C. 3312.01(A). An ESC provides services to school districts and community schools by contract and by statute. R.C. 3312.01(A) and (C); Hastings, Manoloff, Sharb, Sheeran &amp; Jaffe, <em>Baldwin\u2019s Ohio School Law, </em>Section 4.5, 44-45 (2011-2012 Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 5} Jefferson County ESC works with administrators, teachers, and students in seven local school districts. In 2001, school superintendents in some of those schools were concerned over the depletion of resources in their districts caused by the loss of students recruited to \u201ccommunity schools,\u201d also known as \u201ccharter schools,\u201d which were authorized by the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of R.C. Chapter 3314 in 1997. 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 909, 1187. <em>See State ex rel. Ohio Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers v. State Bd. of Edn., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 568, 2006-Ohio-5512, 857 N.E.2d 1148, \u00b6 1, 6. The superintendents believed that it was necessary to research \u201conline curriculum options\u201d that could be used to compete with charter schools, and Jefferson County ESC began looking at a \u201cvirtual learning academy\u201d that was being used by another district.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 6} A \u201cvirtual learning academy\u201d or \u201cVLA\u201d is an \u201cinternet-based educational delivery system designed for K-12, providing alternative educational options for credit deficiencies, alternative programs, home schooling, home bound instruction, and 2002 summer school programs.\u201d A VLA is not a school; it is an \u201ceducational option,\u201d like \u201cdistance learning,\u201d which involves \u201csystematic instruction in which the instructor and/or student participate by mail or electronic media.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3301-35-01(B)(10)(a) (including \u201cdistance learning\u201d as an \u201ceducational option\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 7} After researching the market, Jefferson County ESC determined that the best on-line curriculum was available through a California vendor, Learning Springs. Jefferson County ESC passed a resolution to partner with Learning Springs and then marketed its own VLA to local school districts and, eventually, districts around the state. But as the program proved more successful in enrolling students, concerns arose over the curriculum\u2019s failure to fully align with Ohio\u2019s state academic-content standards. In 2003, Jefferson County ESC hired teachers to rewrite the curriculum so that it would fully align with state standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Although we are not aware of any reported case in the state or federal courts that addresses the specific question with which we are confronted, we are aware that \u201ccyber schools\u201d and curriculum options like the VLA are increasing in America. A number of states include virtual learning as a form of public education. <em>See generally </em>Browning, <em>Will Residency Be Relevant to Public Education in the Twenty-First </em>Century?, 8 Pierce L.Rev. 297, 338-339 (2010). Indeed, cyber schools are an increasingly popular, and rapidly growing, addition to the education community. There were only 60 \u201cvirtual\u201d or \u201ccyber\u201d charter schools in America in 2003, but by 2009, more than 100,000 students were enrolled in 195 virtual schools in 26 states. Brady, Umpstead &amp; Eckles, <em>Unchartered Territory: The Current Legal Landscape of Public Cyber Charter Schools, </em>2010 B.Y.U.Educ. &amp; L.Rev. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 9} Ohio is at the forefront of this development. \u201cIn 2003, Ohio had only six cyber charter schools. Since 2003, Ohio has officially granted charters for the opening of thirty-nine additional cyber charter schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, fn. 19. As of April 2008, the VLA served 22,000 students in 180 school districts in Ohio.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 10} The instructors in this case were hired to instruct students in the VLA. Each instructor can serve hundreds of students in a given year.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 11} If a school district decides to use the VLA as part of its own curriculum, that district decides whether to use its own faculty or the VLA staff. If the school district decides to use VLA staff, Jefferson County \u201cmatches\u201d the students to one of the VLA instructors. Jefferson County receives a participation fee of $175 per student for its role and \u201cpasses through\u201d the pay VLA instructors receive, which is $105 per student per semester, or $210 per student for a full (two-semester) academic year.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 12} In order to obtain that pay, VLA instructors submit a stipend form to Jefferson County ESC when a student completes a course or the student\u2019s license expires. If the school district withdraws a student from a VLA course, Jefferson County ESC pays the instructor on a prorated basis for the number of units of the course the student completes.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 13} As VLA instructors, Nese, Williams, and Miles did not have contracts with Jefferson County. Rather, they signed a form provided by Jefferson County that stated that they agreed \u201cto be on board to take on VLA students.\u201d As VLA instructors, they did not receive health insurance or other fringe benefits from Jefferson County ESC. However, most VLA instructors are full-time teachers working in classrooms. Nese and Williams served as teachers in local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>school districts and thus received health insurance and other benefits through their traditional teaching jobs. And Miles retired as a teacher at the end of the 2008-2009 school year and likely received those benefits through her retirement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 14} Nese, Williams, and Miles were entitled to a great deal of latitude in their day-to-day work. For example, VLA instructors were authorized to create their own midterm and final examinations or to use on-line lessons as the examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 15} They were also free, as were other VLA instructors, to choose when and where they did their work. Jefferson County did not set specific times at which they were required to instruct or deadlines by which the work had to be completed. And although Jefferson County offered a place to work for teachers and students who do not have access to a computer, the VLA instructors were not required to teach there. In fact, most of the VLA instructors worked at home or at a public library and often did so after typical school hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 16} Jefferson County ESC initially considered its VLA instructors to be independent contractors rather than employees. Consequently, it did not deduct contributions to pay into the retirement system. Eventually, however, Jefferson County ESC decided to treat its VLA instructors as employees and withheld contributions accordingly. Thus, for example, in 2004, Williams received a 1099 form from Jefferson County for his work instructing in the VLA, but for 2005 through 2009, he received W-2 forms. Other instructors also received 1099 forms initially and subsequently received W-2s.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 17} In November 2008, the STRS determined that the VLA instructors were independent contractors instead of employees. It refunded all contributions made by Jefferson County ESC on the VLA instructors\u2019 behalf. Thereafter, Jefferson County ESC adopted a resolution specifying duties for its VLA faculty, including the general duties of \u201clogging into the system on a daily basis to grade student\u2019s work, answering student\u2019s questions, providing feedback to students, providing structure to students, and outlining expectations to students.\u201d And Nese, Williams, and Miles were given performance evaluations after the STRS\u2019s decision that they were independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 18} In December 2009, Nese, Williams, and Miles filed an action in the Tenth District Court of Appeals challenging the STRS\u2019s decision. In their amended complaint, Nese, Williams, and Miles sought writs of mandamus to compel Jefferson County ESC to make the requisite employer contributions to the retirement system for their VLA instruction and to compel the STRS to accept employer and employee contributions based on their work for the VLA and to include their VLA compensation in calculating their final average salary for retirement purposes. In so doing, the VLA instructors were seeking inclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>sion of their compensation as VLA instructors into the calculation of their final annual salary for retirement purposes. The amounts are significant: the instructors allege that the compensation from working in the VLA ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars and reached as high as $66,324 for one instructor.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">{\u00b6 19} On December 29, 2011, the court of appeals denied the writ. The court held that there was some evidence to support the STRS\u2019s finding that the VLA instructors were independent contractors. Nese, Williams, Miles, and Jefferson County ESC appealed to this court. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>Mandamus and the Applicable Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 20} The instructors seek extraordinary relief, mandamus, to compel the STRS to accept retirement-system contributions for their work while instructing for Jefferson County ESC. To be entitled to the requested relief, Nese, Williams, and Miles must establish a clear legal right to be recognized as members of the retirement system for their VLA work, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the STRS to treat them as retirement-system members and to accept contributions for their VLA work, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel.

Ohio Dept. of Edn., </em>123 Ohio St.3d 35, 2009-Ohio-4084, 913 N.E.2d 977, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 21} Notably, the instructors must establish their entitlement to the writ by clear and convincing evidence. <em>State ex rel. Wasserman v. Fremont, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 52, 2012-Ohio-27, 960 N.E.2d 449, \u00b6 4. In other words, the instructors must present evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">is more than a mere \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d but not to the extent of such certainty as is required \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in criminal cases, and [that] will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-10\"><em>State ex rel.

Ledford, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 22} We begin our analysis with the propriety of mandamus relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe General Assembly established the State Teachers Retirement System to pay retirement allowances and other benefits to public school teachers, and the State Teachers Retirement Board administers and manages the retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ment system.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. of Ohio, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 324, 2009-Ohio-591, 904 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 19, citing R.C. 3307.03 and 3307.04. The determination of whether any person is a teacher, and thus a member of the retirement system, is solely within the province of the retirement board. <em>See </em>R.C. 3307.01(B) (\u201cIn all cases of doubt, the state teachers retirement board shall determine whether any person is a teacher, and its decision shall be final\u201d). .</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 24} Because the retirement board\u2019s final decision whether a person is a teacher and thus a member of the retirement system is not appealable, Nese, Williams, and Miles lack an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Thus, mandamus is available to the instructors if they show that the STRS abused its discretion in making its determination. <em>See State ex rel. Hulls v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. of Ohio, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 438, 2007-Ohio-2337, 866 N.E.2d 483, \u00b6 27 (applying abuse-of-discretion standard to the retirement board\u2019s determination concerning disability-retirement benefits); <em>State ex rel. Schaengold v. Ohio Pub. Emps.

Stiles v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-2140, 807 N.E.2d 353, \u00b6 13. Thus, \u201c \u2018[a]s long as there is sufficient evidence to support [a] retirement-system board\u2019s decisions, we will not disturb them.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Marchiano v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 139, 2009-Ohio-307, 902 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 21, quoting <em>State ex rel. Grein v. Ohio State Hwy.

As we stated in <em>Schaengold,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">[A] \u201cclear legal right to a writ of mandamus exists when the board is found to have abused its discretion by entering an order that is not supported by some evidence.\u201d <em>[State ex rel.

Foley v. Vulcan Mfg. Co., </em>84 Ohio St.3d 59, 60, 701 N.E.2d 993 (1998) (because there was \u201csome evidence on which the [Industrial Commission] could rely\u201d in denying benefits, the court \u201ccannot disturb the commission\u2019s decision\u201d), citing <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc., </em>31 Ohio St.3d 18, 508 N.E.2d 936 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 28} Deference is always due in an abuse-of-discretion case. But it is particularly important when, as here, we are presented with conflicting evidence on whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. In cases in which a worker presents some evidence that he is an employee rather than an independent contractor, the question becomes one of fact that should be decided by the fact-finder. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Laird, </em>126 Ohio St. 617,186 N.E. 718 (1933), paragraph three of the syllabus. <em>See also Bostic v. Connor, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 144, 145-146, 524 N.E.2d 881 (1988) (the question whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor becomes a jury question when the worker presents some evidence that he is an employee). We are mindful that the STRS is the finder of fact in this matter, as well as an adjudicator highly knowledgeable about Ohio\u2019s teachers, their work, and their pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 29} Having set forth the applicable standards, we proceed with our analysis of the dispositive issue in this appeal: whether some evidence supported the STRS\u2019s decision that Nese, Williams, and Miles were independent contractors of Jefferson County ESC rather than employees of Jefferson County ESC.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\n<em>R.C. 3307.01(B): Definition of \u201cTeacher\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 30} Under Ohio law, public-school teachers and their employers must make contributions to the retirement fund. R.C. 3307.26 and 3307.28. As relevant to this case, R.C. 3307.01(B)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defines \u201cteacher\u201d for purposes of retirement-system membership as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">(1) Any person paid from public funds and employed in the public schools of the state under any type of contract described in section 3311.77 or 3319.08 of the Revised Code in a position for which the person is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>required to have a license issued pursuant to sections 3319.22 to 3319.31 of the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">(5) Any other teacher or faculty member employed in any school, college, university, institution, or other agency wholly controlled and managed, and supported in whole or in part, by the state or any political subdivision thereof, including Central state university, Cleveland state university, and the university of Toledo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 31} In construing statutory provisions, including R.C. 3307.01(B), our paramount concern is the legislative intent. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Grace, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 471, 2009-Ohio-5934, 918 N.E.2d 135, \u00b6 25. \u201cAn axiom of statutory construction is that \u2018[w]ords * * * that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoffman v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 376, 2007-Ohio-2201, 865 N.E.2d 1259, \u00b6 26, quoting R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 3307.01(B)(1) and (5) require that individuals must be employees to be \u201cteachers\u201d \u2014 and thus covered by the retirement system\u2019s pension plan. But the STRS determined that Nese, Williams, and Miles were not \u201cteachers,\u201d because they were independent contractors rather than employees when they worked as VLA instructors for Jefferson County ESC. We thus turn to the legal tests for distinguishing an employee from an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>Common Law: Distinguishing Employees from Independent Contractors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cThe chief test in determining whether one is an employee or an independent contractor is the right to control the manner or means of performing the work.\u201d <em>Bobik v. Indus. Comm., </em>146 Ohio St. 187, 64 N.E.2d 829 (1946), paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>See also Foran v. Fisher Foods, Inc., </em>17 Ohio St.3d 193, 194, 478 N.E.2d 998 (1985) (holding that \u201cone who exercises day-to-day control over the employee will be considered as the employer\u201d). \u201cIf such right is in the employer, the relationship is that of employer and employee; but if the manner or means of performing the work is left to one responsible to the employer for the result alone, an independent contractor relationship is created.\u201d <em>Pusey v. Bator, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 275, 279, 762 N.E.2d 968 (2002), citing <em>Bobik </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 34} In so holding, however, we have recognized that as a practical matter, every contract for work reserves to the employer a certain degree of control to enable him to ensure that the contract is performed according to specifications. <em>Gillum v. Indus. Comm., </em>141 Ohio St. 373, 382, 48 N.E.2d 234 (1943). Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>have distinguished on the continuum of control whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cThe control of the work reserved in the employer which effects a master-servant relationship is control of the means and manner of performance of the work, as well as of the result; an independent contractor relationship exists where the person doing the work is subject to the will of the employer only as to the result, but not as to the means or manner of accomplishment. Thus, a person employed to perform certain work is not necessarily a mere servant because the contract provides that the work shall be subject to the approval or satisfaction of the employer. Such a provision is not an assumption by the employer of the right to control the person employed as to the details or method of doing the work, but is only a provision that the employer may see that the contract is carried out according to the plans.\u201d See also, 21 Ohio Jurisprudence, 626, Section 4; <em>Miller v.

They did not receive health insurance or other fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>{\u00b6 38} They set their own work hours and could create their own examinations. They did not use Jefferson County ESC\u2019s facilities to perform their work. They were not required to instruct a specific number of students or courses.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">{\u00b6 39} The instructors were paid \u201cstipends,\u201d which were flat fees per student. Two of them initially received 1099 forms instead of W-2 forms for tax purposes because Jefferson County ESC originally considered them to be independent contractors rather than employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 40} We have relied on comparable factors in upholding a public employee retirement board\u2019s determination that persons are independent contractors rather than public employees entitled to retirement-system membership and benefits. <em>See, e.g., Schaengold, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 147, 2007-Ohio-3760, 870 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 20-21 (factors included that attorney serving as a temporary magistrate pursuant to a bilateral contract was paid a flat fee, was not eligible for employee fringe benefits, was not controlled or supervised in conducting hearings or in issuing decisions, and received a form 1099 for tax purposes). Similarly, the courts of appeals have found, on similar facts, that a person was an independent contractor rather than an employee. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Curtin v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-801, 2011-Ohio-2536, 2011 WL 2112498, \u00b6 28 (assistant city income tax administrator was paid a fee for services, did not receive fringe benefits, provided many of his own supplies, and received form 1099 for tax purposes); <em>State ex rel. Peyton v. Schumacher, </em>10th Dist. No. 00AP-78, 2000 WL 1715901, *2 (person who hauled gravel for two townships did not maintain regular hours, did not receive fringe benefits, was paid by the amount hauled and not an hourly wage or salary, and provided his own truck for hauling).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 41} The instructors rely on evidence of a resolution setting forth duties for VLA instructors and performance evaluations completed for Nese, Williams, and Miles, all of which were drafted <em>after </em>the STRS decided that the instructors were independent contractors and not employees entitled to retirement-system membership. The instructors\u2019 argument is not persuasive, given that the STRS was not presented with this information prior to rendering its decisions. The STRS could not have abused its discretion based on evidence that was never presented to it. <em>See Marchiano, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 139, 2009-Ohio-307, 902 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 25 (applying this general rule to a determination by the School Employees Retirement System). Notably, even the general duties for VLA instructors listed in the resolution are directed to the basic rules of the work to be performed (e.g., logging onto the system daily to grade students\u2019 work and answering students\u2019 questions) rather than to subjective decisions about the quality or substance of the work itself (e.g., directing the actual grading and answers provided by the instructors).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>{\u00b642} Finally, the instructors rely on a statement in a retirement-system employers\u2019 manual that \u201c[i]f the teaching duties performed by an independent contractor are the same as those performed by teachers under employment contracts, then there is no difference for [retirement-system] purposes.\u201d But even assuming purely arguendo that we are bound to accept that statement as true, the instructors submitted no credible evidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, to establish that their duties were the same as those performed by other teachers working with Jefferson County ESC under employment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 43} On the record before us, we cannot say that the STRS\u2019s determination was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. At worst, the evidence was equivocal. Reasonable minds could differ as to whether Nese, Williams, and Miles were independent contractors or employees of Jefferson County ESC when they acted as VLA instructors. But our role is not to review de novo. Rather, our duty under the law of Ohio is to review only for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 44} In discharging that duty, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals because the instructors have failed to present clear and convincing evidence establishing that they were employees. The court of appeals properly held that the STRS\u2019s decision was supported by some evidence and that therefore, mandamus would not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 45} Finally, we recognize that the dissent in the court of appeals expressed concern over STRS\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">imposing the traditional attributes of a teacher on the less than traditional and, in light of technological advances, a likely increasingly common approach to teaching. What constitutes control will vary with the circumstances, and the circumstances here are considerably different than those of the more traditional classroom and make the factors [the STRS] cites not pertinent to determining whether relators are employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">2011-Ohio-6764, 2011 WL 6923145, \u00b6 16 (Bryant, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). We do not disagree with the view that the VLA and cyber schools present a new way of teaching. But it is precisely for those reasons that the STRS, with its expertise in this area, is entitled to deference. And, of course, the General Assembly is entitled to change the definition of \u201cteacher\u201d in R.C. 3307.01(B)(5) to encompass VLA instructors and other independent contractors who work in cyber schools. Those prerogatives, however, are not judicial ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 46} We conclude that Nese, Williams, and Miles did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the STRS abused its discretion by determining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>they were not \u201cteachers\u201d under R.C. 3307.01(B) for purposes of their work as instructors for the VLA operated by Jefferson County ESC.

In my view, they are teachers because they meet the statutory definition of teachers, and the appellate court magistrate determined that the STRS had abused its discretion in concluding that the relators were independent contractors. In addition, the appellate court magistrate found that the Jefferson County Educational Service Center employed Nese, Williams, and Miles to provide teaching services through the VLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">{\u00b6 49} Nese, Williams, and Miles each held a license to teach from the state of Ohio, each instructed students not only in public schools but also through the VLA of the Jefferson County Educational Service Center, an agency supported by the state, and each contributed to STRS for their years of service. STRS objected to the legal conclusions of the magistrate. On its review, the appellate court approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings, but then disregarded them by concluding that Nese, Williams, and Miles were independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">{\u00b6 50} Because Nese, Williams, and Miles qualify statutorily as teachers, because the magistrate\u2019s findings are supported by the record, and because the appellate court abused its discretion by adopting the findings of the magistrate but then denying the writ, I would reverse the decision of the appellate court and grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">{\u00b6 51} Nese, Williams, and Miles taught school in Jefferson County, and they also taught courses through the VLA of the Jefferson County Educational Service Center, an Internet-based educational system designed for K-12. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ing to the magistrate\u2019s decision, Nese provided teaching services through the VLA from the 2005-2006 fiscal year through the 2007-2008 fiscal year, Williams and Miles provided services in the program from the 2004-2005 fiscal year through the 2007-2008 fiscal year, and contributions were submitted to STRS by relators and the Jefferson County Educational Service Center for that service. However, in a December 2008 letter, STRS refunded $14,771.93 in contributions, asserting that earnings for the VLA were being returned as unauthorized contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">{\u00b6 52} In December 2009, Nese, Williams, and Miles filed a mandamus complaint in the Tenth District Court of Appeals seeking to compel STRS to accept their contributions for earnings from the Jefferson County Educational Service Center. The appellate court referred the matter to a magistrate, who found that the Jefferson County Educational Service Center employed Nese, Williams, and Miles to provide teaching services through the VLA, further found that relators had received W-2 and 1099 forms from the Jefferson County Educational Service Center, and concluded that relators\u2019 receipt of these \u201cdoes not indicate independent contractor status.\u201d The magistrate also noted that the Jefferson County Educational Service Center exercises control over relators and concluded that their status was that of employees, not independent contractors. The magistrate also referred to an STRS employer fact sheet, which suggested that even hiring independent contractors does not necessarily relieve the employer of the obligation to forward contributions on earnings. The magistrate thus concluded that Nese, Williams, and Miles fit within the statutory definition of teacher and recommended that the writ be allowed to permit them to participate in STRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 53} The appellate court, after reviewing the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and adopting its findings, rejected the magistrate\u2019s legal conclusions and instead concluded that STRS did not abuse its discretion in concluding that relators are independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 54} Relators and the Jefferson County Educational Service Center appealed that denial to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 55} This court applies a standard of abuse of discretion when reviewing an appellate court decision on a complaint seeking a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Hillyer v. Tuscarawas Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>70 Ohio St.3d 94, 97, 637 N.E.2d 311 (1994) (applying abuse-of-discretion standard to appellate court\u2019s decision in a mandamus case). \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 means an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable decision.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Relators are Teachers</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 56} R.C. 3307.01(B)(5) defines the term \u201cteacher\u201d to include \u201c[a]ny other teacher or faculty member employed in any * * * other agency wholly controlled and managed, and supported in whole or in part, by the state or any political subdivision thereof.\u201d Because the Jefferson County Educational Service Center is a successor to a county school district, it receives funding from the state. R.C. 3311.05(A); R.C. 3301.07(C). In <em>Cline v. Martin, </em>94 Ohio St. 420, 426, 115 N.E. 37 (1916), we characterized boards of education of county school districts as \u201cagencies of the state for the organization, administration, and control of the public school system of the state, separate and apart from * * * other subdivisions of the state.\u201d Thus, in conformity with this statute, educational service centers are agencies supported in whole or in part by the state. <em>See generally </em>R.C. 3317.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 57} In addition, R.C. 3307.01(B)(5) emphasizes the <em>capacity </em>in which employment occurs, in order to distinguish those employed as teachers from those employed in other capacities, such as cooks or custodians or administrators, etc. This statute therefore defines teachers as those employed in the capacity of teachers or faculty members employed in an agency supported by the state. Here, each relator is a member of the teaching profession, has a license to teach issued by the state of Ohio, and provided teaching services through the VLA by virtue of employment at the Jefferson County Educational Service Center, an agency that is supported by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 58} Notably, the General Assembly does not use the term \u201cemployee\u201d in R.C. 3307.01(B)(5), nor does it require employment status as it has done in other statutes relating to retirement systems. <em>Compare </em>R.C. 145.01(A)(3) (\u201cpublic employee\u201d means \u201c[a]ny person who is an <em>employee </em>of a public employer, notwithstanding that the person\u2019s compensation for that employment is derived from funds of a person or entity other than the employer\u201d) (emphasis added); R.C. 5505.02 (membership in the Ohio State Highway Patrol Retirement System \u201cincludes all state highway patrol <em>employees, </em>as defined in [R.C. 5505.01], and such membership is mandatory for such employees\u201d) (emphasis added). Although the General Assembly could have required a teacher to be an employee in the definition of \u201cteacher\u201d in R.C. 3307.01(B)(5), it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 59} Thus, in my view, relators were employed as teachers in the Jefferson County Educational Service Center within the meaning of R.C. 3307.01(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Employee vs. Independent Contractor</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 60} STRS urges that R.C. 3307.01 permits only those <em>employed </em>as teachers to participate in the retirement system, claiming that some evidence supports its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>determination that Nese, Williams, and Miles were independent contractors, not employees, and ineligible to participate in STRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">{\u00b6 61} Contrary to this position, the magistrate found that the Jefferson County Educational Service Center employed them as teachers, and that finding is supported by competent, credible evidence: W-2 forms issued to relators for at least some of their years of service and the control of the mode and manner of instruction by the Educational Service Center. Notably, in <em>Gillum v. Indus. Comm., </em>141 Ohio St. 373, 48 N.E.2d 234 (1943), we explained that an individual is an employee, rather than an independent contractor, when the employer has the right to control the manner in which the individual works. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 62} And the magistrate also noted that an STRS employer fact sheet instructs that STRS may still require contributions from those hired as independent contractors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Hiring an individual to fill an STRS Ohio-covered position through an independent contract or a temporary agency does not necessarily relieve an employer\u2019s obligation to make contributions on earnings to STRS Ohio. <em>If the individual\u2019s duties are the same as those performed by teachers or administrators under employment contracts, STRS Ohio considers the individual to be an employee and requires contributions to be remitted to STRS Ohio.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Please note that an agreement to be an independent contractor is not the sole indicator of a true independent contract relationship. Primary criterion cited in Attorney General Opinions and IRS Guidelines for distinguishing between an independent contractor and an employee is the right of the employer to control the \u201cmode and manner\u201d of the work performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 63} The magistrate\u2019s recommendation concluded as follows: \u201cGiven the record, the fact that relators fit within the definition of R.C. 3307.01(B)(4), and STRS policy regarding independent contractors, the evidence fails to support [State Teachers Retirement Board\u2019s] finding that relators are not members of STRS for the employment with [Jefferson County Educational Service Center] and teaching at the VLA.\u201d 2011-Ohio-6764, 2011 WL 6923145, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 64} The difficulty for me with the court of appeals\u2019 opinion is that it adopted the factual findings of the magistrate, \u00b6 13, but then disregarded those findings in its analysis when it concluded that the STRS did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the relators were independent contractors. The appellate court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>conclusions contradict the findings it adopted, and because relators did prove their entitlement to participate in STRS for at least some of their years of service, the court of appeals abused its discretion in denying the writ.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Axj\">Green, Haines, Sgambati Co., L.P.A., Ira J.

The Jefferson County Educational Service Center, an agency supported by the state, employed them as teachers, they served in that capacity for several years, they made STRS contributions during that time, and they relied on their status as teachers for their retirement. The sudden and unexpected refund of those contributions by STRS on its assertion that contributions for earnings from the VLA are unauthorized is wholly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 66} Accordingly, I would conclude that the court of appeals abused its discretion in adopting the findings of its magistrate but then concluding, contrary to those findings, that STRS did not abuse its discretion in returning what it called \u201cunauthorized\u201d contributions. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and grant the requested writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-8\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
