Sheward from presiding over any further proceedings in the above-captioned cases, both of which are pending for trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">{\u00b6 2} Adams alleges that Judge Sheward is biased and prejudiced against him and the other defendants, as evidenced by the judge\u2019s alleged (1) \u201cpersonal attacks\u201d against Adams, (2) attempt to \u201cforce a settlement,\u201d (3) disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>confidential information to plaintiffs, and (4) ex parte communications with Adams\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Sheward has responded in writing to the allegations in Adams\u2019s affidavits, offering a detailed account of his handling of both cases. Judge Sheward denies any bias or prejudice against Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Sheward.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>Alleged personal attacks and attempt to force settlement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 5} Adams claims that Judge Sheward has made \u201cpointed personal attacks\u201d against him and attempted to force settlement to lighten the judge\u2019s docket. Judge Sheward denies making any such attacks, and he \u201cfervently dispute[s]\u201d that he encouraged settlement in order to remove the cases from his docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">{\u00b6 6} Adams has failed to substantiate these claims. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence and argument demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). \u201cGenerally, an affiant is required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations contained therein.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2012-Ohio-6341, 985 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 6. Here, Adams offers only his affidavits to support these allegations. He concedes that he did not witness Judge Sheward\u2019s allegedly improper settlement conduct, yet none of the three attorneys who he says did witness it submitted an affidavit supporting Adams\u2019s claims. Further, and contrary to R.C. 2701.03, Adams has not set forth any specific examples of the alleged personal attacks made against him. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) (requiring the affiant to include the \u201cspecific allegations on which the claim of interest, bias, prejudice, or disqualification is based and the facts to support each of those allegations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">{\u00b6 7} On this record, Adams\u2019s vague and unsubstantiated allegations \u2014 especially in the face of clear denials by Judge Sheward \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>See In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988); <em>In re Disqualification of Synenberg, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2009-Ohio-7206, 937 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 25 (\u201cin the wake of the conflicting stories presented here, I cannot conclude that the judge should be removed * * *\u201d); <em>In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation \u2014 such as those alleged here \u2014 are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">{\u00b6 8} Adams also claims that Judge Sheward stated: \u201cBret I do not like your style of intimidation and aggressiveness,\u201d \u201cMr. Adams likes to keep secrets from this Court,\u201d and \u201cAttorney Adams likes to run attorneys off his cases.\u201d To the extent that these comments are the alleged \u201cpersonal attacks\u201d cited in Adams\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>affidavits, the comments do not warrant judicial disqualification. First, Judge Sheward does not recall making some of these statements, and he claims that if he did make them, they are \u201cinaccurate\u201d and have been \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d Because Adams failed to substantiate his allegations with a transcript or third-party affidavit, there is no way to determine whether Judge Sheward made the comments, let alone whether the comments reflect bias or prejudice against Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">{\u00b6 9} Second,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">[t]he term \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d \u201cimplies a hostile feeling or spirit of ill-will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1232, 2002-Ohio-7479, 798 N.E.2d 17, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956). If the comments were made, they appear unnecessary, but the comments alone do not convey the impression that Judge Sheward has developed a hostile feeling towards Adams or reached a fixed anticipatory judgment necessitating his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">\n<em>Alleged disclosure of con\u00f1dential information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 10} When Adams\u2019s former counsel, Joel Mirman, moved to withdraw, Adams claims that he requested that Judge Sheward keep the reasons for Mirman\u2019s withdrawal confidential. Judge Sheward, according to Adams, disregarded their \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the confidentiality of this information and disclosed it to the plaintiffs. For his part, Judge Sheward appears to dispute that he had any such \u201cunderstanding\u201d with Adams. Instead, the judge believes that he had an obligation to conduct an open hearing on Mirman\u2019s motion where both sides could be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">{\u00b6 11} Adams\u2019s allegation here is not well taken. Adams has not submitted any authority suggesting that Judge Sheward violated some sort of duty to Adams by disclosing this information at the hearing. But more important, Adams has not established that Judge Sheward\u2019s disclosure of the information was the product of bias or prejudice against Adams. The record shows that the opposing parties objected to Mirman\u2019s withdrawal, and Judge Sheward determined that disclosure of the information was necessary for an open hearing. It is well settled that \u201ca judge\u2019s adverse rulings, even erroneous ones, are not evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>of bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Fuerst, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1267, 2012-Ohio-6344, 984 N.E.2d 1079, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\n<em>Alleged ex parte communication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 12} Finally, Adams claims that Judge Sheward made an ex parte telephone call to Mirman, his former counsel. Judge Sheward acknowledges leaving a voice-mail message for Mirman informing him that the judge was going to deny his motion to withdraw. Judge Sheward insists, however, that the message was not an improper ex parte communication under Jud.Cond.R. 2.9(A)(1), because it did not address a substantive issue in the underlying case. Despite the judge\u2019s voice-mail message, Judge Sheward ultimately granted Mirman\u2019s motion to withdraw, to which Adams did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 13} Even if Adams had established that Judge Sheward violated his ethical duties by contacting Mirman, in an affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding, the question is not whether a judge has violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, but whether the communication demonstrates bias or prejudice on the part of the judge. <em>In re Disqualification of Nicely, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2012-Ohio-6290, 986 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 10. Adams has failed to explain how Judge Sheward\u2019s voice-mail message to Adams\u2019s counsel demonstrates bias or prejudice against Adams. Under these circumstances, Judge Sheward\u2019s communication is not grounds for disqualification. <em>Compare id. </em>(affiant failed to explain how alleged ex parte communication, which led to a favorable decision for the affiant, demonstrated bias or prejudice against her).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>Adams\u2019s rebuttal letters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 14} Adams has written and submitted three rebuttal letters, but R.C. 2701.03 requires that a party or counsel seeking to disqualify a judge file an affidavit. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(2) (requiring that the affidavit contain the \u201cjurat of a notary public or another person authorized to administer oaths or affirmations\u201d). Because Adams failed to confirm the statements in his rebuttal letters \u201cby oath or affirmation,\u201d the letters were not considered. <em>See, e.g., In re Disqualification of Fuerst, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1267, 2012-Ohio-6344, 984 N.E.2d 1079, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>In re Disqualification of Pokorny, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1238, 657 N.E.2d 1345 (1992) (finding the affiant\u2019s unsworn rebuttal letter to be a \u201c \u2018nullity\u2019 \u201d having \u201c \u2018no effect on the proceedings\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">{\u00b6 16} For the reasons stated above, the affidavits of disqualification are denied. The eases may proceed before Judge Sheward.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
