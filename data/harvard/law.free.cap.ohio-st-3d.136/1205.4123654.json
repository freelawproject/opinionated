Burge from presiding over these cases and all future cases in which Cilio appears as counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 2} Cilio claims that his \u201ccomplex and often contentious history\u201d with Judge Burge, combined with the judge\u2019s recent public comments regarding Cillo\u2019s involvement in an alleged disciplinary investigation of the judge, have created an appearance of impropriety requiring the judge\u2019s disqualification. Cilio also alleges that Judge Burge has expressed a fixed anticipatory judgment in the <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Burge has responded in writing to the allegations in Cillo\u2019s affidavits. He denies any bias against Cilio, disagrees that an appearance of impropriety exists, and states that he has not formed or expressed any opinion in the <em>Jalowiec </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, Judge Burge is disqualified from presiding over the <em>Jalowiec </em>proceeding, but Cillo\u2019s request for a blanket order of disqualification in all other current and future cases is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">\n<em>State v. Jalowiec</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">{\u00b6 5} The <em>Jalowiec </em>case is pending on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Cilio alleges that Judge Burge expressed an opinion on that motion and therefore should be removed. In support of the allegation, Cilio submits the affidavit of Nick J. Hanek, an assistant prosecuting attorney assigned to Judge Burge\u2019s courtroom. Hanek avers that after Cilio moved for Judge Burge to voluntarily recuse himself from the <em>Jalowiec </em>case, the judge commented to Hanek: \u201cHe [Anthony Cilio] thinks that I would make a ruling based on him when there\u2019s a man who certainly deserves a new trial.\u201d Judge Burge denies making the statement, declaring that he \u201cnever expressed to any assistant prosecutor, including the assistant prosecutor assigned to [his] court, or to anyone else, that Jalowiec is entitled to be granted a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-14\">If a judge\u2019s words or actions convey the impression that the judge has * * * reached a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d that will prevent the judge from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>presiding over the case with \u201can open state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts,\u201d <em>State ex rel Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, then the judge should not remain on the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>In re Disqualification of Synenberg, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1220, 2009-Ohio-7206, 937 N.E.2d 1011, \u00b6 24. Here, the record contains conflicting affidavits regarding whether Judge Burge made this statement to Hanek. Typically, such conflicting evidence is insufficient to overcome the presumption of a judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at \u00b625 (\u201cin the wake of the conflicting stories presented here, I cannot conclude that the judge should be removed * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 6} But Judge Burge did not rest with simply submitting his formal response to Cillo\u2019s affidavit of disqualification. Judge Burge also commented to the media about Cillo\u2019s allegation, which then triggered the filing of Cillo\u2019s supplemental affidavit with more allegations of bias and prejudice against the judge. Specifically, despite the requirements of Jud.Cond.R. 2.10, Judge Burge is quoted in two newspapers as stating, \u201cI don\u2019t believe an assistant [county prosecutor] told him [Cilio] that and if he did, it would be false,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen a person ascribes dishonest motives to another, it\u2019s usually because the accuser has dishonest motives himself and believes that everyone behaves the same way he does.\u201d The unfortunate result has been a public dispute between the administrative judge of the Lorain County Common Pleas Court and the chief of the prosecutor\u2019s criminal division played out in the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe proper test for determining whether a judge\u2019s participation in a case presents an appearance of impropriety is * * * an objective one. A judge should step aside or be removed if a reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8. The language used by Judge Burge in his media statements could cause the reasonable and objective observer to conclude that the judge has become Cillo\u2019s adversary, thereby creating a possibly intolerable atmosphere between the judge and the prosecutor in the courtroom. <em>See </em>Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>Section 15.7, 435 (2d Ed.2007). This public dispute cannot be allowed to overshadow the pending <em>Jalowiec </em>case, which has already endured a stay of the scheduled hearing for this affidavit-of-disqualification proceeding. \u201cWhen the case becomes about the judge rather than the facts of the case and the law, it is time for the judge to step aside,\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Saffold, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1204, 2010-Ohio-6723, 981 N.E.2d 869, \u00b6 2, or, as in this case, it is time for the judge to be removed when he refuses to step aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 8} In addition to the media statements, other factors are present that support disqualification. For example, Judge Burge did not respond to some of the allegations in Cillo\u2019s supplemental affidavit, including the claim that Judge Burge \u201cdiscarded the traditional route of reassignment in Jalowiec\u2019s case in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>to preside over the case himself.\u201d \u201c[A] judge\u2019s failure to respond to allegations of bias and prejudice may result in the judge\u2019s disqualification to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1234, 1235, 763 N.E.2d 602 (2001). Further, Judge Burge has been assigned to this case for a relatively short amount of time, which lessens the disruptive impact of disqualification. <em>Compare In re Disqualification of Nicely, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2012-Ohio-6290, 986 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 8 (disqualification of judge who presided over eight-year litigation with a 15-day trial warranted only under extraordinary circumstances clearly showing a fixed anticipatory judgment). Given the unique combination of facts here, prudent grounds exist to remove Judge Burge.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 9} Reassignment of the case to a new judge, however, should not be interpreted as implying that Judge Burge actually expressed an opinion in the proceeding, holds a personal bias against Cilio, or engaged in any unethical conduct. Judge Burge steadfastly denies making the alleged comment to Hanek, and it is quite possible that there was a misunderstanding of what was said and meant. Nevertheless, even in cases in which no evidence of actual bias or prejudice is apparent, disqualification is often necessary to avoid the appearance of impropriety and to ensure the parties\u2019 and the public\u2019s \u201cabsolute confidence in the fairness of [the] proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Sheward, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1258, 1260, 674 N.E.2d 365 (1996); <em>see also Saffold </em>at \u00b6 6 (disqualification appropriate when the \u201cpublic\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the judicial system is at stake\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 10} Accordingly, Judge Burge is disqualified from the <em>Jalowiec </em>case to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Cillo\u2019s requested blanket order of disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"Afj\">{\u00b6 11} In support of his request for a blanket order of disqualification, Cilio claims that prior to Judge Burge taking the bench, he and the judge opposed each other in high-profile, tension-filled cases, some of which resulted in Cilio moving for sanctions against then-attorney Burge. Cilio alleges that after Judge Burge was elected to judicial office, the relationship \u201cbecame even more fraught with tension.\u201d For example, Cilio asserts that in 2007, the judge entered an order finding him in contempt, a decision later criticized by an appellate court judge, and in 2011, Judge Burge made questionable evidentiary rulings in a three-judge death-penalty proceeding. Cillo\u2019s supplemental affidavit lists more recent judicial conduct that Cilio labels \u201cless than professional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 12} In addition, Cilio contends that Judge Burge recently impugned his integrity in a public comment to the parole board about an alleged disciplinary investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cilio points to a newspaper article attributing the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>comment to Judge Burge regarding a statement that the judge claimed Cilio had made to him: \u201cI have been told by the Supreme Court Disciplinary Counsel that Mr. Cilio denies having said that to me.\u201d Cilio argues that through this comment, Judge Burge \u201cpublished <em>his belief\u201d </em>that Cilio is \u201can untruthful person.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Cilio similarly interprets the comment as suggesting that Cilio \u201clied\u201d to disciplinary counsel and will be \u201ca witness against [the judge] in disciplinary proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">{\u00b6 13} Cillo\u2019s arguments are unconvincing. Judges are presumed to be capable of putting aside old disagreements with former opposing counsel and attorneys appearing before them, and nothing in Cillo\u2019s affidavits would lead a reasonable person to conclude that Judge Burge has developed such a strong personal bias against Cilio \u2014 based on their history \u2014 that the judge would be unable to preside' fairly over cases involving him. And as for Judge Burge\u2019s recent comment to the parole board, it is a stretch to interpret the comment as suggesting that Cilio \u201clied\u201d to investigators. Similarly, the comment does not demonstrate that Cilio will be a witness against the judge in a disciplinary proceeding \u2014 -mostly because there is no evidence that a formal disciplinary complaint has been filed. At this point, Cillo\u2019s claims are based on speculation and are therefore insufficient to establish bias or an appearance of bias. <em>In re Disqualification of Flanagan, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1236, 2009-Ohio-7199, 937 N.E.2d 1023, \u00b6 4 (\u201cAllegations that are based solely on hearsay, innuendo, and speculation * * * are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 14} In addition, the cases cited in Cillo\u2019s affidavit do not support a blanket order of disqualification. For example, Cilio relies on <em>In re Disqualification of Hoover, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1233, 2006-Ohio-7234, 863 N.E.2d 634, but that judge was ultimately removed because his response to an affidavit of disqualification was \u201claced with invectives against [the affiant]\u201d and \u201cbristle[d] with caustic phrases about [the affiant],\u201d suggesting that the judge was not able to view the affidavit objectively and calling into question his ability to preside fairly over the affiant\u2019s cases. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. Judge Burge\u2019s formal responses to Cillo\u2019s affidavits do not show any similar resentment towards Cilio. In fact, the judge describes Cilio as \u201ca capable trial attorney that is always prepared, organized, technically sound, credible and dedicated to his cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 15} Similarly, <em>In re Disqualification of O\u2019Neill, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1226, 2002-Ohio-7476, 798 N.E.2d 12, does not support the conclusion that an appearance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>impropriety exists here. In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the affiant was a witness to alleged judicial misconduct \u201ccontained in the pending disciplinary complaint\u201d against the judge, and there was a strong indication that the affiant would be the \u201csubject \u25a0 of vigorous cross-examination by [the judge\u2019s] counsel regarding [affiant\u2019s] perception of the events alleged in the disciplinary complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. In addition, Judge O\u2019Neill characterized the disciplinary charges against her as \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d and she had been publicly critical of the individuals involved in the disciplinary matters. <em>Id. </em>Except for Judge Burge\u2019s publicly critical comments of Cilio, the record here is devoid of any of these same facts. Most important, there is no evidence of a pending disciplinary complaint against Judge Burge, and therefore it remains speculative whether Cilio would ever be involved in a disciplinary matter against the judge or subjected to his cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 16} At bottom, there is no doubt that Cilio \u2014 rightly or wrongly \u2014 sincerely believes that an appearance of impropriety exists, and \u201c[i]t is of vital importance that the litigant should believe that he will have a fair trial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Turner v. Marshall, </em>123 Ohio St. 586, 587, 176 N.E. 454 (1931). That principle, however, must be balanced against the rule that \u201c[t]he statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Hunter, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 607, 608, 522 N.E.2d 461 (1988). The significance of that remedy is heightened here because Cilio acts as counsel of record in all capital cases in Lorain County and \u201chandles the cases where the most serious crimes have been perpetrated.\u201d Accordingly, Cillo\u2019s requested remedy will effectively remove Judge Burge from presiding over all capital cases and other serious criminal matters. At this point, Cillo\u2019s speculative allegations are insufficient to issue such an extraordinary remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Cilio has failed to submit compelling evidence to overcome those presumptions, and therefore he has failed to establish an appearance of impropriety warranting a blanket order of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 18} Two of Cillo\u2019s cases remain pending before Judge Burge: <em>State v. Weber </em>and <em>State v. Fine. </em>Unlike the <em>Jalowiec </em>case, Cilio did not set forth any specific allegations of bias or prejudice relating to these cases. Judge Burge states that the parties in <em>Weber </em>are attempting to resolve the case without trial, and the docket in <em>Fine </em>indicates that a trial is scheduled for August 2013. It is expected that by that time, Judge Burge and Cilio will have worked to improve their professional relationship to reassure the citizens of Lorain County of the fairness of their justice system. The public deserves that from its public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>{\u00b6 19} For the reasons explained above, Cillo\u2019s affidavit of disqualification is granted with respect to the <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>case, and it is ordered that Judge Burge participate no further in those proceedings. The assignment of another judge will be addressed in a separate entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 20} Cillo\u2019s affidavit with respect to the <em>Weber </em>and <em>Fine </em>cases is denied, and those cases may proceed before Judge Burge. Cillo\u2019s request for a blanket order of disqualification is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\">. Under Gov.Bar R. V(11)(B)(1), all proceedings and documents relating to investigation of disciplinary grievances are \u201cprivate.\u201d The record here contains newspaper articles stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>Judge Burge is the subject of a disciplinary inquiry, and Judge Burge\u2019s response to Cillo\u2019s supplemental affidavit seems to indicate that he has received a letter of inquiry from disciplinary authorities. The Chief Justice has no knowledge of whether any such disciplinary inquiry existed or is ongoing, and this entry should not be interpreted as confirming the existence of any such inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
