Jno. B. Hoyle, J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-13\">Jno. Baxter for petitioner,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APi\">filed the argument of J. S. Wiltse, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-14\">I take the ground that the practice of the business of any occupation, is not such a privilege as to be taxable under the Constitution and Bill of Bights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>because it is my right to do it. I refer to the lawful definition of a \u201cprivilege\u201d as laid down in Bur-rill\u2019s Law Dictionary \u2014 \u201cbeing that around which the law throws some peculiar protection \u201d unusual and special. The word privilege has a certain signification in law, and the same must hold unless the context shows something different: See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Hum., 394.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">I find no good reason in the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Mabry </em>v. <em>Tarver, </em>or <em>State </em>v. <em>Tarver, </em>where it is held that the Legislature may make anything a privilege by taxing it, or saying that he shall not practice it who does not pay for it. It could only have been rendered in view of the clause in the Constitution prohibiting the granting of privileges. This very decision admits that my occupation, or any other man\u2019s occupation, when not opposed to public policy, is only a privilege, and so taxable by the operation of the taxing statute. It therefore follows, that. I had a right to do it before, and I can not constitutionally be taxed, or else that the taxing power of a Legislature is an absolutely unlimited power and prerogative, and there are no such things as constitutional limitations. To hold this is against law and public policy. The other must in reason and right be held..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">The statute found us, when it was enacted \u2014 doing the thing it seeks to prohibit or tax. I had in it a vested right. The Legislature had no constitutional power to deter me from it: Sedgwick on Constitutional Law, 511.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-8\">A Legislature can not select any specific property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>as the subject of taxation, and assess the owner distinctly from his equal share of tax as required of all persons. No more should it, if it has power to tax an occupation not opposed to public policy, (not admitted) tax one man\u2019s occupation and not another\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\">The statute imposes or seeks to impose a tax that is not \u201cequal and proportionate,\u201d and so also is unconstitutional : Sedgwick, 504. It imposes \u201c excessive fines,\u201d and so also violates constitutional provisions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-6\">Attorney-General Heiskell for the State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-7\">Lewis Shepherd for Hamilton county.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b562-8\">Nicholson, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Alu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">This is an application for a writ of error, petitioners being real estate brokers at Chattanooga, failed to pay the tax and take out license for the privilege of prosecuting the business of real estate brokers, as required by the Code. The Clerk of the County Court issued a distress warrant, and had the same levied\u2014 whereupon petioners obtained writs of <em>certiorari </em>and supersedeas, and removed the cause to the Circuit Court of Hamilton county. Upon motion, at the March Term, 1873, the petition was dismissed and judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The only ground on which the writ of error is applied for \u2014 is, that the act of Assembly imposing the tax upon the occupation of a real estate broker as a privilege, is unconstitutional. The Legislature is left unrestricted by the Constitution, as to the manner in which privileges shall be taxed: Const, art. 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>sec. 28. Since the case of <em>Mabry </em>v. <em>Tarver, </em>1 Hum., 94, a privilege has been held to be \u201ca license to do anything which is prohibited by the general law.\u201d Among the occupations and transactions, which by the general law are not to be pursued without license, is that of a broker of real estate: Code, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The Constitution of 1870 retained the clause as to the taxation of privileges which- was found in the Constitution, and we have held more than once, that it is to be presumed that the word privileges was adopted and retained in the Constitution of 1870, in the sense in which it was used in the Constitution of 1834, as ascertained and settled by judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Following these adjudications as conclusive of the question, there was no error in the action of the Circuit Judge in dismissing the petition, and therefore we refuse the application for writ of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
