The question is\u2014 was he correct in so holding? By sec. 61 of the act of 1873, it is provided, \u201cThat in all cases where taxes remain due and unpaid on the first day of June, of the year following the year for which the taxes are due, the tax collector shall make out a complete list, etc./5 and then proceeds in the balance of the section, and succeeding sections, to point out with great particularity, the mode of proceeding in such sales. By sec. 80, it is enacted, \u201cThat all acts and parts of acts upon the subject of assessments and collection of taxes, and sale of lands for taxes, in conflict with the provisions of this act, and all other acts in conflict Avith the provisions of this act, be and the same are hereby repealed.55</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">It is certain, that the taxes of 1872, remaining due and unpaid on the first day of June, 1873, are included in the language of sec. 61 of the above act of 1873. \"We can see no principle of law by which it can be held that the mode of enforcing the collection of a debt due the State for taxes becomes irrepealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\"We are familiar with the principle, that the substantial remedy provided by law at the time of the creation of the debt, can not be 'so taken away or changed, as to defeat or impair the right of a creditor to enforce a contract entered into. But we do not see that this principle has application to this case. The creditor does not complain that his right to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>debt has been impaired, nor do we think such complaint could be made, even in case it was a private creditor, while an equally efficient and substantial remedy was provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Be this however as it may \u2014 and we do not definitely decide how this is \u2014 it is, as we think, certain however, that sec. 80, which we have cited, repeals all laws for the collection of taxes, and sale of lands for taxes, from and after its passage, and no court can properly make any sale under former statutes; for being repealed, with no saving clause as to taxes accruing before the passage, they stand as if they had never existed \u2014 have been taken from the Statute Book as laws, and have no binding force, and as a matter of course, can not be administered or enforced by the courts. The legislative will is distinctly and unequivocally declared, and is conclusive upon all \u2014 that such laws are repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In the case of <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Denton, </em>14 Eng. Law &amp; Eq. R., 127, Lord Campbell states the law to be that, \u201cThe general rule is, that a repealed statute can not be acted upon after it is repealed, but that with regard to all matters that have taken place under it before the repeal, they remain valid and can not be questioned.\u201d He says, \u201cIt is said that there is a difference between the case where the repealing act affects the substance of the proceeding, and where it affects only the form; but I do not think any such distinction can be made.\u201d As a matter of course, the repeal of the former statutes has no influence on orders of sale for taxes, before the dates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of the repeal \u2014 but such sales will be valid and binding, if done in pursuance of the law in force at the time such judgments were entered. This principle was applied by the Court of Appeals of New York, in the celebrated case of Mrs. Hartung, in 22 N. Y. R., 96, to the discharge of a party convicted of a most atrocious murder, because of the repeal of the law inflicting capital punishment. The same principle has been applied in several other cases of like character. See <em>Huchler </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Am. L. Reg., 43; <em>Brothers </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Col.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">These were criminal cases, but we are aware of no difference in the principle as applied to criminal and civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\"Without citing further authorities, our conclusion is, that the only law now in force under which a tax sale can be made is the law of 1873, all others being expressly repealed by sec. 80 of said act, and therefore, his Honor was correct in his holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
