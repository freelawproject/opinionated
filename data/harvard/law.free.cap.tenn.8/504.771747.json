Irving Halsey, J., quashing a distress warrant for privilege tax.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-5\">Attorney-General Heiskell for the State,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av7\">argued that the provision in our Constitution is different from that of any other State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">The general phraseology places the <em>suhstanee </em>and the <em>title </em>on the same footing, no law <em>shall </em>embrace more than one subject, (or object) which shall be expressed in the title. In construing such a clause, it is impossible to distinguish the two objects which the Convention mean to reach, for they have expressed the same idea in the same language as to both. Both must therefore, though naturally of very different degrees of importance, be directory \u2014 or \u2022 both imperative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-7\">But the Constitution of Tennessee distinguishes these two things, and I maintain designedly. \u201cNo bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject; that subject to be embraced in the title.\u201d Why depart from the phraseology of the Constitutions of fourteen States where similar provisions prevail, unless a different thing was intended? No doubt an adoption of the phraseology would carry with it a strong argument that the established meaning had been adopted with the phraseology. But the converse of the proposition carries an argument also. The failure to use an established formula, argues that the departure is not without a reason. What is the reason for a departure?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">The title of an act was the most' inconsequential part of it by the usage of legislatures and courts\u2014 the body of it was everything. Now by a sudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>bouleversement, </em>to make the title control the body of an act, is a thing not to be looked for in a wise body of men. To prohibit, under the penalty of invalidity, the log-rolling statutes of former days, the riders by which the constitutional law of legislation was evaded, is to strike at a great evil with adequate weapon, but to apply the same remedy to the title, is -ito waft a feather or to drown a fly.\u201d Therefore, I maintain, that when the Conventions of other States put these things on the same footing, they did that which it was proper to avoid. If she has avoided it, let us not lose the fruits, for want of a proper construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">Look at the instances. In other States they have held acts void where the title, undertaking to enumerate divers particulars, omitted some, when it was admitted that the substance of the acts was not objectionable \u2014 where a proper act is passed, to have parts of the law held void because not enumerated in the bill, is a monstrous result. We must look to experience in judging of what is practicable in legislation. Every man capable of generalizing at all, must have observed the tendency of the human mind to particularize. The Old Constitution provided for vacancies by death, resignation or removal \u2014 why not <em>vacancies </em>without more. Now, nine cases out of ten in which this question will arise, will be found to depend upon this principle. Legislatures will attempt to particularize, and fail: See the instance of <em>The State </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>14 Ind., 195, where the act was homogeneous, but the title defective in particularizing: See also <em>McWMrier </em>v. <em>Price, </em>11 Ind., 199; <em>Ryman </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Willey, </em>16 Mich., 269. In the construction of the substance of acts there is no difficulty, the courts never fail to sustain what is substantially right. In the title \u2014 <em>heret in cortiee. </em>See the instances quoted: Cooley 145, s. 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">If the substance is wrong, the whole act is void. If the title is wrong, only so much as is not in the title. By what reason ? If the clause is so imperative, and a failure avoids, why does one avoid <em>in </em>toto\u2014 the other <em>pro tanto ? </em>' Each is alike a disobedience of the law. Why does not each make it invalid alike? It is read as if it declared that every act shall be void which embraces more than one subject, and in which that subject is not stated in the title. Yet it is not so held as to the matter stated in the title. But if both matters appear in the title, then the whole act is void. Truly, the whole virtue is gone out of the thing and made to reside in the name. The deficiency in the title is made to cure the fatal defect in the substance, for if two things incongruous are put together, and the title describes one, that one is good, and the other is lopped off; whereas, if both are in the title, both are void. Can not this Constitution have attributed to it a grain of wisdom, in advance beyond those whose construction has resulted in such disatrous absurdities? \u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\"><em>\u201c </em>No bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject; that subject to be expressed in the title.\u201d The first part of this clause is imperative as language can make it. No bill shall <em>become \u2022a </em>law\u2014 not no bill shall <em>be passed, </em>but being passed and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>proved, it shall <em>not be law. </em>This is as strongly expressed as is possible. But the conditional part ceases where this .member of the sentence ends; \u201cwhich embraces more than one subject,\u201d but the next member is in a different form entirely, to construe this imperative it should read, \u201cor the subject of which is not expressed in the title,\u201d but how different the actual mode of expression; \u201cthat subject to be expressed in the title.\u201d Are we to suppose that this striking change in the mode of expression is accidental. It was drawn by one of the most careful and accurate scholars, one of the most astute and far-seeing of men. Now did it mean the wise thing which it seems to express by plain language, or did it simply by accident seem to express what was not in the mind of any one. If it be \u2019 accidental then it is providential, and we must construe the . words as we find them. But the law of other States having been found to work badly in making these two things, so unlike in substance\u2014 equal in grade, we are bound to presume that the change was adopted with design.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">The whole act is upon one subject: <em>revenue, </em>its <em>receipt and disbursement; </em>which might well be made the <em>subject </em>of <em>one bill or act; </em>but with a circumscribed title, \u201cto fix the State tax on property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">By reference to Cooley, p. 146, it will be seen that the liberal scope o.f construction on this point, allows a wide range in the <em>subject, </em>sufficiently so to cover the whole subject of revenue, its collection and disbursement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Jarnagin &amp; Frazer for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">The form of the law and the assessment, make it the duty of the collector to issue licenses to retail liquor dealers in Memphis, only upon payment of $150 to the State, and the same to the county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">The amount to be paid for the privilege, is affected by the number of inhabitants in the town or city.

He did right. The constitutional provision referred to, is mandatory and not directory: Cooley on Con.

This is a sound view. But we must not rest the case on this ground. It is enough that constitutional provisions like the one being considered, are held- mandatory by the great weight of authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">An ingenious effort is made to separate the fourth section, into a mandatory and a directory element. The mandatory going to the body of the statute, and the directory to the title. This is merely plausible. The language differs in both features from that employed in other State Constitutions. But it is sufficiently emphatic to leave no doubt. It never entered into the minds of the convention-makers, that this provision was to be destroyed by declaring that it had a hard and a soft side; that it was to be a hybrid; a legislative plaything. The evils to be remedied by this provision are considered by Cooley, 142.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">The particularity required in stating the subject in the title of the act, is critically examined in connection with decided cases: Cooley, 144. If the title embraces more than one object, the whole act is void: Cooley, 147.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-11\">It would seem that where the act is broader than the title, that so much may stand as the title covers: Cooley, 148.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>But as our Constitution declares that no bill containing more than one subject, shall become' a law, is the effect not to invalidate the whole? Such is the view of the learned Attorney-General. And he admits that the third section is totally different from the first. This, then, on his own view, is conclusive against the act. <em>Felo de se. </em>I agree that a liberal construction shall be allowed, so as not to embarrass legislation: Cooley, 146, and note 8. But this act is a palpable infringement of the rule. To see how distinct \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cprivileges\u201d are, I refer to 2 Head, pp. 365, 366. The Legislature creates privileges, but not property: 3 Head, 414.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">\"What is a privilege? 4 Sneed,,193; 5 Sneed, 258.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">As this is a case of first impression in this State, I submit that the Court shall set its face against legislative trifling with the Constitution, under the pretext of directory provisions. It is a dangerous doctrine. It will give rise to infinite mischief. It is an invitation to hold the fundamental law in light esteem.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">I concede that under a suitable title, the entire subject of privileges might be regulated. I concede that whatever is dependent upon, or grows out of the main subject, may be embraced under the general title. The title of the act may be restrictive, as to exclude matters that might under proper title be embraced: Cooley, 149. There is no decided ease that will sustain that statute, except as to the first section, in any State where the mandatory construction prevails.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-10\">I call special attention to the following cases: <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>v. <em>Bowers, </em>14 Ind., 195; <em>Memberton </em>v. <em>Price, </em>11 Ind., 199; <em>Pyerson </em>v. <em>TJttery, </em>16 Mich., 269. These cases are believed to be in point, or so nearly so, as to control the case in hand. The several constitutional provisions will be seen: Cooley, 141, note 4. Assuming that section 4 is void, or that the whole act is void, then a distress warrant issued under it would be a nullity. ' A void act is no act: Cooley, 188. The remedy by <em>supersedeas </em>in such a case is proper.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b531-5\">Nicholson, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQk\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">This case commenced by petition for <em>supersedeas, </em>in which it is alleged, that defendant as collector of privilege taxes for Shelby county, issued a distress warrant against the property of petitioner, a licensed liquor dealer, for failure and refusal by him to pay the State and County tax assessed against him, under the act of July 7th, 1870, by which the tax on all privileges was increased 50 per cent, upon the basis then existing. It is alleged in the petition, that this act of the Legislature is void, because it violates a ft. 2. s. 17, of the Constitution of the State, which provides that \u201c no bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject; that subject to be expressed in the title.\u201d The Circuit Judge held the act unconstitutional, and quashed the distress warrant. From this judgment the State and county have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The title of the act of July 7th, 1870, is as follows: \u201cAn act to fix the State tax on property.\u201d The first section fixes the State tax on every $100 worth of property at 40 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Section 2 repeals the act of February 25th, 1870, which fixes the State tax at 20 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Section 3 amends sec. 4 of the act of February 25th, 1870, as to the manner and order in which the Comptroller and Treasurer were directed to pay out the money in the treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Section 4 increases the tax on all privileges 50 per cent, upon the existing basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">It is insisted that this act violates sec. 17 of art. 2 of the Constitution of the State, which is as follows: \u201cSec. 17. Bills may originate in either house; but may be amended, altered, or rejected by the other. No bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject; that subject to be expressed in title. All acts which repeal, revive, or amend former laws, shall recite in their caption, or otherwise, the title or substance of the law repealed, revived, or amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The particular portion of this section on which the question, in the present case is raised, is the following: \u201cNo bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject; that subject to be expressed in the. title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Similar provisions have been introduced, of late years, into many of the State' Constitutions, and frequent occasions have arisen for their construction by the courts. In several States the courts have construed the provisions to be only directory to the Legislatures, and held that their acts are not invalid, although not conforming to the directory requirements of their Constitution. But the courts of most of the States have construed the provisions to be mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>or imperative, and therefore, that the acts not passed in conformity therewith, are invalid and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The language adopted in our Constitution differs, in some respects, from that used in other States. \u201cNo bill shall become a law which embraces more than one subject.\u201d This is a direct, positive and imperative limitation upon the power of the Legislature. It matters not that a bill has passed through three readings in each house, on three different days, and has received the approval of the Governor; still it is not a law of the State if it embraces more than one subject. It is, therefore, a plain, absolute and unconditional limitation upon legislative power. But while it is \u25a0conceded that a bill which embraces more subjects than one can not become a law, because of the imperative or mandatory character of the language, yet it is suggested, that the remaining portion of the provision \u2014 \u25a0 to-wit: \u201cthat subject to be expressed in the title,\u201d was not intended to be mandatory but only directory; and, therefore, that a bill may become a law, although the subject of the bill may not be expressed in the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In the present case, we do not deem it necessary to express an opinion as to the question, whether any provision of a Constitution, can be properly treated otherwise than as mandatory. The essential nature and object of constitutional law, being restrictive upon the powers of the several departments of government, it is difficult to comprehend how its provisions can be regarded as merely directory. But, however this may be as to other provisions of the Constitution, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>can see no reason for placing a different construction on the language used in the latter portion of the provision under consideration, from that placed on the first portion. The language \u201cthat subject <em>to he </em>expressed in the title,\u201d can not merely be regarded as directory. The command is positive that no law shall embrace more than one subject, and is equally positive \u2022that that subject <em>is </em>to be, or <em>shall </em>be expressed in the title. To constitute a valid law under this provision, the bill must not embrace one subject alone, but that subject must be embraced in the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Plausible reasons might be given to show, that it was not essential to the object which the Convention sought to accomplish, that the subject of legislation should be imperatively indicated in the titles of bills, but where there is no real ambiguity in the language employed, we have no right to fritter away the obvious import of that language by construction. The Convention evidently designed to cut up by the roots, not only the pernicious system of legislation, which embraced in one act incongruous and independent subjects, but also the evil practice of giving titles to acts which conveyed no real information as to the objects embraced in its provisions. To accomplish both purposes, the Convention deemed it wise to withhold from the Legislature, any power to enact a law which either embraced more than one subject, or which failed to express the fact in its title.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">It follows that if the act of July 7th, 1870, either embraces more subjects than one, or if the title does not express the subject of the act, the law is uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>stitutional and invalid. This brings us to consider these two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">It is said by Judge Cooley, at page 144 of his work on Constitutional Limitations, that \u201cthe general purpose of these provisions is accomplished when a law has but one general object, which is fairly indicated by its title. To require every end and means neccessary or convenient for the accomplishment of this general object, to be provided for by a separate act relating to that alone, would not only be unreasonable, but would actually render legislation impossible.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe generality of a title is no objection to it, so long as it is not made a cover to legislation incongruous in itself, and which by no fair intendment can be considered as having a necessary or proper connection. The Legislature must determine for itself, how broad and comprehensive shall be the object of a statute, and how much particularity shall be employed in the title in defining it.\u201d \"We concur in these general views as sound and practical, and by them the validity of the act in question must be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The first inquiry is, does the act in question embrace more than one subject? As we have seen, the first section provides for raising revenue by a tax on property; the second repeals a former law as to the manner and order of paying out the revenue from the treasury, and the fourth provides for raising revenue by a tax on privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The general subject of the act is revenue \u2014 and each and every section has direct reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>subject of revenue in its different phases. It can not be said that there is the least incongruity among the provisions of the four sections. They have \u2022 a natural, if not a necessary connection with and dependence upon each other. Revenue is the general subject of- the act; its amount and its disbursement from the treasury are the special objects provided for. It is clear that the act is not obnoxious to the objection that it embraces more subjects than one: 14 Ind., 195; 2 Iowa, 280; 19 N. Y., 119; Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">But the next .question is, does the title of the act express its subject? The title is, \u201cAn act to fix the State tax on property.\u201d <em>We </em>have seen that the subject of the act is revenue; the raising of it by taxation on property and privileges, and its disbursement from the treasury. The title indicates that the subject of the act is the fixing of the State tax on property. We have seen that the fixing of the State tax on privileges, and the mode and order of disbursing the revenue were germane to the fixing of the State tax on property, and therefore, that the several subjects embraced in the act were not incongruous. The question then arises, is the subject of the act sufficiently expressed by the title, which describes it as \u201cAn act to fix the State tax on property \u201d ? In answering this question, it is necessary to look to the object to be accomplished, by requiring the subject of the act to be expressed in the title. In the case of <em>The People </em>v. Mahaney, 13 Mich., 494, it is said: \u201cthat the object was to put an end to a practice, by which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>through dexterous management, clauses were inserted in bills of which the titles gave no intimation, and their passage secured through legislative bodies, whose members were not generally aware of their intention and effect, and to require that in every ease, the proposed measure should stand upon its own merits, and that the Legislature should be fairly satisfied of its design when required to pass upon it.\u201d Judge Cooley, Con. Lim., 145, states the object of the provision, as deduced from numerous cases, to be: \u201c to prevent surprise or fraud upon the Legislature, by means of provisions in bills of which the titles gave no intimation, and which might therefere be overlooked, and carelessly and unintentionally adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Such being the object of the constitutional provision, when a bill was introduced with the announcement, that it was \u201ca bill to fix the State tax on property,\u201d with a section in it, fixing the tax on privileges, could it be said with reason or plausibility, that the title gave no intimation as to the provisions of the bill, in regard to taxing privileges as well as property? In 25 Ill., 181, it was held, that an act to incorporate a railroad company, may authorize counties to subscribe to its stock, or otherwise aid the construction of the road. After citing a number of similar cases, Judge Cooley concludes as follows: \u201cmany other cases are referred to in the note which will further illustrate the views of the courts upon this subject. There has been a general disposition to construe the constitutional provisions liberally, rather than to embarrass legislation by a construction whose strict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ness is unnecessary to the accomplishment of the beneficial purposes for which it has been adopted:\u201d Cooley\u2019s Con. Lim., 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It is not to be denied, that there is some seeming conflict in the authorities on this subject, but upon a careful examination of the several cases, we are satisfied that the conflict is more apparent than real. In the case of <em>Ryerson </em>v. <em>Utley, </em>16 Mich., 278, which is the most important' authority relied on, by the counsel for the petitioner, Judge Cooley distinctly recognizes the rule of construction which we have adopted. In that case, he said: \u201c the only object mentioned in the title to this act, is the preservation of the Muskegon River Improvement; for which purpose the act authorizes tolls to be levied and expended. The payment of Beard\u2019s claim is in no way connected with this object; and the title to the act would apprise neither the Legislature nor the public, that it covered provisions under which a large sum was to be collected and disbursed to pay for the original construction of the work.\u201d It being clear that the title of the act had no reference to, or connection with the payment of Beard\u2019s claim, he held the act unconstitutional. But he reiterated what he had held in the <em>The People </em>v. <em>Mahany, </em>13 Mich., 494, that if the title covered the object, of the act, the degree of particularity with which it should be set out, was for the Legislature to determine. In support of this position he cites 8 Iowa, 82 ; 11 Iowa, 482; 7 Ind., 681; 14 Ind., 195; 2 Iowa, 280; 19 N. Y. 116, and 3 Met. Ky., 566, in which last named case it was held, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u201cthe constitutional provision should receive a reasonable construction, and any provision of the act directly or indirectly relating to the subject expressed in the bill, and having a natural connection therewith, and foreign the'reto, should be deemed embraced in it. We approve, says Judge Cooley, of the principle thus stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The cases of <em>Mewherter </em>v. Price, 11. Ind., 199, and <em>The State </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>14 Ind., 195, were decided upon the ground, that the provisions in the acts declared void, were not embraced in, but were clearly excluded from the titles of the acts. The subjects of those provisions had no relation, directly or indirectly, to the subject expressed in the title, but were foreign thereto, of consequence void under the Constitution of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">It is obvious, therefore, that the true rule of the construction, as fully established by the authorities, is, that any provision of the act, directly or indirectly relating to the subject expressed in the title, and having a natural connection thereto, and not foreign thereto, should be held to be embraced in it. Following this rule, we hold that in the case before us, the fourth section of the act, fixing the tax on privileges, has a ' natural connection with the subject expressed in the the title of the act, and that the same is constitutional and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed, and judgment will be rendered here upon the <em>supersedeas </em>bond..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
