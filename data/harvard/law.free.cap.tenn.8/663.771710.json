R. &amp; Lee Head, for the petitioners:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-5\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>was in use in North CaroCarolina as far back as 1777. With but few exceptions, it was used for all the different purposes to which it is now applied. The Constitution secured its existence, together with the general outlines of its use. For a time held to apply only to civil cases, afterwards it was held to apply to criminal cases. At first, its issuance was only authorized when directed by the fiat of a judge; but afterwards, it was allowed to be granted by two justices. Every facility has been afforded for its use, and every inconvenience remedied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-6\">This writ is the proper remedy by which to remove judicial sentences of all courts exercising jurisdiction under statutory regulations, either in a summary way, or by a mode of proceeding according to common law forms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-7\">It has also been held to lie in administration and probate causes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-8\">In the case of <em>Murfree </em>v. <em>Leeper, </em>1 Tenn. B., 1, it was held that, in cases falling within the jurisdiction of the County Court, in which the judgment of such court was, by statute, declared to be final and conclusive, without any appeal to the Superior Court, this exclusion of appeal does not take away the writ of <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-9\">What other remedy is there? A suit in equity will not lie to restrain the collection of a tax upon the sole ground that it is illegal. In addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>illegality of the tax, there must exist some special circumstances bringing the case under some recognized head of equity jurisdiction \u2014 such as that the enforcement of the tax would lead- to a multiplicity of suits, or produce irreparable injury, or that the property is real estate, and the imposition of the tax throws a cloud upon the title of the owner \u2014 otherwise courts of equity will not interfere with the determinations of inferior boards or tribunals of special jurisdiction. \u201cIn all other cases,\u201d says the court in the case of <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, </em>5 Wallace, 413, \u201cthe review and correction of the proceedings must be obtained by the writ of <em>certiorari.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-5\"><em>\u25a0 </em>In the case of <em>Spears </em>v. <em>County Court Clerk of Shelby County, </em>6 Cold., 420, involving the question of taxes on privileges, this court says: \u201cThe writ of <em>certiorari </em>affords the proper remedy against a distress warrant illegally issued to collect taxes, or a penalty for failing to pay taxes.\u201d This case involved a construction of the revenue act of 1868. This writ was used as the remedy, and relief obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-7\">In the case of the <em>M. and A. of Nashville </em>v. <em>Pearl, </em>11 Hum., 249, it was held that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>was the proper process by which to remove a corporation warrant into the Circuit Court. The court says: \u201cThe <em>certiorari </em>has a much more extended application in this State than in England. It has been adopted with us as the almost universal method by which the circuit courts, as courts of general jurisdiction, exercise control over inferior jurisdictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>however constituted, and whatever may be their course of proceeding.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-5\">The provisions of our statute are conclusive. Sec. 3123 of the Code provides that \u201cthe writ of <em>certiorari </em>may be granted in all cases where an inferior tribunal, board or officer, exercising judicial functions, has exceeded the jurisdiction conferred, or is acting illegally, when, in the judgment of the court, there is no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy.\u201d The County Court is an inferior tribunal, the tax imposed is in violation of law, and the act of assessment made by the Judge of the County Court is clearly in excess of the jurisdiction conferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-6\">But the main argument of defendants is, that the only remedy provided by law for the petitioners as taxpayers, is to pay the tax assessed against them under protest, and then to sue the officer collecting the same, within thirty days after making the payment, for the recovery thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-7\">The act of 20th March, 1873, \u201cto facilitate the collection of revenues,\u201d relates to revenue due the State, and if constitutional and valid, does not deprive the petitioners of their remedy as against the county and railroad tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-8\">But we deny the constitutionality of this act. The Legislature had as well pass an act suspending the writ- of <em>habeas corpus, </em>as to deprive the citizen of his constitutional right to apply for and obtain the writ of <em>certiorari, </em>as provided in s. 10 of art. 6 of the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>In the case of <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>7' Yerg., 22, the court says: \u201cThis court is of the opinion that the power secured to the judges of the superior courts by the Constitution, by art. 5, and to the judges and justices of inferior courts, in the sec. 7 of the same article, was only intended to restrain the Legislature from abridging the right of the citizen to his remedy by <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-5\">The Legislature may suspend the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>but no exception is made by the Constitution in which the writ of <em>certiorari </em>should be suspended, or refused the citizen when applied for upon his sworn petition, showing good cause for the same. The Legislature has created an exception in favor of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-6\">But, furthermore, s. 17 of art. 1 of the' Constitution provides; \u201cThat all courts shall be open; and every man, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial, or delay.\u201d When a citizen is pursuing his remedy by due course of law, that is, by suit pending in one of the courts, an act of Assembly passed requiring his suit, or a certain class of cases embracing his, to be dismissed, would be unconstitutional and void: 2 Yerg., 554; 6 Yerg., 119, 132. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-7\">A rule o\u00ed court requiring a motion for new trial to be made on a particular day, has been held to be repugnant to the constitutional provision that all courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>shall be open: 7 Yerg., 502. An act must be unconstitutional -which requires the citizen to pay revenue when the same is unjust, illegal, contrary to the statute, and a plain violation of a constitutional provision ; and such is the requirement of the act in question. This act .seems to be violative of fundamental principles of republican government, and a legislative encroachment upon the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-5\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is likewise authorized by ss. 3123 and 3124 of the Code. By reference to s. 17, art. 2, of the new Constitution, we have the following clause: \u201cAll acts which repeal, revive, or amend former laws, shall recite in their caption or otherwise the title or substance of the law repealed, revived, or amended.\u201d Neither in the caption or body of said act are these two sections of the Code mentioned, either by number, title, or in substance; nor is there any repealing clause in said act. The result of this omission is, that ss. 3123 and 3124 of the Code are not repealed by the act of 1873, c. 44.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-6\">The Circuit Judge allowed defendants to file their sworn answers, together with a number of exhibits and affidavits, on the motion to dismiss. This is error: <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Knab, </em>1 Tenn. B., 55; <em>King </em>v. <em>Rentfroe, </em>1 Tenn., 191; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>2 Tenn.

The facts upon which the same were made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-7\">Petitioners own 185 miles of. road from Louisville to Nashville, 31 miles of which lie in Sumner county, civil districts Nos. 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 19, including road-bed, occupying, in the aggregate, 241 acres, valued at $8,435; several depot grounds, and one .separate parcel of land. In Davidson county and the' State of Kentucky they own valuable engine-houses- and machine-shops, indispensable to running and operating their road. Also rolling stock, which is in. Sumner county only when in use, passing over the-road. Assessments were made upon their depot grounds- and tract of' land for the years 1873 and 1874, by the respective tax assessors in the several districts aforesaid, and the tax levied in pursuance thereof, aggregating $105. The amount assessed and levied for 1873 was paid. In June, 1874, petitioners were notified to appear before the County Judge of Sumner, and show cause why the road-bed, rolling stock, &amp;c., should not be assessed for taxation. They then and there proved the facts just recited, and insisted that their road-bed, rolling stock, &amp;c., as such, were not liable for taxation. But the County Judge assessed the road-bed, rolling stock, <em>&amp;o., </em>in Sumner county at the sum of $675,000, and a tax levied thereon for the year 1873 of 5,400 for state, county, school and sinking fund purposes. The assessment for 1874 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>$500,000. The assessments for both years were made upon the same basis, which was upon a valuation of the entire road-bed, rolling stock, equipments, engine-houses and machine-shops, in view of the special purposes and uses to which they were all applied, and the profits arising therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-5\">The act of 1873, c. 118, to provide more just and \u2022equitable laws for the assessment and collection of revenue for state and county purposes, relieves us of the necessity of reviewing the previous laws, since, by the 80th section of said act, all laws in conflict therewith are repealed. The 8th section thereof provides that \u201cno tax shall hereafter be assessed upon the capital of any bank, banking association, or of any other joint stock company; but the stockholders in such bank, banking association, or other corporations, shall be assessed and taxed on the value of their shares &lt;of stock therein.\u201d It is sufficient to render assessments made and tax levied on petitioners\u2019 property for 1873 and 1874 illegal, that the County Judge has not complied with the provisions of the act; fox', by it, the capital of no corporation in Tennessee is liable for taxation as such, but the individual shares of \u00abtook shall be assessed and taxed according to their value. If these corporations own real estate, the same is not exempt from taxation, but is subject thereto to the same extent and rate, and in the same manner, as other real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-6\">The power of taxation is derived by the legislative department of the government from art. 2, s. 28, of the Constitution, which is, that all property, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>real, personal or mixed, shall be taxed according to its value, and not according to the purposes for which the same may be used; or what it may be worth estimated and valued in connection with something in another county or state, but simply according to its value; that value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature may direct, so that taxes shall be equal and uniform throughout the State. Furthermore, no one species of property shall be taxed higher than any other species of property of the same value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-5\">If the property is to be assessed as real estate under the act of 1873, then the law governing the same is clear and unmistakable. By the 4th section of the act, real estate shall be assessed according to its market value, on a credit of one and two years, deducting fifteen per cent, in gross, in the district or ward where the same is situated. If the assessments made by the County Judge of $675,000 for 1873, and $500,000 for 1874, could be held to have been made upon the property of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company as real estate, while the same would not be in compliance with statutory law, in addition thereto, one species of property would be taxed higher than another. The real estate of this corporation lying in Sumner county numbers 241 acres, worth, as is alleged in the petition, $8,435. The same is assessed by the County Judge, and a tax levied thereon for one year of $5,400. An unequal and oppressive tax is contrary to law: 1 Hum., 232.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-6\">The road-bed, rolling stock, and such buildings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>are necessary and indispensable to tbe running of the road, are not real estate under the act of 1873. They compose a part of the capital stock of the company, which, by s. 8 of the act, is not liable to be assessed as such, but which is reached by a tax on the shares of stock in the hands \u25a0 of stockholders. The value of the shares of stock is controlled to a very great extent by the number, size and cost of the appurtenances of these corporations; and if the same are taxable as real estate, and in addition must pay the taxes required by this act, the result necessarily is double taxation. The petition alleges that the stockholders have been so assessed. All railroad companies own lands along the line of their road, especially in timbered sections of country, from which they supply cross-ties and fu\u00e9l. Such are the lands contemplated by said act which are to be taxed as other real estate; otherwise, no uniform rule can be laid down for making such assessments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-5\">The County Judge fixes' a value upon the entire line of road, with all its appurtenances, both in Tennessee and in Kentucky; then, there being 31 miles of the road in Sumner county and <em>185 miles </em>in Tennessee and Kentucky, he takes 31-185 of the whole value, by which method he arrives at a fictitious value for every mile of road in Sumner county, and thus he assesses the same for largely more than its actual value. All their costly bridges are in Davidson county and Kentucky \u2014 out of Sumner county. These are estimated by him in arriving at a value for each mile in Sumner. It is simply an absurdity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to say that every mile of petitioners\u2019 road in Sumner county, or in Tennessee and Kentucky, is of equal value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-5\">But other objections remain. If this mode of assessment be correct, then Davidson county must adopt the same rule as against petitioners, which estimates that portion of the road in Davidson as worth the same in proportion to the number of miles in the two counties, as in Sumner, when in point of fact, the road in Davidson is worth largely more than in Sumner, because all the valuable depot buildings, machine shops and engine houses of the company in Tennessee, and the railroad bridge across the Cumberland river, are in Davidson county. By this rule Sumner gets more than her proportion. Another objection is, that the officer of the law in making assessments and levying taxes, is confined to his own county and state, and therefore, he is strictly confined to property within his jurisdiction. In the assessment here, is included not only the buildings in Davidson county and Kentucky, above mentioned, but also the individual shares of non-resident stockholders. If any statute could be found authorizing such a course, the courts could not enforce the same, because tax laws are purely local and can have no extra-territorial operation: 15 Wall., 300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-6\">In the case of <em>Railroad Company </em>v. Jaekson, 7 Wall., 262, the Court held that a state had no power to tax the interest on bonds, secured by mortgage, given by a railroad corporation, binding every part of the road, when the same lies partially in another state; one road incorporated by two States. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>case of <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>The Ferry Go., </em>11 Wall., 423, the Court held that the ferry boats of a corporation, incorporated in one state, carrying passengers forward and backward across a river to a city in another state, are not taxable under a law taxing \u201cwithin the city,\u201d where the relation of the boats to the city was simply that of contact, as one of the termini of their voyages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-5\">In the case of <em>Louisville &amp; Portland Canal Co., </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Kentuehy, </em>one hundred acres of land owned by the company, were listed for taxation by the Commissioner at $1,000,000, considered in their improved state, including all improvements thereon. But all the property was situated in Jefferson county, within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner. Besides, the Commissioner acted under a statute in force in Kentucky, and upon which this decision was based, directing lands or town lots to be listed, adding their value \u201cconsidered in their improved state, including all improvements thereon.\u201d We have no such statute in Tennessee. Similar statutes were enacted in the different states in which such decisions were made; at least, as far as I have been able to extend my investigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-10\">The tax for the benefit of the Cumberland and Ohio Eailroad, involves the legality of the entire proceedings connected therewith. Contesting the collection of any tax, opens the investigation, not only as to the mode, but as to right of the assessment and levy of the tax. The Code, 1142, provides, that \u201cany county, incorporated town, or city, may subscribe for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>stock in railroads upon the following terms and conditions\u201d: minutely set out in 1143-49. Section 1150 provides, that as soon as the stock is subscribed, it is the duty of the County Court, or corporate authorities, to levy a tax sufficient to meet the instalments of subscription as made. This latter section contemplates a strict compliance with all terms and conditions prescribed in that chapter. For upon them is made to depend the right and power to subscribe the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b695-5\">Upon the application of Commissioners, a proposition was submitted to the legal voters of Sumner county, to take stock in said Cumberland &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, to the amount of $300,000, payable in the bonds of the county. An election was held, and without any order of the court subscribing said stock, or confirming the election, or recognizing the same as valid, the County Judge proceeded to issue some $80,000 or $100,000 of the bonds of the county. The County Court has levied' a tax sufficient to meet the interest on the entire amount of $300,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b695-6\">The subscription of stock by Sumner county in said Cumberland &amp; Ohio Railroad is void. By the Code, the election can be ordered only upon application made in writing by the Commissioners. But before this application can be made, the entire line of the road, in which the stock is proposed to be taken, shall be surveyed by a competent engineer, and substantially located by designating the terminii, and approximating the general direction of the road, and an estimate of the grading, embankments, and masonry, made by the engineer under oath. This survey, location, and esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>mate of the entire line, must be filed with the application for the order for election.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b696-5\">These are conditions \u2022 precedent, and the power of the County Court to order the election is vested only when these directions are followed. The chief engineer of the company in his report of the survey and estimate of grading, etc., says: \u201cIn compliance with the requirement of the Code of Tennessee, as set' forth in section 1145, ch. 3, title 8, I have caused surveys and estimates on that portion of the railroad contemplated from Nashville to Cincinnati, lying in Sumner county,\u201d which was done by E. F. Falconnet, a competent engineer. This report is not under oath. The latter under oath states, that \u201che has made a survey of the Cumberland <em>&amp; </em>Ohio Eailroad, located in Sumner county, from the State line to Gallatin, and then to a point of intersection on the Edgefield <em>&amp; </em>Kentucky Eailroad,\u201d giving in addition, the distance through Sumner county, and' estimated cost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b696-6\">The survey and estimate required by the statute, was of the entire line of the road from Nashville to Cincinnati, and not merely of that portion in Sumner county. Nor is the survey, \u201c from the State line to Gallatin, and thence to a point 'of intersection on the Edgefield <em>&amp; </em>Kentucky Eailroad,\u201d without mentioning or giving a general idea as to what point he commenced on the State line, and the same as to the point of intersection, such a substantial location, designating the termini, and approximating the general direction of the road, as meets the requirements of the law. These omissions are not mere irregularities, which render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>proceedings voidable, and of which advantage could be taken then, but not afterwards, but they are fatal to the proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-5\">By the act of 1851-2, e. 117, the County Courts of the respective counties, through which railways had been or might be thereafter, located, were authorized to subscribe stock therein through their chairman. As conditions precedent, however, \u25a0 the Sheriff was required to hold an election, after giving thirty days notice, specifying the amount of stock proposed to be taken, when payable, and the name of the company in which the stock was to be taken. In the case of the <em>Justices of Campbell County </em>v. <em>The Knoxville &amp; Kentucky R. R.

Section 4 authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>stock to be subscribed to an amount not exceeding one-tenth instead of one-fifteenth of its taxable property. The 5th section repeals section 1149 of the Code, which requires the money raised to be expended in the county in which the stock is taken, or as near thereto as practical. No other sections of the Code are amended or repealed by this act. Besides, the record from the County Court shows that the survey and estimate were made, and other proceedings had, under these several sections of the Code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-6\">\u2022 Another reason why the issuance of these bonds is not authorized by law, is, that it would be in direct violation of the Constitution. The distinction between giving or loaning credit to, or becoming a stockholder in such association or corporation, is clear. The Constitution recognizes the distinction: Art. 2, s. 29. Perhaps the origin of the distinction is this. In 1838, by legislative enactment, the State was authorized to become a stockholder in turnpike companies and other corporations. Stock was subscribed by the State under this act. But the losses of the State were so heavy, that in 1852, this law was repealed, and an act passed authorizing bonds to be issued, as a loan of the credit of the State to corporations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-8\">Art. 2, s. 29 of the Constitution provides, that \u201cthe credit of no county, city or town, shall be given, or loaned to, or in aid of any person, company, association, or corporation, except upon an election to be first held by the qualified voters, and the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast at said election. Nor shall any county, city, or town become a stockholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>with others in any company, association, or corporation, except upon a like election, and the assent of a like majority.\u201d Now, be it either to take stock or loan credit, the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast at the election, is necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-4\">But twenty-six counties, Sumner included, are excepted out, of the provisions of this section, so far that the assent of a majority of the qualified voters of either of said counties, voting on the question, shall be sufficient, when the credit of such county is given or loaned to any person, association, or corporation. To subscribe stock requires three-fourths of the votes cast; to a loan of credit, only a majority of the qualified voters of either of said counties voting is necessary. But this is a case of subscription of stock of $300,000; the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast, is required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-5\">But concede that the exception made in this provision of Constitution would apply. Then what would be required? \u201cA majority of the qualified voters of either of said counties voting on the question,\u201d not the assent of a majority of the votes cast. The word voting, here most clearly refers to counties, and not to the qualified voters. To give or loan the credit of either of said twenty-six counties, the assent of a majority of the qualified voters of the county must be obtained. Otherwise the expression <em>\u201c </em>a majority of the votes cast\u201d would have been employed, as is done in the same section of the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-6\">At the time of the election there were 4,500 qualified voters in Sumner county. 2,861 voted at said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>election, of that number, 1,781 voted in favor of, and 1,080 against subscription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b700-5\">But the argument is made that some of these bonds have passed into the hands of innocent purchasers and <em>bona fide </em>holders, and that as such, they are to be protected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b700-6\">This position would be correct, if the objections assigned were mere irregularities. But if a compliance with the requirements of the' Code, was indispensable, then the authority of the County Court to order the election, only existed when this was done. If done without, the election would be void. Neither could these parties, if such there be, shield themselves as innocent purchasers or holders of the .bonds, if we are correct in the construction we have given to the provision of the Constitution. A subscription of stock in a railroad by counties, is in the nature of a contract. The county must act through its officers as agents, who derive their authority to act, together with the manner in which the same is to be exercised, from the Constitution and statute books. <em>Ignorantia legis, exeusat neminem. </em>From these, persons may know the extent of the agent\u2019s authority, and whether the acts done are within the scope of their agency. If these bonds are void, <em>ah </em>initio, holders thereof could stand upon no higher ground than a <em>bona fide </em>holder of forged paper, who has never been protected by the courts as an innocent purchaser.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b700-7\">J.

In Great Britain .this complete power rests in the Parliament; in the American States it resides in the people themselves, as an organized body politic. But the people, by creating the Constitution of the United States, have delegated this power as to certain subjects, and under certain restrictions, to the Congress of the Union; and that portion they can not resume, except as it may be done through amendment of the National Constitution. Eor the exercise of the legislative power, subject to this limitation, they create, by their state constitutions, a legislative department, upon which they confer it; and granting it in general terms, they must be understood to grant the whole legislative power which they possessed, except so far as at the same time they saw fit to impose restrictions. While, therefore, the Parliament of Britain possesses completely the absolute and uncontrolled power of legislation, the legislative bodies of the American States possess the same power, except, <em>first, </em>as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>may. have been limited by the Constitution of the United States; and, <em>second, </em>as it may have been limited by the constitutions of the states. A legislative \u25a0act can not,, therefore, be declared void, unless its conflict with one of these two instruments can be pointed out.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b709-5\">* * * \u201cWhen a law of Congress is assailed as void, we look in the National Constitution to see if the grant of specified powers is broad enough to embrace it; but when a State law is attacked on the same ground, it is presumably valid in any case, and this presumption is a conclusive one, unless' in the Constitution of the United States or of the State we are able to discover that it is prohibited. We look in the Constitution of the United States for <em>grants </em>of legislative power, but in the Constitution of the-State to ascertain if any <em>limitations </em>have been imposed upon the complete power with which the legislative department of the State was vested in its creation. Congress can pass no law but such as the Constitution authorizes, either expressly or by clear implication; while the State Legislature has jurisdiction of all subjects on which its legislation is not prohibited\u201d: Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 172, 173; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bank oj Nashville, </em>Peck, 269.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b709-6\">Chief Justice Marshall, in one of the ablest -opinions delivered by him, has said of the taxing power: \u201c The power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of government, and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>government may choose to carry it. The only security against the abuse of this power is found in the structure of the government itself. In imposing a tax, the Legislature acts upon its constituents. This-is, in general, a sufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxation. The .people of a State, therefoi\u2019e, give to their government a right of taxing themselves and their property; and as the exigencies of' the government can not be limited, they prescribe no-limits to the exercise of this right, resting confidently on the interest of the legislator, and on the influence-of the constituents over their representative, to guard them against its abuse\u201d: <em>MoCulbeh </em>v. Maryland, 4 Wheaton, 428.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b710-5\">\u201cThe power to impose taxes is one so unlimited in force and so searching in extent, that the courts-scarcely venture to declare that it is subject to any restrictions whatever, except such as rest in the discretion of the authority which exercises it. It reaches-to every trade or occupation; to every object of industry, use, or enjoyment; to every species of possession; and it imposes a burden which, in case of failure to discharge it, may be followed by seizure and sale or confiscation of property. No attribute of sovereignty is more pervading, and at no point does the power of the government affect more constantly and intimately all the relations of life than through the exactions made under it. Taxes are defined to be burdens or charges imposed by the legislative power upon persons or property, to raise money for public purposes. The power to tax. rests upon necessity, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>is inherent in every sovereignty. The Legislature of every free State will possess it under the general grant of legislative power, whether particularly specified in the constitution among the powers to be exercised by it or not. No constitutional government can exist without it, and no arbitrary government without regular and steady taxation could be anything but ah oppressive and vexatious despotism, since the only alternative to taxation would be a forced extortion for the needs of government from such persons' or objects as the men in power might select as victims\u201d: Cooley\u2019s Const.

It is an elaborate and learned opinion. He says: \u201c Tested by the common and statute law of England prior to the emigration of our ancestors, and by the laws of many of the States at the time of the adoption of this amendment, the proceedings authorized by the act of 1820 can not be denied to be due process of law, when applied to the ascertainment and recovery of balances due to the government from a collector of customs, unless there exists in the Constitution some other provision- which restrains Congress from authorizing such proceedings. Eor, though \u2018due process of law\u2019 generally implies and includes <em>actor, reus, judex, </em>regular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled course of judicial proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>mgs: 2 Inst., 47, 50; <em>Hoke </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>4 Devereux (N.

There may be, and we have seen that there are, cases under the law of England, after <em>magna charta, </em>and as it was brought to this country, and acted on here, in which process, in its nature final, issues against the body, lands and goods of certain public debtors, without any such trial; and this brings us to the question, whether those provisions of the Constitution which relate to the judicial power are incompatible with 'these proceedings?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b712-5\">Again: <em>\u201c </em>The power to ' collect and disburse revenue, and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying that power into effect, includes all known and appropriate means of effectually collecting and disbursing that revenue, unless some such means should be forbidden in some other part of the \u2022 Constitution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b712-6\">And again; \u201c It may be added, that probably there are few governments which do or can permit their claims for public taxes, either on the citizen or the officers employed for their collection or disbursement, to become subjects of judicial controversy, according to the course of the law of the land. Imperative necessity has forced a distinction between such claims and all others, which has sometimes been carried out by summary methods of proceeding, and sometimes by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>systems of fines and penalties, but always in some way observed and yielded to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b713-5\">He still further adds: \u201cThough, generally, both public and private wrongs are redressed through judicial action, there are more summary extra judicial remedies for both. An instance of extra judicial redress of a private wrong is the recapture of goods by their lawful owner; of a public wrong by a private person, is the abatement of a public nuisance; and the recovery of public dues by a summary process of distress, issued by some public officer authorized by law, is an instance of redress of a particular kind of public wrong, by the act of the public through its authorized agents. There is, however, an important distinction between these. Though a private person may retake his property, or abate a nuisance, he is directly responsible for his acts to the proper judicial tribunals. His authority to do these acts depends not merely on the law, but upon the existence of such facts as are, in point of law, sufficient to constitute that authority; and he may be required, by an action at law, to prove those facts, but a public agent, who acts pursuant to the command of a legal precept, can justify his act by the production of such precept. He can not be made responsible in a judicial tribunal for obeying the lawful command of the government; and the government itself, which gave the command, can not be sued without its own consent. At the. same time there can be no doubt that the mere question, whether a collector of the customs is indebted to the United States, may be one of judicial cognizance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>It is competent for the United States to sue any of its debtors in a court of law. It is equally clear that the United States may consent to be sued, and may yield this consent upon such terms and under such restrictions as it may think just. Though both the marshal and the government are exempt from suit for anything done by the former in obedience to legal process, still Congress may provide by law that both, or either, shall, in a particular class of cases, and under such restrictions as they may think proper to impose, come into a court of law or equity and abide by its determination. The United States may thus place the government upon the same ground which is occupied by private persons who proceed to take extra judicial remedies for their wrongs, and they may do so to such extent, and with such restrictions, as may be thought fit\u201d: <em>City of Philadelphia </em>v. <em>The Collector, </em>5 Wall., 420; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United States, </em>7 Wall., 122.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b714-5\">The act of Congress of July 13, 1866, c. 184, s. 19, prohibited suits for the recovery of taxes alleged to have been paid illegally, except upon certain conditions therein set forth: 14 U.

He says: \u201cIt has been again and again decided, under every variety of state constitution intended to secure \u2018trial by jury/ \u2018due process of law/ and the \u2018inviolability of private property/ that the political power may appropriate it by any summary mode which the wisdom of the Legislature may prescribe, and that neither the novelty nor the injustice of the form will warrant judicial interference. The following are but a small portion of the numerous judgments establishing the principle and illustrating the tendency in our country to question and demand the reiteration of the oldest and best settled governmental powers.

By the term joint-stock corporation, we would be understood to mean such a corporation as has for its object a \u25a0dividend of profits among its stockholders. A corporation of this sort is invariably empowered to raise a certain amount of capital, by the mutual subscriptions \u25a0of its members, and this capital is divided into shares, which are made to vest in the subscribers according to their respective contributions; and they entitle the holders of them to a corresponding proportionate part of the profits of the undertaking. * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b722-7\">A share in one of these companies may be defined to be a right to partake, according to the amount of the party\u2019s subscription, of the surplus profits obtained from the use and disposal of the capital stock of the company to those purposes for which the company is constituted. It is believed to be not unusual for the act of incorporation to provide that this interest shall be personal property, though it must be so regarded independently of any enactment to that effect; and this, notwithstanding it arises, in a measure, out of realty, it being the surplus profit only that is divisible among the individual shareholders. The land, buildings, etc., of canal, turnpike and railroad companies, are the mere instruments whereby the joint-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>stock of the company is made to produce that profit; and, moreover, belong exclusively to the corporate body, \u25a0which is altogether \u00e1 separate person from the individual members \u201d: Ang. &amp; Ames on Corp., (9th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 556-7; <em>Bradley </em>v. Holdsworth, 3 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 334; <em>Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>10 Met., 595.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b723-5\">The same principles were ruled in the case of the <em>Union Bank of Tennessee </em>v. <em>The State, </em>9 Yer., 490.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b723-6\">In that case the Court said: \u2018But this Court, in the case of <em>Brightwell, adm\u2019r, </em>v. <em>Mallory et ais., </em>has said, \u201cthat is a mistake to suppose that the stock of an individual consists of so much money owned by him in bank; the money in the bank is the property of the institution, and to the ownership of which the stockholder has no more claim, than a person who is not at all connected with the bank. The stockholder has an entire and perfect ownership over his own stock, and may sell and transfer\u2019 it to whomsoever he pleases, and from doing which the bank has no power to restrain him.\u2019 It necessarily follows that the capital stock of the bank can not be taxed as the property of the stockholder, as he has no legal title to any portion of' it, but only the immediate right to receive his share of the dividends as they are declared, and the remote right to his share of the effects on hand at the dissolution of the institution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b723-8\">The decision was made in 1836, nearly forty years ago. It has never been called in question, so far as we know, since it has been rendered. On the contrary, another Convention was called in this State in 1870. It re-adopted, in substance, the provisions, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>this point, of the Constitution of 1834. They did' this with a judicial exposition thereof, made as aforesaid, standing unquestioned for about thirty-four years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b724-5\">No principle is more plainly established, than that such re-adoption is made, with the distinct intention to embrace within the provisions of the Constitution, the .exposition thereof rendered by the highest tribunal in the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b724-6\">In <em>Van Allen </em>v. <em>The Assessors, </em>3 Wall., 384, the Supreme Court of the United States, say: \u201c The interest of the shareholder entitles him to participate in the nett profits earned by the bank in the employment of its capital, during the existence of its charter, in proportion to the number of his shares; and, upon its dissolution or termination, to his proportion of the property that may remain of the corporation after the payment of its debts. This is a distinct, independent interest or property, held by the shareholder, like any other property that may belong to him. Now, it is this interest which the act of Congress has left subject to taxation by the States, under the limitations prescribed, as will be seen on referring to it <em>\u201d </em>: <em>National Panic </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Wall., 358; <em>People </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>4 Wall., .244.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b724-9\">In the case of the- <em>National Panic </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Wall., 358, Judge Miller, in delivering the opinion of the Court, says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b724-10\">\u201cIn the several recent decisions concerning the taxation of the shares of the National Banks, as regulated by sections forty and forty-one of the Act of Congress of June 3d, 1864, it has been established as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the law governing this Court, that the property or interest of a stockholder in an incorporated bank, commonly called a share; the shares in their aggregate totality being called sometimes the capital stock of the bank; is a different thing from the moneyed capital of the bank held and owned by the corporation. This capital may consist of cash, or of bills and notes discounted, or of real estate combined with these. The whole of it may be invested in the bonds of the government, or in bonds of the states, or in bonds and mortgages. In whatever it may be invested, it is owned by the bank as a corporate entity, and not by the stockholders. A tax upon this capital is a tax upon the bank, and we have held that when that capital was invested in the securities of the government it could not be taxed, nor could the corporation be taxed as the owner of such securities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-5\">On the other hand, we have held that the shareholders, or stockholders, by which is meant the same thing, may be taxed by the states on shares so held by them, although all the capital of the bank be invested in Federal securities, provided the taxation does not violate the rule prescribed by the act of 1864\u201d: <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Arnwud, </em>9 Adolphus <em>&amp; </em>Ellis, (N. S.) 806.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b725-7\">Now, we have selected for the purpose of this argument, on this point, the strongest cases to be found \u2014cases in which the capital stock of the corporation was positively exempted from taxation \u2014 and in which, nevertheless, the shares of stock, are held subject to taxation as the distinct, independent, and private indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>vidual property of the stockholders. In this State we have seen that such shares are by statute declared to be personal property, and, as such, subject to execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-5\">No substantial distinction exists between a bank corporation and a railroad corporation. Angel\u00ed <em>&amp; </em>Ames, as already shown, place all joint stock corporations, in this respect, on the same footing: <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>14 Gratt., 385; <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Nashau, </em>46 N. H., 398; <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>12 Allen, 322; Redf. Sup, to Law of Railways, 507-10; The Delaware Railroad-Tax, 18 Wall., 229; <em>State </em>v. <em>Petway, </em>2 Jones\u2019 Eq.. (N. C.) 396.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-6\">In this case, if there had been a positive exemption of the capital stock of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company, from taxation, in its charter, such exemption would not have prevented the State from taxing the individual shares of the stockholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-7\">We conclude, consequently, that the taxation of the individual shares of the stockholders, residents, and citizens of Sumner county, Tennessee, in the Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co., all other questions aside, was constitutional and legal; and that such taxation interposes no objection to the taxation of the property of said corporation by the State, or to the assessment sought to be superseded in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b726-8\">But we add: the stockholders are not parties to this proceeding. . Their rights, as such, are not involved. We have to deal with the corporation, as such. Certainly, the corporation, in this proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>can not be heard to complain that its stockholders, as such, have been unconstitutionally or illegally taxed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-4\">3. It is next insisted, that the Tax Act ' of Tennessee, approved March 25, 1873, exempts, and especially by force of the eighth section thereof, said corporation from the taxes assessed and levied against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-5\">Our answer to the position last aforesaid, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-6\">1. Said act, and especially said eighth section, on a fair construction thereof, does embrace the railroad corporations of Tennessee, or the Louisville <em>&amp; </em>Nashville R. R. Co.; and the provisions' of said act of 1873, other than said eighth section, do declare the property of said corporation taxable, and provide details for its assessment and taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-7\">2. The property of the corporation taxed in this case is not the capital of the Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co., within the sense of said eighth section, on the assumption said corporation is held to be embraced therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-8\">3. Assuming that both these immediately preceding positions should be ruled against the. State, then we maintain, that said proviso, by its .terms real estate, includes all the property, which we contend is subject to be assessed and taxed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b727-9\">4. The exemption of any property by the Legislature of Tennessee, since the Constitution of 1870, except in the cases therein specified, is unconstitutional. The Louisville <em>&amp; </em>Nashville R. R. Co., does not fall within any of said exceptions. The \u201ccorporations\u201d therein specified are municipal corporations. Nor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>there any exemption contained in the charter of said railroad company, or by virtue of any contract between said company and the State. The Constitution of the State provides, art. 2, s. 28: \u201cAll property, real, personal, or mixed, shall Be taxed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-5\">The property of the corporation, and the property of the stockholders therein, are essentially distinct and separate property; and the taxation of the individual stockholder is no taxation of the corporation, and conversely. Then, where is the constitutional legislative authority to prescribe that the property of the stockholder shall be taxed, and the property of the corporation shall not? We shall not return to this proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-6\">Sec. 1 of the act of 1873, is: \u201c That all property, real, personal, and mixed, shall be assessed for taxation, except such as is declared exempt in the next section.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-7\">See. 2 defines all exemptions; and the property of railroad corporations is not among them, in any aspect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-8\">Sec. 4 provides as follows: \u201cThat the basis of all assessments shall be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b728-9\">\u201c 1.

An appeal was taken from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the assessment, by the company, to the County Court, under the last clause of the statute of 1819, (2 Stat. Law, 1376,) and a motion made to reduce the valuation to one hundred thousand dollars. The motion failed by a division of the Court, and the company have appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-6\">\u201c The proof shows clearly, that if the canal be embraced and estimated in the valuation, that the amount will at least equal, if not exceed, the value found by the commissioner. That the cut or canal, together with all locks, dams, bridges, and houses, should be taken into the estimate in fixing the value, we can not doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-10\">\u201cThe 7th section of the statute of 1831, (2 Stat.

All such improvements add to the value of the freehold, and should be estimated in the valuation of the same for taxation. And whether such lands, with their improvements, belong to an individual or a corporation, they are equally subject to taxation according to their increased value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u201cHad the land through which the canal has beeni excavated, been owned by an individual, with capital sufficient to make the canal, locks, etc., there could be no doubt that he would have had the right to do so, and to exact tolls at his discretion, from all those who might choose to use the same in avoiding the dangers of the falls. And' if so, he surely would be subject to taxation on the property thus increased in value by the improvements and consequent increase in value, by reason of the issues and profits springing out of the same. If so, we can see no good reason why a corporation owning the same property, should not be subject to taxation in the same manner and at the same valuation, as if owned by an individual. The charter contains no restriction on the right of taxation, which is a sovereign right, and should never be regarded as surrendered, limited or restricted in the grant of a charter or creation of a corporation, unless there be express terms of surrender, limitation or restriction. The property of the corporation lies in the state, and is protected by the laws of the state, and may be taxed here whether the shareholders live here or elsewhere, as the real estate, with ihe improvements, of individuals lying here may be taxed, whether the owners live here ' or elsewhere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b737-5\">The rule laid down by the Supreme Court of Illinois, in the case of <em>The State of Illinois </em>v. <em>The Illinois Central Railroad Co., </em>27 111., 64, is thus stated: \u201cThis clause has been understood to mean, the value at the time of taxation or assessment. Values are fluctuating and changable, as all experience shows. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Nor is it easy, at any one period of time, to lay down a general and satisfactory rule of certain application, in all cases, for the purpose of ascertaining the value of many kinds of property subject to taxation. Where property has a known and determinate value ascertained by commerce in it, as in most kinds of personal property, or fixed by law as money, there can be no difficulty. But there are many kinds of property, as to which the assessor has no such satisfactory guide. Such is peculiarly the case with railroad property, and other similar property, constructed not only for the profit of the owners, but for the accommodation of the public, under the sanction and by the exercise of the sovereign power of the state. In such cases the inquiry should be, what is the property worth, to be used for the purposes for which it is constructed, and not for any other purpose to which it might be applied or converted, or for which it ihight be used. In such cases, if the property is devoted to the use for which it was designed, and is in a condition to produce its maximum income, one very important element for ascertaining its present value is discovered, and that is its net profits. When property is thus improved, it is manifest that it is more or less valuable, as it yields a greater or less profit, in its productive and commercial use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"255\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b738-5\">In assessing real property belonging to a railway company, consisting of a strip of land but a few rods in width, upon which the railroad track is located, with the necessary stations, buildings, etc., the land should not be assessed as an isolated piece of prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>erty, but as part of the whole railway; and its value should be estimated in connection with its position, and the business and profit derived therefrom: <em>The People </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>48 N.

The Rockford, Rock Island &amp; St. Louis Railroad Go., </em>recently decided, and not yet reported, except in pamphlet form, the Supreme \u25a0Court of Illinois say: \u201c There is, moreover, an almost insuperable difficulty which must attend all attempts by local assessors to assess the capital stock, franchise, roadway and rolling stock of most railroad companies. Such roads are usually located through several counties. The cost of construction in a particular town or county affords no criterion of the value of that portion of the road, for every mile of the road is equally indispensable to its existence as a whole, and contributes, proportionally, to its principal earnings. Local improvements may, indeed, vary, and they are required to be assessed by the local assessors; but the road and its equipments constitute a single, entire property. In determining the value of such property, the question is neither one of original cost nor of the intrinsic value of the various items of which the road and its equipment is composed, taken separately; but what is It worth, with all its capacities and facilities; as a railroad? The franchise- extends to the entire corporate property, and it is not possible that it can be divided. It must, if assessed at all, be assessed as an entirety, and this, as we have already shown, may be in connection with the'\u201d property to which it is attached\u201d: <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Peniston, </em>18 Wall., 5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"269\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b741-6\"><em>Sixth. </em>We maintain that the rolling stock is a part of the road \u2014 constitutes, in the sense of the law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>fixtures thereto; and that the real, actual, aggregate value thereof must be apportioned to the road, in its entire length of 185 miles, from Louisville to Nashville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"270\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-5\">The common law is progressive; it expands to meet the new and varied exigencies of society and civilization; and the enlightened courts of our own State have, from time to time, recognized and applied this principle: <em>Jaeob </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 Hum., 519.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"271\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b742-6\">This question came before the Supreme Court of New York in the case of <em>The Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Oo. </em>v. <em>Hendriehson, </em>25 Barb., 484. Strong, Judge, said: \u201cThe property of a railway company consists mainly of the road-bed, the rails upon it, the depot erections, and the rolling stock, and the franchise to hold and use them. The road-bed, the rails fastened to it, and the buildings at the depots are clearly real property. That the locomotives, and passenger, baggage and freight cars, are a part, and a necessary part, of the entire establishment, there can be no doubt. Are they so permanently and inseparably connected with the more substantial realty as to become constructively fixtures? Railways being a modern invention, and of a novel character, we have no decisions upon this question, and those relating to and governing old and familiar subjects do not absolutely control us, although we must necessarily resort to them as guides. Judge Weston well remarks, in <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Stachpole, </em>6 Greenl., 157, that modern times have been fruitful of inventions and improvements for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the more secure and comfortable use of buildings, as well as of many other things which administer to the enjoyment of life. \"Venetian blinds, which admit the air and exclude the sun, whenever it is desirable so to do, are of modern use; so are lightning-rods, which have now become common in this country and in Europe. Those might be removed from buildings without damage; yet, as suited and adapted to the buildings upon which they are placed, and as incident thereto, they are doubtless part of the inheritance, and would pass by a deed as appertaining thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"272\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b743-5\">\u201cThe general principles of law must be applied to new kinds of property, as they spring into existence in the progress of society, according to their nature and incidents, and the common sense of the community. It may be that if an appeal should be made to the common sense of the community, it would be determined that the term 'fixtures\u2019 could not well be applied to such movable carriages as railway cars. But such cars move no more rapidly than do pigeons from a dove-cote, or fish in a pond, both of which are annexed to the realty. Judge Cowen admits, in Walker, v. <em>Sherman, </em>that a machine, movable in itself may become a fixture, from being connected in its operations by boards, or in any other way, with the permanent machinery. It \u2022 results from many cases that it is not absolutely necessary that things should be stationary in any one place or position, in order that they should be technically deemed fixtures. The movable quality of these cars has frequently, if not generally, induced the opinion that they are personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>property. Hence, railway mortgages of rolling stock have, as I understand, been generally filed in the offices of the clerks of all the towns through which the roads pass. That was undoubtedly the more prudent course, as it saved any question as to the character of the property. Even the learned counsel for the plaintiffs has gone no further than to denominate the cars <em>\u2018quasi\u2019 </em>fixtures. Public opinion, however, although respectable in matters of fact, is an unsafe guide as to legal distinctions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"273\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b744-5\">\u201cThat railway cars are a necessary part of the entire establishment, without which it would be inoperative and valueless, there can of course be no doubt. Their wheels are fitted to the rails; they are constantly upon the rails, and except in cases of accidents, or when taken off for repairs, nowhere else; they are not moved off the land belonging to the company; they are peculiarly adapted to the use of the railway, and in fact can not be applied to any other purpose; they are not like farming utensils, and possibly the machinery in factories and many of the movable appliances to stores and dwellings; the objects of general trade; they are permanently used on the particular road where they are employed, and are seldom, if ever, changed to any other. Many of these are strong characteristics of the realty; some of them have often been deemed conclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"274\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b744-6\">\u201c In <em>Imshington </em>v. <em>Sewell, </em>1 Simons, 435, 480, Vice Chancellor Hart was inclined to think the devise of a West India (real) estate passed the stock of slaves, cattle and implements, because such things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>are essential to render the estate productive, and denuded of them, it would rather be a burden than a benefit. The reason assigned appears to be sound; but the Vice Chancellor carried the doctrine further than the cases would warrant, as slaves (in the West Indies), cattle and implements of husbandry, were objects of general commerce. In the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Inhabitants of St. Nicholas, </em>Caldecott, 276, (cited by Judge Cowen, 20 Wend., 269) it was decided that a steelyard, being in a machine-shop, was a fixture. Lord Mansfield said: 'The principal purpose of the house is for weighing. The steelyard is the most valuable part of the house. The house, therefore, applied to this use, may be said to be built for the steelyard, and not the steelyard for the house/ Surely this reasoning is equally applicable to the cars on a railway. The railway is constructed expressly for the business to be done by the cars, and what evinces their essentiality in a strong point of view in this case is, that there can be no tolls, which are expressly mortgaged, without them. It is remarked by Mr. Dane, in his Abridgment (vol. 3, p. 157), that certain articles were 'very properly a part of the real estate and inheritance, and pass with it, because not the mere fixing and fastening to it is alone to be regarded, but the use, nature and intention/ Judge Weston, in the case which I have cited from 6 Greenl., in speaking of a saw-mill, said: 'If you exclude (from the realty) such parts of the machinery as may be detached without injury to the other parts, or to the building, you have it mutilated and incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>p\u00edete, and insufficient to perform its intended operations/ Surely all this would be true of a railway, for it is nothing without its locomotive vehicles. It is true that no mechanical or agricultural business can be carried on to much extent without tools or farming implements, and such tools and implements are universally conceded to be personal property; but then such tools or implements are not peculiarly adapted or confined to any particular establishment, but may be used upon them generally, and are subjects of frequent barter. It is different, I admit, as to the stationary machinery in a factory, and articles of a similar character in a dwelling-house, which are not absolutely fastened; but although they are considered as personal property for reasons peculiar to them, and not of universal application, yet such reasons do not seem to me sufficient, while many things become fixtures without physical annexation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"275\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b746-5\">Judge Bedfield says of this case: \u201cThis opinion is certainly plausible, and it is impossible to say that the views here maintained will not, or may not, ultimately prevail. There is, no doubt, justice and convenience in such a view. But it seems to us somewhat a departure from the general law of fixtures in this country, and at variance with generally received notions upon that subject, at present, when carried to the extent of declaring the rolling stock of a railway a fixture \u201d: 2 Bedf. on Bailw., (4th ed.) 483.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"276\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b746-6\">The same doctrine is supported by the courts of Illinois.

It is not necessary in all cases that things should be actually affixed to the freehold, in order to constitute a part of it for the purpose of transfer and sale. Take the case of mill-stones, which are constantly being taken up and sharpened: when up, they are as much a part of the mill as when in their beds, and would pass by a deed or mortgage of the mill, if they had been, in fact, detached for six months. So of various kinds of machinery, as a screw, or cutting engine, or lathe, where \u00e1 great multitude of different sized pinions or cutters are kept on hand, but only one of which can be used at a time. All of these are necessary to make the complete machine, and. would pass by a sale of the factory as being a part of it, but with no more propriety than is the rolling stock a part of the railroad.

Therefore, the assessment law was framed so as to tax it through, the shareholder and exempt the corporation; unless it appeared that the shareholder was exempt from taxation, and in that event the corporation was taxed. In this way the property would be taxed either through the corporation or the shareholders, but it could be taxed but once; and as our shareholders have been taxed to the full market value of their shares, the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co., as a corporation, can not again be taxed in regard to the very property represented .by those shares, and upon which their value depends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"304\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b752-6\">Ve are aware of the decisions of this Court, and of the United States Supreme Court, to the effect that the corporation is the legal owner of the capital, and of all the property of the corporation, and can deal with it as absolutely as a private individual can deal with his own,\u2019 while the stockholders are the owners of their respective shares of stock, which are a distinct independent interest, or property held by the stockholder like any other property that may belong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>to him.

There is no pretense for assuming that the road passing through the rolling lands of Sumner county cost as much per mile as that part of. it which crosses the mountain ranges of Kentucky, and the large and numerous- rivers of that state, which are spanned by iron bridges of the most costly character. The cost of the road-bed as it runs through the sparsely settled poor lands of Sumner county, bears no proportion to the lands occupied in the cities of Nashville, Franklin, Bowling Green, Elizabethtown and Louisville, all of which is estimated' as a part of the \u201c whole length of the line.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"316\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-8\">The assessment law expressly requires that property shall be assessed \u201cin the district or ward in which it lies\u201d: Acts 1873, p. 169, s. 4, \u00b6 4.

In England it is distributed among the several parishes, not in proportion to the length of the railway, but in proportion to the actual earnings in each parish: 2 Redf. Railw., p. 179 (3d ed.); this is manifestly the only fair mode as between the several counties of the same state. The Louisville <em>&amp; </em>Nashville Railroad Co. have but ten miles of road in Davidson county, while they have over thirty miles in Sumner \u2014 and yet their profits upon the Davidson county business is probably ten times as much as the profits upon the Sumner county business; and yet, if the net earnings were divided. between these two counties in proportion to the length of road within their respective limits, Sumner county would get three times as much tax from the road as Davidson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"319\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b761-5\">It is useless, however, to discuss the merits of a tax upon the net earnings of a railroad; for the Constitution of Tennessee requires property to be taxed according to its value, and permits no income tax, except .\u201ca tax:upon incomes derived from stocks and bonds that are not taxed <em>ad valorem,\u201d </em>Const., art. 2, s. 28. Even if the Constitution ,.were not in the. way&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>the Legislature would probably never levy an income tax, owing to the fact that odious and inquisitorial assessment laws are requisite for its collection.

The State of Kentucky has the_ same right as Tennessee to tax the net earnings of this road; and whether she insists upon levying her tax in proportion to the length of the road, or the profits earned in her state, she would get the advantage of . this State. This State might retaliate upon Kentucky by disregarding the proportion claimed by her; but it would be a cruel injustice' upon the railroad for Tennessee to impose a double tax upon earnings which the State of Kentucky had already taxed. The only safe plan to avoid conflicts between the states, and at the same time do justice between the states and the railroads, is to adhere strictly to our Constitution \u2014 tax only such property as is within our boundaries, and tax that as we tax all other real estate, by the number of acres and upon the value per acre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"321\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-10\">In the case of the <em>Albany &amp; Schenectady JR,.

A portion thereof, nearly ten miles in length, rail within the town of Watervliet. The principal office of the plaintiff was in the city of Albany. The defendants, who were the assessors of the town of Watervliet, assessed $250,000 as the valuation of that part of the railway which lay within the said town, being all the real estate belonging to the railway in said town, which sum the assessors arrived at by estimating the entire worth of the plaintiff\u2019s road, considering the lucrativeness and income thereof, and taking the same proportion of said worth that the length of the said road in the town of Watervliet bore to. the whole length thereof. The actual value of that part of the plaintiff\u2019s railway, including the land on which it was laid and the fixtures connected with the same, lying within . the said town, and detached from the remainder of the road, did not exceed $60,000, beyond which last valuation the plaintiff insisted it could not be legally assessed. The New York statute provides that \u201call real or personal estate liable to taxation shall be estimated and assessed by the assessors at its full and true value, as' they would appraise the same in payment of a just debt due from a solvent debtor.\u201d Upon the foregoing state of facts the Supreme Court- of New York held \u201cthat no distinction was made between the property of a corporation and that of an individual;\u201d that the assessors \u201care simply to ascertain the value of the land, and of the erections or fixtures thereon, irrespective of the consideration whether the road is well or ill managed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>or whether it is profitable to the stockholders or otherwise. Such property is to be appraised in the same manner as the .adjacent lands belonging to individuals, and without reference to other parts of the railway. In estimating the value of an adjacent farm, it certainly would not be permitted to take into consideration the skill with which it was managed, nor the means bv which high prices were obtained for the produce. These would change with every occupant and perhaps with every year. If such a course were proper, two adjoining farms of equal extent and fertility, and equally distant from market, might be very unequally taxed in the same town, because the one was occupied by a poor farmer and yielded no profit, and because the other was managed with an amply rewarded skill and industry. Such a course of proceeding would levy an income tax, or at least a tax upon skill and thrift rather than upon the value of the land itself.\u201d Under the statute the income of the road was not taxable; nor in the taxation of either its real or personal estate was the profitableness of the road to be taken into account. The court therefore held that the actual value of that part of the railway, including the land on which it was kid and the fixtures connected with the same, lying within said town, and detached from the remainder of the road, was the value at which it should be assessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"322\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-5\">In the case of the <em>Albany &amp; West Stoekbridge E.

On its route it passed for about nine miles through the town of Canaan in \"the State of New York, and the quantity of land occupied by it in that town was ninety acres, worth about fifty dollars per acre, and with the erections, superstructure and fixtures upon the road in that town, did not exceed in value $45,000. The assessors nevertheless assessed it at $300,000, arriving, at that sum, as plaintiffs averred, by valuing the road at the cost thereof and estimating the income and productiveness thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"323\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b765-5\">The Supreme Court of New York, affirming- the case in 12 Barb., 223, cited above, held that it was '\u201cthe duty of the assessors to estimate the section of. the plaintiffs\u2019 road within their jurisdiction at its full and true value. In ascertaining this value, the superstructure and fixtures, every thing annexed to the land, was to be taken into the account. But whether the stock was above or below par, or whether the business of the road was productive or unproductive, were questions with which the assessors had nothing to do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"324\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b765-6\">In the case of the <em>Sangamon &amp; Morgan JR.

Naples in Scott county, through Morgan county, to Springfield in Sangamon county, in the State of Illinois, a distance of fifty-five miles in all, twenty-seven miles of which were in Morgan county. The entire road-bed was assessed at $125,000, .and Morgan county claimed the right to assess for state and county taxes on-27-55 of this amount. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Supreme Court of Illinois held, that the jurisdiction \u2022of the county court to levy the tax did not extend beyond its own limits, and therefore their mode of valuation was improper. In the language of the court, \u201cinstead of valuing and assessing the twenty-seven miles of road which is situated in Morgan county, an undivided portion of the whole road was assessed and taxed. The valuation should have been of, and the assessment upon, that portion of the road which was situate in Morgan county.\u201d \u201cWe can not know,\u201d say the court, \u201cnor is it even probable, that each mile or portion of the road was of equal value. It is not probable that each portion of the road was equally profitable or productive. One portion of the road may be badly constructed and another well constructed. One portion may have heavy grades and curves, and another portion be level and straight. In some places the land occupied by the road may be very valuable, while in other places it may be nearly valueless. All of these considerations must be taken into, account in ascertaining the value of any portion of the road. But admitting that each portion of the road was of equal value, still the valuation should have been of that specific part which was within the county, and not of an undivided part <em>of </em>the whole road, portions, of which are- within two other counties. A farm or a field might be divided by a county line, but- in such case the valuation should not be of the whole farm or field, and the assessment made upon such valuation in proportion to the quantity situated in the county for which the tax is levied. Each county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>must assess and tax the real property within its limits and no other.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"325\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b767-5\">In the case of the <em>Chicago &amp; N.

But say the Supreme Court of Illinois: \u201c This, in our opinion, does not follow. So far as the return in McHenry county is concerned, <em>non con-stat, </em>but that it was proper and necessary to place that valuation upon it in order to put it on the basis established by the assessors of that county for assessing the property of individuals therein. What may have been just in McHenry county may not have been just at the time the return was made by the railroad in Boone county. So that they returned their property as. high as individuals in Boone county, they complied with the law as enforced against the taxpayers of Boone county and the same of McHenry county.

It was insisted that the value of the whole apparatus in all the parishes in which it was situate should be ascertained, and then divided among said several parishes according to the quantity of land occupied by the apparatus in each parish; but the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench replied that if this principle be correct, every square foot of land occupied by the apparatus is to be rated at the same rate, without regard to the situation or nature of the land, whether it was originally part of a barren heath, like Putney heath, or part of the market ground of Fulham; and without regard to whether it be merely land occupied by pipes under the surface of the highway, or whether it be land upon which expensive buildings have been erected for the purpose of converting it into- filtering beds or reservoirs. We have no difficulty in saying that this principle is not correct, and that we can not sanction it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"327\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b768-5\">It will be argued, however, that while it may be right to confine the assessment of each county to that portion of the railroad which lies within its own limits, yet regard may be had to the fact that it' is a component part of an entire line, and as such, has a value far exceeding what it would have were it detached from the balance of the line and operated as a separate railroad.' That a railroad from Nashville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>to Louisville is more valuable than one from Nashville to the Kentucky line may be true, but the State of Tennessee has no right to tax a railroad lying beyond her limits, and as the only part of the railroad within her jurisdiction lies between Nashville and the state line, that is the only part of it that this State can legally tax. So a railroad from the state line to Nashville is more valuable than one whose terminii are on the north and south boundaries of Sumner county; but Sumner county can only tax such a railroad as she finds within her jurisdiction, and can not add to that value by looking beyond her limits. The question is, what is that part of the railroad worth that lies within her own limits? And to arrive at this, she has no right to estimate the value of the whole road and then assume to take a certain proportion of it; for if, by taking such a proportion of the value of the whole road, she gets a larger sum than she would by taking the value of only so much of the road as lies within her own limits, she is ceiv tain to get a tax upon values that do not exist within her own jurisdiction, and which therefore she has no right to tax. If Sumner county may thus get the benefit of values beyond her jurisdiction, so may every other county upon the line, and we may thus be compelled to pay upon the same values twenty different times.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"328\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b769-5\">It is said, however, that the road-bed and superstructure should be taxed as a railroad, and not as farming land; that our road-bed is worthless for farm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ing purposes, that our iron and cross-ties would be worth only what they would bring as so much old material, and in that way we - would escape from all but- a nominal taxation. We do not insist that our land should be' taxed lower than the adjacent lands, merely because we have rendered them useless for farming purposes by the way we have constructed our road. On the contrary, we stand ready to pay as high a tax upon every acre of ground we own in Sumner county as any adjacent taxpayer of that county is taxed upon his. We also stand ready to pay the full value of all iron ' and cross-ties put upon the road; and when we have done this we have done as much as any other tax-payer, and should not be required to do more. The assessment law requires that \u201cin assessing real estate the following shall be shown:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"329\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b770-5\">\u201c1. The description of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"330\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-6\">\u201c2. The name of the owner or owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"331\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-7\">\u201c3. The value of the land or town lots, including improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"332\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-8\">\u201c 4. The value of mills, manufactories, distilleries, breweries, founderies and other buildings used for similar purposes\u201d; Acts 1873, p. 169, s. 5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"333\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-9\">We ask that our assessment be made upon this principle and no other. We do not insist that our land shall be taxed as a farm, for it is not a farm. It has a character as distinctive as that of a mill, manufactory, distillery, brewery, or foundery, and should be taxed precisely as it is. But in taxing the mill of a private citizen situated in Sumner county, while it could not be taxed as a mere building, the assessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>could not look to the fact that the same citizen owned a distillery a few yards distant, but in Davidson county, where he used the products of his mill more profitably. Neither could Davidson county, in taxing the distillery, have regard to the mill in Sumner. The fact that they were both owned by the same person and used in connection with each other might render both of them much more' profitable, but it would not make them more valuable in the sense of our assessment laws, which do not affect to tax profits or incomes. Some other citizen of Sumner might own a mill by the side of the other mill, and in all respects its duplicate; would he be entitled to a reduction in his taxes because he had no distillery, like his neighbor\u2019s, to furnish a market for his mill, which, in consequence, lay idle most of the year? So; while our railroad in Sumner county is to be taxed as a railroad, and is not to be regarded as a mere slip of land encumbered with old iron and cross-ties, yet it is to be regarded simply as a railroad, and its franchise right to charge for freight and passengers, the profits that it may earn from that source, and the fact that we own other portions of a road, which, operated in connection' with it, enables us to make this part of the road more profitable than it otherwise would be, can not be regarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"334\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-8\">In the case of the <em>State Easton Del. Dr. Co. </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>31 N. J. Law, 378, the prosecutors were the owners of a toll-bridge over the Delaware river, between Easton in the State of Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg in the State of New Jersey. The one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>of the bridge, including the abutments and piers, to the middle of the river on the New Jersey side, was assessed for taxation as real estate in New Jersey, under a statute which required the \u201cassessor to assess' and value property at its full and fair value, and at such prices as, in his judgment, said property would sell for at a fair and <em>bona fide </em>sale by private contract at the time 'such assessment was made.\u201d The witnesses on the part of the tax assessor estimated its value from $120,000 to $200,000, looking not only to the value of the bridge as a structure, but upon the fact that it was a toll-bridge, owned by a company with the right of taking <em>tolls; </em>that the travel was large and income very profitable. The witnesses on the part of the bridge company estimated its value at from $25,000 to $60,000, looking only to the material value of the bridge as a structure, without reference to the franchises of the company or the income of the bridge or the amount of travel. The assessor estimated the whole at $120,000, and assessed the New Jersey half of it at $60,000. Upon <em>certiorari, </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey reduced the assessment to $25,000. They held that the assessor did right in refusing to assess it as if it was worth only the value of the lumber that was contained in it; that it was in fact a bridge, with a character as distinctive as that of a house, a store, or a mill, and should be valued at what it was, as distinguished from the value of the material to be converted into something else. But while the assessor had the right to take these matters into consideration, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the fitness of the structure to the purposes for which it was intended, the court held that he had no right whatever to look to the value of the franchise, nor to the income derived from the tolls. Upon this point they say: \u201cThere is a great distinction between the franchises of a company under its charter, and the material things contemplated by it and necessary to its objects. There is a value about each. In this case the rights of the bridge company, under their act of incorporation, to build a bridge and to take tolls, are matters of value apart from the structure. They are not liable to be taxed under our present tax laws, except only so far as they may be reached in the capital stock, and the surplus, if to tax such is legal. If the bridge should be destroyed, these rights would still exist, and, as such, could not be taxed; and if rebuilt, its value should not be enhanced by the peculiar franchises or profits of the company. The franchises do not connect themselves \u2022to the bridge as determining its value; the bridge is \u2022only the material means to their enjoyment, and has an ascertainable value in itself\u201d: p. 383. A building fitted up expressly for a bank, with its vaults and arrangements, would be valued independently of the profits that could be made there under its charter. The adaptedness of the building for a bank would be taken into the estimate of value, but not the franchises or profits of the corporation using it; and so, in this case, the adaptedness of a bridge as a structure for the purposes intended should be considered in fixing its value, but not the franchises or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>profits of the corporation using it: p. 383. Proceeding upon these principles, the court reduced the assessment, as stated above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"335\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-5\">Section 13 of the assessment act taxes the franchises of certain saving banks, but they are the only corporations whose franchises are taxed by the laws of Tennessee: see Acts 1873, p. 172, s. 13.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"336\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b774-6\">Att.-Gen\u2019l Heiskell for the State.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"337\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b774-7\">The first question in this case is the question of jurisdiction.

The acts on the subject, 1868, c. 79, s. 16, and 1873, c. 44, s. 2, expressly forbid the use of a <em>supersedeas </em>to stay the collection of any tax. The latter also prohibits any proceeding but the one provided for in its body, for the remedy of any wrong in connection with the taxes. This last, probably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>does preclude the remedy by <em>certiorari. </em>The remedy by <em>certiorari </em>is constitutional, the remedy by <em>supersedeas </em>is not. The one, therefore, stands upon a different footing from the other. As to the one, the <em>supersedeas, </em>it is merely a question whether the state is bound to prescribe the same remedy between the millions composing her community on the one side, and the individual on the other, as she provides for one individual against another, and whether she has done so. As to the other, the <em>certiorari, </em>it is a question of the extent of the constitutional provision, and the intent of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"340\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b775-5\">The association of the <em>certiorari </em>with the <em>supersedeas, </em>in our minds, is calculated to mislead. But when examined, they are found to be merely associated writs. The <em>certiorari </em>is used in many instances without the associated writ, and on the contrary, the <em>supersedeas </em>is in constant use, disconnected with the <em>certiorari. </em>Every day we have <em>certioraris </em>issued from this Court to bring up perfect records. We may use it if a court below refuses to send up the record at all, to enforce the right of appeal. It may be allowed on the pauper oath when the <em>supersedeas </em>can not be obtained for want of security. On the contrary, the <em>supersedeas </em>accompanies a writ of error \u2014 where it is ordered by a Judge of the Supreme Court, and its relation to the writ of error is precisely the same as to <em>certiorari; </em>sometimes accompanying it, and often not doing so. There is then no necessary connection between them. The prohibition in the act of a <em>supersedeas </em>is not therefore in any sense an interference with the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>tutional writ of <em>eertiora/ri, </em>but is perfectly consistent with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"341\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b776-5\">This branch of the statute, then, involves simply the right to use exceptional remedies in the collection of revenue, and the question whether the remedy here is exceptional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"342\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b776-6\">The preventive remedies of the courts are extraordinary, and not the usual remedies. Every lawyer will remember the history of that memorable contest by which the writ of injunction was set on foot, by which a court having no revisory power, and so no writ which would affect the process of the other, by the use of a power over the person of a suitor, prohibited him from using the process they could not stay or supercede. It was an extraordinary process, out of the course of the common law, and as such regarded and resisted by one of the greatest of English judges. It was, however, established and has become common, but still, remedy by way of prevention in every shape is regarded as extraordinay, as distinguished from the common course of law to redress evils after they have been consummated. No writ of this kind issues of course, but every one \u2014 injunction, attachment, <em>supersedeas, mandamus, </em>etc., is granted only upon the oath of a party. Now, the State does, by this act of 1873, take away the preventive remedies, and leaves the citizen, in a contest with her, to the ordinary remedial actions which prevail between citizen and citizen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"343\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b776-7\">\"We contend that there is no constitutional provision which prohibits such a course, and no direct pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>hibition is put forward. It is needless to repeat the authorities, which have been presented by Mr. McHenry, which settle that due process of law does not require, in respect of the State, the same process that is required between citizens. The distress warrant is due process of law in collecting revenue. Indeed, distress itself, without warrant, was due process of law in England, in cases of trespass, etc. This summary process has been constantly used in Tennessee, and it is used in the United States courts by statute, under provisions of a constitution exactly equivalent to ours, prohibiting the deprivation \u201cof life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d As to the exceptional mode, taking away the <em>supersedeas, </em>there can be no question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"344\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b777-5\">But the matter of the <em>certiorari </em>stands upon a different footing, and as there is a clause in the Constitution prohibiting its disuse, we must consider the scope and intent of the- prohibition. To do this it is necessary that we study its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"345\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b777-6\">The Constitution of 1796, art. 5, s. 7, is in these words: \u201c The Judges or Justices of the inferior courts of law, shall have power in civil cases to issue writs of <em>certiorari </em>to remove any cause, or a transcript thereof, from any inferior jurisdiction, into their court, on sufficient cause, supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d The subsequent Constitutions have the same words in every essential particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"346\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b777-8\">It is said the <em>certiorari </em>has been held to apply to several cases not within its scope in England; but is not held that the Constitution requires such extension. In the case of courts martial, our courts held, that a <em>cer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number><em>tiorari </em>would lie \u2014 but not that it was included in the constitutional provision. Nor was any point involving the Constitution involved in <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>7 Yer., 21, except that it was held that the Constitution pi\u2019otected the remedy, and did not restrict the power of the Legislature to regulate it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"347\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b778-5\">The case in 11 Hum., 251, does not mention the Constitution. It states that at the earliest period of our judicial history., the writ was extended in its operation, and cites 2 Tenn. It., 181; 4 Hay., 54, 69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"348\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b778-6\">The cases in 4 Hay., are proceedings in a court martial, to which the Constitution could not apply, and which showed- no extension of the English practice. The other, <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Mall, </em>2 Tenn., 181, is a case where the attempt was to get the benefit of a writ of error and bill of exceptions, by means of a <em>certiorari, </em>to re-try a case from the County Court, and where the relief was denied. The court speak only of proceedings in courts not of record. Not a single one of the cases cited, nor any to be found in our decisions, go beyond this revision of acts of courts, justices, or courts martial, until the case of <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Nashville, </em>11 Hum., 249. There it was applied to the warrant of a city recorder to collect a tax, and that proceeding was quashed for defects apparent on its face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"349\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b778-7\">Now, none of these c'ases show that the Constitution extends to courts martial, whose jurisdiction is criminal, nor to tax cases. Could, then, the Legislature forbid the issue of the writ in a case of court martial ? Certainly, for the Constitution applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>civil, not criminal matters. The same observation is true of <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Loague, </em>6 Col., 421, where there is no allusion to the Constitution, and nothing to show that it was cited or relied on. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hen &amp; Reagan, </em>MS., Knoxville, 1874, is put upon the Code, 3123, and not on the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"350\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b779-5\">So there is nothing in the decisions of.our courts to show that they have regarded a distress warrant as being subject to <em>certiorari, </em>within the Constitution. There may be persuasive authority that before the act of 1873, the <em>certiorari </em>was a proper remedy, but not that it was a constitutional remedy, beyond the power of the Legislature to repeal. The question is just this, and on this there is no authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"351\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b779-6\">Now, to what does the Constitution apply? To civil cases \u2014 to remove causes, or transcripts thereof, from inferior jurisdictions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"352\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b779-7\">I maintain, that a revenue matter is not civil, that an assessment is not a case or a cause, and that a tax assessor is not a jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"353\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b779-8\">I have already shown, (chiefly by the aid of my learned associate,) that revenue proceedings are exceptional in their character, and not subject to the rules as to civil proceedings, and we are not' therefore, bound liberally to construe <em>e </em>civil \u2019 to include matters which may or may not come within its scope. When you undertake to show that the people have tied their own hands in a constitution so that they may not protect themselves as a state,, from the most serious embarrassment, and that the Legislature as their representatives, have exceeded an authority, which you must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>limit by strict proof, you fail if the expression is equivocal. Besides, if you find in that constitution, a provision allowing the Legislature to decide whether the State is to be suable or not, you will not construe a doubtful declaration, that she may be sued by <em>certiorari, </em>to operate against the State if the words expend their proper force in any sense upon these litigations, in which the State is no party. Revenue cases are not properly 'civil/ To sue in a revenue case is to sue the State, and as the option is given to the Legislature to decide whether the State can be sued in any case, it will not do to say that ' civil\u2019 is to include State cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"354\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b780-5\">Mr. Bouvier defines a civil action to be \"an action which has for its objects, the recovery of private civil rights or compensation for their infraction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"355\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b780-6\">Now, supposing a suit brought by the State for revenue, can it be said to be an action to recover a private civil right, or compensation for the infraction?

But it can hardly be supposed that such cases can be subjects of <em>certiorari. </em>Taken in connection with <em>\u2018 </em>courts5 and \u2018 civil,\u2019 it means an action in a court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"362\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b782-5\">Now, I maintain, that when the tax assessor sends me one of the assessment blanks, and I hand it back to him, and he puts it down on his tax-book, we do not institute a case. Nor do we make a case within the meaning of the Constitution, when I fail to make my return, and he puts me down as I was last year, or adds to that on\u00e9-fourth of the amount,' because I fail to make the proper return. If these are civil cases within the Constitution, in which every man has the right to <em>certiorari, </em>then is our Constitution a curse, and our revenue system a mockery, under which, the little fish will be consumed by those who are able to fight off the taxes. This thing of assessing taxes is not judicial, it is not upon evidence, but eyesight of the assessor; he takes no testimony, he issues no process, he opens no court, he institutes no suit! Who are the parties, where is his transcript or record? The review by the Sheriff, County Judge, or other officer has some of the <em>insignia, </em>of a suit, but it must be in its nature like the original act of assessment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"363\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b782-6\">It is not a cause to be brought up. A cause is defined to be \u201cAn action or suit at law or in equity, a case in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"364\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b782-7\">Then, the Constitution fails in three particulars to cover and protect an assessment of taxes. It is not a case, cause, or civil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"365\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b782-8\">Again, a tax assessor is not a jurisdiction. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>is a word as strictly applicable to courts, as case and crime: Mr. Tidd, Pr., p. 398, uses \u2018 inferior jurisdictions\u2019 as equivalent to \u2018inferior courts.\u2019 Who calls the Governor\u2019s office a superior jurisdiction, or a Sheriff\u2019s an inferior jurisdiction, or a tax assessor a jurisdiction? The concurring indications show that the Constitution had in view something other than these things, and meant to apply this process, beyond legislative recall, to Justices of the Peace, and other like jurisdictions, acting between private parties \u2014 and they meant then to trust the Legislature and Courts with the extension to criminal cases, and such others as they may deem proper. The courts may have extended it to this class of cases, but not with any-intimation that it was in this application, placed upon the impregnable basis of a constitutional writ. The Legislature too, have treated it upon the same footing, thinking it was necessary, in 1857-8, to insert it in the Code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"366\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b783-5\">I have shown that the decided cases do not establish any thing on the constitutional question, and are consistent with my view. But there is a case inconsistent with any other, the case of <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Murray, 2 </em>Sneed, 50. There was a case \u2014 a civil case,- before a jurisdiction \u2014 not a Chancery Court, but a Chancellor with statutory power, sitting at Chambers, on notice with parties, evidence, and all the paraphernalia of counsel,, argument, etc. Yet the Court held that it was not a case for <em>certiorari, </em>because it was evident that the Legislature meant that there should be no appeal or writ of error. All the cases on <em>certiorari </em>were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>cited in the briefs, and the Constitution, art. 6, s. 15; which must be a misprint for s. 10; as s. 15 relates wholly to civil districts, and constables, etc. The Court recites its provisions, and holds, notwithstanding the Constitution, that it can not apply where the Legislature means the proceeding to be final: 2 Sneed, 56, and they hold that the <em>certiorari </em>can not be maintained. They might have said that the Legislature have not clearly manifested the intention to take away this right, and a fair construction of the act, will be to hold that it allows this writ. They do not even give that effect to the Constitution. They hold that the Legislature has the power to make any proceeding final, when they see proper so to do, and this provision of the Constitution does not prevent it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"367\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b784-6\">How much more here where is no case, no civil action or cause, no jurisdiction or court, and a matter in which the Legislature has declared, in words carefully weighed and framed, that the proceedings shall not be disturbed or inquired into until the tax is paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"368\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b784-7\">This case seems to establish a theory which has been floating in my mind for some time, viz.: that the Constitution only intended to settle the writ of <em>certiorari </em>as a mode of reaching a result when the review was to be made, but did not intend to compel the Legislature to make every proceeding of an inferior judicature subject to review. This would give it the operation contended for by the one class of North Carolina lawyers, and settle the whole controversy, whether it was the proper writ, without settling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>for all time that no civil judgment could be final in the first instance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Either this is the effect of the decision, or it must be put upon the ground that only-controversies of a regular court or . judicature can be subject to its constitutional irrepealable action. The fact that the case of <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Murray </em>was the subject of a dissent, to my mind, gives assurance that it was thoroughly considered. Nothing is more sure to bring out the powers of the judicial mind than a disagreement and collision of judges, taking different sides of a question and debating it orally, in consultation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"369\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b785-6\">It is to be remembered, too, by those who would give weight to the case in 11 Hum., that this opinion is by the same judge who delivered that opinion, and it shows affirmatively what that opinion' shows negatively, that he was not in that case <em>(Pearl </em>v. <em>Nashville) </em>considering the constitutional aspect of the matter, but the practice and usage only \u2014 beyond the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"370\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b785-7\"><em>Certiorari </em>is not properly a mode of reviewing questions of fact, but of law merely: 1 Tidd, 398, note A. Such was the English rule. But in <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Knabb, </em>1 Tenn., 60, the right of <em>certiorari </em>after trial (the writ in England being used almost 'wholly before trial) is derived from the right of retrial on appeal; and it is clearly shown that where there is no appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>there can be no retrial on <em>certiorari. </em>And this ease strongly corroborates the case of <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Mwrray, </em>2 Sneed. In the case of <em>Quaife </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 Zab., 90, the same point is recognized, that at common law the <em>certiorari </em>only reached errors of law; and although the court in that case revise the errors of law, they refuse to have anything to do with the estimate of value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"371\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b786-5\">Again, it is clear, from our decisions, that the <em>certiorari </em>was either a substitute for a writ of error, or for an <em>audita querela, </em>to affect a judgment; or a proceeding to affect an execution\u00bb To the latter no analogy can be claimed for this proceeding. No indication occurs anywhere on our books that the dispute in North Carolina involved the application of this writ beyond these two classes of cases. In these we have the measure of the right of review by the superior courts, and these were confined to courts and judicatures, and did not extend to acts of mere ministerial officers not constituting courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"372\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b786-6\">The cases on the subject of <em>certiorari </em>cited by Mr. Baxter, throw no light on the constitutional argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"373\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b786-7\">The case of <em>Quaife </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 Zab., (N.

The act to be reviewed was therefore <em>quasi </em>legislative in its character, and, clearly not within the proper scope of the <em>certio</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>rari </em>as used in this State. But the case in 1 Vroom, 353, shows that the application of the <em>certiorari </em>in New Jersey is regarded by their own court as anomalous and peculiar to their practice, and they justify it upon legislative recognition. They do not claim for it any legitimate derivation from anything in the common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"374\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b787-5\">It further appears that in that State the statute gives a right of appeal to the courts, and they might well maintain the jurisdiction upon the same principle which we have deduced from the common law, in <em>Bech </em>v. <em>Knahb, </em>that a right to appeal, whenever defeated by accident, &amp;c., supports the right to <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"375\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b787-6\">The case of <em>State of Missouri </em>v. <em>St. Louis Court, </em>47 Missouri, 599, is a <em>certiorari </em>to the county court, which is an appellate court in questions of assessment by statute, a regular court acting upon complaint of the party, and the proceeding in which has all the elements of a <em>suit; </em>so that it throws no light whatever on the question, whether the original assessment is a <em>case </em>to which the <em>certiorari </em>may reach under our Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"376\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b787-7\">The case of the <em>Cal.

The court do then extrajudicially discuss the <em>certiorari,. </em>beginning in this way: <em>\u201c </em>But in this case we are not prepared to say that the plaintiff has not, or rather had not, if he had availed himself of it in time, an ample remedy by <em>certiorari </em>to correct the assessment while it was in <em>fieri </em>and capable of being reached.\u201d The opinion then proceeds with some rather loose <em>obiter dicta </em>about the scope of the <em>certiorari, </em>and concludes with, <em>\u201c </em>If this remedy should fail, and the town authorities fail to redress the grievance, the only remedy will be to apply to the Legislature to provide one.\u201d Certainly this is too loose to answer as an authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"378\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b788-6\">But in New York the fact is, the <em>certiorari </em>is a statutory remedy in numerous cases, and by express statute goes to officers as well as courts, as it does here under the Code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"379\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b788-7\">The other citation from 40 N.

The evil to be remedied by that provision was this: the Legislature had been in the habit of passing acts which gave no notice on their face of their purpose or substance \u2014 as, Be it enacted, that sec. 4700 of the Code be repealed; or amended by inserting the words, &amp;c. Now the Legislature, by such act, was liable to be imposed on by the change of a single figure or word, or by impudent misrepresentations on the Soor. It was, therefore, required that the act should give notice on its face of its subject. This act does so fully, and is in compliance with the Constitution. To give the constitutional provision the construction claimed, would render it impossible to legislate, as every law modifies or affects many other laws; and if every act to be affected, directly or remotely, must be recited \u25a0or directly referred to, legislation would be impossible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"381\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b789-5\">As to the construction of the act of 1873, s. 8, \u25a0the conclusions of Mr. McHenry are clearly right.

Such general clause is not indicative of an intent to include everything that the most extended construction of them may include.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"383\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b790-5\">The present case brings before us the principle. The law enumerates certain corporations of a particular kind, and we may extend the general clause to any corporation of like kind. Now, what is like</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"384\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b790-6\">kind? Likeness may be in various degrees. It may liken banks to banks, or other money corporations; or banks to other local corporations, as gas companies. Now, the court have held that a gas company is included. That establishes the extension of the like thus far to the broader construction. But the-question now is, is this likeness to be extended to corporations in no like sense local, as a railroad, which may reach throughout the State and beyond it? Does not the use of the provision referring to locality, &amp;c., show conclusively that the Legislature did not contemplate such a corporation as a railroad ? But it may apply to all like in kind as to local character, not to those unlike in that respect. It may be said this applies to the main question, whether the Legislature intended to tax railroads, and that the details prescribed do not fit. them.

The plaintiff is an incorporated railroad company, chartered by the State of Kentucky in 1850, for so much of its road as lies in that State, and by the State of Tennessee in 1851, ' for so much thereof as lies in the latter State, and has been for many years operating its original main trunk of railroad one hundred and eighty-five miles,</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>connecting the cities of Louisville and Nashville, and owns and operates about six hundred and five miles of road in the two states aforesaid; and, as lessee, operates and controls some two hundred and fifty miles of road in this State. About thirty-three miles of the plaintiff's road lie in the county of Sumner, in this State, and the same has been assessed for taxes for 1873 and 1874, on behalf of the State and county, by 'the defendant Austin, as County Judge of said county of Sumner. This litigation involves the validity of said assessment, and embraces two causes originating by petition- for <em>certiorari </em>and <em>supersedeas </em>in the Circuit Court of Sumner county, in one of which, the defendant Austin, as County Judge, and the State of Tennessee, are defendants, and in the other, the said Austin and the Cumberland &amp; Ohio E. E. Co., are defendants. The case first named involves the validity of the assessment on behalf of the State and county, and the second upon the same grounds as that on behalf of the county, with the additional defence, that so much of the latter assessment as seeks to exact a tax in liquidation of certain county bonds, issued in aid of said Cumberland &amp; Ohio E. E. Co., is illegal and void for want of lawful authority in the County Court of said county, to subscribe stock in said company and issue said bonds. In both cases, the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded, restraining the tax collector from enforcing the collection of the taxes until further notice, and in both cases answers were filed; in the first, by defendant Austin, and in the second, by the defendant Austin and the Cumberland &amp; Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>R. R. Co. The two cases were heard by the Judge of the Circuit Court upon the petitions, answers, exhibits, and proofs, who rendered judgments dismissing the petitions in both cases, and from the judgments the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\"Waiving for the present, the consideration of the main question involved in these two causes, we proceed, first, to dispose of the question, whether the plaintiff 'can, in this proceeding, successfully resist the payment of its lawful quota of taxation in liquidation of the said county subscription to the Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R. \u2014 assuming for the argument that the assessments complained of are, upon all other grounds, valid and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. was incorporated by the State of Kentucky on the 24th of February, 1869. The General Assembly of this State, on the 10th of January, 1870, passed an act stating the fact of the aforesaid charter, and that the objects thereof was the construction of a railroad from the Ohio river, through certain counties in Kentucky, to a point on the boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Kentucky, about due north from the town of Murfreesboro, in Tennessee, with a view of connecting with the Southern system of railways converging at Nashville, Tennessee; and enacting that for the purpose of carrying out said enterprise in the State of Tennessee, and to form the connection aforesaid, the powers and privileges of said Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R., as granted by the State of Kentucky, be granted and extended from the point afore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>said, on the boundary line aforesaid, to the town of Gallatin, in Sumner county, in the State of Tennessee, and from thence to the city of Nashville, in said State; and said Cumberland <em>&amp; </em>Ohio R. R. Co., for the purpose of building and constructing said railroad, were granted all the powers, rights, and privileges, which were conferred upon the Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co., by its charter originally granted and amended by the Legislature of the State of Tennessee. Certain named gentlemen, thirteen in number, and among whom were J. C. Rodemer, J. J. Turner and W. S. Munday, were appointed commissioners to receive subscriptions to the capital stock of said Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., and \u201cthey may cause books to be opened for that purpose, at such times and places as they may see proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">By section 30 of said act, \u201ceach county and incorporated town, through which the said road may be located, in the State of Tennessee, may take stock in said road, as provided by the Code of Tennessee. On the 1st day of May, 1871, the commissioners aforesaid, appeared before the County Court, composed of the defendant Austin, County Judge, and twenty-five of the Justices of said county, and presented an application on the part of said company, to submit the questions to the voters of said county, whether the said county of Sumner would subscribe stock in said company to the amount of $300,000, in aid of said enterprise, upon the terms and conditions prescribed by law, and issue its bonds for the amount, bearing six per cent, interest, payable annually, and said bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>to be payable in not less than ten, nor more than thirty years from the issuance of the same. This application was granted, the record showing that a majority of the Justices of the county voted for it. The entry of record contains the following recital: \u201cAnd it appearing that said road has been surveyed by a competent engineer, and substantially located by designating the terminii of said road, and a number of points in the same, and the general direction and course of the road have been designated, and an estimate of the grading, embankment and masonry, made by the engineer, under oath, and filed with the application ; now in pursuance of the law,\u201d etc. The entry then proceeds to order an election, according to the formulary prescribed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">At the July Term following, the vote of the county was reported, from which it appeared that the total number of votes cast was 2,861, of which, 1,781 were for the subscription, and 1,080 against it, the majority for subscription being 701. The subscription was thus carried, and the same was duly accepted by the company. It does not appear that said enterprise has been abandoned, but the same is in process of completion; and it is stated that up to the present time, some $220,000 of said subscription has been evidenced by the bonds of the county, and that much of the same has been negotiated in the discharge of contracts and obligations, and entered into by the company in the prosecution of its enterprises, and the county has received its certificates of stock therefor. The people of Sumner county have, since the maturity of the cou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>pons, been regularly taxed to meet the interest, and the interest has been regularly paid. The plaintiff as a tax payer of the county, has heretofore paid a small assessment on its property, on this account, without protest. The county has its stock regularly represented in the operations of the company, and a special commission of citizens has been constituted by the County Court, under heavy bonds, whose duty it is to receive these railroad taxes and discharge the coupons as they may be presented. It is said that the subscription aforesaid and bonds so issued are void and unlawful, and that no tax could be lawfully predicated upon the same; and divers grounds are urged in argument, which we will notice as briefly as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We have recently had occasion to say in a case where the bondholders were themselves parties to the litigation, that \u201cafter the solemn obligations of the county have been negotiated and thrown .upon the commerce of the country, into the hands of <em>bona fide </em>holders, who, so far from having notice of any supposed illegality, were encouraged by the county itself, through a series of years to give them implicit credit, it would require a very grave departure from legislative restrictions to justify the courts in exonerating the county <em>\u201d: State, ex rel. Ross </em>v. <em>Anderson county, </em>MS., Knoxville, 1874. In the case now before us, however, the bondholders, who are the parties most vitally interested, are not before us, and we are asked in a collateral proceeding, to annul the action of a court of competent jurisdiction, at the suit of a single tax payer, because certain things required to be done were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>not done, when the record assumes on its face, that every material prerequisite of the statute has been complied with. The statute provides, <em>\u201c </em>that before such application can be made, the entire line of the road in which stock is proposed to be taken, shall be surveyed by a competent engineer, and substantially located, by designating the terminii, and approximating the general direction of the road, and an estimate of the grading, embankment, and masonry, made by the engineer, under oath, and filed with the application.\u201d The record of the County Court assumes that all of this was done, and though the certificate of the engineer, exhibited in the record, does not fill the exact requirements of the statute, yet it is avered in the answer of the Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., that it was the same enterprise under a different name rhat was before the county of Sumner in 1852, for a subscription under the name of the Cincinnati, Danville &amp; \u25a0 Nashville R. R. \u2014 that the road was carefully surveyed by an eminent engineer, and a careful estimate made of the cost of the road; that the field notes, profiles and estimates, fell into the hands of the Cumberland <em>&amp; </em>Ohio R. R. Co. That the route was again carefully traced and examined by the engineers of the Cincinnati Southern R. R., the original profile and notes having been furnished said engineer by the said Cumberland <em>&amp; </em>Ohio R. R. Co. That these notes, profiles, and estimates, together with a map, were before the County Court, furnishing all the facts required by the Code; that they were filed, but subsequently withdrawn to be used at other points; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., m 1871, and previous to its application in May of that year, had made careful instrumental surveys of the road, and had fixed its main terminii, and the general points on the road. In view of the recitals of the record, that all these requirements of the law had been strictly complied with, we are to presume that the record speaks the truth, and it must be held to prevail against a collateral attack like this.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">It is further urged, that the application of the County Court was unlawfully made by the commissioners aforesaid, as the company was then organized, and the law required the application to be made by the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">If we concede that the plaintiff\u2019s construction of the statute be correct, we could not hold that a departure so slight and immaterial from the terms of the statute, should vitiate the important action of the court \u201c and the people \u201d which followed it. But we think the statute which allows the application to be made by the commissioners or board of directors of the company, if organized, admits of no such construction; and it is immaterial from which body the applcation may come. The vital and important matter is the action of the court and the people, which is to follow it. Nor are we prepared to hold after a subscription of stock has been made upon a vote of the people, and the bonds have been negotiated, as in this case, that the whole proceeding is void, because the consent of a majority of the Justices was not obtained at a Quarterly Term; the fact appearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>a majority of the Justices of the county were actually present and voting on the question at the May Term, 1871, instead of a Quarterly Term. The old act upon the subject provided, that the election \u25a0 might be ordered by the \u201cCounty Court\u201d; and it was held by this Court in the case of the <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Davidson oounty, </em>et <em>al., </em>1 Sneed, 638, that where a new power is vested in the County Court, or a new duty devolved upon it, and no particular number of Justices is specified, any number which may constitute a legal court can perform it. And in the same case, the Court holds that the duties imposed by the statutes upon the court in these matters of railroad subscription, are ministerial merely, and not judicial. That the intention evidently was to commit the whole matter to the people, and provide that their edict in relation to it, should be subject to no intermediate obstruction, but be fully and fairly carried out by the use of the agencies designated. Th\u00e9 Legislature could have appointed any other county officers to perform these acts, as well as the Justices of a County Court. The duties required were all ministerial: 1 Sneed, 681. But the Legislature of 1871, thought it wiser and safer to commit this important trust to a majority of the Justices of the county, instead of the three functionaries constituting the quorum court; and hence, the act of 1871, c. 50, provides, that the consent of a majority of the Justices of the Peace of the County, at a Quarterly Term of the County Court, should first be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">,We think as their duties are ministerial merely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>and not judicial, that the spirit and purpose of the enactment, was to \u2019secure absolutely the consent of a majority of the Justices of the county; and that the requirement that it, should be so obtained at a Quarterly Term, was directory, and intended the better to secure that consent, inasmuch as under the constitution of the court, a majority of said Justices were not usually in attendance upon the Quorum Terms of the Court. As held by this Court, the Justices were in such matters the mere instrumentalities of the people, upon' whom the whole responsibility of self-taxation was thrown, and they were the mere agents by whom the popular edict upon the matter was to be registered and enforced. The county of Sumner at the present stage of the proceedings, could not well complain of an irregularity which it has ratified and adopted, by its subsequent action; and the plaintiff can not stand in any better condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">But it is said that this subscription of stock was unlawful and void, because it was not made upon the requisite popular vote. The constitution of 1870 provides that the credit of no county, city or town shall be given or loaned to, or in aid of, any person, company, association or corporation, except upon an election to be first held by the qualified voters of such county, city or town, and the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast at said election. Nor shall any county, city or town become a stockholder with others in any company, association or corporation, except upon a like election and the assent of a like majority. But the county of Sumner and others are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>specially excepted out of this provision, so far that the assent of a majority of the qualified voters of either of said counties voting on the question shall be sufficient, when the credit of such county is given or loaned to any person, association or corporation: Art. 2, s. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We have seen that the subscription in this case was carried by a majority of the voters voting in the election, and we have seen also that the- charter of the Cumberland &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. had conferred upon the county of Sumner the power to subscribe for stock in said road under the provisions of the Code. These provisions of the Code, requiring a majority of the voters of the county, wer\u00e9 repealed by the act of 1871, c. 50, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of 1870, above cited. The question is, whether these provisions, as to the number of votes required, apply in this case to a matter of subscription of stock, or a lending or giving of credit, so far as the excepted county of Sumner is concerned. The literal phraseology would seem to distinguish between a lending or giving of credit, and a subscription of stock; and yet, to give it such a construction, would involve the absurdity of permitting the county to give or lend its credit to a railroad upon the assent of a majority of the voters voting in the election, and to require a three-fourths\u2019 vote in subscribing for stock; or, in other words, the county may tax itself and donate its taxes as a gratuity to a corporation upon a bare majority of the voters voting in the election, and upon a proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>to subscribe stock, by which the county may be indemnified for its outlay, a majority of three-fourths is required. . We can not assent to such a construction. \u201cConstitutions,\u201d said Mr. Story, \u201care instruments of a practical nature, founded on the common business of life, adapted to common wants, designed for common use, and fitted for common understandings. The people make them, the people adopt them, they must be supposed to read them, with the help of common sense \u201d: Story on the Const., \u00a7 451. They must be interpreted in the light of practical sense, and enforced according to their manifest intention. The general provision is, that the credit of no city, town or county shall be given, or loaned to, <em>or in aid of, </em>any person, company, association or corporation, except upon an election to be first held by the qualified voters, and the assent of three-fourths of the votes cast at said election. Nor shall any county, city or town become a stockholder with others in any company, association or corporation, except upon a like election and the assent of a like majority. Now we find certain exceptions to this provision in favor of the counties of Sumner and others, and a new county authorized to be established out of fractions of Sumner, Macon and Smith counties, so far that the assent of a majority of the qualified voters of either, voting on the question, shall be sufficient: but with the words added: \u201c When the credit of such county is given' or loaned to any person, association or corporation.\u201d And in looking to the journal of the convention, we find the amendment to the section under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>consideration, by which the new county to be established out of fractions of Sumner, Macon and Smith, was excepted from its provisions; and this amendment expressly includes the taking of stock, as well as the giving or loaning of credit to or in aid of any person, company or corporation. This amendment was adopted by the convention as a part of said sec. 29 of the Constitution, but by some singular misprision. in the final engrossment of the instrument, the words, \u201cbecome a stockholder,\u201d were left out in the excepting clause. Taking this amendment and the manifest intention of the framers of the instrument as a guide and interpreter, we are constrained -so to construe the section as to apply its general provisions, as to \u201csubscribing stock,\u201d to the excepted -counties. Some of these were contemplating a subscription to some railroad enterprise, already projected through them on the faith of such promised subscription, as Sumner county was, and this exception was incorporated in the Constitution with a view to ensure it. Why a larger vote should be required for a subscription, than for a giving of credit, is simply incomprehensible. It can not be the meaning of the instrument, and manifestly is not, when the whole section and its purposes are considered. In the construction of the organic law, as in the construction of statutes, the real intention, when ascertained, will prevail over the literal sense of terms. \u201cThus,\u201d .say this court in regard to the construction of statutes, \u201ca thing may be within the letter of the statute, and yet not within the statute, unless it be within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number><em>intention </em>of the maker \u201d : 2 Sneed, 88; 1 Wheat, 326; 20 Wend., 561; 1 Kent, 462; 15 John., 380; 14 Mass., 92; Dwarris on Stat., 691, 725. We can not, therefore, hold this proceeding void upon this ground, without doing violence to these familiar rules of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">As to other mere irregularities and departures from the precise formularies prescribed by statute, it is sufficient to say, that under our owq, adjudications and those of many of the courts of this country, including those of the highest tribunal in the Union, it is now too late for the county of Sumner or its tax-payers to resist the payment .of this subscription on that ground. We will not encumber this opinion with a detail of the multiform phases in which these questions have been presented and adjudged, but must content ourselves with' a mere reference to some of the cases, where they may be found, and ' where the various questions raised in' this branch . of the case are discussed: 7 Ohio, 327-401; 34 Ill., 421; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>Co., MS., Knoxville, 1874; 24 Ill., 9; 5 Wall., 90; 25 Penn., 156; Ang. &amp; Ames Corp., 237; 1 Penning (N.

J., 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We. conclude that, the plaintiff can not resist the tax assessed against it by the county of Sumner, to discharge the county\u2019s indebtedness on account of the subscription of stock in the, Cumberland &amp; Ohio. R. R. Co., upon any of the grounds assumed in the petition or in the argument; and that said subscription being a valid. debt. against the county, the, levy of taxes for its extinguishment was lawful and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">And this brings us to the consideration of the question, whether the assessment for county taxes was, in the form and manner in which it was done, a valid and lawful assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\u25a0 The Constitution of this State, and <em>the law </em>passed in pursuance thereof, provide that <em>all </em>property, real) personal and mixed, <em>shall be taxed, </em>subject to certain specified exemptions; and that all property shall be taxed according., to its value, that value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature may direct, so that the taxes shall be equal and uniform throughout the State; and no one species of property, from which a tax may be collected, shall be taxed higher than any other species of property of the same value: Const. 1870, art. <em>2, </em>\u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Before the assessment now in controversy, the plaintiff had been taxed, not as a railroad, but as the owner of eight acres per mile upon which its thirty-three miles of road in Sumner was built, aggregating 241 acres, and on its depot-houses and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>real estate in the county, of the aggregate value of $8,435; and this property was assessed as other real estate in the county \u2014 the road-bed as farming lands were assessed, and the buildings and other realty as other like property of like value; the aggregate amdunt' of taxes assessed against the plaintiff on all its railroad and other property in said county being about $105.00 for the year 1873, which was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The laws of this State have never established any basis of' assessment for railroad property <em>as such. </em>The general provision applicable to every species of property alike, was, at the time of the assessment now in controversy, <em>that all real property shall be assessed at its marlcet value, on a credit of one and two yearsf </em>deducting fifteen <em>per </em>cent.; and all- personal property at the same value at which it ought to be appraised in payment of a just debt in cash from a solvent debtor: Act 1873, c. 118, s. 4. The 25th section of the act just cited provides that, \u201cshould it, at any time after the assessments have been made, come to&gt; the knowledge of the chairman or judge of the county court, the clerk of the county court, the county trustee, sheriff, or tax-collector, of any county in the State, that any person, company, firm or corporation-in said county have not been assessed as contemplated' by said act, or have been assessed on an inadequate amount, it shall be the duty of said chairman or judge, clerk, trustee, sheriff, or tax-collector to cite such person, company, firm or corporation, their agent, attorney or representative, to appear before them for the purpose of being assessed according to law; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>said chairman or judge, clerk, trustee, sheriff, or tax-collector, are hereby authorized and empowered to make the proper assessment against such person, company, firm or corporation.\u201d Under the provisions of this section, after the plaintiff had been assessed, as above stated, for the year 1873, the defendant Austin, as County Judge of Sumner county, summoned the agent of the plaintiff before him, to show cause why a new and different assessment should not be had for 1874, and why said company should not be assessed for taxes for 1874, upon their road-bed, rolling stock, depots and other property in the county of Sumner.The defendant Austin states that said company appeared before him by its attorney; that the consideration of said matter was postponed from time to time, at the request of said attorney; and that, finally, no satisfactory reason appearing why the assessment should not be made, he proceeded to make the same upon the basis, as stated in his own words, as follows: \u201cI estimated the length of the company\u2019s road in Sumner county at thirty-five miles, and valued each of said miles at a fraction over twenty-seven thousand dollars, which was formed from an estimate upon -the whole length of the road, and the whole amount of stock, to find how much stock each mile represented. I then multiplied this amount by thirty-five, the number of miles in the county. I then made an estimate of this amount, counting the stock to be worth forty-five cents to the dollar, the market price thereof on the 10th of January, 1874. This gave the amount on which the assessment was made, which was $500,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>000. I also caused a similar notice to be served on said company to show cause why they should not be taxed for the year 1873. No answer or appearance having been made, I assessed said company for taxes for the year 1873, estimating the value of their property in this county for the year 1873 at $675,000, the amount for 1873 being made greater than the amount for'1874, on account of the stock being worth more in 1873 than in .1874. I caused such assessment to be entered on the tax-books for collection. The taxes for - Sumner county for 1873 were assessed by the county court at its April term, 1873.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">It is complained in the petition of the plaintiff that the assessments of the county judge, now in controversy, were made upon a valuation of the entire road-bed, rolling stock, equipments, engine-houses and machine-shops of petitioner, together with the special uses and purposes to which they were all put and applied, the profits arising from them as a railroad and appurtenances, and also the depot-grounds and lands already assessed as before stated; that a part of said valuation of $675,000 was assessed as the pretended proportional actual value of the road-bed, rolling stock and depot grounds in Sumner county, as compared with the value of the entire road, from which, however, the taxes before assessed against said depot grounds separately, and which had been paid, as stated above, were directed to be deducted. And it' is insisted that said road-bed, if liable to taxation as such, must be assessed in the several districts where it is located, and not elsewhere, and not in gross. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>That it should be taxed and assessed according - to its value as aforementioned, and not in. the mode-adopted. That the assessment and- taxation of the capital, property, road-bed, and rolling stock to -petitioners corporation, and the taxation, also, of the shares of stock therein <em>to the </em>stockholders, is unequal, unconstitutional and void; and that the road-bed, rolling stock, capital and property of petitioner\u2019s corporation are not subject or liable to assessment and taxation, and the same is prohibited by law. The last proposition\u2014 that the road-bed, rolling stock, capital and property of the plaintiff is not subject to assessment and- taxation \u2014 is predicated, we presume, upon the- 8th section of the act of 1873, c. 118, which is in the words following: \u201cNo tax shall hereafter be assessed upon the capital of any bank or banking association, or any other joint stock company organized under the authority of this State or the United States, but the stockholders of such bank or banking association, or other corporation, shall be assessed and taxed on the value of their shares of stock therein; said shares shall be included in the valuation of personal property of such stockholders in the assessment of state, county or municipal taxes, at the place, town, ward or district where such bank or banking association or other corporation is located, and not elsewhere, whether said stockholders reside- in said place, town, ward on district or not; but not at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individuals in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Aside from the effect of the familiar principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>law, that the authority to tax is never to be taken to be relinquished except upon \u25a0 the most clear and unequivocal expression of the legislative will, we are satisfied from the very terms of this statute, that it was not intended to embrace railroad corporations: 16 How., 435; 4 Pet., 561; 11 Pet., 545. This view might be enforced by a mere criticism upon- the literal force of the words employed, but the matter, as it seems to us, is too plain for argument. It is not to be supposed that the State would surrender so splendid a source of its revenues, except in terms that could not be misunderstood.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We are not called upon in this case to construe the statute in question otherwise than as it is supposed to embrace railroad corporations within its provisions, nor to pronounce upon the abstract question of the compatibility of such a statute with that provision of the constitution which requires that \u201call property shall be taxed,\u201d save such as may be exempted from the general burthen by the express terms of the instrument itself. The provision that exempts certain property from taxation, would seem to be one of those which executes itself; and when the lawmaking power undertakes to vouchsafe exemptions, it must look alone to the organic law for its authority to do so. Whatever is the subject of ownership, is actually owned, and is appreciable in value, is property in the sense of the constitution; and \u201call property shall be taxed,\u201d is the imperative, and not merely potential or directory injunction, which would seem to embrace every conceivable species of property as sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>ject to the burthen, except such as are specially exempt, or <em>may be </em>exempted at the will of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The four elements of property in all joint stock companies are, the capital stock \u25a0 the corporate property ; the franchise of the corporation, and the indi-' vidual stock of the shareholders. Whether either of these may be exempted under the peculiar provisions of our constitution, may be matter of grave doubt\u2014 not necessary, however, to be decided in this case. The sole question before us on the provisions of the eighth section of the act is, whether it was intended to embrace railroad corporations, which we hold, upon its obvious import, was not intended. We take it, therefore, that all the property of a railroad corporation is taxable in this <em>State; </em>but the question recurs, has the plaintiff in this case been assessed according to the constitution and the law ?</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">It is said that the plaintiff\u2019s property should have been assessed in the several districts in which it lies, and such is the requirement of the law in regard to taxable property in general. But the assessment in this case falls directly within the exception specified by the statute, when in the opinion of the County Judge an inadequate assessment had been made, in which event, it was the special duty of that officer to re-assess the property. We see no objection to the exercise of this power by that officer, and the assessment of railroad property, as such, lying in several civil districts, certainly does not fall within the reason-of the general law requiring the property of\u2019the citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>zen to be assessed in the district in which it lies; as the sole enquiry of the assessor would be, what is the value of the property, and this could as well be ascertained in the town of Gallatin, as in the several districts through which the railroad runs. Even in the case of an assessment by the district assessor, he is not absolutely required personally to inspect each lot, tract or parcel of land, but he may otherwise \u201cobtain satisfactory information in regard to the value thereof\u201d: Act 1873, c. 118, s. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In this case, we are. to presume that the assessor has availed himself of the best sources of information, and that. he has arrived at the approximate value of that part of the plaintiff\u2019s road. which lies in Sumner county. An exact mathematical certainty in assessing the value of property for taxation is not attainable. It was an observation of Chancellor Kent, that a just and perfect system of taxation, is yet a <em>desideratum </em>in civil government: 2 Comm., 332. But we do not understand that this assessment is objected to as excessive in valuation. We think, on the other hand, that it is so susceptible of demonstration, that if the basis of assessment be lawful, the plaintiff has no right to complain of the valuation. In the absence of any specific legislative directions, fixing a basis for the assessment of railroad property, we must throw ourselves upon the provisions of the Constitution and the general law, that all property must be taxed according to its value; and that real estate must be assessed at its market value, on a credit sale of one and two years. If that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad lying in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Sumner county, while in full operation,- were levied upon and sold upon a credit of one and two years, it would be sold and bought as a railroad, an integral part of a great and profitable line of freight and travel, between the two cities of Louisville and Nashville, and not as so many acres of ground upon which its easement lies, with its appurtenant houses and lands. If a tract of land be bought and sold in the same way, its capacity for production and advantages of market, would be essential elements and incidents of valuation. A railroad, with its necessary fixtures and appliances, is real estate, and taxable as such, and must be taxed upon its value as a railroad, and that value .must be ascertained by its actual, and not its speculative profits, or its mere capacity for productiveness; as it must be taxed at its value when assessed, and not what might be its value if under better management. We can conceive of no better criterion by which its value can be ascertained, than, first, the value of its structure, superstructure and properties, and then the profits which may enure to its owners in its operation. And xhis we understand to be the basis of assessment in this case. If it be an interstate railroad, as in this case \u2014 a part in this State and a part in another \u2014 we know of no better plan to fix the taxable value of that portion lying in this State, than to ascertain what proportion the latter bears to the whole. Upon this subject, however, there is great conflict of authority, and great contrariety of judicial reasoning and ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Thus, it is said, a state may impose taxes upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the corporation as an entity existing under \u25a0 its laws, as well as upon the capital stock of the corporation, or its separate corporate property, and the manner in which its value shall be assessed, and the rate of taxation, however arbitrary or capricious, are mere matters of legislative discretion. A tax on a corporation may be proportioned to the income \u2014 revenue, as well as to the value of franchise granted, or the property assessed: 18 Wall., 208. In <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>6 McLean, 395, it is said that a tax can only be just and equal on railroad corporations, by being assessed upon the profits, while the case of the <em>Sangamon &amp; Morgan P. P. Co. </em>v. <em>The County of Morgan, et al. </em>14 Ill., 163, it is held that the portion of a railroad company which lies within a county is taxable there, and the valuation must be of that specific part of it situated in such county, without reference to the whole road. But how, we ask, is that part of it, if valued as a railroad, to be ascertained except as proportioned to the value of the whole? In the case of <em>The People ex rel. etc., </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>Am. Railway Rep., 149, it is held, that in assessing real property belonging to a railway company, consisting of a strip of land but a few rods in width, upon which the railroad track is located, with the necessary stations, buildings, etc., the land should not be assessed as an isolated piece of property, but as a part of the whole railway, and its value should be estimated in connection with its position and the business and profit derived therefrom. And so in the case of <em>The People ex rel. etc., </em>v. <em>Fredericks et al., </em>48 Barb., 173, it was held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>real estate of railroad companies should be assessed at its value for the purposes to which it had been adapted, and not as mere farming lands; and in estimating the same, the assessors are not bound to consider it as mere land, and superstructure, isolated from other parts of the road. They are entitled to estimate the value of that part of the real estate within their jurisdiction which contributes to make up a complete and useful railroad extending beyond the town they represent. Judge Davis in delivering this opinion in this case said; <em>\u201c </em>They, the assessors, were not called upon to assess a farm, but some nine miles of railroad, completed and operated as a railroad; and the question was, what is the fair value under the statute rule, of this estate, thus made into a complete and useful railroad? To sever for the purpose of assessment the buildings and superstructure, and call the residue farming lands, would be a gross absurdity. A farm four rods wide and nine miles long, intersected with public highways, cut up with cattle-guards, culverts and bridges, divided lengthwise by a graded embankment, with ditches on either hand occupying a large share' of its width, would be a poor investment, either for cultivating or grazing purposes, and no assessor would be justified in appraising it at forty dollars an acre, because the adjoining farms, which were useful, such as were of that value. The law as well as good sense, require that the assessors should regard this property precisely what it was, and judge of it accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In the case of <em>The State of Illinois </em>v. <em>The Illinois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><em>Central R. R. Co. </em>27 Ill., 64, it is held that in assessing the value of a railroad for purposes of taxation, the enquiry should be what is the property worth, to be used for the purpose for which it was designed, and not for any other purpose to which it might be applied. In such a case, if the property is devoted to the use for which it was designed, and in a condition to produce its maximum income, one very important element for ascertaining its present value, is the amount of its nett profits. This, however, should not be the absolute standard of value. There should be taken in connection with it, the enquiry \u2014 what would a prudent man give for the property as a permanent investment, with a view to its present and future income. \u201cWhen property is thus improved/\u2019 said Judge Breese, in delivering the opinion, \u201cit is manifest that is it more or less valuable, as it yields a greater or less profit in its product and economical use. No prudent purchaser of such property would neglect in the first instance, to look at the income the property yields, so that he might, thereby, judge what profits he might in the future reasonably expect from its investment. To ascertain what he might safely give for the juoperty, no doubt he would and ought prudently to anticipate the future as' well as regard the past; and yet should he give more than the value as indicated by the present income, such enhanced value would be rather speculative than real, depending on a great variety of circumstances and casualties.\u201d We will not multiply citations upon this question. It resolves itself at last into one of practical sense, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>which the law of it must be evoked. <em>We </em>had as well talk of assessing a gold mine for taxation by the value of contiguous farming lands, as to assess a railroad by that standard. The law which requires that all property shall be taxed according to its value, would thus be rendered inoperative and nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In this case, it is said, that the assessor has treated the rolling stock of the road as part of the realty. This does not necessarily follow, however, because he has included it as one of the elements of value. The rolling stock necessarily enters into his estimate of value, and is an indispensable element of it, and so the implements of husbandry make land valuable, but are not a part of the realty. The rolling stock is a part of the railroad, and without it the road as such would be without value. It is a kind \u2022 of mixed property, partaking of the character of both realty and personalty \u2014 a sort of nondescript whose status has never been defined either by legislative or judicial ruling, in this State. In the case of the <em>Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>25 Barb., 484, the Supreme Court of New York, held that as between mortgagees and judgment creditors of the mortgagors, the rolling stock of a railroad company, such as locomotive engines, passenger, baggage and freight cars, etc., are fixtures, and will pass under a mortgage of the track of a roadway. ' In discussing the question, the Court say: \u201cAs a general rule, in order that articles originally personal should be considered as annexed to the freehold so as to become fixtures, they must either be fastened to the -realty, or what is clearly a part of it, or must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>be placed upon the land with a manifest intent that they shall permanently remain there; and that they shall be in some way peculiarly fitted to something that is actually fastened upon it, and essential if not absolutely necessary to its proper enjoyment. It is not necessary that things should be stationary in one place or position, in order that they should be technically deemed fixtures.\u201d And so it was held also, that the rolling stock of a railroad is a fixture, in <em>Farrer </em>v. <em>Stackpole, </em>6 Greenl., 157; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>23 Ill., 300; <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>23 How., U. S., 117. \u201cWe are all of opinion,\u201d say the Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>\u201cthat rolling stock, rails, ties, chains, spikes, and all other material brought upon the ground of the company incumbered by the mortgage, and designed to be attached to the realty, should be considered as a part of the realty.\u201d And to the same effect are the cases of the <em>Louisville &amp; New Albany R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>The State, </em>25 Ind., 177, and <em>Minnesota Co. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Co. </em>2 Wall.. 644. Following these respectable authorities, we might safely hold, that for the purposes of taxation, the rolling stock of a railroad company may be considered a part of the realty. The Legislature certainly has a right to impress it with the character of realty or personalty, but until it does so, it must be classified according to the doctrines of the common law. We have seen that by the Constitution of this State, all property except such as is exempt, <em>shall be taxed. </em>That it shall be taxed according to its value;- that value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature may prescribe. We can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>not presume' a <em>hiatus </em>in the law, or that the lawgivers have been utterly oblivious of this great source of revenue, and have left it untaxable; that the property of the plaintiff is exempt from this general burthen. The Legislature had not up to the time of this assessment, prescribed the basis or manner of assessing railroad property for taxation, but it is left to be assessed under the general law, \u201cthat real property shall be assessed at its market value, on a credit of one and two years, deducting fifteen per cent, in gross.\u201d In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s property has been assessed on its actual value, as railroad property, upon a valuation of its entire road-bed, rolling stock, equipments, engine houses, machine shops, depot grounds and lands, in view of the special uses and purposes to which they were all put and applied, and the profits arising from them as a railroad and appurtenances. It seems to us, if the plaintiff\u2019s property in the county of Sumner were exposed to' sale, that all these elements of value would be essential and indispensable in the estimate of its value, and that they constitute the only safe and just criterion thereof. It results, therefore, in the opinion of the Court, that the assessment of the plaintiff\u2019s property for county taxation in this case, was lawful and proper, and that there is no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The case involving an assessment of like nature for purposes of state taxation, is resisted on another ground, which is not involved in the case already considered. It is' argued on behalf of the State that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>remedy by <em>certiorari </em>does not lie to resist an assessment for state taxes. The Legislature has prescribed a remedy in such case on behalf of the taxpayer, and it is insisted that the remedy thus prescribed is exclusive of all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The first section of the act of 1873, c. 44, is in these words: \u201cThat in all cases in which an officer, charged by law with the collection of revenue due the State, shall institute any proceeding or take any steps for the collection of the sum alleged or claimed to be due by said officer, from any citizen, the party against whom the proceeding or step is taken shall, if he conceives the same to be unjust or illegal, or against any statute or any clause of the Constitution of the State, pay the same under protest; and upon his making such payment, the officer or collector shall pay such revenue into the state treasury, giving notice at the time of payment to the Comptroller that the same was paid under protest; and the party paying said revenue may, at any time within thirty days after making said payment, and not longer thereafter, sue the said officer having collected said sum, for the recovery thereof, and the same may be tried in any court having jurisdiction of the amount and parties, and if it be determined that the same was wrongfully eoll\u00e9cted as not being due from the said party to the State, for any reason going to the merits of the same, then the court trying the same may certify of record that the same was wrongfully paid, and ought to be refunded; and thereupon the Comptroller shall issue his warrant for the same, which shall be paid in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>.preference to other claims on the treasury.55 The second section of this act declares this remedy to be exclusive of all others. It will thus be seen that an ample remedy is provided for the citizen who conceives himself wronged by an improper exercise of the taxing power.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">But it is argued, on behalf of the plaintiff, that this statute is unconstitutional and void, as it deprives the citizen of the remedy by <em>certiorari, </em>guaranteed by the organic law. . By the tenth section of the sixth article of the Constitution it is provided, \u201cthat judges or justices of the inferior courts' of law and equity shall have power in all civil cases to issue writs of <em>certiorari </em>to remove any cause, or the transcript of the record thereof, from any inferior jurisdiction, into such court of law, on sufficient cause, supported by oath or affirmation.55 We are of opinion that, in regard to the taxing power in the State, this statute does not infringe either this or any other constitutional provision. The power to tax is not conferred by the Constitution, but is the incident and the highest attribute of sovereignty. Its limitations are self-imposed by the sovereign, and these alone are to be found in the bills of rights and constitutions vouchsafed to the subject for his protection. No government could exist for a day without this attribute of supereminent sovereignty, and no government could exist for a day if its subjects could resist at pleasure and without restriction, the power to levy taxes. It is the paramount power of all others which guarantees to the subject absolute protection upon the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>dition of absolute obedience and promptness in meeting its pecuniary exactions, by which alone it has the power to protect. The government can create its own sources of revenue without restriction, except such as it has imposed upon itself. Its power in this respect is imperial and all-pervading, and in the free states of America it is as unfettered and absolute, to the extent of their territorial jurisdiction, and subject only to the self-imposed restrictions of their own organic laws, as it was in imperial Rome when the \u201cdecree went forth from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.\u201d ' The power to tax involves the power to exist, and the one must be exercised promptly, certainly, and without interruption, in order to secure the other. \u201cThe State can not commit suicide.\u201d The remedy provided by the statute is ample, speedy and certain, and the indemnity of the injured citizen is absolutely assured. We have no hesitation in holding that the clause of the Constitution in question has no reference whatever to any litigation growing out of the taxing power in the State, and that the enactment is constitutional and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"390\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b822-6\">Judges Deaderick, McFarland and Nicholson</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">joined in the following dissenting opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">It is ordained by the Constitution of the State that \u201call property, real, personal and mixed, shall be taxed according to its value, that value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature shall direct.\u201d This provision was not intended to confer upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Legislature the power of taxation; that power is inherent in the Legislature, as the representative of- the sovereignty of the State. It was intended to be an imperative direction to the Legislature to subject all property to taxation, except that exempted by the Constitution, and to require that the taxation should be according to its value, but imposing upon the Legislature the duty of directing the manner in which the value is to be ascertained, so that taxes shall be equal and uniform throughout the State. It is obvious that this provision of the Constitution can not be practically operative until the Legislature has prescribed the manner of ascertaining the value of property. The question is, has the Legislature, by any act, directed the manner in which railroads or railroad corporations shall be assessed for taxation? They can only be taxed, after the Legislature has prescribed the manner of ascertaining their value. Their franchises, as well as their road-beds, rolling stock, &amp;e., constitute, property, real, personal and mixed, and are therefore properly subjects of taxation. But, until the manner of ascertaining their value is prescribed, no valid assessment of them for taxation can be made. The Legislature, in 1873, undertook to discharge the duty imposed by the Constitution, by the passage of an act which decrees that \u201call property, real, personal and mixed, shall be assessed for taxation,\u201d except such as is therein expressly exempted. This is but a repetition of the constitutional ordinance, and shows that it was the purpose of the Legislature to carry out that ordinance. The basis on which all assessments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>of property are to be made is declared, and as to real property, it is to be assessed \u201cat its market value, and to be assessed in tbe district or ward where situated, on a credit of one and two years, deducting fifteen per cent, in gross.\u201d \u201cIn assessing real estate, the following shall be shown: 1, the description of the property; 2, the name of owner or owners; 3, the value of the land or town lots, including improvements; 4, the value of mills, manufactories, distilleries, various founderies, and other buildings used for similar purposes, Ac.\u201d \u201cIn describing real estate, the following rules shall be observed: 1, the number of the town lots shall be given, the name of the street, avenue, alley or road on which it fronts, &amp;c.; 2, if\" the property is a part of any known sub-division, the number, &amp;c.,' its size, dimensions, &amp;c., shall be given; 3, In describing tracts of land, when it can be done, the surveyor\u2019s district, range, township, &amp;c., shall be designated, and the number of acres.\u201d The act requires each assessor, in assessing in his district or ward, to commence at some corner or outside point of his district or ward, and assess the property in rotation as it joins, or lies contiguous to, property just assessed; and- proceed in some regular manner until he has made the circuit of his district or ward. He shall see each lot, tract or parcel of land, or otherwise obtain satisfactory information in regard thereto, &amp;c. The provisions for the sale of real estate for unpaid taxes, require the real estate to be described as \u201ctracts of land, town lots, and parts of town lots.\u201d These are all the provisions of the act which can bear upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>the question under consideration, except the 25th section, which authorizes the chairman or judge of the county court, the clerk of the county court, the county trustee, sheriff, or tax-collector, of any county, upon information that any person, company, firm or corporation in said county have not been assessed as contemplated by the provisions of the act, to cite said person, company, firm or corporation to appear before them for the purpose of being assessed according to law. This section has no other effect than to provide for collecting assessments omitted or improperly made, in pursuance of this act. The question now is, did the Legistature intend, by the provisions of this act, to prescribe the manner of assessing railroads for taxation ? There is no direct allusion to the franchises, stock, road-beds, rolling stock or other property of railroad corporations, throughout the statute. If we assume that the locomotives and cars of railroads, as well as their corporate franchises, constitute real estate, then it' may be conceded that the language of the first section is broad enough to include railroads. It says: \u201cAll real estate shall be taxed.\u201d But did the Legislature intend to include railroads as real estate? Our business is with the intention of the act. Is it possible that the Legislature could have intended to subject so vast an amount of property to taxation without directing specifically how its value was to be ascertained?- Every direction laid down in the act, as to the manner of assessing real estate, has special reference to town lots and tracts of land as constituting the only real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>to be assessed. The value of the real estate to be assessed is its market value, on a credit of one and two years, deducting fifteen per cent, in gross. This is to be the value of the land, or town lots, including improvements. The town lots are to be described by numbers, streets, &amp;e. The land is to be described by reference to the surveyor\u2019s district, range, township, Ac. There is to be ah assessor for every civil district or ward, and he is- directed to commence at a corner or outside point of his district or ward. All this has manifest reference to land and town lots as the real estate intended by the Legislature. It is clear that there is no express direction in the statute as to the manner of assessing or ascertaining the value of the property of railroad corporations. This is a preliminary step to be taken by the Legislature before this property can be subjected to taxation, by the express provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">But it appears that the authority for making the assessments, in the present case, is claimed for the county judge of Sumner county, by virtue of the provision of the 25th section of the act of 1873. That portion of the Louisville &amp; Nashville railroad located in Sumner county was not assessed for taxation by the regular assessors. This fact coming to the knowledge of the county judge, he notified the railroad company to appear before him, for the purpose of being taxed \u201caccording to law.\u201d He accordingly made the assessment now resisted by the railroad company. It is obvious that the assessment was not made in pursuance of the manner of ascertaining the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>real estate prescribed in tbe statute. He assumes that tbe railroad, including its road-bed, engines and cars and franchises is real estate, and, as \u2022 such, subject to assessment. He ascertained the value of the whole road, with all its fixtures and franchises, by a rule entirely arbitrary, and then assessed the portion of the road located in Sumner county according to the value so ascertained. But the statute prescribes no such manner of ascertaining the value of. real estate for the purpose of assessment. We have seen that all the provisions of the statute, directing the manner of ascertaining the value of real estate, have special reference to the assessment of town lots and tracts of land, with their improvements, and that the assessment of a railroad as real estate, in pursuance of these provisions, would be wholly <em>impracticable; </em>hence it is that the county judge has adopted an arbitrary manner of making the assessment, under the assumption, we presume, that as the regular assessors had not assessed the railroad, he had the power to supply the omission, and in so doing, to exercise a discretion as to the manner of making the assessment. But the statute only authorized the county judge to make assessment in these cases where the regular assessor had omitted to assess \u201caccording to the provisions of the statute,\u201d and, in express terms, he was required to assess \u201caccording to law.\u201d No discretion whatever is given to him, but he was required to, make his assessment in the manner directed by the statute. It may be, and we think it is probably true, that the manner adopted by the assessor in ascertaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>value of the railroad in Sumner county for assessment is a proper manner, but the Constitution imposes the duty upon the \u00abLegislature to direct the manner of ascertaining the value of all real estate. Until this duty was performed by the Legislature, the county judge had no authority to adopt a manner not prescribed by the Legislature.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
