S. Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">Defendants Flint City Councilmen appeal from a judgment and order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>trial court and affirmance by the Court of Appeals (on different grounds), the effect of which would be to prohibit informal meetings or discussions by members of the council pertaining to the business of the city.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The core question is one of construction of two statutes which could be interpreted as in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The constitutional problems of prior restraint, of freedom of assembly, speech and the press were neither briefed nor argued and so will not be considered. The balancing of rights as exemplified by the now classic observation that your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose was\u2014 perhaps wisely \u2014 omitted from the issues placed before the Court. This is mentioned only because the trial judge obliquely brought constitutional issues into his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Although we will eventually construe tlie statutes in question, we cannot in good conscience apply the law to the stipulated facts. These \"facts\u201d are too abstract and the problem too important for us to enter into what would be essentially a guessing game. For this reason, we will retain jurisdiction but remand to the trial court for factual testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The agreed statement of facts are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\" 'Flint city councumen have met in City Hall at the request of the city manager on several occasions at which meetings the public was excluded. Subjects of discussion generally effect <em>[sic] </em>overall policy and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>occasion, may involve items which may require legislative action at a later date.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">If one were to speculate upon what really occurred in these gatherings, any number of possibilities come into focus. For instance:</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">1. A firm decision could have been made with only the formalities of a vote remaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">2. Vague theories could have been tested upon colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">3. A preliminary discussion could have taken place regarding a subject which may or may not ever come to a vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">4. Legal advice may have been sought from the city attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">5. Labor negotiations then taking place may have been the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">6. A rumor involving the reputation of an employee could have been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">7. A possible need for land could have been discussed, the knowledge of which might greatly increase the cost to the taxpayers if the probability blossomed into reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">There are limitless possibilities as subjects of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">However, the \"stipulated facts\u201d do limit discussions to those taking place in the city hall at the request of the city manager. The content of the discussions is uncle\u00e1r and specifically will be the focus of this remand..</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">We cannot apply the law to facts which we do not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">For this reason, we remand to the trial court for a factual record concerning the character and content of the discussions and meetings in question. We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-16\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. G. Kavanagh, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Swainson, Williams, Levin, and J. W.

The relief sought is a modification of the injunction issued by the Circuit Court for the County of Genesee pursuant to a stipulation of the parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\"Wherefore, both parties move this Court to issue an order modifying the injunction heretofore issued in the Circuit Court of the County of Genesee so that such injunction would provide as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\" 'The City Council for the City of Flint, or any members thereof, are restrained from meeting in private for the purpose of making a decision or conducting discussions or deliberations which might lead to a decision involving the city government except for the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">'\"1.

To consider records which are specifically exempt by law from public inspection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">\" '6. To consider severe threats of riot or insurrection public knowledge of which, in the opinion of the City Council, would be detrimental to efforts to meet or lessen the threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\" 'Failure of members of the Flint City Council to abide by this stipulation may result in the commencement of contempt proceedings by the plaintiffs herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\" 'It shall be the continuing duty of the City Attorney, or his Assistant, as Officers of the Court, to report any violation of the Court\u2019s injunction as modified hereinabove.
