He was sentenced to 2 to 15 years with the recommendation that he serve only the minimum term,</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">The incident occurred on Memorial Day 1971. Defendant was at the home of Mr. Ellis Samon. An argument began between Mr. Samon and a young neighbor. The youngster was ordered to leave the Samon yard. He did, returned and was again ordered to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">The child returned a third time accompanied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>his 15-year-old brother. Mr. Samon was not present and defendant ordered the boys to leave. The older boy threw a piece of wood at defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">When again ordered to leave, the older boy said that he was going to get a gun. He went to his home and reappeared at the back door with an object which defendant claims he thought was a gun. Defendant was himself armed with a pistol. He fired and fatally wounded the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">At trial, it was shown that defendant owned the pistol for use in his work as a gas station attendant. He also knew that the boys had access to a weapon. Defendant claimed that his actions were taken in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Preliminary matters and the presentation of evidence consumed four trial days. The court instructed the jury as to seven possible verdicts. The instructions cover 45 pages of transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The jury deliberated four days. On three occasions the court repeated portions of its charge concerning possible verdicts. Finally, the court delivered this instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\"Our-laws assume that in the process of deliberation and discussion it will be possible for twelve minds to meet, to reach a consensus in which all twelve participated. Now, if this assumption proves to be incorrect in case after case, our system of jury trials as we know it will have broken down and there would have to be some other system devised to replace it. Recognizing this, the high court of our State and I should have said the highest of our State and the highest court of our Nation approves of an instruction by the trial Judge concerning efforts on agreement. The only mode provided by our Constitution and laws for deciding questions of fact in criminal cases, is by the verdict of a jury. In a large proportion of cases, and perhaps, strictly speaking, in all cases, absolute certainty cannot be attained or expected. Although the verdict to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a juror agrees must of course, be his own verdict, the result of his own convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his fellows, yet, in order to bring twelve minds to a unanimous result, you must examine the questions submitted to you with candor and with a proper regard and deference to the opinions of each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\"You should consider that the case should, at some time, be decided; that you are selected in the same manner, and from the same source, from which any future jury must be; and there is no reason to suppose that the case will ever be submitted to twelve men and women more intelligent, more impartial, or more competent to decide it, or that more or clearer evidence will be produced on the one side or the other. And, with this in view, it is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so without surrendering your conscientious belief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\"Now, in order to make a decision more practicable and easier to arrive at, the law places the burden of proof on one party in a criminal case and that party is the Prosecution and as I was going to say, the Prosecution is the Prosecuting Attorney. The law imposes that burden on the Prosecution. That burden is upon the Prosecution to establish every part of its case beyond a reasonable doubt and if, at any part of it you\u2019re left with a reasonable doubt, the Defendant is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and must be acquitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\"But, in conferring together, you ought to pay proper respect to each other\u2019s opinions and listen, with a disposition to be convinced to each other\u2019s arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\"And, if on the one hand if much the larger number of your panel are for a conviction, a dissenting juror should consider whether a doubt in his own mind is a reasonable one which makes no impression upon the minds of so many men equally honest, equally intelligent with himself and who have heard the same evidence, with the same attention, with an equal desire to arrive at the truth and under the sanction of the same oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\"If, on the other hand, if a majority are for acquittal, the minority ought seriously to ask themselves whether they may not reasonably, and ought not to doubt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>correctness of a judgment which is not concurred in by most of those with whom they are associated and distrust the weight of sufficiency of that evidence which fails to carry conviction to the minds of their fellows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\"Now, I ask you to try conscienciously <em>[sic] </em>and honestly in your own convictions, to try to arrive at a verdict. If you can arrive at a verdict in individual good conscience, do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The jury left the courtroom at 11:15 a.m. At 2:35 they reached a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. Its \"review of the instruction complained of demonstrates that <em>People v Chivas, </em>322 Mich 384 [34 NW2d 22] (1948) and <em>People v Coleman, </em>21 Mich App 193 [175 NW2d 308] (1970) control\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\n<em>ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Was the <em>Allen </em>-type charge either (1) coercive per se, or (2) coercive in this particular case?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">The instruction delivered by the court is known as an <em>Allen </em>charge. The earliest example is found in <em>Commonwealth v Tuey, </em>62 Mass (8 Cush) 1 (1851). The Court approved a charge the substance of which was the same as the one quoted above. It said that this \"did nothing more than to present to the minds of the dissenting jurors a strong motive to unanimity.\u201d The instruction was \"entirely sound, and well adapted to bring to the attention of the jury one of the means by which they might be safely guided in the performance of their duty.\u201d Also see <em>State v Smith, </em>49 Conn 376 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">The popular name for this instruction results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s approval of the charge in <em>Allen v United States, </em>164 US 492; 17 S Ct 154; 41 L Ed 528 (1896). The charge was identical to that given in <em>Tuey. </em>The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">\"While, undoubtedly, the verdict of the jury should represent the opinion of each individual juror, it by no means follows that opinions may not be changed by conference in the jury-room. The very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by comparison of views, and by arguments among the jurors themselves. It certainly cannot be the law that each juror should not listen with deference to the arguments and with a distrust of his own judgment, if he finds a large majority of the jury taking a different view of the case from what he does himself. It cannot be that each juror should go to the jury-room with a blind determination that the verdict shall represent his opinion of the case at that moment; or, that he should close his ears to the arguments of men who are equally honest and intelligent as himself. There was no error in these instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">To date the United States Supreme Court and this Court have sanctioned the use of this instruction. Indicative is <em>Kawakita v United States, </em>343 US 717; 72 S Ct 950; 96 L Ed 1249 (1952). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had discussed the <em>Allen </em>charge. See 190 F2d 506. The Supreme Court did not speak to this issue saying that certain allegations of error were \"either insubstantial or so adequately disposed of by the Court of Appeals that we give them no notice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>Michigan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Use of the <em>Allen </em>charge also has long been part of this state\u2019s jurisprudence. In <em>People v Coulon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>151 Mich 200; 114 NW 1013 (1908), the trial court urged the minority to reconsider but further indicated \"that no juror should yield his well-grounded convictions or violate his oath\u201d. The trial court also said that \"if upon further consideration a juror cannot conscientiously yield, of course he ought not to do so\u201d. This Court citing <em>Tuey, Smith </em>and <em>Allen </em>said such instructions were not erroneous. See <em>People v Tutha, </em>276 Mich 387; 267 NW 867 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Compare the decision in <em>People v Engle, </em>118 Mich 287; 76 NW 502 (1898) where the Court noted a deviation from the <em>Tuey </em>charge and granted a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\"In the present case, however, the jury were not instructed that the verdict to which they agreed should be and must be each individual juror\u2019s own verdict, the result of his own convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his fellows; but, on the contrary, they were instructed just the reverse, \u2014 that they must each try to be persuaded. We think the court was in error in this instruction, and that its substance had a tendency to make the jurors feel that they must give way their honest convictions upon the merits, and agree with the majority, though they had a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In <em>People v Kasem, </em>230 Mich 278; 203 NW 135 (1925), the trial court apparently told the jury that they had a duty to reach a verdict. The court indicated to the panel that it would entail great expense to declare a hung jury. This Court did not regard this as coercing agreement although \"what was said might better have been omitted\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>case must be evaluated on its own facts and circumstances. See <em>People v Digione, </em>250 Mich 206; 229 NW 421 (1930); <em>People v Licavoli, </em>256 Mich 229; 239 NW 292 (1931) and <em>People v Pizzino, </em>313 Mich 97; 20 NW2d 824 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Defendant in the instant case admits that the trial court was most scrupulous in following the language approved in <em>People v Chivas, </em>322 Mich 384; 34 NW2d 22 (1948). In <em>Chivas, </em>the charge was given after the jury had deliberated into a second day. The Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\"In our opinion the court did not tell the jury that it was their duty to agree upon a verdict or tell an individual juror that he must give up his own views and agree with the majority. The jury was instructed to deliberate upon the matters in issue with an open mind, giving due credit to the opinions of others. The jurors were also instructed that the verdict must be the individual verdict of each juror and be the result of his own convictions. We are unable to find any coercion in the instructions given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Our decisions lead to the conclusion an <em>Allen </em>charge is not per se coercive. Any claim of coercion must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The <em>Allen </em>charge reached middle age before it received critical attention. Although most state and Federal courts continue to use an <em>Allen </em>-type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>charge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> some jurisdictions have adopted new instructions and of those jurisdictions, some had deficiencies not present in the Michigan instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">However, a look at case and comment on the subject may bring into focus the principal concerns involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The giving of proper supplemental instructions serves a positive end.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One author noted \"the basic theme that considerations of judicial economy require that jurors reexamine their convictions in attempting to reach a verdict\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and then wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">\"[T]he interests in avoiding hung juries and in impressing jurors with the necessity to deliberate in good faith with their fellows in attempting to reach a unanimous verdict deserves substantial weight, not merely in terms of judicial administration but in terms of achieving the end product of a fair trial.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Although the elimination of supplemental instructions might retard rather than promote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>interests of justice,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> courts must guard against coercion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">\"Such an instruction is proper only if it serves to start further deliberation. If the charge has the effect of forcing a juror to surrender an honest conviction, it is coercive and constitutes reversible error. In order to determine whether the <em>Allen </em>instruction has such an influence on the jury, the charge must be examined in the factual context in which it is given.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The optimum instruction will generate discussion directed towards the resolution of the case but will avoid forcing a decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">If the instruction given \"can cause a juror to abandon his conscientious dissent and defer to the majority solely for the sake of reaching agreement\u201d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then that charge should not be used. Such results obviously have no place in a fair criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The study presently having a great impact is the ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The standards relating to trial by jury were approved by the House of Delegates in 1968. Section 5.4 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\"Length of deliberations; deadlocked jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\"(a) Before the jury retires for deliberation, the court may give an instruction which informs the jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\"(i) that in order to return a verdict, each juror must agree thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">\"(ii) that jurors have a duty to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if it can be done without violence to individual judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">\"(iii) that each juror must decide the case for himself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with his fellow jurors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">\"(iv) that in the course of deliberations, a juror should not hesitate to reexamine his own views and change his opinion if convinced it is erroneous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlH\">\"(v) that no juror should surrender his honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of his fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">\"(b) If it appears to the court that the jury has been unable to agree, the court may require the jury to continue their deliberations and may give or repeat an instruction as provided in subsection (a). The court shall not require or threaten to require the jury to deliberate for an unreasonable length of time or for unreasonable intervals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">\"(c) The jury may be discharged without having agreed upon a verdict if it appears that there is no reasonable probability of agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>As we shall see, some courts have given great weight to these recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">For nearly three quarters of a century the <em>Allen </em>charge had clear sailing in the Federal courts with but an occasional contrary breeze.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In 1969 the Seventh Circuit addressed the problem in <em>United States v Brown, </em>411 F2d 930. The Court rejected arguments that the instruction violated the Sixth Amendment or was necessarily unfair. Noting criticisms, the Court \"concluded that it would serve the interests of justice to require\u201d under its supervisory power that district courts prospectively follow the ABA recommendation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction because he could not show the charge given was so prejudicial as to warrant reversal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>United States v Fioravanti, </em>412 F2d 407 (1969), the Third Circuit analyzed a charge telling minority jurors to distrust their own judgment, a charge not present in the instant instruction. However, the Court did not reverse the conviction. The charge \"was not so prejudicial as to deprive appellant of a fair trial\u201d. The Court did forbid trial judges to \"direct a juror to distrust his own judgment if he finds a large majority of the jurors taking a view different from his.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The ABA standards also were adopted in a 5-4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>decision by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>in <em>United States v Thomas, </em>146 US App DC 101; 449 F2d 1177 (1971). The trial court had given an <em>Allen </em>charge but also personally encouraged the jurors to reach a verdict. The Court of Appeals deemed this coercive. The Court did not hold the <em>Allen </em>charge per se coercive but exercised its supervisory powers in adopting the ABA proposals for use in trials conducted after the date of their opinion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The majority of circuits continue to permit use of the <em>Allen </em>charge<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> particularly if it emphasizes that each juror has to make an individual judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>United States v Sawyers, </em>423 F2d 1335 (1970), the Fourth Circuit noted that the instruction \"twice included language emphasizing that no juror should surrender his or her conscientious convictions because of the opinion of other jurors or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\"A calmly dispassionate balanced effort on the part of a trial judge to induce a verdict does not seem to us to invade the province of the jury. What, after all, is the purpose of the judge\u2019s initial charge to the jury? It is not to induce a verdict based upon evidence and the law as he has given it to them? Why is a trial judge in the federal system given the power to comment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>evidence, and to place the burden of proof, and to advise the jury that it is their duty to accept the law as he gives it to them, unless it is to help the jury arrive at a true verdict? If the jurors misunderstand the instructions, no one, we think, would seriously suggest that the judge may not subsequently clarify or repeat them. If, at the same time, he urges further deliberation in an effort to agree upon a verdict, and in doing so his comments are balanced and not slanted toward conviction, we are unable to perceive harm to the defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Also see <em>United States v Bailey, </em>480 F2d 518 (1973) where the Fifth Circuit sitting <em>en banc </em>reaffirmed their \"decisions approving the <em>Allen </em>charge within the limitations therein delineated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">As noted above, the charge which <em>Commonwealth v Tuey </em>validated originally was approved in <em>United States v Allen. </em>In 1968 the Massachusetts Court reaffirmed the holding of <em>Tuey. </em>In <em>Commonwealth v Rollins, </em>354 Mass 630; 241 NE2d 809 (1968), the Court said the instruction was not coercive and states \"merely what an intelligent juror should set as a standard for his own conduct\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\"We think that the language of the <em>Tuey </em>case has stood the test of time as a reasonable method of inviting a jury\u2019s attention, even after the original charge, to considerations which, as reasonable men, they should take into account, without surrendering positions which conscience and careful judgment have led them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>adopt. The parties are entitled to have a jury appropriately guided at all stages by the trial judge, whose proper participation is essential to fair trial by jury. The <em>Tuey </em>charge seems to us a method by which a trial judge may assist a jury when requesting them to consider a case further.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Also see <em>Commonwealth v Richardson, </em>\u2014 Mass \u2014; 282 NE2d 95 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">However, the Massachusetts Court recently provided some prospective guidelines. In <em>Commonwealth v Rodriquez, </em>\u2014 Mass \u2014; 300 NE2d 192 (1973), defendant\u2019s claim that the supplemental instructions were prejudicial was rejected on the authority of <em>Rollins. </em>\"For the future\u201d the Court thought \"certain emendations of the <em>Tuey </em>charge are desirable in the interests of the better administration of criminal justice\u201d and prospectively adopted a revised version.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In an appendix the Court printed the <em>Tuey </em>charge with the changes it thought appropriate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The Court said the charge still \"has a sting and our approval of it is not to be taken as an indication that it may be used prematurely or without evident cause.\u201d The Court also approved the illustrative charge accompanying \u00a7 5.4 of the ABA study.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Among others, Oregon, Alaska and Minnesota also proceeded to adopt the ABA standards. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibited further use of the <em>Allen </em>charge in <em>Commonwealth v Spencer, </em>442 Pa 328; 275 A2d 299 (1971).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The ABA standards were recommended as guidelines. The ruling was prospective only. Defendant\u2019s convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tion was affirmed as analysis disclosed that the jury was not coerced. For a favorable analysis of a supplemental charge, see <em>Commonwealth v Lambert, </em>450 Pa 130; 299 A2d 240 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Exercising its supervisory powers, the Illinois Supreme Court adopted the ABA standards and recommended instructions in <em>People v Prim, </em>53 Ill 2d 62; 289 NE2d 601 (1972). The Court did not totally prohibit use of supplemental instructions. The Court did not feel that \"a jury should be left to grope in such circumstances without some guidance from the court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The ABA standards were adopted in Maine in <em>State v White, </em>285 A2d 832 (1972). However, the <em>Allen </em>-type charge was not considered per se coercive, nor did it have that effect in this case. Defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Vermont also has recently disapproved \"the use of such a charge that departs from the substance of the ABA standards\u201d. <em>State v Perry, </em>131 Vt 337; 306 A2d 110 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Although the majority of state and Federal jurisdictions still approve an <em>Allen </em>-type supplemental charge, an increasing number of courts have found an inherent danger in the possibility that the charge may be coercively worded and applied in some cases. In order to insure fair trials generally and fewer retrials, the better practice has been deemed by many to be that found in ABA standard jury instruction 5.4. We agree in that conclusion and in the proclivity of the various courts to adopt the standard for future use.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Concluding from the standards generally approved by both Federal and state courts and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Michigan precedent, we cannot find the supplemental charge given herein coercive per se. Nor can we objectively say that it was applied coercively in this case or resulted in a coerced verdict. In fact, the great care insured by the trial judge and the extensive thought evidenced by the jury in asking for re-instructions as to particular verdicts produced a verdict quite appropriate to the admitted facts. The totality of this long trial based upon the state of the law at that time precludes any finding of error by the judge or deprivation of constitutional rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">However, we are persuaded that any possible future danger of coercive effect by the giving of an <em>Allen </em>-type charge is one which can and should be avoided. An analysis of recent cases and commentaries confirms our belief that the better practice is to be found in the recommended ABA jury standard 5.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Therefore, prospectively from the date of this opinion, the ABA standard jury instruction 5.4 as set forth herein is adopted by this Court. Any substantial departure therefrom shall be grounds for reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Swainson, Williams, and J. W. Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with M. S. Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> The court made this observation at pp 289-290:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\"In considering such questions, we are apt to lose sight of the fact that jurors are men of intelligence. They fully understand that they are not mere automatons, charged with the duty of voicing the sentiments or desires of the trial court. The majority, if not all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>them, have a proper conception of their own duty, and of the duty of the court, and will not be driven to return a hasty or unjust verdict because they might think it in accord with the wishes of the court.

In a large proportion of cases, and perhaps, strictly speaking, in \u00bf1 cases, absolute certainty cannot be attained or expected. Although the verdict to which a juror agrees must of course be his own verdict, the result of his own convictions, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his fellows, yet, in order to bring twelve minds to a unanimous result, you must examine the questions submitted to you with candor, and with a proper regard and deference to the opinions of each other. You should consider that <em>it is desirable that </em>the case must at-seme -time be decided; that you are selected in the same manner, and from the same source, from which any future jury must be; and there is no reason to suppose that the case will ever be submitted to twelve men <em>persons </em>more intelligent, more impartial, or more competent to decide it, or that more or clearer evidence will be produced on the one side or the other. And with this view, it is your duty to decide the case, if you can conscientiously do so. In order to make a decision more practicable, the law imposes the burden of proof on one party or the other, in all cases. In the present case, the burden of proof is upon the commonwealth to establish every part of it, beyond a reasonable doubt; and if, in any part of it you are left in doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>be acquitted. But, in conferring together, you ought to pay proper respect to each other\u2019s opinions, and listen, with a disposition to be convinced, to each other\u2019s arguments. Andy on the one hand, if much the larger member-of-your panol aro for a-eonviction, a dioconting juror- <em>Thus, where there is disagreement, jurors for acquittal </em>should consider whether a doubt in his- <em>their </em>own mind- <em>minds </em>is a reasonable one, which makes no impression upon the minds of so-many men, <em>others, </em>equally honest, equally intelligent with himself <em>themselves, </em>and who have heard the same evidence, with the same attention, with an equal desire to arrive at the truth, and under the sanction of the same oath. And on the other hand, if a majority are for aoquittal, the minority <em>jurors for conviction </em>ought seriously to ask themselves, whether they may not reasonably, and ought not to doubt the correctness of a judgment, which is not concurred in by most- of those <em>others </em>with whom they are associated; and distrust the weight or sufficiency of that evidence which fails to carry conviction to the minds of their fellows.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> \"The verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree thereto.

In the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to reexamine your own views and change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous.
