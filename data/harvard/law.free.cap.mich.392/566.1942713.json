Why the difference here? It is because of misgivings about the statute of limitations. As one who has himself been led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>astray in that regard,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I appreciate those sentiments. It has, however, come to be recognized that the statute of limitations is not a disfavored plea but a perfectly righteous defense, a meritorious defense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that may, like other affirmative defenses, be raised tardily.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">My colleague says this is a matter of discretion. In a somewhat similar context, I wrote and others concurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\"If we were to recognize a judge\u2019s personal view of a claim or defense as a valid reason for rejecting an amendment, we would find it difficult to explain why his personal view should not also be relevant in assaying a claim or defense raised in the initial pleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\"An individual judge may not properly substitute his personal view of justice and sound public policy for the statutory, or common-law or court rule meant to apply.\u201d <em>Ben P Fyke &amp; Sons v Gunter Co, </em>390 Mich 649, 659-660; 213 NW2d 134 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-9\"><em>Fyke </em>is distinguished on the ground that it concerned amendment of a pleading and relevant Rule 118 does not expressly provide for the imposition of conditions, while Rule 520.4, concerning setting aside of defaults, does explicitly so provide. My colleague states, \"[t]his difference is deliberate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\"Amendment of pleadings is for the most part intended to assure accuracy and completeness in the presentation of the whole controversy on its merits. No good purpose occurs to us to warrant imposing, conditions for allowing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Yet he discusses, with seeming approval, an earlier opinion recognizing a judge\u2019s power to \"impose just and reasonable terms as a condition precedent to the amendment\u201d. <em>Beecher v Wayne Circuit Judges, </em>70 Mich 363, 369; 38 NW 322 (1888).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Section 1 of the statute of amendments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *first enacted in 1846 and carried forward without substantive change to the Revised Judicature Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> authorizes a trial court to allow prejudgment amendment of a pleading \u201cfor the furtherance of justice, on such terms as shall be just\u201d. This had been regarded as authorizing a judge to impose conditions when allowing an amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The authorities are legion throughout the land that amendment of a pleading may be granted subject to conditions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">FR Civ P, 15(a), the source of Rule 118,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> similarly contains no express authorization for a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>judge to allow amendment of a pleading upon conditions, while, as Professors Wright and Miller write, \"Rule 15(d) authorizes the court to permit a supplemental pleading to be served 'upon such terms as are just * * * \u2019. The absence of a comparable provision in Rule 15(a) has quite properly been ignored; it clearly should not be interpreted as preventing the court from imposing conditions on a grant of leave to amend under that subdivision. The statement in Rule 15(a) \u00a1that 'leave shall be freely given when justice so requires\u2019[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>], presupposes that the court may use its discretion to impose conditions on the allowance of a proposed amendment as an appropriate means of balancing the interests of the party seeking the amendment and those of the party objecting to it. The imposition of terms often will further the rule\u2019s liberal amendment policy. If the party opposing the amendment can be protected by the use of conditions from any possible prejudice that might result from the untimeliness of the amendment, there is no justifiable reason for not allowing it.\u201d 6 Wright &amp; Miller, Fed Prac &amp; Proc, \u00a7 1486, pp 423-424.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">My colleague sees rough or poetic justice in relieving the road commission of its default only on the condition that it not plead plaintiffs\u2019 \"default\u201d in failing timely to file the complaint. His reasoning would permit a judge to refuse to allow the defense of the statute of limitations whenever a defendant fails timely to answer. The statute of limitations could then be raised, by amendment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>in a late-filed answer, only as an indulgence of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">If it is sound public policy to allow the defense of statute of limitations only if it is raised in a timely-filed answer, we should riot leave the matter to discretion. It would be better to amend the General Court Rules to provide that trial judge authority to allow pleading amendments and setting aside of a default does not extend to allowance of an amendment or late-filed answer which sets up the defense of statute of limitations. This unique exception to the general policy of encouraging the allowance of amendments and setting aside of defaults would be without viable precedent, but would be better than for allowance of the defense in such case to become a matter of judicial grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A judge may properly attach only those conditions necessary to prevent advantage to the tardy defendant and to relieve the plaintiff of prejudice attributable to defendant\u2019s delay in answering or in proferring his amended pleading. He may not attach a wholly irrelevant condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\"><em>Strauss v Douglas Aircraft Co, </em>404 F2d 1152, 1158 (CA 2, 1968) illustrates both that whether a statute of limitations defense may be raised belatedly does not rest entirely in trial judge discretion and that the principle which should guide its exercise is avoidance of advantage to defendant and prejudice to plaintiff. There, had defendant timely raised this defense, plaintiff could have timely commenced his action elsewhere. The United States Court of Appeals held \"that because of the substantial prejudice to Strauss caused by Douglas\u2019 excessiv\u00e9 delay in raising the Statute of Limitations defense, the court below abused its discretion in permitting Douglas to amend its answer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The trial judge abused his discretion in this case because the condition he imposed bore no relationship to any adverse consequence suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the road commission\u2019s default.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The condition does not restore the plaintiffs to the position they would have been in had the road commission timely answered, but, rather, places them in a vastly superior position. Default is not \"a procedure intended to furnish an advantage to the plaintiff so that a defense may be defeated or a judgment obtained without the difficulty that arises from a contest by the defendant\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The question now before us was presented in <em>Detroit v Wayne Circuit Judge, </em>112 Mich 317, 319; 70 NW 894 (1897). The trial court, in setting aside the city\u2019s default, struck a notice, accompanying the city\u2019s plea, that it would defend on the ground that it had not received timely notice of injury. This Court reversed because once the judge determined that the city had a right \"to make defense to the action, * * * it was not within his discretion to limit its defense in the manner set forth\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">In the instant case, the trial court erroneously equated the \"default\u201d of the plaintiffs to commence their action against the road commission until 8 years after the accident with the default of the road commission in failing to answer within 20 days, a lapse it sought to rectify 14 days after entry of the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The statutes of limitations and procedures for default judgments serve different policies and purposes. Statutes of limitations are intended to \"compel the exercise of a right of action within a reasonable time so that the opposing party has a fair opportunity to defend\u201d; \"to relieve a court system from dealing with 'stale\u2019 claims, where the facts in dispute occurred so long ago that evidence was either forgotten or manufactured\u201d; and to protect \"potential defendants from protracted fear of litigation\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Default procedures serve to \"keep the dockets current\u201d, \"to expedite the disposal of causes, thereby preventing a dilatory or procrastinating defendant from impeding the plaintiff in the establishment of his claim\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The road commission\u2019s immediate effort to set aside the default fulfills the deterrent purpose of the default mechanism. After a short delay caused by inadvertence,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the case can move toward dispo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>sition. The plaintiffs do not allege that the delay in any way impedes their ability to prove their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In contrast, conditioning the setting aside of the default on waiver of the statute of limitations defense defeats the purposes of the time limitation. The road commission will be required to defend against a \"stale claim\u201d, a claim of which it had no notice until eight years after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">During this period, while the plaintiffs were presumably interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence for trial, the road commission may have passed up similar opportunities because it did not realize it had any exposure. Its ability to cross-examine the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses and to have \"a fair opportunity to defend\u201d may have been impaired.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The order of the trial court is reversed to the extent it precludes the road commission from asserting a defense and the cause is remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b661-7\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Swainson and M. S. Coleman, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\"> <em>See Wilson v Eubanks, </em>36 Mich App 287; 193 NW2d 353 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> \"No modern case has been called to our attention, however, wherein a reviewing court has reversed the ruling of a triad court allowing a plea of the statute of limitations by way of amendment. That defense was formerly in disfavor with the courts. However, it was Justice Story who wrote: 'It has often been matter of regret in modem times, that, in the construction of the statute of limitations, the decisions had not proceeded upon principles better adapted to carry into effect the real objects of the statute; that, instead of being viewed in an unfavorable light, as an unjust and discreditable defense, it had received such support, as would have made it what it was intended to be, emphatically, a statute of repose. It is a wise and beneficial law, not designed merely to raise a presumption of payment of a just debt, from lapse of time, but to afford security against stale demands, after the true state of the transaction may have been forgotten, or be incapable of explanation, by reason of the death or removal of witnesses. It has a manifest tendency to produce speedy settlements of accounts, and to suppress those prejudices which may rise up at a distance of time, and baffle every honest effort to counteract or overcome them.\u2019 <em>Bell v Morrison et al, </em>1 Pet 351, 26 US 351, 360, 7 L Ed 174 [1828].</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\"By the aid of such counsel the defense has gained in favor.

This being judicially determined, the court may impose just and reasonable terms as a condition precedent to the amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In an area where it is contemplated that conditions may be imposed, this establishes an appropriate standard for imposing them. It seems to be the standard used by the Federal courts in testing discretion exercised under Rules 55(c) and 60(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which were the model for our GCR 1963, 520.4. See <em>Bridoux v Eastern Airlines, Inc, </em>93 US App DC 369; 214 F2d 207 (1954). Also see 3 ALR Fed 956 and the cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">This appears to be the standard used by the trial judge here. In his opinion explaining his ruling, after concluding the affidavit of facts was defective, Judge Armstrong said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\"The Board of Road Commissioners goes on to point out that it also wants to raise as meritorious defenses the two year and three year statutes of limitations pertaining to tort actions against the Board of Road Commissioners and to tort actions generally. The Board of Road Commissioners is saying that the Plaintiffs are in default of filing their action against the Board of Road Commissioners within the two year and three year statutes of limitations. The plaintiffs claim that had it not been for the now unconstitutional sixty day limitation for the giving of notice of intent to file suit against the Board of Road Commissioners and the plaintiffs\u2019 ignorance of that requirement, that they would have filed their action against the Board of Road Commissioners before the expiration of the two year limitation statute for such actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\"So now we have a situation where the plaintiffs were in default and where the defendant Board of Road Commissioners is now also in default. Both the plaintiffs and said defendants now are asking the Court to permit them to raise meritorious defenses against each other. If the default of the Board of Road Commissioners is set aside without conditions imposed upon their defense, they will be in the unique position of now being able to raise the prior default of the plaintiffs in failing to file an action within the statutes of limitations and the plaintiffs will no longer have the advantage or the benefit of the defendant Board of Road Commissioners\u2019 present default. In view of the defaults of both parties it would seem that such a result would be neither equitable nor just insofar as plaintiffs are concerned. Any old default through ignorance on the part of the plaintiffs is certainly no greater a default then <em>[sic] </em>the present default of the defendant Board of Road Commissioners, particularly in view of their inadequate affidavit of facts and affidavit of merits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">We do not regard the considerations which moved the majority of us in <em>Fyke, supra, </em>as controlling here. GCR 1963, 118 does not provide for the imposition of conditions. GCR 1963, 520.4 does. This difference is deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Amendment of pleadings is for the most part intended to assure accuracy and completeness in the presentation of the whole controversy on its merits. No good purpose occurs to us to warrant imposing conditions for allowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Default rules are intended to keep a case moving to conclusion and the rule provides for the imposition of costs and other conditions as sanctions to make the rules effective. GCR 1963, 520.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">We think the true intent of GCR 1963, 520.4 and the better practice is to commit the matter to the discretion of the trial judge. Unless a reviewing court can say that the judge abused his discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>by imposing a wholly arbitrary and unreasonable condition, the trial judge\u2019s decision should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In this case the trial judge concluded that since each of the parties in turn had failed to meet an arbitrarily established deadline for pleading neither should be entitled to take advantage of the other\u2019s delinquency, but rather both should try the case on its merits. We cannot say that this is an arbitrary or unreasonable attitude, and accordingly we hold that he did not abuse his discretion in establishing the condition for the setting aside of the defendant\u2019s default.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Affirmed with costs to plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-6\">Williams, J., concurred with T.
