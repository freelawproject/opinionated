The trial court answered affirmatively; the Court of Appeals said no. We agree with the trial court. We therefore reaffirm the definition of forgery we used in <em>In re Stout, </em>371 Mich 438; 124 NW2d 277 (1963), reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">On November 7, 1970, defendant Eugene Martin Susalla purchased a red hunting suit and boots, paying for them with a business check of the M &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>J Uniform Shoppe. Defendant had no connection with the company and, in fact, the Shoppe had been out of business three or four years. The check had no designation by what authority the drawer signed the instrument, but the signature line was immediately below the company name imprinted on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Defendant signed his own name to the check and wrote his driver\u2019s license number on the back. Although he did not affirmatively represent himself as an owner or other officer of the company, defendant, in responding to the store manager\u2019s question, said that business was not bad. The manager also testified he treated the check as if it were an ordinary business check. The check was returned, marked account closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">After a full jury trial commencing September 21,1971, defendant was found guilty of violation of MCLA 750.248; MSA 28.445, forgery,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and MCLA 750.249; MSA 28.446, uttering and publishing a forged instrument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>He received concurrent sentences of 7-14 years on both counts. Motion for new trial was denied. The Court of Appeals reversed unanimously, holding that although this \"resourceful fellow\u201d might be guilty of a whole panoply of crimes, \"one simply can\u2019t 'forge\u2019 his own name\u201d. <em>People v Susalla, </em>46 Mich App 473, 476; 208 NW2d 221 (1973). Since the forgery conviction was overturned, the uttering and publishing conviction also fell. We granted leave on September 27,1973. 390 Mich 779 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">II. <em>In re Stout </em>CONTROLLING.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In our opinion this case is controlled by <em>In re Stout, </em>371 Mich 438; 124 NW2d 277 (1963). Petitioner Stout brought habeas corpus to contest his commitment as incompetent to stand trial for a felony. He had been charged with the felony of forgery and he claimed that his signing his own name as a company representative on the back of a draft without authority to do so was not a forgery and therefore not a felony. These facts are substantially similar to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">This Court in <em>Stout, </em>relying on <em>People v Marion, </em>29 Mich 31, 35 (1874) found forgery includes \"any act which fraudulently makes an instrument 'purport to be what it is not.\u2019 \u201d 371 Mich 438, 441, and that therefore <em>Stout </em>was properly charged with a felony. We reaffirm that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">III. DEFENDANT\u2019S CASES DISTINGUISHED.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Defendant would have us instead rely on the dissent in <em>Stout </em>and on <em>Gilbert v United States, </em>370 US 650; 82 S Ct 1399; 8 L Ed 2d 750 (1962) on which that dissent relied. Justice Harlan, writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>for the 4-3 majority, applied the common law meaning to the Federal statute on the basis there was no legislative interpretation. The common-law interpretation did not include misrepresentation of agency. We believe that the Michigan statute unlike the Federal statute does not require resort to the common law for interpretation and hence prefer to follow <em>Stout </em>and not <em>Gilbert.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Defendant also relies on <em>People v Brown, </em>178 Mich 155; 144 NW 477 (1913). The facts in this case are altogether different. Defendant made out a personal check to himself and signed it, using an Anglican name he commonly went by rather than his own long foreign name. It was accepted by a friend of many years who knew and recognized him and who also knew his right name and that he commonly used the name he employed on the check. There were, of course, no funds in his account at the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">IV. OTHER STATES.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Decisions in our sister states differ.3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore find both these, and <em>Gilbert, </em>inadequate as precedent. Additionally, because we are dealing with a matter involving construction of our own statute, we are not required to find safe passage through such a morass to come up with what our own Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>V. TEXTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Most writers and commentators agree that forgery is \"the false making or material alteration, with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability.\u201d 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 621, p 396.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The hornbook most commonly used in Michigan practice notes that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\"In order to constitute forgery there must be a making of a false instrument for the purpose of creating another\u2019s liability, with fraudulent intent to injure him. Such a forged instrument may be made in various ways, as by creating it entirely, by adding to or taking away from it some of its essential terms, or by procuring the signature of a person who had no intention of signing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">3 Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law &amp; Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 1485, p 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Therefore, it is clear that forgery includes any act which fraudulently makes an instrument appear to be what it is not. Nowhere is there a requirement that a signature is necessary, much less a fictitious one, before we can call something a forgery. For example, Professor Perkins, in his treatise, specifically explains that forgery may be committed, for example, by one using his or her own name, by false dating, or using one\u2019s name as that of another. Perkins, Criminal Law, (2d ed), p 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">VI. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">The key appears to be that the writing itself is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>lie. In the instant case, defendant created a business check by signing his name. The check would not have been negotiable without a signature, therefore, the signing was itself the act which made the false instrument. He had no authority to do so, therefore he acted with fraudulent intent. This is precisely the kind of false making punishable by our forgery statute. Had this been a personal check drawn on a bank in which he had no account, of course, defendant\u2019s signing his own name might have made him suspectible to other charges, but not forgery, because we have other statutes more precisely fitting that offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, there is missing from that offense that misrepresentation of authority which makes the check what it is not. Here, defendant falsely made and uttered a business check without apparent authority. This is more than a mere misrepresentation of agency. It is forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In the presence of a statute defining a criminal offense, we will not look to the common-law meaning, as long as the statute\u2019s intent is clear. The offense of forgery is complete when a person falsely makes any writings enumberated in the statute, with intent to deceive, in a manner which exposes another to loss. This includes the signing of one\u2019s own name to a business check, without authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">No error being found, the conviction is affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The Court of Appeals is reversed and the trial court affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-6\">T.
