The matter was assigned to the Honorable Horace Gilmore, Wayne County Circuit Judge, who ordered defendant committed to the Forensic Center for a competency determination. After evaluation, at a hearing on February 19, 1970, defendant was held competent to stand trial. Defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity in a trial by the court on March 17, 1970. Pursuant to MCLA 767.27b; MSA 28.966(12) defendant was automatically committed for an indeterminate period to the Department of Mental Health by order of Judge Gilmore on March 24, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Defendant was subsequently confined in the Ionia State Hospital and there remained for nearly two years without evaluation or recommendation for release by the Forensic Center, the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>precedent to either his release on convalescent care or complete discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In March 1972, while defendant was yet in custody of the Department of Mental Health, pursuant to Judge Gilmore\u2019s order of commitment, defendant, by the office of State Appellate Defender, filed before Judge Gilmore a pleading entitled \"Delayed Motion to Vacate Commitment Order\u201d. Oral argument was had, the matter was taken under advisement, and on June 27, 1972, Judge Gilmore vacated the order of defendant\u2019s commitment. In the opinion published by the trial court supporting its decision, Judge Gilmore found that the automatic commitment statute (MCLA 767.27b; MSA 28.966[12]) was constitutionally deficient in failing to provide substantially equal treatment in terms of commitment and release procedures to those committed \"criminally\u201d as accorded to those committed \"civilly\u201d. As to due process Judge Gilmore found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\"The commitment is further constitutionally deficient because of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Specht [v Patterson, </em>386 US 605; 87 S Ct 1209; 18 L Ed 2d 326 (1967)] controls here. Due process requires a full hearing on the crucial issue \u2014 was the defendant so mentally ill at that time as to require commitment to a mental institution? No hearing is held on that issue under MCLA 767.27(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Having found the procedure under which defendant was committed lacking in constitutional protections, the trial court sought to fashion a proceeding according such protections to defendant and held a sanity hearing on December 18, 1972. Defendant was adjudicated sane and permanently discharged from custody of the Department of Mental Health on or about December 21,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">From Judge Gilmore\u2019s consideration and grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ing of defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the commitment order and the judge\u2019s subsequent finding of sanity at a special hearing the prosecution appealed. Leave was granted by the Court of Appeals and a stay of proceedings was ordered. Defendant\u2019s application for bypass was granted by this Court on April 27, 1973. 389 Mich 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">This Court is pleased to note that the appellate presentation of the case by prosecution and defense counsel was of high merit and they are to be commended for it. We were also aided in our decision by the comprehensive, well-reasoned opinion by Circuit Judge Gilmore. Finally we are grateful for the helpful brief of the amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">II \u2014JURISDICTION TO REVIEW CONSTITUTIONALITY ON DELAYED ORDER (ISSUE 1)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The prosecution contended the Wayne Circuit Court which automatically committed defendant had no jurisdiction to consider a delayed motion to vacate. They contended the motion questioned the legality of defendant\u2019s commitment and was therefore in reality an. action of habeas corpus, venue for which would be in the county of detention, Ionia.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">There was, and can be, no contention that the Wayne Circuit Court did not have original jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">MCLA 600.601; MSA 27A.601 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\"Circuit courts have the power and jurisdiction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">\"(3) prescribed by rule of the supreme court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The Supreme Court by GCR 1963, 528 provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the circuit court may modify previous judgments or orders pertinently as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">\".3 On motion * * * , the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons: * * * (4) the judgment is void * * * or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In <em>Attorney General v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>341 Mich 461, 472; 67 NW2d 708 (1954) we held that a trial judge has \"inherent power\u201d to consider a delayed motion for a new trial in a case that was heard before him. It was stated that this \"is an inherent judicial function, the exercise of which rests within the sound judicial discretion of a trial judge to so grant when justice requires. This Court has not, and will not, infringe upon this time-honored and necessary judicial prerogative, except for an abuse of judicial discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The policy underlying the judicial power, delineated above, to reform erroneous judgments and/or orders is well stated by the ABA Standards For Criminal Justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\"Little would seem to be served by freezing a decision that later turns out to have been erroneous. Provision that the sentencing court can undo what hindsight has demonstrated to have been a mistake seems the least that is due the victim.\u201d ABA Standards, ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, (Approved Draft, 1968), p 280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">For the reasons set forth above we hold that the Wayne Circuit Court properly assumed jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>commitment statute by which defendant had been committed.<footnotemark>2.5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Ill \u2014PERTINENT FEDERAL DUE PROCESS &amp; EQUAL PROTECTION AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The United States Supreme Court has made it clear that commitment to a mental hospital is deprivation of liberty. Commitment may not be accomplished without proper notice and hearing to determine mental incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The leading case is <em>Baxstrom v Herold, </em>383 US 107; 86 S Ct 760; 15 L Ed 2d 620 (1966). Baxstrom, while serving a sentence in a New York prison, was certified insane by a prison psychiatrist and thereupon transferred to the Dannemora State Hospital, a mental institution under the jurisdiction of the New York Department of Correction. At the expiration of his sentence, a civil commitment was sought pursuant to \u00a7384 of the New York Correction Law, and that commitment was ordered by a surrogate after a sanity hearing. Baxstrom\u2019s custody was moved from the Department of Correction to the Department of Mental Hygiene again. He, however, remained at Dannemora State Hospital upon the administrative decision of the Commission of Mental Hygiene, as allowed by \u00a7 384. He challenged the above procedure by petitioning for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In a unanimous opinion the United States Supreme Court held that Baxstrom was denied equal protection of the laws because, solely on the basis that he was nearing the expiration of his prison term, he was not afforded a jury review of his initial commitment hearing as others civilly committed were afforded and, because once committed, he was transferred from an institution under the control of the Department of Mental Hygiene to an institution under the control of the Department of Correction for the criminally insane without any hearing concerning his present dangerousness, while others who were civilly committed could be similarly transferred only after it has been determined at a judicial hearing that they were dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In the leading case of <em>Specht v Patterson, </em>386 US 605; 87 S Ct 1209; 18 L Ed 2d 326 (1967), the petitioner was convicted in a Colorado state court of a sex offense for which the maximum sentence of ten years could be imposed. The trial judge, acting pursuant to the Colorado sex offenders act, summarily committed Specht. Though psychiatric reports were received the judge granted the petitioner no hearing or right of confrontation with respect to those reports. With no challenge allowed, he determined that Specht constituted a threat of bodily harm to members of the public, or was an habitual offender and mentally ill, and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence of from one day to life. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that the failure to grant full procedural safeguards, including the right of confrontation, violated due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\"Under Colorado\u2019s criminal procedure, here challenged, the invocation of the Sex Offenders Act means the making of a new charge leading to criminal punishment. The case is not unlike those under recidivist statutes where an habitual criminal issue is 'a distinct issue\u2019 * * * on which a defendant 'must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\u2019. * * * Due process, in other words, requires that he be present with counsel, have an opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against him, have the right to cross-examine, and to offer evidence of his own. And there must be findings adequate to make meaningful any appeal that is allowed. * * * None of these procedural safeguards * * * is present under Colorado\u2019s Sex Offenders Act. We therefore hold that it is deficient in due process as measured by the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 386 US 605, 610-611. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We are cognizant of the case cited to us by the prosecutor of <em>People v Dubina, </em>304 Mich 363; 8 NW2d 99 (1943) where this Court upheld the constitutionality of the predecessor automatic commitment statute over a claim of denial of due process. This opinion was prior to the present commitment statute and to the United States Supreme Court opinions in <em>Specbt </em>and <em>Baxstrom. Specht </em>set down certain minimal requirements of due process that were not' required at the time of <em>Dubina. </em>Given the expanded interpretation of Fourteenth Amendment rights in the automatic commitment setting, we feel <em>Dubina </em>is no longer controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">IV \u2014CONSTITUTIONALITY OF TEMPORARY DETENTION (ISSUE 2)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Under MCLA 767.27b; MSA 28.966(12):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\"Any person, who is tried for a crime and is acquitted by the court or jury by reason of insanity, shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>committed immediately by order of the court to the department of mental health for treatment in an appropriate state hospital, * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">It is argued by the people that the language of immediate commitment in the statute should be construed as immediate &gt; temporary detention which does not offend due process or equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In <em>Bolton v Harris, </em>130 US App DC 1; 395 F2d 642 (1968), while holding that persons found not guilty by reason of insanity must be given a judicial hearing with procedures substantially similar to those in civil commitment proceedings, the Court, per Chief Judge Bazelon, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\"[CJommitment without a hearing is permissible for the period required to determine present mental condition. The jury\u2019s finding of a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense provides sufficient warrant for further examination.\u201d 130 US App DC 1, 10; 395 F2d 642, 651.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-8\"><em>Bolton </em>was cited with approval as a legitimate extension of the <em>Baxstrom </em>principles in <em>Jackson v Indiana, </em>406 US 715, 724; 92 S Ct 1845; 32 L Ed 2d 435 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">See supporting authority in <em>People v Lally, </em>19 NY2d 27; 224 NE2d 87 (1966); <em>State v Clemons, </em>110 Ariz 79; 515 P2d 324 (1973); <em>In re Franklin, 7 </em>Cal 3d 126; 101 Cal Rptr 553; 496 P2d 465 (1972); 56 Nw UL Rev 409, 443-445, 458 (1961); 11 Wm &amp; Mary L Rev 185, 197-198 (1966).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">\"This conclusion [that temporary criminal detention does not afford equal protection of the laws], however, does not mean that the state must necessarily afford acquitted defendants procedures identical with those afforded civil defendants. In order to protect society, some divergence is justified. To the extent that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>acquitted by reason of insanity have more clearly than others demonstrated the likelihood of present dangerousness, different treatment is warranted. Even assuming that both classes deserve an equal degree of protection, there remains the possibility that the state may vary the precise procedural formats to foster administrative convenience so long as the end result is substantial equivalence.\u201d 116 U Pa L Rev 924, 940 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">We agree that past criminal conduct caused by insanity justifies temporary detention for examination. It does not justify permanent detention. We believe that neither due process nor equal protection prohibit those acquitted by reason of insanity from being temporarily detained for a reasonable period for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">While those civilly committed must be given a hearing prior to any commitment there exists significant relevant differences between those civilly and criminally committed. The fact that the judge or jury found a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense and the possibility existed that defendant still may be unstable and commit another offense provides sufficient reason for holding for further examination. Defendant in fact concedes this point in his brief. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\"The trial court\u2019s verdict in this case implied a doubt as to sanity in the not-too-distant past. This doubt, when coupled with any inference of dangerousness Defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct will support, may be a constitutionally sufficient justification for temporary incarceration until there has been a reasonable time to determine whether the defendant continues to be mentally ill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Further, \"a hearing would be meaningless until trained medical experts had a reasonable opportunity to observe and examine the subject and report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>their findings. Hence some time gap between the verdict and the appraisal of the defendant\u2019s then-existing mental condition is unavoidable under any scheme which would provide adequate safeguards.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v Overholser, </em>108 US App DC 308, 313; 281 F2d 943, 948 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We believe this to be a judicious weighing of the public\u2019s right to be protected from possibly dangerous mentally ill persons against the individual defendant\u2019s right to be protected against unjustified commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Therefore, we believe the statute legitimately calls for automatic temporary detention for a period of time to examine and determine defendant\u2019s present mental condition. A reasonable period for such examination detention may be 60 days. The <em>Bolton </em>Court did not choose to set a definite time limit for temporary commitment. They stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">\"The length of time required for such examination will vary, of course, with the individual case. It will be the responsibility of the court to establish this period, * * * .\u201d 130 US App DC 1, 10; 395 F2d 642, 651.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Section 1026a of the California Penal Code requires a minimum 90-day period of confinement prior to hearing. The California Supreme Court in <em>In re Franklin, </em>7 Cal 3d 126; 101 Cal Rptr 553; 496 P2d 465 (1972) held that this 90-day period did not offend due process as it was well within the 6-month period as recommended by \u00a7 4.08 of the Model Penal Code. The code commentators believed that this period was necessary for initial observation. 496 P2d 465, 469. See also <em>The Confinement &amp; Release of Persons Acquitted by Reason of Insanity, </em>4 Harv J Legis 55, 56-66 (1966) and <em>The Virginia Procedure for Commitment &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>Release of Persons Acquitted by Reason of Insanity, </em>11 Wm &amp; Mary L Rev 185, 197-198 (1969) where two commentators have concurred that a 90-day period of observation is appropriate in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">In a recorded survey of hospital superintendents asked for their own \"recommended period of observation and examination necessary for accurate diagnosis\u201d, the responses ranged from \"many, many hours\u201d to \"1 year\u201d while 4 of the 11 doctors surveyed preferred a period within the 30-day (or 1 month or 4 week) range. See 56 Nw UL Rev 409, 466, Table c.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We choose to follow a middle ground of allowing 60 days for examination and observation. However, upon completion of the examination and observation notice and hearing must follow forthwith. We find this to be a legitimate balance between an individual\u2019s liberty, protection of society and adequate time for the psychiatrist to form an accurate diagnosis. This 60-day standard is one we adopt on a temporary basis until the Legislature speaks to the problem or the matter is briefed and argued before this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">V \u2014CONTINUED DETENTION WITHOUT NOTICE &amp; HEARING (ISSUE 3)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">After the conclusion of examination and observation must the defendant have notice and hearing as to his present mental condition? At present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the automatic commitment statute does not provide for such a hearing in so many words.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">It was held by Judge Gilmore that such commitment procedures violated both due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment unless construed to provide a hearing of the question of present mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>A. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">It is claimed by defendant that the statute violates due process in that no hearing was held to determine defendant\u2019s present mental condition and need to be institutionalized when found not guilty by reason of insanity. It is argued that the fact that there was reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity when he committed the act could not be viewed as conclusive that he was still not mentally competent at the time he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The prosecution has argued among other things that the statute does not foreclose a hearing but merely allows commitment for a brief period in which to determine defendant\u2019s present mental condition. The prosecution has also cited three cases from foreign jurisdictions for our consideration, <em>State ex rel Schopf v Schubert, </em>45 Wis 2d 644; 173 NW2d 673, 677 (1970); <em>Daniels v O\u2019Connor, </em>243 So 2d 144 (Fla, 1971) and <em>Chase v Kearns, </em>278 A2d 132 (Me, 1971). These three cases generally stand for the proposition that automatic commitment is valid for temporary detention and are distinguished from <em>Baxstrom </em>as cases involving a reasonable classification. With this we agree. These cases also recognize, in one degree or another, that upon commitment the committee is entitled to adjudication of his present sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Due process analysis focuses on the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>which rights and protections are essential to constitutional procedure in a given situation. One long-established basic guarantee of due process is the right to a hearing prior to deprivation of liberty. <em>Boddie v Connecticut, </em>401 US 371; 91 S Ct 780; 28 L Ed 2d 113 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">As Judge Gilmore correctly pointed out, in Michigan \"[a]ll that an acquittal by reason of insanity establishes in law is that the People have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was competent at the time he committed the crime which might have been months before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Thus, the use of a presumption of continuing insanity arising from a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is not justified where there never has been a finding of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In <em>Specht </em>there was a reasonable statutory presumption that a person convicted of indecent liberties constituted (in the words of the Colorado statute) \"a threat of bodily harm to members of the public * * * \u201d. Nevertheless the United States Supreme Court required a full hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Similarly in <em>Bolton v Harris, </em>130 US App DC 1; 395 F2d 642 (1968), the Court of Appeals found that the automatic commitment statute for the District of Columbia was constitutionally deficient. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\"Subsection (d) [of the D.C. statute] provides for automatic commitment without any hearing, even though acquittal by reason of insanity reflects only a reasonable doubt that the defendant was sane at the time of the offense. * * * [T]he defense may be based merely upon 'some\u2019 evidence, said to be 'more than a scintilla\u2019 but not necessarily enough to raise a reasonable doubt of sanity. The plea is neither an express nor implied admission of present illness, and acquittal rests only on a reasonable doubt of <em>past </em>sanity, <em>i.e., </em>at the time of the offense. * * * After acquittal by reason of insanity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>there is * * * need for a new finding of fact: The trial determined only that there was a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s sanity in the past, present commitment is predicated on a finding of present insanity. Thus <em>Specht </em>would appear to require that this finding be made in a hearing.\u201d 130 US App DC 1; 395 F2d 642, 648-650.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">To quote from Judge Gilmore\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\"><em>\"Specht </em>summarizes fundamental due process requirements. No person can be confined or committed without a full judicial hearing in which the legal basis for this commitment <em>at the time of the commitment </em>is established under settled rules of law with full procedural due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">This principle of <em>Specht </em>was affirmed in <em>Jackson v Indiana, </em>406 US 715, 737-738; 92 S Ct 1845; 32 L Ed 2d 435 (1972). In <em>Jackson, </em>it was determined that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial and was summarily committed until he regained his sanity. Finding this procedure to violate due process of laws, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\"It is clear that Jackson\u2019s commitment rests on proceedings that did not purport to bring into play, indeed did not even consider relevant, <em>any </em>of the articulated bases for exercise of Indiana\u2019s power of indefinite commitment. The state statutes contain at least two alternative methods for invoking this power. <em>But Jackson was not afforded any formal commitment proceedings addressed to [his] ability to function in society,\u2019 or to society\u2019s interest in his restraint, </em>or to the State\u2019s ability to aid him in attaining competency through custodial care or compulsory treatment, the ostensible purpose of the commitment. At the least, due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Based on <em>Specht, Jackson </em>and <em>Bolton </em>we hold that due process requires a sanity hearing for those found not guilty by reason of insanity after the completion of examination and observation.

Do these differences justify commitment without notice and hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In <em>Baxstrom, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\"Equal protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but it does require that a distinction made have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made. * * * <em>Classification of mentally ill persons as either insane or dangerously insane of course may be a reasonable distinction for purposes of determining the type of custodial or medical care to be given, but it has no relevance whatever in the context of the opportunity to show whether a person is mentally ill at all. </em>For purposes of granting judicial review before a jury of the question whether a person is mentally ill and in need of institutionalization, there is no conceivable basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is nearing the end of a penal term from all other civil commitments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\"It may or may not be that Baxstrom is presently mentally ill and such a danger to others that the strict security of a Department of Correction hospital is warranted. All others receive a judicial hearing on this issue. Equal protection demands that Baxstrom receive the same.\u201d 383 US 107, 111-112, 114-115. (Citation omitted.)

Finding the commitment statute violative of equal protection, the Court reasoned that prior criminal conduct could not be a sufficient reason for denying a hearing on the question of present mental condition. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\"[T]he commission of criminal acts does not give rise to a presumption of dangerousness which, standing alone, justifies substantial difference in commitment procedures and confinement conditions for the mentally -ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\"We think the principles of <em>Baxstrom </em>also apply where, as here, the defendant is acquitted upon his own plea of insanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\"[P]rior criminal conduct cannot be deemed a sufficient justification for substantial differences in the procedures and requirements for commitment, and habeas corpus may no longer be deemed to afford adequate protection against unwarranted detention.\u201d 130 US App DC 1, 6, 8; 395 F2d 642, 647, 649.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Equal protection demands that differences in treatment of classes be based on a rational basis. The lack of a hearing cannot be justified by the contention that the defendant because of his acquittal by reason of insanity is so potentially dangerous at that time that he must be committed without further hearing. <em>Baxstrom </em>held that past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>criminal actions could not serve as a rationale basis of classification for purposes of determining commitment procedure. Those committed civilly in the State of Michigan receive a determination of mental illness which attains far more certainty than any inference of insanity. Where the state has provided a full range of judicial protection to determine the competency of all civilly committed, it may not deny those rights to a person found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Thus, based on equal protection of the laws, we hold that defendant is entitled to a sanity hearing when found not guilty by reason of insanity after completion of observation and examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\n<em>C Interpretation of the Automatic Commitment Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">We have held that unless those found not guilty by reason of insanity are given sanity hearings to ascertain their present mental condition, then their due process and equal protection rights have been violated. It was also the ruling of the trial court that the statute was defective on both grounds unless construed to provide for such a hearing. Is MCLA 767.27b unconstitutional in that it does not specifically provide for such a hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Returning to the language of the statute, any person found not guilty by reason of insanity must \"be committed immediately\u201d. The construction placed on this language by the trial judge that there is no provision for a hearing is a reasonable one. However, it is the duty of the Court to give the presumption of constitutionality to a statute and construe it as constitutional unless the contrary clearly appears. See <em>Cady v Detroit, </em>289 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Mich 499, 505; 286 NW 805 (1939); <em>Sullivan v Michigan State Board of Dentistry, </em>268 Mich 427, 429-430; 256 NW 471 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Due process and equal protection require a hearing. We find nothing in MCLA 767.27b which precludes a hearing and since <em>Baxstrom </em>and <em>Specht </em>require one, we deem it necessarily implicit in our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">While due process requires that defendant be given a sanity hearing to determine present mental condition and equal protection requires that the hearing be substantially similar to other commitment proceedings, we believe that neither due process nor equal protection prohibit those acquitted by reason of insanity from being temporarily detained for a reasonable period for examination. As noted in both <em>Baxstrom </em>and <em>Bolton </em>exact equality of procedures is not necessary, but rather as stated in <em>Bolton </em>the procedures need only be substantially similar with different treatment permissible to the extent that there are relevant differences between these two groups. Therefore we hold that after examination and observation within the initial 60-day period of temporary detention the defendant is entitled to a full hearing identical with the usual civil commitment hearing provided by MCLA 330.21; MSA 14.811.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>VI \u2014RELEASE PROCEDURES UNDER MCLA 767.27b (ISSUE 4)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">If the result of the sanity hearing is such that defendant is not found insane, naturally he is released. However, if defendant is rightfully committed after such a hearing, the question becomes whether the release provisions available to him under MCLA 767.27b; MSA 28.966(12) are constitutionally adequate. The statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\"Any person, who * * * is acquitted * * * by reason of insanity, shall be committed immediately * * * , until discharged in accordance with Act No. 151 of the Public Acts of 1923, as amended. The person shall not be released on convalescent care or final discharge without first being evaluated and recommended for release by the center for forensic psychiatry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As regards release provisions, Judge Gilmore held that, \"[t]he procedures for release of a person committed under MCLA 767.27b must be the same as those committed through normal civil commitment procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>A. Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">While <em>Baxstrom </em>held that the state cannot withhold from a few the procedural protections or the substantive requirements for <em>commitment </em>that are available to all others, it did not concern itself with <em>release </em>provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">In <em>Jackson v Indiana, supra, </em>defendant was committed to a mental institution due to his incompetency to stand trial until he be deemed sane. There was no statutory provision for periodic review of the defendant\u2019s condition by either the court or mental health authorities. Thus, as there was no evidence that Jackson would ever be sane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>enough to stand trial, his commitment was permanent in practical effect. The United States Supreme Court found critical disparities in release provisions in two civil commitment statutes, under any of which Jackson could possibly have been committed. They stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\"More important, an individual committed as feeble-minded is eligible for release when his condition 'justifies it,\u2019 \u00a7 22-1814, and an individual civilly committed as mentally ill when the 'superintendent or administrator shall discharge such person <em>or </em>[when] cured of such illness.\u2019 \u00a722-1223 (emphasis supplied). Thus, in either case release is appropriate when the individual no longer requires the custodial care or treatment or detention which occasioned the commitment, or when the department of mental health believes release would be in his best interests. The evidence available concerning Jackson\u2019s past employment and home care strongly suggests that under these standards he might be eligible for release at almost any time, even if he did not improve. On the other hand, by the terms of his present \u00a7 9-1706a commitment, he will not be entitled to release at all absent an unlikely substantial change for the better in his condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\"As we noted above, we cannot conclude that pending criminal charges provide a greater justification for different treatment than conviction and sentence. Consequently, we hold that by subjecting Jackson to a more lenient commitment standard and to a more stringent standard of release than those generally applicable to all others not charged with offenses, and by thus condemning him in effect to permanent institutionalization without the showing required for commitment or the opportunity for release afforded by \u00a7 22-1209 or \u00a7 22-1907, Indiana deprived petitioner of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 406 US 715, 728-730.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">See also <em>Bolton, supra, </em>where the Court while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>upholding the release provisions in the mandatory commitment statute read into these provisions the civil release provisions, particularly the requirement of periodic examination of the person and a right to a court hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Do the release provisions of MCLA 767.27b deny equal protection of the laws?</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\n<em>B.

In the instant case, however, we hold that the quoted language from MCLA 330.35 offends equal protection of the laws as it would prohibit those criminally committed from using the civil release provisions without a rational basis for the difference in release provisions. The fact that habeas corpus still exists as a possible method of release does not in itself mean that the release procedures are constitutionally adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In Thomas Cooley\u2019s \"Constitutional Limitations\u201d it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\"It will sometimes be found that an act of the legislature is opposed in some of its provisions to the constitution, while others, standing by themselves, would be unobjectionable. * * * A statute may contain some such provisions, and yet the same act, having received the sanction of all branches of the legislature, and being in the form of law, may contain other useful and salutary provisions, not obnoxious to any just constitutional exception. It would be inconsistent with all just principles of constitutional law to adjudge these enactments void, because they are associated in the same act, but not connected with or dependent on others which are unconstitutional. Where, therefore, a part of a statute is unconstitutional, that fact does not authorize the courts to declare the remainder void also, unless all the provisions are connected in subject-matter, depending on each other, operating together for the same purpose, or otherwise so connected together in meaning, that it cannot be presumed the legislature would have passed the one without the other. The constitutional and unconstitutional provisions may even be contained in the same section, and yet be perfectly distinct and separable, so that the first may stand though the last fall. The point is not whether they are contained in the same section; for the distribution into sections is purely artificial; but whether they are essentially and inseparably connected in substance. If, when the unconstitutional portion is stricken out, that which remains is complete in itself, and capable of being executed wholly indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>dent of that which was rejected, it must be sustained.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) pp 177,178.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">See also <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 415; 185 NW2d 9 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The release provisions are separate and distinct from the sentence which precludes their application to those committed by a court of criminal jurisdiction. The striking of the constitutionally repugnant sentence leaves the remainder of the statute completely independent and capable of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In <em>Bolton, supra, </em>the Court upheld the mandatory commitment statute release provisions which provided for release of the patient upon the hospital superintendent\u2019s discretionary decision; however, civil commitment procedural safeguards requiring periodic examination of the patient and a right to a court hearing if one of the examining physicians believed the patient should no longer be hospitalized were read into the statute under the equal protection doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">We believe that <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Bolton </em>require a similar result here.

We can find no statutory authorization for a circuit judge to conduct a civil commitment hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only civil process for commitment provided by statute is a probate court civil commitment hearing. As to these matters, the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction is original and exclusive.

There was no contention that at the hearing conducted by Judge Gilmore the prosecution was not given an adequate opportunity to present its position or that the conclusion of the judge as to defendant\u2019s sanity was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Technically, the status of this case is that the defendant after being found not guilty by reason of insanity has been unconstitutionally committed and thereafter invalidly found ineligible for commitment. The defendant is therefore all things being equal eligible for discharge. The proper parties, however, may at any time upon a proper showing move to commit the defendant. While we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>perceive no special reason why the prosecutor should do so, in remanding this matter to the trial court, we will withhold cancelling the bond for 20 days within which time the prosecutor or any other proper party may, if it is thought appropriate, take commitment action in the probate court. If proceedings are not begun within this period, or if the prosecutor indicates he will not initiate such action, then the bond will be discharged and the orders of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">If the prosecutor undertakes to bring commitment action, such action shall in addition to the statutory procedures contain the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">(1) notice to the potential committee by serving him the petition or a copy thereof sufficiently in advance of the hearing;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">(2) advising the potential committee at the outset of the proceedings that he has the right to legal counsel and, if indigent, to appointed counsel, to assist him at the proceedings;</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">(3) presence of the potential committee at the hearing unless his conduct is so disruptive that the proceeding cannot continue in any reasonable manner and only after some alternative to total exclusion is first attempted;</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">(4) notification to the potential committee of his right to demand a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">VII \u2014CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">We hold that neither due process nor equal protection prohibit a period of temporary statutory detention for examination and observation of one found not guilty by reason of insanity. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>upon completion of the examination and observation, due process and equal protection require that a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity must have the benefit of commitment and release provisions equal to those available to those civilly committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The ruling as to such automatic commitment procedures is to have prospective effect only. Ex: cept that any already similarly detained for more than 60 days without examination and observation shall be given examination and observation within the 60 days from the date of this opinion and thereupon noticed for hearing' within the next 10 days or discharged. The ruling as to release procedures applies immediately to all those automatically committed under MCLA 767.27b.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">As to the instant case, the prosecution has 20 days from the issuance of this opinion to commence commitment proceedings in probate court if it so desires.

The circuit court is also authorized to consider the diagnostic reports and recommendations and may order the defendant committed to the Department of Mental Health for an 18-month period if it finds the person incompetent to stand trial. If during or after this 18-month period, the Department of Mental Health believes that defendant cannot recover competence to stand trial, the matter is then taken over by the <em>probate court </em>to conduct a civil commitment hearing. Even this statute does not give the circuit judge authority to conduct a civil commitment hearing under the procedures of MCLA 330.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">As to the constitutionality of commitment statutes for incompetency to stand trial see <em>Jackson v Indiana, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> See the required procedures in <em>Bell v Wayne County General Hospital, </em>384 F Supp 1085 (ED Mich, 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\"> Such procedure would comply with due process specified in <em>Bell v Wayne County General Hospital, </em>384 F Supp 1085 (ED Mich, 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b631-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADz\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Absent a showing that judicial intervention is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm to the complainant, a sentencing court may not properly issue a directive concerning procedures to be followed by a state agency located in another county, physical custody of the complainant having been lawfully transferred to the state agency by the sentencing court, the state agency not being a party to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">McQuillan contends that his acquittal by reason of insanity effectively removed him from the strictures of the criminal justice system and that as a free man he may only be committed to the Department of Mental Health upon compliance with the procedures applicable in civil commitments. He contends that when, without a hearing, he was \"automatically\u201d committed to the Department of Mental Health, following his acquittal by reason of insanity, he was unlawfully deprived of his liberty because r</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">(1) he could not constitutionally be detained and transferred to the Department of Mental Health without a prior hearing and determination of present insanity;</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">(2) the statutory procedures for determining his post-commitment sanity and securing his release from custody are constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The Court rejects McQuillan\u2019s principal argument, holding that a person acquitted of a criminal charge on the ground of insanity may be automatically detained for a reasonable period of time \u2014 60 days \u2014 without a hearing on the issue of his sanity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The Court accepts the essence of McQuillan\u2019s second argument holding that his detention and transfer (\"commitment\u201d) to the Department of Mental Health was tainted by the constitutional inadequacy of the statutorily prescribed procedures for determining post-commitment sanity. The Court then promulgates in constitutional terms requirements for. an initial hearing (within 60 days of \"temporary detention\u201d) and for subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>quent hearings to redetermine sanity if the initial one results in \"permanent\u201d commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Consideration of this case should have ended once it was decided that the sentencing court properly transferred physical custody of McQuillan to the Department of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The jurisdiction of the sentencing court was invoked on the theory that its order \"committing\u201d or \"temporarily detaining\u201d McQuillan was invalid because of deficiencies in the procedures for determining post-conviction sanity. The jurisdiction of the sentencing court to hear this case is sustained by analogizing the relief sought here to the relief sought when a convicted person files a delayed motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Had this Court concluded that McQuillan should have been immediately released upon acquittal and, therefore, the order detaining him was altogether void, there might be force to the analogy. But this Court does not hold that McQuillan was entitled to be immediately discharged upon acquittal by reason of insanity. This Court holds, rather, that the original order detaining McQuillan was valid to the extent it provided the authorities an opportunity \"to examine and determine [his] present mental condition\u201d. Approval of a 60-day period of \"automatic temporary detention\u201d means that McQuillan\u2019s right to a sanity hearing did not mature until this period was completed and, thus, until long after he had been transferred from Wayne to Ionia authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The Court\u2019s analysis would permit a prisoner incarcerated at Jackson or Marquette to file a motion for \"relief from judgment\u201d in whichever of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Michigan\u2019s 83 counties he was convicted on the theory that the sentencing court was without authority to sentence him to serve a term of imprisonment, and the sentence was therefore invalid, because rules or practices of the correctional authorities deny him constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">A sentencing judge confronted with a showing that conditions at a state institution located in another county represent an immediate threat of irreparable harm to a convicted person might be constrained to enter a protective order. Such action would be appropriate only if the court in the other county could not be relied on to act expeditiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">There is no suggestion that the Ionia Circuit Court could not or would not act expeditiously. McQuillan waited two years before filing his pleading entitled \"Delayed Motion to Vacate Commitment Order\u201d in the Wayne Circuit Court. No reason is advanced why McQuillan failed to seek relief in the Ionia Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The question whether McQuillan was entitled to a sanity hearing within 60 days after acquittal was moot 22 months before he filed his delayed motion to vacate commitment order. McQuillan cannot avail himself of the procedures spelled out by the majority. I would not address these issues until they are presented in an adversary context by a person aggrieved, at the time he files his pleadings, by the asserted procedural deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Whatever constitutional deficiencies there may be in the statutory commitment and release procedures, McQuillan is entitled to no relief until he seeks and is denied a sanity hearing. At no time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>did he seek such a hearing in the Ionia Circuit Court before instituting this proceeding in the Wayne Circuit Court. If the Wayne Circuit Court had simply transferred venue to the Ionia Circuit Court for the purpose of determining the legality of McQuillan\u2019s continued detention, I would join in affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Besides the Wayne Circuit Court\u2019s lack of authority to decide and McQuillan\u2019s lack of standing to litigate the post-commitment issues decided, the Legislature has obviated all need to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The new Mental Health Code provides persons acquitted by reason of insanity the declaratory relief granted by the majority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Court unnecessarily extends constitutional doctrine to reach the very results embodied in an Act of the Legislature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Mr. Justice Harlan stated in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\"The political process now having taken hold again in this very field, I am at a loss to understand why the Court should have deemed it appropriate or, in the circumstances of this case, necessary to proceed with such precipitate and insecure strides.\u201d <em>Jones v Alfred H Mayer Co, </em>392 US 409; 88 S Ct 2186; 20 L Ed 2d 1189, 1213, 1229 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We would reverse the trial court and grant appellant\u2019s motion that venue be transferred to the Ionia Circuit Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-6\">T.

However, it also affirms the trial court\u2019s simultaneous commitment of McQuillan to \"temporary custody\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> 1974 PA 258, approved August 6,1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> Even though the civil commitment statute requires a precommitment hearing on the issue of present sanity, the majority hold that \"there exists significant relevant differences between those civilly and criminally committed\u201d <em>(similarly, see Bolton v Harris, </em>130 US App DC 1; 395 F2d 642 [1968]), justifying \"automatic temporary detention\u201d without a hearing on present sanity of a person acquitted by reason of insanity. Yet the Court holds that a legislature may not permissibly differentiate between commitment and release procedures for persons whose illness is in no way related to criminal activity and the procedures to be followed for persons whose illness a trier of fact has found causally related with the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">Automatic temporary detention is upheld by the Court only after \"a judicious weighing of the public\u2019s right to be protected from possibly mentally ill persons against the individual defendant\u2019s right to be protected against unjustified commitment\u201d. Yet, without even presentation of the competing policy considerations, the Court, on constitutional grounds, insists that all other procedures affecting persons civilly and criminally committed must be \"equal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Nor is the Court content to limit its insistence on equality to those procedures presently existing. In anticipation of legislative revision of the civil commitment scheme in response to <em>Bell v Wayne County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>General Hospital, </em>384 F Supp 1085 (ED Mich, 1974), the Court holds that equal protection requires that these as of yet unknown amendments to the civil commitment procedures be necessarily made available to those found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Requiring the Legislature to treat the civilly committed and those committed following acquittal by reason of insanity identically may impede legislative reform of civil commitment procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
