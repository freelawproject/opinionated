Robinson asked her friend, Randall Hayes, to drive her to Wallace\u2019s apartment. According to Lee Griffin\u2014a friend of Hayes and Robinson\u2014Hayes was hesitant to drive Robinson to Wallace\u2019s apartment because Robinson was angry. Griffin testified that, after Robinson calmed down, Hayes drove both Robinson and Griffin to Wallace\u2019s apartment. When they arrived at Wallace\u2019s apartment, Griffin and Hayes remained in Hayes\u2019s car while Robinson walked to Wallace\u2019s apartment. Griffin and Hayes testified that, because Robinson had walked around a building to reach Wallace\u2019s apartment, they could not see either Wallace or Robinson; they could, however, hear them arguing. Hayes testified that, after he heard Wallace and Robinson arguing, he moved his car so that he could see Robinson. Hayes explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cThat\u2019s when [Robinson] was, like frantic at the time, running around, you know, saying, like, get her something. Get her something. I don\u2019t know what happened between the time of her getting out of my car and going to [Wallace\u2019s] apartment. I don\u2019t know what happened that made her so upset, but by that time she was just frantic, running around looking for something. I don\u2019t know what she was trying to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">(R. 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Griffin explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">\u201cWell, [Robinson and Wallace] were arguing back and forth. So from that point when we seen [Robinson, she]\u2019s like standing in the parking lot. [Hayes] was yelling out the window, like, telling [Robinson] to come on. Because, like, you know, [Robinson and Wallace were] arguing back and forth. That\u2019s the original reason why [Hayes] didn\u2019t want to take [Robinson] from the beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-12\">\u201cBut, like she\u2014what she said to [Wallace]\u2014she said to him, like, you know, profanity, but she was saying, like, she wasn\u2019t going to use it. And when she said that, that\u2019s when the initial shot went off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAKl\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-13\">\u201cSo after that point, [Robinson] ducked. She stood back up and she\u2019s like, you going to shoot me? She said, you know, fing n* * * * * you going to shoot me, and [Wallace] was running towards the car, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAKpp\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-14\">\u201cSo [Wallace] came around the car, [Robinson] turned around to him and that\u2019s when he was, like, close up on her face and he shot her in the face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">(R. 41-43.) Griffin testified that, after he witnessed Wallace shoot Robinson in the face, he heard approximately three more gunshots. Hayes testified that, after Wallace first shot Robinson, \u201che stood over her and he shot her again ... maybe like, 2 or 3 more times.\u201d (R. 71.) Both Griffin and Hayes testified that they did not see Robinson with a weapon that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">Officer Chris Coleman, an evidence technician with the Birmingham Police Department, testified that, at the scene of the shooting, he observed a pool of blood, a hat with what appeared to be blood on it, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>live rounds, and three shell casings. Officer Coleman testified, however, that no weapons were recovered from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Officer Mitch Rector, a firearm and tool-marks examiner with the Birmingham Police Department, testified that he received two live \u201c.45 auto caliber\u201d cartridges and three feed \u201c.45 auto caliber\u201d cartridge casings that were collected from the scene of the shooting. Officer Rector testified that \u201cthe [three] fired cartridge cases ... had all been fired from the same firearm\u201d and that the live rounds and the cartridge cases \u201call had a similar marking that indicated they were made by the same manufacturer.\u201d (R. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Detective Talana Brown with the Birmingham Police Department testified that she never received any information indicating that Robinson was in possession of a gun or any other type of weapon that evening and that, as a result of her investigation, she concluded that Wallace was not justified in using deadly force to defend himself against Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Dr. Gary Simmons, a medical examiner with the Jefferson County Coroner\u2019s Office, testified that he performed an autopsy on Robinson on November 25, 2012. Dr. Simmons testified that Robinson suffered five gunshot wounds\u2014three to her extremities, one to the left side of her jaw, and one that entered the left side of her back and exited the right side of her chest. Dr. Simmons testified that he collected a small projectile from a wound in Robinson\u2019s arm and another projectile from her jaw. Dr. Simmons testified that Robinson was shot from a distance of, at most, three feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">After the State rested its case, Wallace testified in his own behalf. According to Wallace, on the afternoon of November 24, 2012, he received the following series of threatening text messages from Robinson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u2022 At 4:00 P.M.: \u201cB* * * *, you so dirty, ho. You can get this phone ho and give me my money back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u2022 At 4:01 P.M.: \u201cThat\u2019s f* * * * * up, b* * * *t i \u215e\u215b\u215b did s* * * to you, ho. You going to do me like that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u2022 At 4:03 P.M.: \u201cJust give me my money back. If you do not, you ain\u2019t going to like me, or you\u2019re going to hate me, b* * * *. I am telling you the wrong b* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u2022 At 4:04 P.M.: \u201cB* * * b* * * *, Jq'H \u215c \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-13\">\u2022 At 4:05 P.M.: \u201cB* * * *, I\u2019m going to kill [you], ho, on my kids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">(R. 337-41; C. 336-40.) Wallace testified that, after she sent him the text messages, Robinson telephoned him and that, when he did not answer, she left him a threatening voicemail. Wallace testified that, after he listened to Robinson\u2019s voicemail, he was \u201cterrified\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cstayed in the house.\u201d (R. 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">Wallace testified that, later that evening, Robinson arrived at his apartment and began banging on his door. Wallace testified that, when he opened the door, Robinson \u201cwas still yelling and in a terrible rage.\u201d (R. 346.) Wallace testified that he gave Robinson $70 and that she threw her phone on the sidewalk. Wallace testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdWJ\">\u201c[Wallace]: [Robinson] stayed in a rage. Just kept fussing. I\u2019m like to myself, I gave you the money to get you another phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-16\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: Did you ever say that to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-17\">\u201c[Wallace]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzI\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-18\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: What were you doing while she was in the rage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-19\">\u201c[Wallace]: I was just\u2014I was just\u2014I was just shocked, you know what I\u2019m saying? To be honest, I just couldn\u2019t believe this is what\u2014you know what I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>saying, she stayed in a rage and the person give you some money to get from your house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: And were you telling her to get\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAhN9\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201c[Wallace]: I\u2019m telling her to get on. So I shot a warning shot, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: When you say you shot a warning shot, what do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201c[Wallace]: I shot a warning shot behind my back, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: When you shot that warning shot, where were you aiming the pistol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201c[Wallace]: Up in the air, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAdd\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: And when you shot in the air, did she take off running?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201c[Wallace]: I shot and she said\u2014she said\u2014exactly these are the words she said: \u2018That ain\u2019t scare me, b* * * *,\u2019 and she just took out, out of sight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: Okay. All right. Now at that point\u2014so you couldn\u2019t see her anymore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">\u201c[Wallace]: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: All right. Could you hear anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-17\">\u201c[Wallace]: Yes, I still heard her voice in a rage still, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-18\">\u201c[Wallace\u2019s counsel]: What was she doing\u2014or what could you hear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-19\">\u201c[Wallace]: The most words I really understood is just b* * * * * * and ho\u2019s pretty much. You know, \u2018I\u2019m going to get you, n* * * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-20\">(R. 347-50.) Wallace testified that he \u201cstalled for a minute to see if she was out of sight\u201d and that he began \u201c[w]alking to see if she [was] gone.\u201d (R. 352.) Wallace testified that, as he walked toward the parking lot, he observed Robinson, who had been hiding behind a car, \u201ccoming up with a pistol\u201d and saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, b* * * (R. 353-54.) Wallace testified that he was surprised and terrified and that he was unable to run away from Robinson. Wallace testified that, based on the threats Robinson had made to him earlier that day, he believed his life was in danger, and, therefore, he asserted, he shot Robinson in self-defense. When asked why he shot Robinson so many times, Wallace stated, \u201c[B]ecause the kind of gun I had is a .45 with no safety on it.\u201d (R. 356.) Wallace testified that, after he shot Robinson, he and his son fled his apartment because Wallace was concerned for their safety. Wallace testified that he turned himself in to police the next day. Wallace confirmed that he is a felon and that he knew he was not permitted to possess a firearm. Wallace testified that he lived in a bad neighborhood and that he kept a gun in his home to protect himself and his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-23\">Frank Slapikas also testified in Wallace\u2019s behalf, explaining that Wallace had hired him as a private investigator. Slapi-kas explained that, on March 4, 2014, he interviewed Hayes about the shooting and Hayes stated that, during that incident, Robinson said to Hayes, \u201cGive me something, I\u2019m fixing to kill this b* <em>* </em>* *. He don\u2019t want to give me my money,\u201d and that, after saying so, Robinson picked up a brick. (R. 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-24\">After the defense rested, the trial court conducted a jury-charge conference. During that conference, the parties discussed the State\u2019s instruction regarding the law of self-defense\u2014specifically, the instruction that, \u201c[t]o sustain a claim of self-defense, it is necessary that the following conditions be established: (1) that the accused was in actual or apparent peril; (2) that the accused was unable to retreat; and (3) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the accused was free from fault in bringing on the difficulty.\u201d (C. 184.) The trial court, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kidd v. State, </em>105 So.3d 1261 (Ala.Crim. App.2012), concluded that, if the defendant claiming self-defense was, at the time of the shooting, a convicted felon in possession a firearm, he has a duty to retreat because he is engaged in \u201cunlawful activity\u201d and is not \u201cfree from fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Wallace objected to the trial court\u2019s conclusion and argued that the correct application of the law with regard to a defendant\u2019s duty to retreat is not whether he was free from fault, but, rather, whether he was the initial aggressor. The trial court overruled his objection. Wallace then argued that he should be \u201cimmune from prosecution as a result of the self-defense,\u201d and the trial court replied that, in accordance with <em>Kidd, </em>the immunity provided by \u201cthe stand your ground [law] doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to [Wallace] in the area of being free from fault since he was a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.\u201d (R. 436-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The trial court then charged the jury with respect to self-defense, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, a defendant is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person, and cannot prevail on the issue of self-defense if it reasonably appears, or the defendant knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating, except that the defendant is not required to retreat if he is in his dwelling or at his place of work <em>and was not the original aggressor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA-aG\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201cNow, some essential elements of self-defense are: 1, that <em>the defendant must be free from fault. </em>That is, he must not have said or done anything for the purpose of provoking the difficulty. Nor must he be disregardful of the consequences in this respect of any wrongful word or action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAkE\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, to sustain a claim of self-defense it is necessary that the following conditions be established:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\u201c1) that the accused or the defendant was in actual or apparent peril.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">\u201c2) that the defendant was unable to retreat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">\u201c3) that the defendant was <em>free from fault in bringing on the difficulty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA7K\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">\u201cRemember, that the party invoking the doctrine of self-defense must be <em>entirely free from fault. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">(R. 491-96; emphasis added.) Wallace again objected to this instruction after the trial court charged the jury. Thereafter, the jury found Wallace guilty of heat-of-passion manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of murder. Wallace then filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, Wallace filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">On appeal, Wallace contends only that the trial court committed reversible error when it refused to instruct the jury on Alabama\u2019s \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d law. Specifically, Wallace argues that the trial court erroneously reasoned that, because Wallace was a convicted felon in possession of a firearm,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he was engaged in \u201cunlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>activity\u201d at the time he shot Robinson and was, therefore, not entitled to the \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201c \u2018A trial court has broad discretion in formulating its jury instructions, provided they are an accurate reflection of the law and facts of the case. <em>United States v. Padilla-Martinez, </em>762 F.2d 942 (11th Cir.1985). However, a \u201cdefendant is entitled to have the court instruct the jury on his defense theory, \u2018assuming that the theory has foundation in the evidence and legal support.\u2019 <em>United States v. Conroy, </em>589 F.2d 1258, 1273 (5th Cir.1979).\u201d <em>United States v. Terebecki, </em>692 F.2d 1345, 1351 (11th Cir.1982). In order to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to necessitate an instruction and allow the jury to consider the defense, \u201cwe must accept the testimony most favorably to the defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>592 F.2d 1282, 1286 (5th Cir. 1979).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\"><em>\u201cCoon v. State, </em>494 So.2d 184, 186 (Ala. Crim.App.1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cBefore 2006, Alabama\u2019s self-defense statute addressed deadly force in defense of self, as well as the duty to retreat, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201c \u2018(b) ... [A] person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if it reasonably appears or he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201c\u2018(1) By retreating, except that the actor is not required to retreat:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">\u201c \u2018a. If he is in his dwelling or at his place of work and was not the original aggressor....\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\u201cEffective June 1, 2006, however, \u00a7 13A-3-23, Ala.Code 1975, was amended to provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">\u201c\u2018(a) A person is justified in using physical force upon another person in order to defend himself or herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by that other person, and he or she may use a degree of force which he or she reasonably believes to be neeessary for the purpose. A person may use deadly force, and is legally presumed to be justified in using deadly physical force in self-defense or the defense of another person pursuant to subdivision (4), if the person reasonably believes that another person is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-15\">\u201c \u2018(1) Using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAxA\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">\u201c \u2018(b) A person who is justified under subsection (a) in using physical force, including deadly physical force, <em>and who is not engaged in an unlawful activity </em>and is in any place where he or she has the right to be <em>has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground.\u2019 </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-17\"><em>George v. State, </em>159 So.3d 90, 93-94 (Ala. Crim.App.2014) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-18\">During the jury-charge conference, the parties discussed, outside the presence of the jury, whether Wallace was entitled to an instruction on the stand-your-ground portion of the self-defense statute. The State argued that, because Wallace was a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Wallace was engaged in \u201cunlawful activity\u201d and, therefore, could not avail himself of the stand-your-ground instruction; the trial court agreed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cWe addressed a similar scenario in <em>Williams v. State, </em>46 So.3d 970 (Ala. Crim.App.2010). In <em>Williams, </em>the trial court gave the following instruction on self-defense, which is nearly identical to the instruction given in this case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe Defendant is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person, and cannot prevail on the issue of self-defense if it reasonably appears or the Defendant knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating, except that the Defendant is not required to retreat if he is in his own dwelling or was not the initial aggressor.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201c46 So.3d at 970. This Court reversed Williams\u2019s conviction and sentence, concluding that \u2018[t]he trial court\u2019s self-defense instruction did not substantially cover the language set forth in the amended version of \u00a7 13A-3-23(b)\u2019 and that \u2018the instruction was an incorrect statement of law, and [that] the trial court erred when it refused to reinstruct the jury regarding the right to stand one\u2019s ground pursuant to the current version of \u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala.Code 1975.\u2019 <em>Williams, </em>46 So.3d at 971.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN3q\"><em>George, </em>159 So.3d at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In the present case, the State concedes that, \u201c[t]hough the trial court gave a jury charge on self-defense, the charge explained the law of self-defense in terms of the pre-June 1, 2006, duty to retreat.... It also failed to include an instruction on the post-June 1, 2006, [\u00a7 ] 13A-3-23(b), \u2018stand your ground\u2019 provisions.\u201d (State\u2019s brief, pp. 10-11.) The State contends, however, that \u201cthis hybrid charge was justified. And, even if there was error in such a hybrid charge, the error was harmless to Wallace\u2019s defense.\u201d (State\u2019s brief, p. 11.) Specifically, the State argues that Wallace was the initial aggressor and was neither eligible to stand his ground nor entitled to any self-defense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">In support of its position at trial, however, the State relied upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kidd v. State, </em>105 So.3d 1261 (Ala. Crim.App.2012). In <em>Kidd, </em>the State argued at trial that, because Kidd was a felon in possession of a firearm, he was engaged in \u201cunlawful activity\u201d that imposed upon him a duty to retreat under \u00a7 13A-3-23(b). <em>Id. </em>Kidd\u2014who, like Wallace, \u201cadmitted that, at the time of the shooting, he was a convicted felon and was aware that he was violating the law by carrying a gun\u201d\u2014argued that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding self-defense was misleading because, he said, it was contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 13A-3-23(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262. This Court rejected Kidd\u2019s argument and held that \u201c \u00a7 13A-2-23(b) imposed a duty to retreat upon Kidd\u201d because his \u201cunlawful possession of the firearm [had] contributed to the argument that eventually led to the shooting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">This Court later stated, however, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">\u201c[although this Court in <em>Kidd </em>held that Kidd had a duty to retreat under \u00a7 13A-3-23, that holding followed this Court\u2019s conclusion that Kidd\u2019s argument was not properly presented on appeal. Thus, this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 13A-3-23, Ala.Code 1975, in <em>Kidd </em>was not essential to the judgment in that case. <em>See Ex parte Williams, </em>838 So.2d 1028, 1031 (Ala.2002) (\u2018Because obiter dictum is, by definition, not essential to the judgment of the court which states the dictum, it is not the law of the case established by that judgment.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\"><em>George, </em>159 So.3d at 95 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">To support his claim on appeal that the trial court should have instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>jury on \u201cstand your ground,\u201d Wallace cites our recent decisions in <em>Diggs v.

The State contends that, based on this unlawful activity, Diggs\u2019s presence at the club was unlawful and, therefore, negated Diggs\u2019s claim of self-defense. In <em>Ex parte Taylor, </em>636 So.2d 1246 (Ala.1993), our Supreme Court recognized that a felon is not completely deprived of his right to possess a firearm when in immediate need to defend his life. Specifically, the Court in <em>Taylor </em>held that, \u2022when a felon is in imminent peril of great bodily harm, or reasonably believes himself or others to be in such danger, he may take possession of a weapon for a period no longer than is necessary ... to use it in self-defense.\u2019 636 So.2d at 1247. In the instant case, evidence presented at trial established that Bowen told Diggs that Blackwell had a gun and that Blackwell had said that he was going to \u2018bury1 him. Diggs\u2019s testimony, if believed by the jury, indicated that Diggs used the firearm in defense of his life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-16\"><em>Johnson, </em>168 So.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">Contrary to Wallace\u2019s position on appeal, neither <em>Diggs </em>nor <em>Johnson </em>stands for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the proposition that a convicted felon in possession of a firearm may avail himself of the \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d portion of the self-defense statute. Indeed, in <em>Fuller v. State, </em>[Ms. CR-14-0368, Dec. 18, 2015] \u2014 So.3d-,-(Ala.Crim.App.2015)\u2014an opinion that this Court is releasing the same day as this opinion\u2014this Court explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cIn the present case, Fuller urges this Court to follow <em>Diggs. </em>Fuller argues that his possession of a firearm before the altercation that led to Witherspoon\u2019s death might have been an event in violation of the law; however, he asserts, based on the testimony of Fuller and Smoot, his possession of a firearm was justified, and thus was not an \u2018unlawful activity,\u2019 at the moment it became necessary for his self-defense. Therefore, Fuller argues that, in addition to the instruction on self-defense under 13A-3-23(a), Ala.Code 1975, he was entitled to an instruction under \u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala. Code 1975, informing the jury that, if he was justified under subsection (a) in using physical force, he had no duty to retreat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cThere is language in <em>Diggs </em>that seems to support Fuller\u2019s argument. However, the language in <em>Diggs </em>concerning the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat was unnecessary and, thus, was merely dicta. Unlike the present situation, in <em>Diggs </em>the trial court erroneously refused to give any instruction to the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself under \u00a7 13A-3-23(a), Ala.Code 1975. That error alone warranted reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>It was unnecessary for this Court to analyze the separate issue concerning the limited right of a person to \u2018stand his or her ground\u2019 if that person is \u2018justified under subsection (a) in using physical force,\u2019 see </em>\u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala.Code 1975.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">(Emphasis added.) In other words, the reversible error in <em>Diggs </em>and <em>Johnson </em>was the trial court\u2019s failure to give a self-defense instruction under \u00a7 13A-3-23(a), not the trial court\u2019s failure to give a \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d instruction under \u00a7 13A-3-23(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Here, unlike in <em>Diggs </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>the trial court instructed the jury on self-defense. Thus, <em>Diggs </em>and <em>Johnson </em>are inapplicable in this case. Therefore, the question we must address, and the question that Wallace asks this Court to decide, is whether, under the facts of this case, the trial court erred when it did not charge the jury with regard to the \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d component of Alabama\u2019s self-defense law, which is set forth in \u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala.Code 1975. Specifically, this case turns on whether a convicted felon in possession of a firearm is engaged in \u201cunlawful activity\u201d under the stand-your-ground provision of the self-defense statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We address this precise question in <em>Fuller </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cIn the present case, the issue whether Fuller, the defendant, was entitled to a \u2018no-duty-to-retreat\u2019 instruction is squarely before us. Specifically, the issue whether Fuller was \u2018engaged in an unlawful activity\u2019 under \u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala.Code 1975, is squarely before us. Fuller urges this Court to follow the dicta set forth in <em>Diggs. </em>However, in the present case, we hold that the trial court did not commit reversible error when it ruled that Alabama\u2019s \u2018stand-your-ground\u2019 law did not apply because Fuller was engaged in unlawful activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">\u201cSection 13A-3-23(b) provides a qualified exception to the common-law rule that required a person to retreat rather than use deadly physical force if that person can retreat without increasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>his or her peril. <em>See Kyser v. State, </em>513 So.2d 68 (Ala.Crim.App.1987) (setting forth the standard concerning a person\u2019s duty to retreat under the common law and under a prior version of \u00a7 13A-3-23). Section 13A-3-23(b) exempts people who are not engaged in an unlawful activity and are in any place where they have the right to be from the common-law rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cTo support its holding, <em>Diggs </em>relied on <em>Ex parte Taylor, </em>636 So.2d 1246 (Ala. 1993). Unlike the present situation or the situation in <em>Diggs, </em>in <em>Taylor </em>the issue was \u2018whether \u00a7 13A-11-72, Code of Ala.1975, which prohibits a convicted felon from possessing a pistol, is a strict liability statute or whether a convicted felon who is charged with possessing a firearm may raise the defense of self-defense.\u2019 <em>Ex parte Taylor, </em>636 So.2d at 1246, That case did not consider whether a defendant had no duty to retreat under \u00a7 13A-3-23(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cTo support its holding, <em>Diggs </em>quoted <em>Taylor, </em>quoting in turn <em>[State v.] Blache, </em>[480 So.2d 304 (La.1985)], as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[W]hen a felon is in imminent peril of great bodily harm, or reasonably believes himself or others to be in such danger, he may take possession of a weapon for a period no longer than is necessary or apparently necessary to use it in self-defense, or in defense of others. In such a situation justification is a defense to the charge of felon in possession of a firearm.\u2019 \u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\"><em>\u201cDiggs, </em>168 So.3d at 162, quoting <em>Ex parte Taylor, </em>636 So.2d at 1247, quoting in turn <em>Blache, </em>480 So.2d 304.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cThis statement should be the rule regarding self-defense. Specifically, ... at the moment when a person who is otherwise unable to lawfully possess a weapon finds himself or herself in imminent peril of great bodily harm, he or she should be able to lawfully take possession of a weapon at that moment and use it for a period no longer than is necessary or apparently necessary to use it in self-defense. Recognizing this rule simply recognizes the defense of justification or necessity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">\u201cOn the other hand, a person should not be able to unlawfully take possession of a weapon well before an altercation occurs, enter circumstances that may result in a violent confrontation, use that weapon in a violent altercation, and then avail himself or herself of the \u2018no-duty-to-retreat\u2019 right created by \u00a7 13A-3-23(b). In such a situation, the defendant is engaged in unlawful activity before it becomes necessary to do so. As such, the defendant who is illegally in possession of a firearm should be required to retreat, if retreat is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-13\">\u201cUnder <em>Taylor, </em>if a person who cannot otherwise lawfully possess a weapon arms himself or herself in self-defense, he or she can raise the defense of self-defense to a charge that he or she unlawfully possessed a weapon. As <em>Taylor </em>held, unlawful possession of a firearm is not a strict-liability offense. However, <em>Taylor </em>did not consider whether such a person has a duty to retreat if possible, and there is no indication in \u00a7 13A-3-23 that the legislature meant to exempt such a person from duty under the common law to retreat if possible. In fact, the opposite is true. The legislature explicitly excluded people \u2018engaged in an unlawful activity\u2019 from the newly established \u2018no-duty-to-retreat\u2019 right. Frankly, we see the wisdom in not allowing violent felons to proactively arm themselves and then avail themselves of the stand-your-ground law when they enter a situation in which violence is likely and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>use the weapon that they are unlawfully possessing to take human life. A felon who -is barred from possessing a gun should be able to act in self-defense, but he or she should also have to retreat if possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201cIf a person enters a situation engaged in an unlawful activity that in anyway relates to or contributes to the situation, that person cannot avail himself or herself of the \u2018no-duty-to-retreat\u2019 right created by \u00a7 13A-3-23(b). This Court previously alluded to this understanding of the law in <em>Kidd v. State, </em>105 So.3d 1261 (Ala.Crim.App.2012)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cIn the present case, Fuller unlawfully possessed a firearm before he drove by the house where [the victim] was located and the altercation occurred. He then used that firearm in the altercation. We hold that Fuller was not entitled to an instruction under \u00a7 13A-3-23(b), Ala.Code 1975, informing the jury that, if he was justified under subsection (a) in using physical force, he had no duty to retreat. We certainly do not believe the Alabama Legislature intended to avail armed violent felons of its stand-your-ground law. Accordingly, this Court holds that the trial court did not commit reversible error when it ruled that Alabama\u2019s \u2018stand-your-ground\u2019 law did not apply because Fuller was engaged in unlawful activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u2014 So.3d at\u2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Likewise, here, Wallace unlawfully possessed a firearm when he left his apartment, searched for Robinson in the parking lot of the apartment complex, and, ultimately, used that firearm to shoot Robinson.
