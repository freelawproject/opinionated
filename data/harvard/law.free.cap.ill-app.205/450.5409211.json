Where, on a bill to foreclose a trust deed, it appeared that four of the notes secured had been paid, that the deed provided that upon payment of any one of the notes the trustee might release a lot, that accordingly four lots were released, two of which the defendant sold, and such release was pleaded in the answer, and a cross-bill was filed by the owners of such lots, upon which an issue was formed and decided against the complainant, and that defendant in the original bill was taxed with the entire master\u2019s fee, which included the testimony on the issues formed on the cross-bill, held that the taxation of the costs on the cross-bill was improper.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b479-7\" pgmap=\"479\">4.

Where a trust deed provides for solicitor\u2019s fees incurred in any suit or proceeding in connection with the foreclosure to which the holder of the notes might be a party, the unsuccessful defendant is not liable for solicitor\u2019s fees for defending a cross-bill by other persons to which defendant is not a party.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
