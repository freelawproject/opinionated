Misconduct of a party and a third person consisting of remarks derogatory to the other party in the presence and hearing of the jury during the temporary absence of the trial judge cannot be assigned as error where the attention of the trial judge was not called to such misconduct, so as to enable the court to counteract whatever prejudicial effect the making of such remarks might have had upon the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b177-7\" pgmap=\"177\">2.
