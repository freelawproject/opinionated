In a suit to compel contribution by the estate under a joint obligation of the decedent and the claimant originally begun by filing a claim in the Probate Court, no written pleadings would be necessary to present questions as to the premature filing of the claim or its contingent character, or that it was only payable out of subsequently discovered assets.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b54-5\" pgmap=\"54\">3.
