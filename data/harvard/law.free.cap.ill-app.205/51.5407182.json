A mere rumor, the truth or falsity of which is easy of ascertainment, that a certain shipment of live stock came from quarantined territory, held not enough to justify the destruction of property rights without even an attempt to verify or disprove such rumor, in an action to recover damages for failure of the carrier to deliver such shipment under its contract of carriage.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b81-11\" pgmap=\"81\">8.
