Wills, \u00a7 20<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what are not insane delusions. In proceedings to set aside a will where it was claimed that the unsoundness of mind of the testator was manifested by his search for gold or coal on his farm, and that his belief that gold could be found in paying quantities was a delusion resulting from an unsound state of mind, and it appeared that the notions which the testator had concerning the probability of finding gold or coal were not purely imaginative but had some basis in fact, held that such ideas of the testator were conclusions and not delusions.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b145-14\" pgmap=\"145\">2. Wills, \u00a7 20*\u2014what constitutes a delusion. In proceedings to set aside a will where it was claimed that the testator suffered from delusions resulting from an unsound mind, held that a delusion is not a deduction from facts, hut something purely imaginative, a figment of the brain.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b145-15\" pgmap=\"145\">3. Wills, \u00a7 20*\u2014what are not delusions. Where the notions of a testator charged with suffering from delusions resulting from an unsound state of mind are based upon some sort of evidence, however insufficient, such notions are deemed conclusions and not delusions.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b145-16\" pgmap=\"145\">4. Wills, \u00a7 20*\u2014when existence of insane delusions not shown. An insane delusion is not established when the court is able to understand how a person situated as the testator was might have believed all that 'the evidence shows that he did believe, and still have been in full possession of his senses.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b145-18\" pgmap=\"145\">5. Wills, \u00a7 20*\u2014what does not constitute a delusion invalidating will. Where a testator has actual grounds for suspicion of the existence of something in which he believes, though in fact not well founded and disbelieved by others, a misapprehension of the fact is not a matter of delusion which will invalidate his will.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b145-19\" pgmap=\"145\">6. Wills, \u00a7 30*\u2014who has burden of proof as to sanity of testator. In the contest of a will upon the question of testamentary capacity, the burden of proving the sanity of the testator is in the first instance on the proponents, but after a prima facie case has been made out by the testimony of the subscribing witnesses, the legal presumption is in favor of sanity, and the burden of the whole case rests upon the contestants.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b145-21\" pgmap=\"145(21) 146(29)\">7. Wills, \u00a7 19*\u2014when senile dementia does not constitute mental incapacity to make will. While senile dem,entia is a weakening condition of the mind resulting from old age and bringing about a diminution of the mental faculties, it does not necessarily result in mental incapacity to make a will.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b145-22\" pgmap=\"145\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.

In a will contest where expert witnesses testified that the testator had senile dementia on a certain date and that he was so afflicted four months previous, when the will was made, but did not testify that such senile dementia which the testator may have had during the month the will was made was of such a character as to affect his testamentary capacity, evidence held insufficient to show mental incapacity to make a will.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
