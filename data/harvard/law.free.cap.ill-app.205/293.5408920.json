St. Supp. 1916, If 5475(3)], and claimed that its motion in arrest should have been sustained, as the declaration failed to state a cause of action under such act, held that the motion was properly denied, as the declaration made no reference to the act, and plaintiff was not seeking to recover except in the common-law action of tort.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\" pgmap=\"321\">Error to the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

St. Supp. 1916, If 5475(3)], which, under the terms of the act, should be conclusively presumed to have elected to be under such act, and where it appeared that such employer was engaged in the egg brokerage business and had nothing to do with the unloading or hauling of any eggs at any time, held that the only occupation which it could possibly be claimed affected such employer was that described as \u201ccarriage by land and water and loading or unloading in connection therewith,\" and that any teaming which such employer hired to be done for it could not be its \u201coccupation, enterprise or business\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
