In an action to recover damages for building the defendant\u2019s portion of a division line fence which was erected by the plaintiff pursuant to the decision of fence viewers appointed under the Fence Viewers\u2019 Act, sec. 8 (J. &amp; A. If 5708), where it appeared that the notice limited the authority of the fence viewers to determining what proportion of the fence should be maintained by each owner, and damages were assessed without giving notice for the selection of fence viewers to make the appraisement of damages, held that the fence viewers originally selected could not legally make the appraisement of the damages, because they were not selected for that purpose under- the original notice, and it was therefore necessary to give another notice to the defendant so that he would have the opportunity, which the statute contemplated, of selecting one of the fence viewers to make such appraise- \u25a0 ment.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b174-7\" pgmap=\"174\">2.
