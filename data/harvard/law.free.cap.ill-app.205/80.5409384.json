Brokers, \u00a7 93<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what are questions for jury in action by members of real estate partnership individually for commissions. In an action by two plaintiffs doing business as a real estate partnership agency to recover commissions claimed for arranging a contract between the defendant and others for the exchange of defendant\u2019s real estate, the questions whether there was a misjoinder of plaintiffs and whether plaintiffs were acting in a dual capacity as agents for both parties to the contract, held to be for the jury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-8\" pgmap=\"109\">2. Brokers, \u00a7 91*\u2014when evidence sufficient to show knowledge by owner that members of real estate partnership were acting for both parties. Evidence held sufficient to sustain the finding that plaintiffs were acting as a partnership in the transaction sued on and that defendant knew they were acting both for him and for the other party to the contract involved in such transaction for the exchange of defendant\u2019s real estate, in an action to recover commissions claimed on account of such transaction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-11\" pgmap=\"109\">3.
