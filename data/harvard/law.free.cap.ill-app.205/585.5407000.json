Defendant having averred a tender of $994.94 and plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept it in full satisfaction of her claim, the court entered judgment for that sum and costs, which was refused as full satisfaction of claim, and the cause having proceeded to trial upon the issues raised by the additional averments of the affidavit of merits, the court directed a verdict for plaintiff for $2,164.16, and from the judgment entered thereon, defendant appeals. .</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-8\" pgmap=\"614\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-9\" pgmap=\"614\">1. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1303*\u2014when not assumed that sufficient evidence -was heard to support directed verdict. On appeal from a directed verdict for plaintiff in an action to recover on a benefit certificate of another insurance society, the liability under which was alleged to have been assumed by defendant insurance society, the rule that the Appellate Court will assume ^that sufficient evidence was heard to support the verdict, where the court\u2019s certificate to the bill of exceptions does not state that it contains all of the evidence, does not control where the record contains some evidence tending to support one of the defenses, and the evidence in support of plaintiff\u2019s claim of assumption of liability by the defendant is too meager to enable the Appellate Court to find that the alleged assumption was not in excess of defendant\u2019s powers or that a new application and examination of defendant could be dispensed with.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b614-10\" pgmap=\"614(62) 615(43)\">2. Insurance, \u00a7 898<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence is insufficient to show assumption of benefit certificate by another company. In an action on a benefit certificate, where defendant\u2019s liability is predicated upon its assumption of the certificate, and the principal reliance of plaintiff to support such contention is the acceptance by defendant of dues and assessments from the insured and the claim that the defendant had \u201cconsolidated\u201d with another insurance company which had \"taken over\u201d the business of the insurer which issued the certificate, but no showing as to the arrangement or method of such alleged assumption is made, there is not sufficient evidence to establish it.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-5\" pgmap=\"614\">Albert J.
