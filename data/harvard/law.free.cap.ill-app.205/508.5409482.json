O\u2019Neil, plaintiff, against the City of Chicago, defendant, to recover for alleged wrongful exclusion by defendant of plaintiff from performance by plaintiff of a certain contract entered into between plaintiff and defendant upon the acceptance by defendant of plaintiff\u2019s bid upon certain work to be performed at Lake View Pumping Station of defendant. From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff brings error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-10\" pgmap=\"536\">Plaintiff was the highest of three bidders on the work in question when the bids were first submitted. Shortly after acceptance of his bid and making of the contract referred to, one of the other bidders instituted suit alleging the contract was illegal and void, as not complying with the statutes requiring competitive bidding, and asking injunction against this plaintiff and defendant. A temporary injunction was issued and later the presiding judge gave an oral opinion directing the entry of a final decree granting a perpetual injunction. Before erltry of such decree this judge died. Thereafter the city readvertised the work and again entered into a contract with plaintiff to do substantially the same work. Such contract was carried out and the work completed by him. Said suit was dismissed by stipulation of the parties.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-8\" pgmap=\"537\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-9\" pgmap=\"537\">1.
