Bassett on said date owned and managed said building; that the building contained a certain elevator shaft, running through and past the different floors of the building; that at the time aforesaid plaintiff\u2019s intestate was employed by the defendant corporation, and that it thereupon became and was the duty of such defendant to provide plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Max Click, with a reasonably safe place in which to work; that it was the duty of the other said defendants to keep and maintain the elevator shaft in question in a reasonably safe condition, so that persons rightfully in and upon the premises would not be injured.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\" pgmap=\"572\">It was further averred that the defendant corporation in disregard of its duty allowed and permitted a certain large number of boxes, bales or barrels to be piled up in its plant or factory, \u201cso that by reason thereof they became and were dangerous and unsafe\u201d; that the other defendants, owners of the building, negligently permitted the elevator shaft to be unprotected and unguarded at or near the floor of said building occupied by the defendant corporation, and in proximity to which the said barrels, bales or boxes were so piled; that while plaintiff\u2019s intestate was at work for the defendant corporation at the place aforesaid, and in the exercise of due care for his own safety, the said pile of boxes, barrels or bales was caused to and did totter, and some of the said boxes, barrels or bales by reason thereof were caused to and did fall upon plaintiff\u2019s intestate while he, in the exercise of due care, was in the act of getting out of the way of said barrels, boxes or bales, as aforesaid, when he was caused to and did fall down and through said elevator shaft or hoistway to and upon the ground or basement floor, and which said fall was caused by the joint and concurrent negligence of the said defendants\u201d; that by reason of such fall plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed, etc.</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-7\" pgmap=\"573\">Abstract of the Decisi\u00f3n.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-8\" pgmap=\"573\">1. Master and servant, \u00a7 123*\u2014what part of premises need not be kept saf\u00e9.
