Cra\u00f1e, L. P. Friestedt Company, Lanquist &amp; Hlsley Company, John E. O. Pridmore, City of Chicago and Murdock Campbell, defendants, to recover damages for injuries to plaintiff\u2019s party wall.

A party wall agreement existed as to this building and a similar building immediately south on premises known as No. 23 North Market street, leased for 99 years by one of the defendants and released from August 1, 1908, to the City of Chicago for a term of years. Between May 1 and September 1,1910, the latter building was tom down and a new building erected on that lot.

The lots Nos. 23 and 25 North Market street were each twenty by seventy feet in dimensions. The new building on the former lot was erected on the old foundation.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-7\" pgmap=\"576\">Abstract of the Decision. \u2018</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-8\" pgmap=\"576\">1.

Evidence held sufficient to sustain the finding that the damage to plaintiff\u2019s building, if any, consisting of the falling of a party wall and other damage, was the result of work done on another than defendants\u2019 property and was not caused by any conduct of commission or omission of the defendants, lessees of a party wall.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-9\" pgmap=\"576\">2.

Evidence held to furnish no basis of fact for the introduction of evidence of the loss of profits to plaintiff\u2019s business as an element of damages claimed, in an action to recover for being deprived of the use of a certain building in which plaintiff conducted such business, where plaintiff kept no record, books or papers other than certain mail orders, which were destroyed from year to year, and a bank pass book, which could not be found, and such evidence as to loss of profits was properly excluded.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-4\" pgmap=\"576\">F.
