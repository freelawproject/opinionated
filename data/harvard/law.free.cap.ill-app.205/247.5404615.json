In an action upon an accident insurance policy to recover for death, where the plaintiff claimed that death resulted from an- infection in the internal ear, which started from the blood caused by a wound sustained in an accident, and the defendant claimed that such an infection could not have been caused by an external injury like the one in question, and the question of liability hinged on whether the trouble antedated the accident, and plaintiff\u2019s evidence on that subject was mainly of a negative character, to the effect that the witnesses never knew of such a trouble, and the defendant offered direct and positive evidence that the insured had chronic internal ear trouble prior to the accident which developed into a septic condition that caused his death, held that remarks of the trial judge calculated to convey to the minds of the jury the impression that negative evidence was as strong and conclusive as positive evidence to the contrary constituted reversible error.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b276-8\" pgmap=\"276\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Veis.
