Railroads, \u00a7 348<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when exclusion of evidence as to basis of assessment of damages for overflow of land in prior action is erroneous. In an action against a railroad for damages to land caused by the construction of a solid embankment about two hundred feet from such land, and adjacent to a solid embankment erected by another railroad, thus leaving no outlet for a natural water course which, before such construction, ran across the defendant\u2019s right of way, and causing the water to back up and overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land, where it appeared that in a prior action damages had been assessed to the plaintiff and the plaintiff claimed that the judgment in the former action was res judicata, and the offer of the defendant to prove that the damages in the former action were not in fact assessed on the theory of law that the defendant was liable for the entire damage, and that in fact it was not liable for the entire damage was denied, held that the refusal to permit the introduction of the evidence offered was error.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\" pgmap=\"225\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Peoria county; the Hon.

Railroads, \u00a7 348*\u2014when exclusion of evidence in action for damages for overflow due to construction of embankment is erroneous. In an action against a railroad for damages to land caused by the construction of a solid embankment about two hundred feet from such land, and adjacent to a solid embankment erected by another railroad, thus leaving no outlet for a natural water course which, before such construction, ran across the defendant\u2019s right of way, and caused the water to back up and overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land, where the defendant offered to prove that its embankment did not change conditions which had existed long prior to the building of such embankment, and also offered to prove that the plaintiff had assisted in the work of closing the water course, and made various other offers to prove that it should not be liable for the entire damage, and all the offers were refused, held that the exclusion of such evidence was error.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b226-6\" pgmap=\"226\">3. Railroads, \u00a7 348*\u2014when evidence that embankment constructed by another railroad obstructed passage of water from land of adjoining owner is admissible. In an action against a railroad for damages to land caused by the construction of a solid embankment about two hundred feet from such land and adjacent to a solid embankment erected by another railroad, thus leaving no outlet for a water course, and causing the water to back upon and overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land, held that the defendant had the right to show that the embankment of the other railroad had obstructed the passage of such water from the plaintiff\u2019s land at the time the defendant constructed its embankment.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"Abm\" pgmap=\"226\">4.

Waters and water courses, \u00a7 15*\u2014what is liability of wrongdoer overflowing land for wrongful acts of others.

Estoppel, \u00a7 16<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when doctrine of estoppel by verdict is applicable. The doctrine of estoppel by verdict is but another branch of the doctrine of res judicata, and is applicable when some controlling fact or matter material to the determination of both causes has been adjudicated in a former proceeding and the same fact or matter is again at issue between the same parties.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b227-4\" pgmap=\"227\">7. Evidence, \u00a7 323*\u2014when parol evidence is admissible to show testimony given and questions determined. Where a judgment is offered in evidence in bar of a claim, and it is uncertain from the record what was adjudged, parol evidence is admissible to show what testimony was given and what questions were submitted for determination at the time the judgment was entered.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
