Trial, \u00a7 199<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when direction of verdict improper. Where the evidence is conflicting, it is improper for the trial court to direct a verdict, as it could not do so without weighing such evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b196-6\" pgmap=\"196\">2. New trial, \u00a7 109*\u2014what considered on motion for. On a motion for new trial, the court is required to consider the weight of conflicting evidence and grant the motion, if in its opinion the verdict was manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b196-7\" pgmap=\"196\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 84*\u2014when evidence insufficient to sustain verdict for plaintiff in action to recover commissions. In an action to recover commissions 'under a contract of employment providing for a weekly salary, and also commissions which were to be due and payable at the end of the employer\u2019s fiscal year, where it appeared that before the expiration of the year the plaintiff quit because he was offered a better position elsewhere, and three witnesses for the defendant testified that the right to commissions depended upon plaintiff\u2019s working for the fiscal year, as against the plaintiff alone who testified that his commissions were not made dependent on his working for the time specified, held that the verdict for the plaintiff was manifestly contrary to the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b196-8\" pgmap=\"196\">4. Master and servant, \u00a7 66*\u2014when employee entitled to commissions on sales. Where, under a contract of employment an employee is to receive a certain commission upon sales made by him payable at the end of the employer\u2019s fiscal year, and the duration of the employment is not fixed, the fact that the employee quits before the expiration of the fiscal year does not of itself bar him from recovering commissions, but if the contract is to continue for the year, the employee cannot recover unless he fully performs his contract for the full term for which he was hired.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b196-9\" pgmap=\"196\">5. Evidence, \u00a7 476*\u2014when testimony of one witness not to he given greater weight than that of opposing witnesses. In an action for the recovery of commissions by an employee where three witnesses, as against the plaintiff alone, testified that the payment of such commissions was made dependent upon the employee working for the defendant for a time specified, and it appeared that the employee quit before the expiration of such period, held that although the number of witnesses alone did not control, it would be unreasonable that the testimony of the plaintiff alone should be allowed to outweigh that of the three witnesses to the contrary.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b196-10\" pgmap=\"196\">6. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1805*\u2014when case reversed without remanding.
