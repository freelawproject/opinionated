Apbeal and error, \u00a7 1802<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when case reversed and remanded. In an action where a default judgment was entered, a motion to vacate the judgment was denied and the prayer for appeal was in general terms, and on appeal it was contended that there was not sufficient evidence in the reebrd to sustain the judgment, and it appeared questionable whether the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for any amount as damages, and a certain amount was included for taxes without any showing why the defendant should be liable therefor and interest was allowed without any contract to pay interest or any other fact entitling the plaintiff to interest being shown, held that because of the inclusion of the item of interest the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-18\" pgmap=\"224\">2.
