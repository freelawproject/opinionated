Garnishment\u2014when garnishee is not entitled to retain funds. In an- action to recover money which the defendant had retained pending the decision of an attachment action against the plaintiff, in which the defendant was garnished, where the attachment was quashed and an order was entered discharging the garnishee, and although a certified copy of such order was served on the defendant, and the money demanded, he refused to turn it over, and, after such refusal, a writ of error was sued out in the attachment action, but it did not appear that the defendant was ever made a party to the supersedeas or that he ever received formal notice thereof, or that the writ was filed in the Municipal Court clerk\u2019s office, and defendant claimed that as the suit in question was begun after the said writ of error was sued out, the writ might be pleaded in abatement, held that, after the defendant had been discharged as garnishee and demand had been made upon him to return the money, he had no right to retain the funds in the expectation that the defeated party in the original case might sue out a writ of error.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\" pgmap=\"328\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
