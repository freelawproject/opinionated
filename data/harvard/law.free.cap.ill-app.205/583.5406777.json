Street railroads, \u00a7 97<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when person crossing track in front of car is guilty of contributory negligence. In an action to recover for the death of one struck by a street car in crossing the track, the evidence showed that plaintiff\u2019s intestate, while looking in another direction, stepped on the track when the car was six or eight feet away and approaching at a good rate of speed, and that its gong was sounding and it was lighted and its headlight was burning. It did not appear that he looked for the car or that his view of it was obstructed, but it did appear that, if he had looked, he must have seen it. The evidence further showed that the speed of the car was not excessive and plaintiff admitted that defendant used all efforts to avoid the injury after the peril was discovered. Held, that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not in the exercise of ordinary care, but was guilty of such contributory negligence as to preclude a recovery.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\" pgmap=\"611\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.
