On a bill of interpleader to determine which of several claimants was entitled to the proceeds of a benefit certificate, where the insured surrendered the certificate several times, and where the defendants contended that the decree was erroneous in failing to find the mental condition of the insured at* the time the certificate in which they were named as beneficiaries was surrendered, and that both the decree and the master\u2019s report were silent upon such point, and that such error was not cured by a finding that the insured was of sound mind at a later date, and the record disclosed that the testimony before the master was made a part of his report and filed, but that it was not contained in the record on appeal, held that every intendment was in favor of the correctness of the decree, and that it must be assumed, in the state of the record, that if any finding such as was contended for had been necessary, the evidence justified a finding that the decedent was of sound mind at the time in question.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.
