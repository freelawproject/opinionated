In the improvement, erection or repair of buildings and the construction of drains and sewers therefor or of other adjuncts, the placing of building materials in the street preparatory to, building on the land is not unlawfully obstructing the street.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b34-7\" pgmap=\"34\">4. Municipal corporations, \u00a7 1038*\u2014what is nature of need authorising placing of building material on street. The necessity of using a public street for the placing of building material preparatory to improving, erecting or repairing buildings or drains or sewers therefor need not be an absolute but it is sufficient if it be a reasonable one.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b34-8\" pgmap=\"34\">5.

Where a fence was erected in the street under a permit for building purposes, the fact that the time limit fixed in it had expired does not make the fence the proximate cause of an injury sustained by a party riding a bicycle being struck by an automobile on an intersecting street where such fence was located, as he was attempting to cross such intersecting street.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AV\" pgmap=\"35\">8.
