Evidence, \u00a7 228<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is necessary -foundation for proof of conservator's reports. In an action by the administrator of the estate of a conservator for a feeble-minded person to recover for moneys expended and services rendered by the decedent for his ward, certain reports filed in the County Court by or for the decedent of his acts and doings as such conservator, held to be incompetent evidence, even prima facie, of the facts contained in such reports without proof of an adjudication of the correctness of such reports by the court in which they were filed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b64-11\" pgmap=\"64\">2. Evidence, \u00a7 228*\u2014when proof of adjudication of correctness of reports of conservator insufficient. Proof of an adjudication of the correctness of certain reports filed by a conservator of a feeble-minded person in the County Court of his acts and doings as such conservator can only be made by the record of that court, and a mere memorandum on such a report to the effect that it had been approved by the \u201cCounty Judge\u201d would be insufficient as proof of such adjudication, in an action wherein such reports were introduced in evidence to establish payments made or services rendered by such conservator.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b64-12\" pgmap=\"64\">3.
