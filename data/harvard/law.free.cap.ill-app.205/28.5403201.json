The words \u201cat once\u201d used in a live-stock insurance policy, providing that the assured should give notice \u201cat once\u201d to the insurer of any sickness or accident to the insured animal, held to mean what the average person would understand them to mean, namely, promptly, as soon as could reasonably be done, and not a full week after such sickness or accident.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-10\" pgmap=\"57(59) 58(63)\">4.

In an action to recover on a live-stock insurance policy, requiring the assured to give notice to the insurer \u201cat once\u201d of any sickness or accident to the insured animal, the fact that the assured when he filed his proofs of death of the insured animal stated that it first showed signs of sickness on July 6th, when the proof showed conclusively .that it first showed signs of sickness on July 2nd and continued to grow steadily worse until its death, held to be strongly suggestive of the fact that the assured appreciated that notice of sickness bad not been promptly given.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-3\" pgmap=\"57\">Thomas J.
