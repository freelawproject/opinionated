Appeal and error, \u00a7 892<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when record not reviewed because of insufficiency of abstract. Where the abstract of the record in a case failed to show that the hill of exceptions contained any motion for a new trial and the exhibits introduced by the defendant were merely described by numbers without giving any information as to their character, and such abstract gave what was designated as \u201can abstract of testimony,\u201d but failed to show how such testimony appeared in the record, and only one of ten instructions given for the plaintiff was shown, and the only reference to defendant\u2019s instructions were the words \u201ctwenty-three \"instructions given on behalf of the defendant pertaining to the question of liability,\u201d and such abstract also failed to show any certificate by the trial judge that the purported bill of exceptions was certified to by the judge, held that the pleadings before the Appellate Court did not justify a review of the record.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327\">2.

Appeal and error, \u00a7 892*\u2014\u25a0what is effect of failure to file proper abstract. The abstract of the record is the pleading of the party seeking to have such record reviewed, and it is the duty of such parties to prepare and file a complete abstract of the record in accordance with the rules, and such abstract as the reviewing court can safely rely upon, and, on a failure to comply with such rules, the reviewing court is not called upon to review the record.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-8\" pgmap=\"327\">4.

In a case where the plaintiff appealed, and in several assignments of error assigned as error the refusal of the trial court to find the defendant not guilty, held that as assignments of error are in the nature of a declaration, and plaintiff was asserting that the trial court should have instructed the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty, it was to be assumed that such assignments were inadvertently included in plaintiff\u2019s assignments.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b327-10\" pgmap=\"327\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
