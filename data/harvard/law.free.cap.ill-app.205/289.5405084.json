In an action for damages for injury to a caisson through its being struck by a steamer of the defendant which was being navigated in the daytime in a navigable river, where it appeared that such caisson had been sunk by the plaintiffs in connection with the construction of a new railroad bridge, and that it was twenty-eight feet long by sixteen feet wide, and projected four feet above the water, and closed the south draw of the old bridge so that vessels could use only the north draw, which facts were known to the captain of the steamer and to the captain of the tug having the same in tow, and, in approaching the bridge, which was swmng to let the steamer pass, the latter should have retarded its speed in order to get through the proper draw, but instead went ahead at full speed, held that the sole cause of the accident was the negligent management of the steamer, unaffected either by the conduct of the captain of the tug or those in charge of the bridge. \u201e</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-12\" pgmap=\"318(45) 319(177)\">2.

In an action for damages for injury to a caisson through its being struck by a steamer of the defendant which was being navigated in the daytime in a navigable river, where it appeared that such caisson had been sunk by the plaintiffs in connection with the construction of a new railroad bridge, and that it was twenty-eight feet long by sixteen feet wide, and projected four feet above the water, and closed the south draw of the old bridge so that vessels could use only the north draw, which facts were known to the captain of. the steamer and to the captain of the tug having the same in tow, and, in approaching the bridge, which was swung to let the steamer pass, the latter should have retarded its speed in order to get through the proper draw, but instead went ahead at full speed, and defendant contended that the lack of a city permit for the bridge and caisson constituted a defense, held that, as the negligent management of the steamer was the sole cause of the accident, the lack of a permit had no causal connection whatever with the occurrence and was therefore not a defense to the suit.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-4\" pgmap=\"318\">W.
