Appeal and ebrob, \u00a7 1413*\u2014when verdict of jury,not disturbed. Where an action to recover damages for personal injuries had been tried twice, the witnesses produced at each trial were practically the same, both juries found the defendant liable, and such finding was not manifestly against the weight of the evidence, held that setting aside the verdict as to liability of the defendant would not be justified, notwithstanding the evidence might easily be held, on an independent review, to exculpate the defendant. \u2022</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b413-14\" pgmap=\"413(10) 414(58)\">2.
