J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALR\">Appellant Nathan W. appeals the judgment making him a ward of the juvenile court. The court had previously sustained the allegations of a Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 602 petition charging appellant with driving under the influence of alcohol (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (a)) and driving while having a blood-alcohol level of .10 percent or more (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">At approximately 9:45 p.m., on April 30, 1987, two Merced County deputy sheriffs were on patrol in Los Banos when they saw a pickup truck on the shoulder of the road. The truck appeared to have been involved in an accident. As the patrol car stopped in front of the pickup the deputies saw appellant stepping out of the driver\u2019s side of the truck. They approached appellant and attempted to find out what had happened and whether there was anyone with him. Appellant was incoherent and very uncooperative. He answered to the effect, \u201cWe were coming back from the fair.\u201d The deputies, however, found no other person in the vicinity of the truck. They called for the California Highway Patrol (CHP).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">CHP Officer Samra arrived soon thereafter. When he approached appellant, Samra detected an odor of alcohol. The officer administered a series of field sobriety tests to appellant and then arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">The CHP officer took appellant to a local emergency room where his blood was drawn. An analysis of appellant\u2019s blood sample showed a blood-alcohol concentration of .14 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">Appellant testified on his own behalf. He did not remember much of what had happened after 4 p.m. on April 30th. He did not recall drinking or driving, nor did he recall the accident. After the accident, he remembered sitting in the middle of the truck\u2019s bench seat and noticing the rear window was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">Friends of appellant who had been with him earlier that day at a local fair testified they did not see him drink. There was also evidence of appellant\u2019s good reputation in his school and the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AyAk\">I., II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">III. Question of Detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Appellant claims the court\u2019s disposition order was erroneous because the court removed him from his parents\u2019 custody. While it found his welfare required his custody be taken from his parents, he argues the court committed reversible error when it failed to find under California Rules of Court, rule 1372(b)(3), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> continued parental custody would be detrimental to the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Appellant\u2019s argument is flawed. The court did not remove appellant from his parents\u2019 physical custody. Thus, the court did not err by failing to make express findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">If, at a disposition hearing the minor is adjudged a ward of the court, the juvenile court may limit parental control and, in so doing, determine the minor\u2019s placement. As the court observed in <em>In re Wayne J. </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 776, 780 [159 Cal.Rptr. 106]: \u201cOne of the purposes of the Juvenile Court Law is to secure for each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court such care and guidance, preferably in his own home, as will best serve his welfare and \u2018preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties.\u2019 (\u00a7 202, Welf. &amp; Inst. Code[.])[] Thus with this in mind, a comprehensive statutory scheme was devised to best provide for the placement and treatment of juveniles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">Placement ranges from the least restrictive, the home of the parent, to the extreme of commitment to the Youth Authority. (See \u00a7 726 et seq.) In order to take a minor from the <em>physical </em>custody of a parent, however, the juvenile court must find <em>one </em>of the following facts: \u201c(a) That the parent or guardian is incapable of providing or has failed or neglected to provide proper maintenance, training, and education for the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">\u201c(b) That the minor has been tried on probation in such custody and has failed to reform. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>\u201c(c) That the welfare of the minor requires that his custody be taken from his parent or guardian.\u201d (\u00a7 726.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">When the court determines the minor\u2019s welfare requires physical custody be taken from the parent or guardian, rule 1372(b)(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires the additional finding, based on <em>In re B.G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244], that continued custody by the parent or guardian would be detrimental to the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Because the court placed him in the care, custody and control of the Merced County probation officer for placement in the home of his parents, appellant appears to argue he was taken from his parents\u2019 physical custody. This is not so. In choosing the least restrictive placement and leaving the minor in the parental home on probation as was done in this case, the juvenile court does not take the minor away from a parent\u2019s physical custody. Instead, the minor remains home on probation in his parents\u2019 physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">The custody awarded by the juvenile court to the Merced County Probation Department is the minor\u2019s <em>legal </em>custody. Thus there is no need for a court finding of detriment, much less that the minor\u2019s welfare requires his \u201ccustody\u201d be taken from his parent or guardian. To do otherwise is illogical. It would defy reason for a court to find parental custody would be detrimental to the minor and nevertheless order the child home on probation. More importantly, ordering a minor home on probation does not violate the parental preference doctrine which was so important to the Supreme Court in <em>In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pages 698-699. The parent-child bond is not broken by home placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">Notably, the case law cited by the parties on whether an express finding of detriment was required involved out-of-home commitments, not at-home placements. (See <em>In re Cindy E. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 393 [147 Cal.Rptr. 812]; <em>In re Kenneth H. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 616 [189 Cal.Rptr. 867, 659 P.2d 1156].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>Appellant\u2019s misconception is understandable, however, given the court\u2019s disposition order. Immediately after the juvenile court placed the minor in his parents\u2019 home, it stated: \u201cFor the purpose of any confinement or out of home placement ordered herein, the minor will be found to be a person described by section 726(c) of the Welfare &amp; Institutions Code in that the welfare of the minor requires that his custody be taken from his parent or guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Other than the fact that this was one of the probation officer\u2019s recommendations, it is unclear why the court made this statement, particularly since the court did not order confinement or out-of-home placement. Again following the probation officer\u2019s recommendations, the court ordered: \u201cYou\u2019ll attend and complete the Intoxicated Drivers Education and Assessment Program and enroll in said program within 20 days after this court hearing. You and/or your parents are to pay the program fees as determined by the program officials. You\u2019ll be confined in juvenile hall for 20 consecutive days suspended on the condition that you attend and complete the alcohol counseling program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">\u201cYou\u2019ll report to the Probation Department\u2019s juvenile work program director for a work program assignment not to exceed five total days. You\u2019ll follow the instructions of the program director and you\u2019ll satisfactorily complete the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be confined in juvenile hall for seven consecutive days suspended to be used at the rate of 24 hours in juvenile hall for every day that you fail to complete the juvenile work program . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">However, these orders did not amount to confinement. What the court apparently intended was to impose a specified amount of time in custody and stay enforcement of the orders subject to subsequent violation of a probation condition. (\u00a7 777, subd. (e).) The probation officer\u2019s pro forma recommendation confused \u201csuspended,\u201d as used in the adult criminal system, with \u201cstay,\u201d which is the procedure used in juvenile court proceedings. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">By imposing time but staying enforcement subject to a probation violation, the court does not need a supplemental petition in case of a probation violation. In that situation, the juvenile court may modify its previous order and remove a minor from the parents\u2019 physical custody to a county institution for up to 30 days. (\u00a7 777, subd. (e).) However, because the court must find the minor has violated a condition of probation under section <em>7777, </em>subdivision (e), such a finding satisfies the requirement in section 726 for a finding to authorize taking the minor from a parent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>physical custody. Specifically, a finding of a probation violation satisfies section 726, subdivision (b), which permits removing a minor from parental physical custody when a court finds the minor has been tried on probation in such custody and has failed to reform. <em>(In re Robert M. </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 812, 819 [209 Cal.Rptr. 657].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">Thus, to the extent the juvenile court may have believed it had to make a section 726, subdivision (c), finding in order to make more real\u2014or easily carried out\u2014the threat of custody time if appellant did not complete the alcohol counseling program and the juvenile work program, such a belief was misplaced. Proceeding under section 777, subdivision (e), would be required irrespective of the anticipatory finding. In any event, the juvenile court did not err by failing to make a detriment finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">V.
