Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11351, 11378). He was sentenced to prison and appeals, claiming the trial court erroneously denied his Penal Code section 1538.5 motion and improperly sentenced. We reject his first contention, but agree in part with his second and therefore remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Johnson dealt cocaine and other controlled substances in the Palm Springs area. One night, he was shot by his female roommate\u2019s estranged husband, who then forcibly kidnapped the woman. Police officers responded to his home and while searching it for evidence of the shooting and kidnapping, discovered evidence of drug dealing. A more comprehensive search pursuant to a warrant then obtained revealed more evidence of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">1. <em>Motion to Suppress </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">\n<em>2. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In denying probation and sentencing Johnson to the midterm for possessing cocaine for sale and a consecutive term for possessing Diazepam, the court said to Johnson: \u201cI. . . [,] in having heard the evidence^] believe you were a big-time dealer in the Palm Springs area. You\u2019re a big-time street dealer. I think under these circumstances, probation should certainly be denied. ... I really\u2014other than the fact that you\u2019ve not been in trouble before, I think you\u2019re too sophisticated to have gotten caught before. I do think these activities have been going on for some time, and I think the evidence supports that theory. So I\u2019m going to sentence you\u2014and incidentally, you are here as a privilege, being a citizen of another country. And yet, you abused that privilege, and seriously abused it. So it will be the judgment and order of this Court, and like I say, the only mitigating circumstances is your lack of prior conviction, but there are the aggravating circumstances which certainly outweigh the mitigating circumstances just by the very nature of the crime. The fact that you are a heavy dealer. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>were spreading cocaine throughout the Palm Springs area. And you abused the privilege of this country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Johnson claims the foregoing shows the sentencing court improperly relied upon his alienage in imposing the midterm.  We agree that a defendant\u2019s alienage is not a proper factor when considering the length of his term, although it may well be when deciding upon probation, particularly if it indicates his ties to the community are tenuous. We are somewhat confused by the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe aggravating circumstances . . . certainly outweigh the mitigating circumstances,\u201d and its imposition of the <em>middle, </em>rather than the <em>upper </em>term, without further elaboration. We also must agree with Johnson that the court failed to separately state a reason or reasons for the imposition of a consecutive term on the Diazepam possession count. For these reasons, we must remand the matter for resentencing, at which Johnson\u2019s alienage should not be relied upon in fixing his term, and a statement of reasons for imposition of the consecutive term should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We, however, do not agree that the court\u2019s reliance upon the extent of Johnson\u2019s drug-dealing activities was improper or unsupported by the facts. Although Johnson claims in this regard that the court relied solely upon hearsay statements by the prosecutor and police officers that Johnson was a \u201cbig time dealer,\u201d the probation officer himself stated in his report that many items seized from Johnson\u2019s residence and car indicated ongoing large-scale drug trafficking activity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court agreed, as indicated above, and the evidence presented at trial fully supported this conclusion. We also reject Johnson\u2019s contention, set forth in his reply brief, that the court \u201cignored\u201d what he denotes as certain \u201cmitigating factors,\u201d i.e., his willingness to abide by the terms of probation, his age, education and employment history and prospects. We have read both the transcript of the sentencing hearing and Johnson\u2019s moving papers relating to the probation report and find nowhere in either any statement by Johnson or his counsel that he was willing to abide by the terms of probation. The remaining factors were addressed in the probation report and/or defense counsel\u2019s statement to the court during the sentencing hearing. It is presumed the court <em>considered </em>them (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 409), which is all that it is required to do. Apparently, the court rejected them as mitigating circumstances, which was within its province.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
