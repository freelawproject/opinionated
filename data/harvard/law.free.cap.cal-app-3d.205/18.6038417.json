Code, \u00a7 51) invalidate minimum resident age restrictions (CC&amp;R\u2019s) applicable to Vista Hermosa. Also under the judgments CCC is permanently enjoined from erecting or maintaining signs designating Vista Hermosa Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 a Senior Citizen Community, and is required to pay attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We have consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The sole issue on appeal is whether there are issues of material fact precluding the grant of summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) Concluding there are issues of material fact concerning whether Vista Hermosa is a senior citizen housing development within the meaning of Civil Code section 51.3, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">In 1976 and 1977, Hermosa Housing Corporation (Hermosa) developed the 436 unit Vista Hermosa subdivision in Oceanside. The project consists of duplexes, called twin homes, which have no lot line setbacks. The twin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>homes have no stairs, short driveways and small yards. According to Loran Winans, a principal of Hermosa, the zero lot line setbacks of the development required a special local zoning ordinance. According to Gary Winans, a member of CCC, the subdivision was originally developed for seniors in conformity with the City of Oceanside zoning ordinance 75.31, article 5, section 513, which provides in part: \u201cThe purpose of this section is to provide a housing alternative to the conventional single family home and condominium project for retirement-oriented communities.\u201d This ordinance was adopted at the request of Hermosa so that the twin-homes project could be built. The residents point out that Hermosa\u2019s request for a change in zoning includes the statement \u201c[t]he proposed development of single family duplex homeownership units along with multiple-family units will provide housing for moderate income families in the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">John Anderson, attorney for Hermosa, and Loran Winans declare that the project was developed for the purpose of providing affordable housing for active senior citizens. Original CC&amp;R\u2019s recorded January 19, 1978, contained residence and age restrictions as follows: \u201cIf persons related by blood or marriage reside in a unit, at least one must have attained age 45 and none of such residents shall be under the age of 18. If persons unrelated by blood or marriage reside in a unit, each must have attained age 45. A sole resident of a unit shall not be under the age of 45. The number of residents in a unit shall be no more than three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In May 1983, the California Supreme Court decided <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 790 [191 Cal.Rptr. 320, 662 P.2d 427], holding invalid under the Unruh Civil Rights Act a CC&amp;R age restriction limiting residency in a condominium project to persons over the age of 18. On August 3, 1983, CCC sent all owners in Vista Hermosa a letter notifying them of the <em>O\u2019Connor </em>decision and stating, in part: \u201cUnder current circumstances your Covenant Control Committee cannot enforce the clause in your CC &amp; R\u2019s related to age .... As soon as the Governor and the legislature see fit to restore our rights in this matter we will again enforce the age restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Effective January 1, 1985, the Legislature enacted section 51.3 which, generally, permits certain enforcement of CC&amp;R\u2019s containing age restrictions. As applicable here, the section is limited to developments that fit the definition of a \u201csenior citizen housing development.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.3, subd. (c)(3).) A \u201csenior citizen housing development\u201d is defined as \u201ca residential development consisting of . . .at least 35 dwelling units . . . which is developed for, or substantially rehabilitated or renovated for, senior citizens.\u201d (Ib<em>id.) </em>A \u201csenior citizen\u201d is a person 62 years of age or older or \u201c55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>years of age or older in a senior citizen housing development.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.3, subd. (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In 1985, Vista Hermosa, by a vote of over two-thirds of the owners, amended the CC&amp;R\u2019s intending to comply with the age requirements of Civil Code section 51.3. The amended CC&amp;R\u2019s were recorded March 25, 1986. They provide, in part: \u201cAt least 1 person residing in each Unit must be 55 years or older. . . . All other persons residing in such Unit must be at least 45 years of age, except the following: (1) the spouse or co-habitant. . . or (2) a person who resides with and provides a primary physical or economic support to the \u2018qualifying resident.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At the hearing on the summary judgment motion the trial court considered the declarations of Gary Winans, Loran Winans and John Anderson as well as over 90 homeowners in Vista Hermosa. Included in these declarations are many expressions of intent in connection with the nature of the subdivision as a senior citizen development.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At the request of the residents, the trial court also took judicial notice of the judgments in five cases brought earlier by CCC against homeowners alleging violation of the original age restriction of 45. In each judgment that age restriction in the CC&amp;R\u2019s before January 1, 1985, was declared arbitrary and unenforceable as a matter of law. The request for judicial notice does not include a request to judicially notice the stipulated facts on which these five cases were tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On this record the trial court granted the summary judgment for the residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\"><em>Mann </em>v. <em>Cracchiolo </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 18, 35-36 [210 Cal.Rptr. 762, 694 P.2d 1134], sets forth the pertinent rules regarding summary judgment as follows: \u201cThe summary judgment procedure, inasmuch as it denies the right of the adverse party to a trial, is drastic and should be used with caution. <em>(Eagle Oil &amp; Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Prentice </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 553, 556 [122 P.2d 264].) Summary judgment is properly granted only when the evidence in support of the moving party establishes that there is no issue of fact to be tried. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c; <em>Lipson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 362, 374 [182 Cal.Rptr. 629, 644 P.2d 822].)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">\u201c \u2018The moving party bears the burden of furnishing supporting documents that establish that the claims of the adverse party are entirely without merit on any legal theory.\u2019 <em>(Lipson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 374.) \u2018The affidavits of the moving party are strictly construed and those of his opponent liberally construed, and doubts as to the propriety of summary judgment should be resolved against granting the motion.\u2019 <em>(Slobojan </em>v. <em>Western Travelers Life Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 432, 436-439 [74 Cal.Rptr. 895, 450 P.2d 271]. \u2018. . . [I]ssue finding rather than issue determination is the pivot upon which the summary judgment law turns.\u2019 <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 439, 441 [116 P.2d 62].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">It is clear from the declarations in this case that issues of material fact are present bearing on the question whether Vista Hermosa is a senior citizen housing development as defined in Civil Code section 51.3. Is Vista Hermosa \u201ca residential development . . . developed for, or substantially rehabilitated or renovated for, senior citizens.\u201d? (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.3, subd. (c)(3).) If so, Civil Code section 51.3, in conjunction with Civil Code section 51.2, authorizes enforcement of age restrictions to the extent permitted by Civil Code section 51.3, notwithstanding the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Civil Code section 51.2, enacted contingent upon the enactment of Civil Code section 51.3, to become effective January 1, 1985,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides: \u201c(a) Section 51 shall be construed to prohibit a business establishment from discriminating in the sale or rental of housing based upon age. <em>Where accommodations are designed to meet the physical and social needs of senior citizens, a business establishment may establish and preserve such housing for senior citizens, pursuant to Section 51.3 of the Civil Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u201c(b) This section is intended to clarify the holdings in Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson (1982), 30 Cal.3d 72 [721], and O\u2019Connor v. Village Green Owners Association (1983), 33 Cal.3d 790.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Civil Code section 51.3 provides in part: \u201c(a) The Legislature finds and declares that this section is essential to establish and preserve specially designed accessible housing for senior citizens. There are senior citizens who need special living environments and services, and find that there is an inadequate supply of this type of housing in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u201c(b) The Legislature finds and declares that different age limitations for senior citizen housing are appropriate in recognition of the size of a development in relationship to the community in which it is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u201c(c) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201c(1) <em>\u2018Qualifying resident\u2019 or \u2018senior citizen \u2019 means a person </em>62 years of age or older, or <em>55 years of age or older in a senior

dissolution of marriage with, the qualifying resident or senior citizen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">\u201c(B) Was <em>45 years of age or older, or was a spouse, cohabitant, or person

restrictions or other documents or written policy <em>shall not limit occupancy, residency, or use on the basis of age more proscriptively than </em>to require that <em>one person in residence </em>in each dwelling unit may be <em>required to be a senior citizen and </em>that <em>each other resident </em>in the same dwelling unit may be <em>required to be a qualified permanent

restrictions or other documents or written policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">\u201c(f) Upon the death or dissolution of marriage, or upon hospitalization, or other prolonged absence of

italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Residents, in support of the summary judgment motion, contend CCC cannot qualify within Civil Code section 51.3 because the property has not \u201cbeen developed for, and initially been put to use as, housing for senior citizens,\u201d nor has it been \u201csubstantially rehabilitated or renovated for\u201d senior citizen housing. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.3, subd. (g).) This issue is one of law, and we construe Civil Code section 51.3 de novo. <em>(See. Dean W. Knight &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 300, 305-306 [202 Cal.Rptr. 44]; <em>Killian </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 1, 7 [143 Cal.Rptr. 430].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We must interpret the statute in a manner to effectuate its meaning and purpose, if possible. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859; <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].) The legislative purpose will be effectuated even where it is inconsistent with the strict letter of the statute. <em>(Southland Mechanical Constructors Corp. </em>v. <em>Nixen </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 417, 430 [173 Cal.Rptr. 917].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The express purpose of Civil Code section 51.3 is to establish \u201caccessible housing for senior citizens\u201d because \u201cthere is an inadequate supply of this type of housing in the state.\u201d This purpose is not supported by requiring all \u201csenior citizen housing development^]\u201d to have been <em>originally </em>designed and developed for that purpose if, in fact, existing facilities otherwise qualify physically within the statutory purpose. Since the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>recognized the shortage of senior citizen housing, it is absurd to construe the statute in a manner precluding consideration of preexisting facilities for such treatment. We decline to do so. Rather, we construe Civil Code section 51.3 to include any preexisting residential development as a \u201csenior citizen housing development\u201d regardless of the actual purpose for which it was originally designed or constructed as long as its physical characteristics meet the requirements of the statute. The intent to devote the property to senior citizens may be acquired after the statute took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">This construction is supported by other language in the statute. Housing \u201csubstantially rehabilitated or renovated for, senior citizens\u201d may satisfy the statutory requirement of Civil Code section 51.3, without any reference to original developer intent. This illustrates the legislative intent of classifying such housing only by its physical design for comfortable and safe senior citizen living, without reference to irrelevant initial developer intent. To require rehabilitation or renovation of existing structures already ideally suited for the purpose of the statute would be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We hold original developer intent for use as senior citizen housing is not a prerequisite to a facility qualifying as a \u201csenior citizen housing development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Our second inquiry addresses the physical attributes of the Vista Hermosa subdivision. For this purpose we may adopt the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 742 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th 1161], footnote 10. \u201c \u2018[Housing p]lans should include more and wider walkways with fewer stairs, an interior and exterior designed to permit easy social contact, provision for common rooms, short distances between buildings, easy refuse collection, light maintenance and well-lighted walkways and halls. . . \u201d (Quoting from <em>Taxpayers Ass\u2019n of Weymouth Tp. </em>v. <em>Weymouth Tp. </em>(1976) 71 N.J. 249, 80 N.J. 6 [364 A.2d 1016, 1027, 83 A.L.R.3d 1051].)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Residents raise questions of fact controverting CCC\u2019s contentions Vista Hermosa satisfies all the enumerated requirements. Are there \u201cmore and wider\u201d sidewalks? No evidence is presented on this question. Is easy social contact fostered by the Vista Hermosa design? The record reflects no provision for common rooms in the development. The record does not establish the development has \u201cwell-lighted walkways and halls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">We do not suggest that the record before us precludes Vista Hermosa from qualification as a \u201csenior citizen housing development\u201d within Civil Code section 51.3. We only identify factual issues which must be determined by the trial court before either party can prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Certain remaining points need to be made. First, <em>Park Redlands Covenant Control Committee </em>v. <em>Simon </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 87 [226 Cal.Rptr. 199], on which residents rely, is of no aid to them. <em>Park Redlands </em>considered the validity under Civil Code section 53, not section 51.3, of an injunction enforcing a restrictive covenant limiting residency in a development to three persons each 45 years of age or older. In 1979, the owners had allowed their 31-year-old daughter and her child, as well as their 20-year-old son to live with them periodically. After a trial, the court enjoined the two adult children and grandchild of the owners from residing with them until the former had attained the age of 45 years, and further enjoined more than three persons, including the owners, from permanently or regularly residing in the owners\u2019 premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Important facts such as the nature of the Park Redlands development were established in <em>Park Redlands </em>after a trial. A summary judgment was not involved. The establishment of those facts by trial permitted the appellate court to conclude the 45 years of age restriction was chosen \u201csolely\u201d to permit the Park Redlands Covenant Control Committee to \u201cengage in impermissible discrimination against children and families with children. <em>(Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 721, 745.) []]]... [P]ark Redlands is not a specialized facility for the elderly; thus, the age restriction is patently violative of the Unruh Act, and therefore unenforceable.\u201d <em>(Park Redlands, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d at pp. 94, 95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Factual determinations such as the nature of the development are not yet made with respect to Vista Hermosa. Only the issues on such matters are so far presented here. Accordingly, <em>Park Redlands </em>furnishes no assistance to the residents, at least at this summary judgment stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Second, the residents\u2019 reliance on the five preceding trial court cases that went to judgment against CCC is misplaced. Only the judgments in those cases, not their stipulated facts, were judicially noticed. More important, the cases involved a state of facts and law in existence before January 1, 1985. Since the law changed effective that date, the five preceding cases do not collaterally estop CCC from litigating the issue for the first time on the basis of the intervening change in the law. <em>(Powers </em>v. <em>Floersheim </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 223, 229-230 [63 Cal.Rptr. 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Third, the residents question whether the 1985 amendment to the CC&amp;R\u2019s was legally effective because of the declaration that the vote was \u201cover two thirds\u201d rather than three-fourths as otherwise provided for in the CC&amp;R\u2019s. At most, the question raises another issue of material fact as to what was the actual vote.  Moreover, Civil Code section 51.3 expressly authorizes enforcement of CC&amp;R\u2019s containing age restrictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>January 1, 1984, to the extent permitted by the section \u201cnotwithstanding lower age restrictions contained in those documents or policies.\u201d Thus, amendment of CC&amp;R\u2019s such as those for Vista Hermosa was unnecessary for the purpose of enabling enforcement of age restrictions to the extent permitted by Civil Code section 51.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Finally, we are merely holding the summary judgment was improperly granted and reversing on that ground. We are not determining the underlying merits of the action. Accordingly, at this stage of the action it is inappropriate to address the matter of attorney\u2019s fees as CCC requests for the first time in its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Judgments reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Wiener, Acting P.
