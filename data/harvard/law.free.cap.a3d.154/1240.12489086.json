The ADO had dismissed a grievance filed by the petitioners against Attorney John F. Bisson.

In their petition, the petitioners argue that the ADO and the CSC erred by declining to docket their grievance as a complaint, and that the CSC erred by failing to answer the questions raised in the petitioners' request for reconsideration. The respondents-the ADO and Attorney Bisson-challenge the merits of the petitioners' claims, and also assert that the petitioners lack standing to bring this petition.

Ct. R.\n   </em>\n   37A(II)(a)(5)(C), (a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Turning to the present petition, the record reflects the following facts. On December 30, 2015, the petitioners filed a grievance with the ADO. The petitioners' grievance arises out of the annual meeting of the Oak Brook Condominium Owners' Association, which took place in November 2015. The petitioners are unit owners at Oak Brook Condominium. Attorney Bisson\n   represented the condominium association at the meeting. The petitioners allege that, during the meeting, Attorney Bisson violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by, among other things, recording the meeting without the petitioners' knowledge or consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ADO reviewed the factual allegations in the petitioners' grievance, along with the exhibits that the petitioners provided. On January 15, 2016, the ADO's assistant general counsel sent a three-page letter to the petitioners, in which he reviewed the allegations, assessed the claimed violations, and explained the reasoning that led to his conclusion that \"a hearing panel would not likely find clear and convincing evidence that\" Attorney Bisson violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. Regarding the claim that Attorney Bisson made a recording without the petitioners' knowledge or consent, he noted that one of the petitioners' exhibits showed that, in fact, the meeting had not been recorded. Based upon the analysis of the petitioners' allegations, the ADO declined to docket the petitioners' grievance as a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petitioners filed a request for reconsideration, asserting that their grievance satisfied the requirements for docketing and that the ADO erred by dismissing their grievance. In their request, the petitioners listed a number of alleged errors in the ADO's decision, which they labeled \"[q]uestion[s].\" In a letter dated February 25, 2016, the CSC informed the petitioners that it had affirmed the ADO's decision. The petitioners then filed a \"Motion for Clarification\" with the CSC, asking that the CSC answer the questions that the petitioners had raised in their request for reconsideration. The CSC responded to the motion by letter, dated March 18, 2016, acknowledging receipt of the motion, and stating that \"th[e] matter is now closed.\" This petition followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In their petition, the petitioners argue that the Supreme Court Rules required the ADO to docket their grievance as a complaint and initiate an investigation. They assert that the ADO and the CSC erred by declining to docket their grievance on the basis that a hearing panel would be unlikely to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Attorney Bisson violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The petitioners further contend that the CSC erred by failing to answer the questions that the petitioners raised in their request for reconsideration. Although the petitioners do not identify a rule that requires the CSC to explicitly answer questions posed in a request for reconsideration, we read the petitioners' argument to be that the CSC was required to respond to each specific question raised. Thus, all of the petitioners' claims on appeal relate to alleged violations of the Supreme Court Rules by the ADO and the CSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The respondents dispute the merits of the petitioners' arguments. However, they also argue that the petitioners lack standing to bring this petition. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Certiorari is an extraordinary remedy that is not granted as a matter of right, but rather at the discretion of the court.\n   <em>\n    Petition of State of N.H.

Nor does the grievant have a personal stake in the proceedings by virtue of his participation in the disciplinary process.

It is for this reason that, generally, a victim has no right to intervene in the criminal case of the accused,\n   <em>\n    see Rullo v.

These cases reflect the underlying principle that \"[a] crime is a public wrong, raising an issue between the state and the accused,\" rather than between the accused and the accuser. 1 R. McNamara,\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire Practice: Criminal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.01, at 1 (2010). This logic-that, given the purpose and design of the criminal justice system, a victim does not have standing to seek judicial review of a criminal disposition-applies with equal force to the attorney discipline system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Therefore, in light of the nature and purposes of the attorney discipline system, we conclude that a grievant does not have a personal interest in the outcome of an attorney disciplinary proceeding that is sufficient to confer standing. In reaching this conclusion, we join the many courts that have likewise held that a grievant does not have standing to challenge the disciplinary authority's disposition of a grievance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Request for Investigation of an Atty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816845\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/1013/\">\n    449 Mass. 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=867%20N.E.2d%20323\">\n    867 N.E.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324-25 (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    Rousseau v.

We agree with those courts that have reasoned that to confer standing upon a private individual in these circumstances would shift the focus of the disciplinary process from the public interest to the private interests of the grievant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Akinaka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263109\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/91/51/\">\n    979 P.2d at 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To do so would contravene the essential purpose of the attorney discipline system-to protect the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, because the petitioners lack standing to appeal the disposition of their grievance, we dismiss their petition for a writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See Libertarian Party of N.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141603\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/158/194/#p195\">\n    158 N.H. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=965%20A.2d%201078\">\n    965 A.2d 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Dismissed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
