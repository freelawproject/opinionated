We find none of these claims persuasive and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the court in its memorandum of decision, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties were married on February 11, 1994. At the time their marriage was dissolved, which occurred by judgment of the court more than twenty-one years later on June 25, 2015, both parties were sixty-five years old. Throughout the marriage, the plaintiff earned a modest income as a self-employed typist and bookkeeper, with her \"best\" year occurring prior to the marriage, in 1992, when she earned approximately $30,000. She retired in 2013, and during her last three years of employment earned an income that was in \"the teens.\" At the time of dissolution, the plaintiff received $241.38 per week in social security benefits and $400 per week in pendente lite alimony. As a result of spinal fusion surgery she had undergone in October of 2012 that did not heal properly, the plaintiff experienced pain in her hands and arms. The plaintiff also was diagnosed\n   with recurring \"panic attacks\" in 1996, and takes a multitude of prescription medications to manage the panic attacks and her pain. The defendant was employed as an engineer at the time of dissolution and earned a net income of $1462 per week. He was in good health and desired to retire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant owned the marital home, located at 580 Hopewell Road in South Glastonbury, prior to the marriage. While the plaintiff and the defendant did not have children, the plaintiff was the primary caregiver for an assortment of family members who came to reside in the marital home, some of whom were more than ninety years old and required constant care. At some point during the marriage, the plaintiff's daughter and her two children began residing in the marital home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1996, the parties constructed a substantial addition to the marital home in order to accommodate the plaintiff's mother. The plaintiff's mother paid for the renovations, which cost $212,000 and added an 850 square foot apartment and bedroom suite to the home. The value of the marital home, which was owned exclusively by the defendant, significantly appreciated as a result of the construction financed by the plaintiff's mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to her role as caregiver, the plaintiff handled the family's finances. She paid the bills, handled some of the investments, and prepared federal and state tax filings. The defendant was unemployed for a period of time in the mid to late 1990s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the defendant\n   was unemployed, the plaintiff's mother contributed her social security benefits plus an additional $70 per month to pay for the family's household expenses. The defendant began day trading in 1999, and financed the endeavor with $175,000 in credit card debt and by taking out a line of credit on the marital home. He lost the entire $175,000. The plaintiff and the defendant repaid the $175,000 debt over the course of nine years, in part with a $66,000 contribution from the plaintiff's mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over time, the marriage began to deteriorate. The defendant lived a \"very structured\" and \"routine based\" life, which took its toll on the plaintiff. The defendant also was generally unsupportive of the plaintiff. In 2013, the plaintiff disclosed to the defendant that she had been sexually abused as a child, to which the defendant \"had no real response\" and \"was indifferent.\" After the plaintiff's spinal surgery in 2012, the defendant was \"shocked\" that the plaintiff had decided to retire and that she had hired a maid to help clean the marital home. Following two physical altercations between the parties in late-2012 and mid-2013, the plaintiff resolved to leave the marriage. In both incidents, the defendant grabbed and pulled the plaintiff's wrists and hands, which, due to her surgery, caused her severe pain. On March 18, 2014, after surreptitiously purchasing a home at 15 Briarwood Road in West Hartford, the plaintiff informed the defendant that she was leaving him. The\n   plaintiff commenced this dissolution action on June 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 25, 2015, following a two day trial, the court entered judgment dissolving the marriage on the ground of irretrievable breakdown, finding that the breakdown was primarily the fault of the defendant. As to the approximate value of the plaintiff's assets at the time of dissolution, the court found that her West Hartford home was valued at $232,500 and that she had bank accounts totaling $14,700, a bond in the amount of $8000, and $334,111 in retirement assets. With respect to the defendant's assets, the court found that his Glastonbury residence, to which the plaintiff did not make any claim in the dissolution proceeding, had an approximate value of $654,200.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant also had $277,000 in a checking account and approximately $653,365 in retirement assets, including a 401 (K) plan valued at $375,153 and an individual retirement account (IRA) valued at $22,270. In its financial orders, the court awarded the plaintiff lump sum alimony in the amount of $100,000, payable in four $25,000 installments, and further ordered the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff all sums in his 401 (K) plan and IRA, which totaled $397,423. The court declined to award periodic alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 24, 2015, the defendant filed a \"motion to reargue/reconsider\" and a motion for a mistrial. The court denied both motions. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth where necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that the court was biased against him, and in favor of the plaintiff, on the\n   basis of his gender and status as a self-represented party. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As an initial matter, the defendant has failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 1-23, which provides in relevant part that \"[a] motion to disqualify a judicial authority shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the facts relied upon to show the grounds for disqualification and a certificate of the counsel of record that the motion is made in good faith.\" This court has held that \u00a7 1-23\"creates a mandatory procedure to be followed by any party seeking to recuse a judge ... and, if a party fails to follow\n   such procedures, the record is deemed to be inadequate for our review because [the procedures] are a condition precedent to a hearing on a judge's disqualification.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1272482\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/71/826/#p830\">\n    71 Conn.App. 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=804%20A.2d%20851\">\n    804 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Despite raising the issue of judicial bias at several junctures during trial, the defendant never filed a written motion to disqualify the court in accordance with \u00a7 1-23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the defendant has not provided us with an adequate record to review this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While that procedural deficiency is reason enough to reject the defendant's claim, given the grave nature of his accusation, we, as this court did in\n   <em>\n    Wendt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wendt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1047962\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/59/656/#p693\">\n    59 Conn.App. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%201225\">\n    757 A.2d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120065\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/918/\">\n    255 Conn. 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=763%20A.2d%201044\">\n    763 A.2d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), address the substance of the claim. \"The standard to be employed when determining whether a judge should recuse herself or\n   himself pursuant to canon 3 (c) [of the Code of Judicial Conduct] is well established. The standard ... is an objective one [meant to assess] whether [the judge] can be fair and impartial in hearing the case. ... Any conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge's disqualification. Thus, an impropriety or the appearance of impropriety ... that would reasonably lead one to question the judge's impartiality in a given proceeding clearly falls within the scope of the general standard. ... The question is not whether the judge is impartial in fact. It is simply whether another, not knowing whether or not the judge is actually impartial, might reasonably question [the judge's] ... impartiality, on the basis of all of the circumstances.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cosley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058883\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/110/283/#p291\">\n    110 Conn.App. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20A.2d%20550\">\n    955 A.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant has not offered a scintilla of evidence to support his claim of judicial bias. Instead, the defendant simply asserts that he is a male, self-represented party, that the court was female, and that the court entered financial and other orders and made credibility determinations with which he does not agree. Our common law and statutory law have always authorized a single Superior Court judge to preside over the trial of marriage dissolution cases. Some marriages in our state, like the defendant's, are contracted between persons of the opposite sex. In such situations, the mere fact that the trial judge is of the same sex as one of the parties is not evidence of bias against the other. The mere fact that a trial judge is of a sex different from one of the litigants could not lead a reasonable person to question the judge's impartiality. Our careful review of the record and the defendant's brief does not point to any predisposition on the part of the court against persons who appear in court on their own behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 13, 2015, the first day of trial, the defendant sought to renew a recusal motion made before Judge Albis, a prior judge in the case who presided over the defendant's motion to disqualify Judge Simon and Judge Bozzuto. Judge Ficeto permitted him to do so. The defendant argued to Judge Ficeto: \"For my part I feel in general,\n   <em>\n    I've never met you\n   </em>\n   ,\n   but I feel in general [that the] trial court is bias[ed] against self-represented male parties. I consider it the slaughterhouse ....\" (Emphasis added.) This statement demonstrates that the defendant's claim of judicial bias is based upon the perceived conduct of other judges who presided over earlier proceedings in the case, rather than on Judge Ficeto's conduct. Such generalized concerns would not lead a reasonable person to question the court's impartiality to those of a different sex who appear before it on their own behalf without the benefit of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendant fares no better with respect to his assertion that the court demonstrated judicial bias by awarding alimony and distributing the marital property in a manner that was adverse to him. When the defendant moved to disqualify the court prior to the start of the second day of trial on May 14, 2015, the court had not yet issued any orders that were adverse to the defendant. The simple fact that, at the conclusion of the trial, the court declined to issue financial orders that were more favorable to the defendant does not evidence judicial bias or prejudice against the defendant.

The court's several other rulings and credibility determinations that the defendant disagrees with likewise do not evidence judicial bias. \"It is an elementary rule of law that the fact that a trial court rules adversely to a litigant, even\n   if some of these rulings were to be determined on appeal to have been erroneous, does not demonstrate personal bias.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wendt\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wendt\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1047962\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/59/656/#p693\">\n    59 Conn.App. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%201225\">\n    757 A.2d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Obviously, if a ruling against a party could be used as ... indicia of bias, at least half of the time, every court would be guilty of being biased against one of the two parties. ...

Put simply, in situations in which the court is acting as the fact finder and there is conflicting evidence as to an issue of fact, the court is charged with evaluating and determining which evidence is more credible, and the mere fact that the court makes such a finding in favor of one party does not form the basis for a challenge to the court's impartiality by the other.

Appellate review of a trial court's findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review.

It is well established, however, \"that the evaluation of a witness' testimony and credibility are wholly within the province of the trier of fact. ... Credibility must be assessed ... not by reading the cold printed record, but by observing firsthand the witness' conduct,\n   demeanor and attitude. ...

In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that it fashioned the alimony award on the basis of all of the evidence admitted at trial and the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 46b-82. In particular, the court noted the parties' lengthy twenty-one year marriage; the fact that the defendant was college educated and healthy whereas the plaintiff was retired from the workforce and was hindered by her anxiety and complications from spinal surgery; and the defendant's relatively steady employment throughout the marriage compared with the modest income earned by the plaintiff. The court also indicated that, while it was inclined to award periodic alimony to the plaintiff, lump sum alimony better accommodated the defendant's desire to retire because \"[l]ump sum alimony, unlike periodic alimony, is a final judgment which cannot be modified even should there be a substantial change in circumstances.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Tremaine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tremaine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"389353\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/235/45/#p58\">\n    235 Conn. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58-59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%20387\">\n    663 A.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). In light of this analysis, we conclude that the court's alimony\n   award was properly based upon an application of the statutory guidelines to the facts of the case.

In support of this argument, the defendant cites the multitude of spreadsheets and documents that he prepared and that were admitted into evidence at trial. In its memorandum of decision, however, the court indicated that it\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   considered the spreadsheets and related evidence but that the defendant's \"argument [was] without merit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court did not disregard the spreadsheets;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   it simply found that they did not persuasively support the defendant's argument that the plaintiff had hidden marital assets. \"It is axiomatic that [t]he trier [of fact] is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the evidence offered by either party.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1272482\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/71/826/#p830\">\n    71 Conn.App. at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=804%20A.2d%20851\">\n    804 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At trial, the plaintiff testified that she had never hidden, and was not currently hiding, any marital property. Although, in the defendant's view, his spreadsheets disproved that testimony, it is unclear from the spreadsheets and the defendant's testimony in connection with them precisely how the defendant arrived at his conclusion that $1.3 million in marital assets were unaccounted for. In particular, the spreadsheets do not appear to account for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the expenses incurred by the plaintiff over the parties' twenty-one year marriage, which could substantially alter the defendant's computation of \"missing\" assets. Accordingly, the court was well within its discretion in rejecting the defendant's spreadsheets as unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We are also not persuaded that the court abused its discretion in distributing the marital property. The distribution of assets in a dissolution action is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81, which provides in pertinent part that a trial court \"may assign to either spouse all or any part of the estate of the other spouse.\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (a). \"In fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court, after considering all the evidence presented by each party, shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the ... dissolution of the marriage ... the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, earning capacity, vocational skills, education, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each\n   of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court shall also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c). \"Courts are not required to ritualistically recite the criteria they considered, nor are they bound to any specific formula respecting the weight to be accorded each factor in determining the distribution of marital assets.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5650664\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/93/809/#p812\">\n    93 Conn.App. 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=890%20A.2d%20581\">\n    890 A.2d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, the court ordered both parties to retain ownership over the marital assets in their respective possessions, except that the defendant was ordered to transfer $397,423 of his $653,365 in retirement assets to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree that this order constituted an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court emphasized in its memorandum of decision that its distribution of the marital property was based upon the factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-81. We note that the court permitted the defendant to retain ownership of the marital home, the value of which, the court found, had been significantly enhanced by a $212,000 addition financed by the plaintiff's mother. The court further found that the defendant was primarily at fault for the breakdown of the marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, in issuing the alimony award, the court noted\n   the length of the marriage and the plaintiff's retirement from the workforce, modest employment throughout the marriage, and diminished physical condition, all of which support the conclusion that the plaintiff's earning capacity at the time of dissolution was significantly less than that of the defendant, who remained in good health and was employed as an engineer. The court's consideration of those factors in awarding alimony, which apply with equal force to the asset distribution calculus, in combination with its other factual findings, convinces us that the court adequately considered and weighed the factors set forth in \u00a7 46b-81, and, thus, did not abuse its discretion in transferring a portion of the defendant's retirement assets to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court improperly refused to order the plaintiff to provide him with periodic updates regarding the well-being of the plaintiff's grandchildren. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the defendant's proposed orders, the defendant sought an order requiring the plaintiff to \"have [her grandchildren] send a short note to [the] [d]efendant telling [the defendant] how they are doing,\" or, in the alternative, requiring the plaintiff to send the defendant a monthly \"e-mail or letter ... with any updates on them.\" The court denied the request in its memorandum of decision, noting the lack of evidence at trial regarding the age of the plaintiff's grandchildren, their relationship to the defendant or whether their parents consented to their continued contact with the defendant. The court also observed that the plaintiff was not the custodian of the grandchildren and thus lacked authority to compel them to write the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We live in an age where many families are blended and where children of one spouse may not be children of the other. The marriage of the plaintiff and defendant\n   was one in which the plaintiff's grandchildren were not the blood descendants of the defendant. The defendant has expressed an abiding, avuncular concern and affection in his briefs and at oral argument before this court for the plaintiff's grandchildren, who lived with the parties in the marital home for a period of time during the marriage. The defendant believes his relationship with the grandchildren should not end simply because his marriage with the plaintiff ended in divorce. We do not denigrate the importance that the defendant places on this issue. We conclude, however, that the court did not err in concluding that the plaintiff was not\n   the custodian of her grandchildren and, thus, that the plaintiff lacked authority to compel her grandchildren to continue contacting the defendant, or to provide the defendant with periodic updates concerning the well-being of her grandchildren.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The United States Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Granville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    530 U.S. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution \"does not permit a [s]tate to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a 'better' decision could be made.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    Id., at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   arose out of a situation in which grandparents were denied continued contact and visitation with their grandchildren following the death of one of their grandchildren's parents.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    Id., at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
