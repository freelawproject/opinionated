Respondents, Dr. Mark Geier (\"Dr. Geier\"), David Geier (\"Mr. Geier\") and Anne Geier (\"Ms. Geier\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint against Petitioners\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"), in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, alleging that Petitioners invaded their privacy by publicizing their private medical information in a cease and desist order that was issued during disciplinary proceedings brought by Petitioners against Dr. Geier and Mr. Geier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   During discovery, the circuit court entered three separate orders that: (1) granted Respondents' sixth motion for sanctions against Petitioners regarding the disclosure of audiotapes\n   of Petitioners' deliberations; (2) denied Petitioners' motion for reconsideration of a default order on liability for a series of discovery failures; and (3) denied Petitioners' motion for a protective order from Respondents' sixth motion to compel documents, which required Petitioners to disclose their personal financial information to Respondents. Petitioners appealed all three interlocutory orders, and this Court granted certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we grant Respondents' motion to dismiss as it relates to the orders denying Petitioners' motions for reconsideration and for a protective order; deny Respondents' motion to dismiss as it relates to the order granting Respondents' sixth motion for sanctions; reverse and vacate the order granting Respondents' sixth motion for sanctions; and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Board's Administrative Proceedings Against Respondents Mark R. Geier and David Geier\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Mark Geier\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 3, 2006, the Board notified Dr. Geier that it had received a complaint against him regarding his use of the drug Lupron\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to treat autistic children. The complaint alleged that Dr. Geier was: (1) practicing outside of the scope of his expertise\n   and the prevailing standard of care for autism ; (2) experimenting on children without a rational scientific theory or the supervision of a qualified review board; and (3) failing\n   to provide appropriate informed consent regarding the potential side effects of Lupron and similar drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 27, 2011, the Board summarily suspended Dr. Geier's right to practice medicine, asserting that the \"public health, safety or welfare imperatively required emergency action\" due to certain medical practices engaged in by Dr. Geier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 16, 2011, the Board formally charged Dr. Geier with violations of the Medical Practice Act, Md. Code (Repl. Vol. 2014), \u00a7\u00a7 14-401\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   of the Health Occupations Article (\"Health Occ.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 15, 2011 the Board issued amended charges against Dr. Geier for prescribing medicine to family members while his license was suspended. After amending its complaint, the Board charged Dr. Geier with: (1) unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; (2) willfully making or filing a false report or record in the practice of medicine; (3) willfully failing to file or record any medical record as required under law; (4) practicing medicine with an unauthorized person or aiding an unauthorized person in the practice of medicine; (5) gross overutilization of health care services; (6) failing to meet standards, as determined by peer review, for the delivery of quality medical care; and (7) failing to keep adequate medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 26, 2011, after six days of hearings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") issued a proposed decision upholding the summary suspension of Dr. Geier's license. On\n   March 13, 2012, following an additional five days of hearings, the ALJ issued a 126-page proposed decision, recommending that the charges against Dr. Geier be upheld,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that his license be revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Geier took exception to the ALJ's findings, but on August 22, 2012, the Board issued a final decision revoking his license. Dr. Geier petitioned for judicial review, and the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed the Board's revocation on April 9, 2014. Dr. Geier moved to alter or amend the court's ruling, but the motion was denied. Dr. Geier then noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and that Court, in a reported opinion, affirmed the Board's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geier v. Md. State Bd.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    f Physicians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260421\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/223/404/\">\n    223 Md.App. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260421\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/223/404/\">\n    116 A.3d 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    b. David Geier\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 16, 2011, the Board also charged Dr. Geier's son, Mr. Geier, for practicing medicine without a license in violation of Health Occ. \u00a7 14-601.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   March 7, 2012, an ALJ recommended that the charges against Mr. Geier be dismissed. On July 30, 2012, however, the Board rejected the ALJ's recommendation and many of the judge's findings, concluding that Mr. Geier had practiced medicine without a license because he diagnosed a patient, determined which blood tests the patient required, and ordered those tests. The Board imposed a $10,000 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Geier petitioned the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for judicial review of the Board's findings, and the circuit court affirmed the Board's decision on April 25, 2014. Mr. Geier then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and that Court, in an unreported opinion dated July 31, 2015, also affirmed the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Disclosure of the Respondents Personal Medical Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 25, 2012, during the pendency of both disciplinary proceedings, the Board issued a cease and desist order against Dr. Geier, accusing him of practicing medicine while his license had been summarily suspended. The order, posted to the Board's website and viewable by the public, specifically alleged that Dr. Geier had written prescriptions for all three Respondents. The order also detailed the Respondents' confidential medical information, identified the specific medications that Dr. Geier allegedly prescribed to each person, and described the medical conditions that each medication treated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioners promptly removed the confidential information from the cease and desist order in response to Respondents' protest. Petitioners also issued an amended cease and desist order that deleted the references to the patients and the medications that Dr. Geier allegedly prescribed for them. In the interim between the initial publication and the Petitioners' remedial actions, other persons viewed and commented about the Respondents' confidential medical information, and those comments are still accessible on the internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ultimately, an ALJ rejected the charge that Dr. Geier had written any prescriptions in violation of the summary suspension order issued by Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Respondents' Civil Action Against Petitioners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 12, 2012, while Dr. Geier and Mr. Geier were pursuing judicial review of the Board's adverse rulings, Respondents filed a three-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Petitioners. The complaint alleged that by publicizing the January 25th cease and desist\n   order that contained the Respondents' confidential medical information, Petitioners deprived them of their constitutional right to privacy; violated the Maryland Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, Md. Code (1982, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 4-301\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   of the Health General Article ; and invaded their privacy by giving unreasonable publicity to private facts. The complaint also alleged that Petitioners \"acted with ill will and with the intent to injure [Respondents] by exposing Dr. Geier's personal medical information and that of his wife and son.\" Respondents requested compensatory damages, as well as three million dollars in punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, asserting they had absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit under\n   <em>\n    Ostrzenski v. Se\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    gel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727184\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/177/245/\">\n    177 F.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1999). Following a hearing on July 10, 2013, the circuit court dismissed the Confidentiality of Medical Records Act claim, finding that the statute did not create a private cause of action. The circuit court allowed the constitutional and invasion of privacy claims to proceed, finding that the record was inadequate to evaluate the applicability of any immunities at such an early stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following the circuit court's ruling that allowed two of Respondents' claims to proceed, Respondents sought extensive discovery, attempting to uncover evidence demonstrating Petitioners acted out of animosity in publishing the cease and desist letter. Respondents sought information regarding the specific circumstances immediately surrounding the Petitioners' disclosure of their confidential medical information, as well as documents and testimony that revealed Petitioners' decisional process in the administrative proceedings against them. Respondents also sought communications between Petitioners and their counsel that related to these proceedings. Following an unsatisfactory response to discovery requests, Respondents filed multiple motions to compel and motions for discovery sanctions against Petitioners between the months of\n   November 2013 and February 2016, which led to numerous hearings in the circuit court, and concurrent interlocutory appeals by Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Of import to the issues before this Court are the events that occurred during and after Petitioners' filed their first interlocutory appeal from the circuit court's June 17, 2014 discovery order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 15, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents filed their fifth motion for sanctions seeking a default judgment as to liability, alleging primarily that Petitioners failed to produce an adequately prepared organizational representative noted as a prepared designee for a 167-topic deposition. Respondents subsequently requested a hearing regarding the fifth motion for sanctions. Also on August 15th, the Court of Special Appeals issued an order staying all discovery in the circuit court pending the outcome of the first interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In opposition to Respondents' fifth motion for sanctions, Petitioners alleged that most of the deposition topics covered information in Respondents' possession or were not discoverable because they involved issues pending on appeal. Petitioners also noted they appealed the circuit court's June 17th discovery order denying Petitioners assertions of various privileges, and that Petitioners \"should not be sanctioned for\n   declining to allow these protections and privileges to be eviscerated in\n   other discovery proceedings\" and allowing Respondents to \"frustrate the appellate court's ability to provide meaningful relief in its resolution\" of the issues before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following a hearing on November 13, 2014, the circuit court granted Respondents' fifth motion for sanctions. On December 16, 2014, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion that detailed Petitioners' culpable conduct during discovery, and thereafter, entered a default judgment of liability against Petitioners. The circuit court noted that a trial on damages would be scheduled after Petitioners' first interlocutory appeal had been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 24, 2014, Petitioners noted a second interlocutory appeal based on the circuit court's default judgment, which the Court of Special Appeals consolidated with Petitioners' initial appeal filed on June 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Md. Bd. Of Physicians v. Geier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    225 Md.App. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Court of Special Appeals' Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals first held that neither order appealed by Petitioners constituted a final judgment. The Court concluded that the collateral order doctrine applied to the June 17th discovery order, allowing the Court to hear Petitioners' claims regarding that discovery order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    225 Md.App. at 129-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at 610-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The collateral order doctrine did not apply to the December 16th order of default on liability, corresponding to Respondents' fifth motion for sanctions, because the Court concluded that the issues that order addressed were not \"collateral\" to the merits of the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    at 139-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at 616-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In considering the merits of Petitioners' claims regarding the June 17th order, the Court held that under Health Occ. \u00a7 14-410\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. John L. Young's (\"Dr. Young\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   disciplinary\n   files were not discoverable by Respondents. The Court noted that, under Health Occ. \u00a7 14-410, both the Board and Dr. Young had to expressly consent to the discoverability of Dr. Young's proceedings as parties to the action. Because the Board objected to releasing Dr. Young's proceedings, they were not discoverable by Respondents in the present action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    at 144-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at 619-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also concluded that the circuit court erred in rejecting Petitioners' claim of executive privilege, because it failed to expressly balance Petitioners' need for confidentiality against Respondents' need for disclosure, and the impact of nondisclosure on a fair administration of justice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    at 147-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at 621-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court considered the merits of Petitioners' claims regarding the allegedly privileged communications between the Board and Joshua Shafer, an investigator for the Board. Although the Court noted that generally an appellate court does not have jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal from a discovery ruling that rejects a claim of attorney-client\n   privilege, the Court still considered the merits because it formed a part of a ruling that the Court had jurisdiction to review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   624 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kurstin v.

The Court concluded that the circuit court erred in rejecting Petitioners' claim of privilege on the ground that the Guidelines rendered Shafer a \"stranger\" to the attorney-client relationship\n   between the Board and its attorneys.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The Post-Remand Proceeding in the Circuit Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On remand, Respondents sought a hearing on their sixth motion for sanctions filed on August 8, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   involving Petitioners' audio recordings on internal deliberations regarding Dr. Geier's and Mr. Geier's disciplinary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On November 5, 2014, Respondents served their sixth request for production of documents, seeking a variety of financial information from Petitioners, which prompted Petitioners to pursue a protective order, based in substantial part, on their claim of absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On December 28, 2015, Petitioners also filed a motion for reconsideration of the default liability order and for summary judgment in Petitioners' favor. Petitioners asserted that in the order of default on liability, the circuit court found the Board, but not the individual Petitioners, had engaged in discovery violations. Petitioners also argued that the Court of Special Appeals narrowed the scope of what discovery should be permitted. Respondents disagreed, and on February 10, 2016, filed a seventh motion for sanctions alleging that Petitioners' motion for a protective order raising the immunity defense was in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On March 24, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing on the parties' respective motions, and subsequently denied Petitioners' motion for summary judgment, motion for reconsideration on the default judgment of liability, and motion for a protective order from Respondents' sixth request for documents. The circuit court found that the General Assembly had enacted a detailed statutory scheme addressing Petitioners' immunity\n   from suit in 1976 that has not been repealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court concluded that because the statutory scheme remains in effect, Petitioners' claim of a common law absolute quasi-judicial immunity claim did not apply. On that basis, the circuit court denied Petitioners' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The circuit court also denied Petitioners' motion for reconsideration because the circuit court found that, even under the Court of Special Appeals' mandate, Petitioners failed to provide specific evidence that their deponent was responsive, sufficient for the circuit court to reverse its order. The circuit court also noted that, even after adhering to the Court of Special\n   Appeals' mandate, Petitioners' conduct remained \"abysmal, abominable, [and] sanctionable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the circuit court granted Respondents' sixth motion for sanctions. The circuit court found that Petitioners did not assert any privilege in their initial responses to Respondents' requests for the audiotapes, and the tapes were not included on Petitioners' privilege logs, so the assertion of privilege was waived. The circuit court also ordered that all of Respondents' outstanding discovery requests were due by April 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On April 1, 2016, Petitioners noted an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, seeking review of the circuit court's March 24th orders denying their motions for reconsideration and request for a protective order, and granting Respondents' sixth motion for sanctions.

Respondents are seeking to obtain discovery that delves into the Board's decision making process.

First, the circuit court's order conclusively determined that Petitioners must disclose their pre-decisional deliberations by submitting the audiotapes\n   to Respondents by April\n   22, 2016. Second, like in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Patuxent Valley\n   </em>\n   , this issue is important because of the \"potentially great harm to the public by the 'disruption of the governmental process' that can be caused by discovery into the decision making process [ ]\" of a high level executive decision maker.\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995346\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/471/#p477\">\n    337 Md. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995346\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/337/471/#p477\">\n    654 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   881 ;\n   <em>\n    Patuxent Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979936\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/200/#p207\">\n    300 Md. at 206-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=477%20A.2d%20759\">\n    477 A.2d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the issue in this case concerning Petitioners' deliberative process (executive) privilege is distinct from the merits of Respondents' action seeking damages for an alleged invasion of their privacy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ehrlich\n   </em>\n   , 396 Md. at 572,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517694\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/396/550/#p560\">\n    914 A.2d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"the propriety of a potential intrusion on [executive] privilege[ ] has nothing to do with the merits of [the plaintiff's] wrongful termination claim.\"). Fourth, the discovery order will be effectively unreviewable on an appeal from a final judgment because the privilege's protection would be irretrievably lost once Respondents' gain access to the individual decisional thought processes of the Petitioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patuxent Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1979936\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/300/200/#p207\">\n    300 Md. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=477%20A.2d%20759\">\n    477 A.2d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, as this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Patuxent Valley\n   </em>\n   , \"[r]egardless of the outcome of the trial, the disruption to the administrative process, caused by placing the officials under pretrial scrutiny, is incurred at the first instance. ...

Orders Denying Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration as to Default Liability and Motion for Protective Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The circuit court's order denying Petitioners' motions for reconsideration and for a protective order are not immediately appealable to this Court. While we may have jurisdiction over one interlocutory order under the collateral order doctrine,\n   it does not give us the authority to consider other interlocutory orders that are not independently appealable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Petitioners conceded before the Court of Special Appeals that a party cannot immediately appeal from an order of default on liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    225 Md.App. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360779\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/114/\">\n    123 A.3d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Petitioners advance the same argument to this Court-that because we have standing to hear their appeal regarding the denial of their executive privilege, this Court has supplementary standing to consider their claims regarding the denial of their quasi-judicial immunity in the orders denying their motions for reconsideration and for a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As the Court of Special Appeals noted, Maryland Rule 8-131(d) states that \"[o]n appeal\n   <em>\n    from a final judgment\n   </em>\n   , an interlocutory order\n   <em>\n    previously\n   </em>\n   entered in the action is open to review by the Court unless an appeal has previously been taken from that order and decided on the merits by the Court.\" (emphasis added). As Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr. observed in\n   <em>\n    Banashak v. Wittstadt\n   </em>\n   ,\"[t]here is scant authority on the question of appellate piggybacking[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1057385\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/167/627/#p670\">\n    167 Md.App. 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1057385\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/167/627/#p670\">\n    893 A.2d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1261 (2006). We have not precisely addressed the issue of whether an order that is appealable as a final judgment allows other orders, otherwise not appealable, to be heard by an appellate court. As Judge Moylan noted, the Court of Special Appeals has repeatedly held that \"the appealability of each separate issue must be\n   analyzed in a vacuum and that there are no two-for-the-price-of-one bargains on the appellate docket.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1057385\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/167/627/#p670\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1057385\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/167/627/#p670\">\n    at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1057385\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/167/627/#p670\">\n    893 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1261 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

But the Court will remember that we asked for basically documents reflecting communications among the Board, Board members about the [Respondents]. That was the seventh request set out in the first set of document requests that was served on the [Petitioners] on August 1, 2013. That matter went to hearing. The Court took up the objections that were asserted by the defendants in November of 2013 and ruled essentially that the document responses should be produced, especially the request we're concerned about here in No. 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [RESPONDENTS' COUNSEL]: Somewhat fortuitously, on a couple of other occasions we sent out document requests, notably the third and fifth request, that also contained requests that would have consumed and brought to the [Petitioners'] attention these audiotapes where they record your deliberations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   [RESPONDENTS' COUNSEL]: There was no objection asserted based on deliberate privilege in response to Request No. 7 way back in September of 2013. The Court ordered them to produce responsive documents, and we got some documents eventually by, by June of 2014. I got a call from Mr. [Gozdor] telling me I finally had all the documents responsive to our August 2013 request, but it wasn't until we took Ms. Hurley's deposition in July of 2014 that we found out about the audio tapes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   And so it was, it came to our surprise to learn that these tapes recorded deliberations where the Geiers were discussed. We asked for those immediately, moved for sanctions. That motion got filed in August 2014. And then because of the pendency of the interlocutory appeal, we, this was never heard. But it's a pretty simple issue. The, any objection that may have been asserted about those tapes is waived. There was no objection. These tapes were hidden and, by the way, it's important to know that after I found out about the existence of the tapes, I began to ask individual Board members at their depositions, did you know about the tapes? I knew about the tapes. Invariably, they knew about the tapes. It's just no one went to get the tapes to produce them in response to our 1-year-old discovery. And so that's the basis for the sixth motion for sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   THE COURT: Thank you, sir.

First, the circuit court concluded Petitioners did not raise the deliberative process (executive) privilege over the audiotapes in their response to Respondents' First Request for Production of Documents, No. 7. The record indicates that, although Petitioners did not raise the deliberative process (executive) privilege specifically over the audiotapes, they did assert in their response to Request No. 7 that \"the communications are also being withheld from [Respondents] pursuant to the deliberative privilege since disclosing them would reveal [Petitioners] deliberative, predecisional thoughts.\" That assertion of the deliberative process (executive) privilege was denied by the circuit court on November 25, 2013 after the court analyzed the parties' claims pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. Verdow\n   </em>\n   balancing test,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Respondents argue that because Petitioners did not include the audiotapes in their response to Request No. 7 and did not produce the audiotapes after the First Motion to Compel was granted on November 25th, the assertion of privilege over the tapes was waived and Petitioners' should be sanctioned for failing to comply with the November 25th discovery order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   This view ignores evidence in the record indicating that the existence of the audiotapes was not discovered until July 29, 2014 when Christine Farrelly testified, during her organizational deposition, that the confidential Board proceedings were recorded. Absent evidence to the contrary, Petitioners could not have raised the deliberative (executive) process privilege over the audiotapes prior to the discovery of their existence in July 2014, and therefore,\n   no abuse of discovery for failing to assert the deliberative process (executive) privilege or produce the audiotapes could have occurred prior to July 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Second, the circuit court acknowledged the possibility the audiotapes were not discovered until after the First Request for Production of Documents was served in August 2013, but concluded that Petitioners failed to timely assert the deliberative process (executive) privilege upon the discovery of the audiotapes. Petitioners argued that they did timely assert the deliberative process (executive) privilege over the audiotapes in their Opposition to Respondents' Sixth Motion for Sanctions, which was filed on August 22, 2014. The circuit court held that Petitioners' assertion of the deliberative process (executive) privilege in an opposition to sanctions was improper, and because Petitioners did not assert their privilege in a specific discovery response, the issue was waived. The circuit court did not cite any support for its conclusion that the assertion of a privilege in an opposition to a motion for sanctions is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Maryland Rule 2-402 governs the scope of discovery and explains the process for asserting a privilege against a discovery request.

Thus, the trial court was well within its rights to find a waiver of the privilege, order the production of the audio recordings, and impose a sanction on the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Majority resurrects the deliberative process privilege waived by Petitioners, both ignoring the abuse of discretion standard of review for discovery decisions and creating a new rule that merges orders for production with orders for sanctions after a failure to produce. The Majority holds, with no cited authority, that \"[a]n order granting discovery sanctions qualifies as a 'discovery order' for the purposes of determining the appealability of an order denying executive privilege under the collateral order doctrine.\" Maj. Op. at 547-48,\n   154 A.3d at 1223. In so holding, the Majority disregards-\n   <strong>\n    and tells government litigants to disregard\n   </strong>\n   -the Rule 2-422 requirements for identifying specifically which parts of a discovery request are sheltered from discovery and for what reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   We have recognized that when a government is a party to litigation, \"a question of unfair litigation advantage may arise.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. Verdow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2089266\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/287/544/\">\n    287 Md. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20A.2d%20914\">\n    414 A.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). Here, rather than protecting against such unfair advantage, the Majority leans the opposite way, sending the message that a governmental party may, with impunity, ignore discovery requests for months at a time and wait until the eleventh hour to identify what items fall within its claimed privilege. The Board did exactly that, and the Majority enables its behavior by permitting this interlocutory appeal, and then overturning the trial court's discretionary determination that Petitioners had waived the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Board's conduct at issue on this appeal is merely one example of their discovery abuses. In December 2014, the trial court described the Board's foot-dragging thus far, saying: \"The deadlines in this case have been moved repeatedly because of discovery problems, due to the conduct of the Board and its inability, or in some cases outright\n   <strong>\n    refusal, to produce documents or accurate privilege logs in a timely fashion\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) It concluded that the Board delayed document production for seven months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   an order that it do so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   To say that discovery in this case has not proceeded smoothly would be an understatement. [Respondents'] first motion for sanctions, which the court granted, was the result of the Board's production of fourteen boxes of documents many months after the court ordered their production on November 25, 2013. Although the original request for production was issued on August 1, 2013, the Board did not make its final production of responsive documents until June 2, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   It also found that the Board's designated representative \"fail[ed] to appear for a properly noticed organizational deposition,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   and that, on a rescheduled date, she was present but entirely unprepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   What is at stake here is more than a meaningless discovery slug-fest. The audio recordings in question are highly relevant to Respondents' claim for invasion of privacy. In order to prevail, they must show malice to defeat the immunity given to the Board members and their agents by statute. Md. Code (1990, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-715(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The internet publication of highly sensitive medical information about a physician and his family is sufficiently unusual and unnecessary that one might\n   wonder why a professional oversight agency did not know better. What went on behind the scenes of the decision to publish is exactly what Respondents need to know. If they are denied this information they are severely hampered in pursuit of their claim. If the audio recordings are protected by a valid deliberative process privilege, then Petitioners should have identified them specifically, and claimed the privilege on a timely basis. It is not up to this Court to protect the Board and its members from their discovery abuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Concurring and Dissenting Opinion by McDonald, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   I agree with the Majority opinion to the extent that it addresses the merits of this appeal. I would, however, go farther and address the question of immunity.
