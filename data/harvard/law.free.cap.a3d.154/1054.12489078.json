Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we conclude that the habeas court properly granted the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth by this court in the petitioner's direct criminal appeal, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. \"On June 24, 2003, the [teenage] complainant was alone inside her parents' home in the town of Fairfield. At approximately 4 p.m., the [petitioner] approached the front door and rang the doorbell. The complainant answered the door, and the [petitioner] informed her that he was selling magazine subscriptions to earn money for college. The [petitioner] asked the complainant to look at a brochure to determine if she was interested in purchasing any of the magazines. The complainant informed the [petitioner] that she could not purchase anything because her parents were not home. She recommended that he return sometime around 6 p.m. when her parents would be home from work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The [petitioner] asked the complainant if he could use the bathroom. The complainant hesitated. The [petitioner] explained that he really had to use the bathroom. Without invitation, the [petitioner] brushed by the complainant, who was standing in the doorway, and walked straight down the hallway of the foyer toward the bathroom located off the kitchen. The [petitioner] remained in the bathroom for approximately thirty seconds. When he emerged from the bathroom, the [petitioner] walked slowly toward the complainant. While the [petitioner] was in the bathroom, the complainant did not hear\n   the bathroom door shut or the water running from the bathroom plumbing. The complainant remained near the front doorway while the [petitioner] was in the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The [petitioner], again, asked the complainant to look at the magazine brochure. The complainant briefly looked at the brochure, handed it back to the [petitioner] and told him that she had not heard of any of the magazines on the list. The [petitioner] took the brochure, walked toward the [front] door and closed [it]. Placing his\n   hand in the rear pocket of his trousers, the [petitioner] told the complainant that he had a gun and ordered her to sit on a couch in the den adjacent to the foyer. The complainant entered the den and sat on the couch closest to the foyer. The [petitioner] asked her what time her parents would arrive home. Though the complainant had told him earlier that her parents would be home at approximately 6 p.m., this time she told the [petitioner] that they would arrive at approximately 5:30 p.m., hoping that he would believe that her parents would arrive sooner. The [petitioner] then asked if anyone else was home, and she told him that no one else was home at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"After approximately three minutes, the [petitioner] told the complainant to stand up because he wanted to go upstairs. Walking sideways facing the complainant, the [petitioner] slowly approached the stairwell just off the den. After taking several slow steps, the [petitioner] placed his hand on the complainant's elbow to hurry her along. As the [petitioner] touched the complainant's arm, she began to scream and cry. The [petitioner] told the complainant to be quiet, and she attempted to leave the house via the front door. The [petitioner] blocked the doorway, as the complainant continued to scream. The [petitioner] suddenly stopped and said that he was just playing. The [petitioner] then called the complainant a 'scaredy-ass,' opened the front\n   door and ran out of the house. Approximately ten minutes elapsed from the time the [petitioner] first arrived at the home to the time that he departed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The complainant closed the door and locked it. She immediately called a friend, who lived up the street, to warn her that the [petitioner] was running in her direction. She was unable to contact her friend. The complainant then unsuccessfully called both of her parents. Finally, she reached her boyfriend by telephone and told him what had happened. She then called the police and gave a brief description of the [petitioner].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Within approximately ten minutes, Officer Joseph Kalson of the Fairfield police department arrived at the home. The complainant again gave a description of the [petitioner], and Kalson broadcast over the police radio that the original description was correct. Officer Christopher Ioli of the Fairfield police department also responded to the call. Ioli observed the [petitioner] jogging on a street. By the time that Ioli had turned his vehicle around and turned down that street, the [petitioner] was sitting on the front lawn of a house. According to Ioli, the [petitioner] was sweating and appeared slightly nervous. Ioli conducted a patdown search for weapons but found none. The complainant was transported to that location, where she identified the [petitioner], and the [petitioner] was taken into custody.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687082\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/97/763/#p766\">\n    97 Conn.App. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=906%20A.2d%20728\">\n    906 A.2d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5729097,5728441,5730159\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/939/\">\n    280 Conn. 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=912%20A.2d%20476\">\n    912 A.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of kidnapping in the second degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94a (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and burglary\n   in the second degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102a (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was sentenced by the trial court to fifteen years incarceration on the kidnapping charge and ten years incarceration on the burglary charge, both sentences to run concurrently, for a total effective sentence of fifteen years.

The petitioner claimed that the trial court did not properly instruct the jury as to the charge of kidnapping because, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , a defendant cannot be convicted of kidnapping in conjunction with another crime if the confinement or movement necessary to support the kidnapping charge is merely incidental to the commission of the other crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 546-47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 5, 2015, the petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment on his amended petition pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-37,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was accompanied by a memorandum of law in support. On March 9, 2014, the respondent filed an objection to the motion. Oral argument on the motion was heard on June 1, 2015, and both sides stipulated to the habeas court\n   treating the June 1 argument as a full habeas trial on the papers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the habeas court granted the petitioner's motion for summary judgment and, in turn, his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In its memorandum of decision dated September 10, 2015, the court summarily concluded that the petitioner was entitled to an instruction on the kidnapping charge in a manner that comports with\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , and, in a more lengthy analysis, concluded that the lack of the proper instruction was not harmless error. The habeas court subsequently granted the respondent's petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The respondent claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that the petitioner was entitled to an incidental restraint instruction on the kidnapping charge in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   . The respondent then argues that, even if an incidental restraint instruction should have been given, the habeas court improperly concluded that the trial court's failure to give the instruction was harmful error. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an initial matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review and principles of law. \" Practice Book \u00a7 23-37 provides in relevant part that a habeas court may grant summary judgment if the pleadings, affidavits and any other evidence submitted show that there is no genuine issue of material fact between the parties requiring a trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. On review from the granting of a motion for summary judgment, our task is to determine whether the court correctly determined that the moving party was entitled, as a matter of law, to summary judgment on the basis of the absence of any genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. Because this inquiry requires a legal determination, our review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Eric M.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20Conn.%20App.%20837\">\n    153 Conn.App. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842-43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201128\">\n    108 A.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20915\">\n    315 Conn. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20A.3d%20308\">\n    106 A.3d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , [our Supreme Court] reconsidered our long-standing interpretation of our kidnapping statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-91 through 53a-94a....

Our Supreme Court stated: \"On the contrary, restraint may be used in the commission of the [other substantive] offense ... even though it is not an element of that offense. Thus, depending on the facts of the [other substantive] crime, the fact finder reasonably might conclude that the kidnapping was merely incidental to the [other substantive] crime irrespective of whether that crime [inherently] requires the use of restraint.... Although it is true, of course, that not every assault involves an appreciable restraint of the victim, many do, and, in those circumstances, we see no reason why a defendant should be denied the benefit of a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction simply because the state is not required to prove restraint of the victim as an element of the assault.\" (Citations omitted.)

As previously mentioned, the crime underlying the charge of burglary was never identified at trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   much less\n   ever completed by the petitioner. Because it is not clear what underlying crime the petitioner intended to commit when he unlawfully entered the house, the jury conceivably could have interpreted the petitioner's confinement and movement of the complainant in several different ways. For instance, the jury may have viewed the petitioner's attempt to have the complainant go upstairs with him as an indication that he wanted to sexually assault her, or as an indication that he wanted to rob her of jewelry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury could have concluded that either of these underlying offenses inherently involved restraint by virtue of its nature. In short, without knowing the jury's specific theory of the case on which it convicted the petitioner of burglary, we have no way of determining whether the jury would have found that the restraint used here was inherent in the crime underlying the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With regard to the remaining\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   factors, the respondent argues that the restraint utilized by the petitioner here prevented the complainant from summoning assistance, reduced the petitioner's risk of detection, and created a significant danger or increased the complainant's risk of harm independent of that posed by\n   the separate offense. As to the final factor, that is, whether the restraint created a significant danger or increased the complainant's risk of harm independent of that posed by the separate offense, it does not appear likely that the jury could conclude that the restraint here was especially dangerous, as the restraint was generally not physical or aggressive in nature, there was no proof the petitioner actually possessed a gun, the restraint did not persist for a long period of time, and the restraint took place in a single location-the complainant's own home. On the other hand, assuming that the jury credited the entirety of the complainant's trial testimony, we agree with the respondent that the additional two factors-whether the restraint\n   utilized by the petitioner prevented the complainant from summoning assistance and reduced the petitioner's risk of detection-do not weigh in the petitioner's favor, given that the complainant \"attempt[ed] to go toward the front door to get away\" but was unable to escape because the petitioner had blocked the exit. To the extent that these cut in favor of the respondent, however, they do not trump the significance of the remaining factors that weigh in favor of the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In light of all of these considerations, we cannot conclude \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hinds\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%2056\">\n    321 Conn. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%20596\">\n    136 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, a properly instructed jury reasonably could conclude that the petitioner's intention in confining and moving the complainant was merely in furtherance of his commission of the crime of burglary. Under the deficient instruction, however, the jury effectively was compelled to conclude that the petitioner committed kidnapping once it credited the complainant's account. Ultimately, the\n   respondent has not proven that the omission of the\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
