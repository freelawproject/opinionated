Additional facts pertaining to the defendant's claims will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by granting the state's motion in limine to preclude him from presenting evidence of four other robberies that took place in Waterbury at approximately the same time as the robbery in the present case. Specifically, the defendant argues that the evidence supported his third party culpability defense and that similarities among all of the robberies \"establish[ed] a connection\" between the perpetrators of the other robberies and the robbery in the present case. The state argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the proffered evidence \"failed to establish a direct connection between the charged offenses and [the] other robberies ....\" We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On April 21, 2014, the day before the trial began, the state filed a motion in limine asking the court to preclude the defense from introducing into evidence any testimony regarding four other robberies that had occurred in Waterbury\n   on November 1 and 2, 2010. The\n   state also moved to require the defendant to make an offer of proof prior to the introduction of any evidence that would support a third party culpability defense, namely, that any evidence that the perpetrators of the four other robberies committed the robbery and murder of the victim. The state argued such evidence was irrelevant, not probative, and prejudicial. The court reserved its decision on the motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Throughout the state's case-in-chief, the defendant repeatedly attempted to put into evidence proof of the other robberies. First, during cross-examination of the state's first witness, David Vaught, who maintained maps for the city of Waterbury, the defendant attempted to introduce into evidence maps that showed the locations of four other robberies that took place in the early morning of November 2, 2010. Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant stated that he had subpoenaed police reports of other robberies and argued that the maps of the locations of the robberies were relevant to show the close proximity of the other robberies to the robbery in the present case. The defendant argued that there were similarities among the robberies that made evidence of the other robberies relevant to his third party culpability defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The robberies were claimed to be similar in that: (1) they took place at approximately the same time and in the same vicinity as the robbery in the present case, (2) they all involved an assault on a victim, (3) the other robberies were committed by three people with a long history of assaults, (4) police found a cigarette butt in the van that the perpetrators of the four robberies used that was the same brand of cigarette found at the murder\n   scene, and (5) the police initially investigated all of the robberies as having been perpetrated by the same individuals. He argued that these facts, which were not yet in evidence, tended to show that a third party or parties, namely, the perpetrators of the other robberies, committed the robbery and murder of the victim. The defendant did concede, however, that there was no DNA evidence linking the perpetrators of the four robberies to the crime scene in the present case. The court sustained the state's objection on the ground that the maps were irrelevant because it did not \"see the connection\" between the four other robberies and the robbery in the present case. It did state, however, that it would reconsider its ruling if there was \"further evidence developed that [made the maps] relevant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, the court conducted an in-camera inspection of the police reports the defendant subpoenaed to ensure that they were properly redacted pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4-7 and General Statutes \u00a7 1-210. The next day, the court provided copies of the reports to the parties with the appropriate redactions. It redacted the witness statements within the police reports that referenced the other robberies because defense counsel did not give a \"further offer of proof with respect to the connection that could or does exist between these incidents and the matter here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Third, the defendant attempted to introduce into evidence a portion of the autopsy report written by an investigator that contained witness statements that referenced the other robberies. The court excluded it because the medical examiner did not rely\n   on it in determining the victim's cause of death and because it constituted hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, defense counsel sought to elicit testimony on cross-examination from Vanessa Vazquez that she saw one of the robberies take place at a certain time\n   and at a certain location because this testimony would undermine the state's timeline of events. The court sustained the state's relevancy objection because \"raising issues of the other robberies, even though they might be probative of the time that the individuals here were picked up ... is likely to cause confusion for the jury,\" and \"absent some kind of physical connection between this incident and the other incidents, [the court is] not going to allow that line of questioning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 29, 2014, the defendant filed an objection to the state's motion in limine and gave an offer of proof in support of his third party culpability defense. The offer of proof included police incident reports for the other assaults and robberies, certified court reports relating to the cases involving the perpetrators responsible for the other robberies, and laboratory reports involving tests on evidence recovered from the other robberies. On April 30, 2014, after reviewing the defendant's objection and hearing arguments by the prosecutor and the defense, the court granted the state's motion in limine. The court explained that \"the defendant has failed to offer any evidence directly linking a third party to the commission of the robbery at issue\" and that \"[t]he fact that other robberies occurred on the same date and in Waterbury and were within the central city area raises, at most, a bare suspicion that another person may have committed the subject robbery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that evidence of the four robberies should have been admitted because such evidence was relevant in giving \"the jury an alternative theory as to who committed the crime.\" He argues that the \"substantial\" amount of evidence of the other robberies and the number of similarities between the other robberies and the robbery in the present case \"does more than raise a bare suspicion that a third party\n   committed the offense; it establishes a direct connection to the instant case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the court excluded this evidence, he claims, it foreclosed his opportunity to present his third party culpability defense, which deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant opines that the court violated his constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This matter is an evidentiary one, however, and will be treated as such.

Instead, all of the evidence the defendant sought to admit merely established\n   that other robberies took place at approximately the same time and in the same vicinity as the robbery in the present case. Thus, without any evidence that\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   connects the perpetrators of the other robberies to the robbery in the present case, evidence of similarities between the other robberies and the robbery in the present case is not sufficient to support a third party culpability defense.

Specifically, the defendant claims that \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1) is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) because he could not have caused serious injury to the victim without first using a dangerous instrument. The state argues that the charges are separate and distinct offenses because \"it is possible to commit an offense under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) without first having committed an offense under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1).\" We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant did not raise this claim at trial, and it, therefore, is not preserved for review.

Section 53a-134 provides in relevant part: \"(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when ... he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime ... or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The substitute information filed by the state alleged in relevant part: \"Count\n   Three: And the above said senior assistant state's attorney further accuses and charges that the defendant said Michael Mark did commit the crime of Robbery in the First Degree in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1), and charges that, on or about November 2, 2010, in the early morning hours, at or near 424 Baldwin Street, in the City of Waterbury, Connecticut, the said Michael\n   Mark, in the course of committing a robbery, or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime caused serious physical injury to any person who was not a participant in the crime, to wit: Arnaldo Gonzalez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Count Four: And the above said senior assistant state's attorney further accuses and charges that the said Michael Mark did commit the crime of Robbery in the First Degree in violation of ... \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3), and charges that, on or about November 2, 2010, in the early morning hours, at or near 424 Baldwin Street, in the City of Waterbury, Connecticut, the said Michael Mark, in the course of committing a robbery, or immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime used and threatened the use of a dangerous instrument, to wit: a rock and/or a shod foot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jury found the defendant guilty on all counts, including both counts of robbery in the first degree. The court sentenced the defendant for his conviction under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1) to twenty years imprisonment and for his conviction under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) to twenty years imprisonment. The court sentenced the defendant to forty-eight years imprisonment for the murder conviction and ordered the robbery convictions to run concurrently with the murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that \"the [two robbery in the first degree] counts are one in the same and conviction and punishment on both violated the double jeopardy clause.\" Because the autopsy report showed that the victim died from blunt force trauma to his head, it was impossible for the defendant to cause a serious physical injury to the victim without first using a dangerous instrument. The defendant argues, therefore, that his \"conviction for robbery in the first degree, \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1) was a lesser included offense of the conviction for robbery in the first degree, \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).\" Thus, the court should vacate the defendant's conviction on the lesser included offense.

The defendant's claim, however, does not satisfy the second prong because under\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   , the two charges constitute separate offenses in that each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To convict the defendant under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (1), the state was required to prove that the defendant actually caused \"serious physical injury\" to the victim, who was \"not a participant in the crime.\" The state was not required to prove that the injury was caused by a dangerous instrument. To convict the defendant under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3), the state needed to prove that the defendant \"used or threatened the use of a dangerous instrument.\" The state was not required to prove that the victim actually suffered serious physical injury. Thus, each of the counts in the information required that the state prove an element of a crime that the other crime does not include. Because each of the charged offenses require proof of an element that the other does not, we conclude that the defendant's right against double jeopardy for the same offense was not violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, the defendant failed to meet his burden of proof demonstrating a clear legislative intent that\n   contradicts the result of the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test.

He argues that \"the state's circumstantial case [which] relied heavily on the credibility of its witnesses ... increased the relevancy\" of the proffered evidence. Without any evidence that establishes a direct connection between the third party and the robbery in the present case, however, any weaknesses in the state's case do not render evidence of the other robberies more relevant to prove \"that others had both the motive and opportunity to commit the crime in this case.\" The defendant has failed to cite to any case law that indicates otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In addition, the defendant argues that the trial court used an improper standard in ruling on its evidentiary claims when it stated that the defendant was required to show a \"physical connection\" between the other robberies and the robbery in the present case. While the court did in fact incorrectly state that the defense was required to show a \"physical connection\" between the third party and the robbery in the present case, a review of the entire record gives us no indication that the court improperly foreclosed the defendant from introducing evidence that directly connected the robberies to the one in the present case. In its ruling on the state's motion in limine, moreover, the court properly stated that defense counsel failed to show a \"\n    <em>\n     direct connection\n    </em>\n    \" between the proffered evidence and the robbery in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
