On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court's jury instruction to continue deliberations after the jury reported that it was unable to reach a verdict violated his right to a fair trial by coercing the jurors to reach a unanimous verdict without providing a cautionary reminder of their duties as individual jurors not to agree to a verdict unless they personally agree to it under the court's instructions as applied to the evidence before them. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury was presented with evidence of the following facts. On May 6, 2012, the New Haven Police Department engaged Zerline Savage as a cooperating witness\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in an attempt to make a controlled purchase of narcotics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers of the New Haven Police Department and Savage met at the predetermined location of Science Park. After Savage was searched to ensure that she did not have any money or drugs on her person, the officers gave her department issued money with which to complete a controlled purchase. In addition, the officers gave her an audio-video recording device disguised as a key fob that she was to carry in her hand when she made the controlled purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Savage was sent to buy narcotics. She made contact with the defendant outside of a convenience store in the area, and asked him if \"he [had] anything.\" The defendant appeared upset to Savage, muttered something, and entered the convenience store. Shortly thereafter, the defendant exited the convenience store and walked away. At some point thereafter, Savage entered a motor vehicle in which the defendant was sitting in the driver's seat. While sitting in the motor vehicle, Savage purchased crack cocaine from the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This exchange,\n   which took place while the witness' hidden recording device was operating, occurred within 1500 feet of Celentano Museum Academy, a public elementary school. Following the purchase, Savage returned to the location of the officers, where she handed them the crack cocaine and the recording device. The officers again searched Savage, and then\n   they and Savage viewed the recording together on a computer located in the officers' vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant was arrested on June 30, 2012, and charged with sale of a narcotic substance in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) and sale of a narcotic substance within 1500 feet of a school in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a (b). A jury trial commenced on May 22, 2014, and deliberations began on May 27, 2014. On May 28, 2014, the jury informed the court that it could not reach an agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the court\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   proposed an instruction that the jury continue deliberating, and review the evidence and the position of each juror to ensure that nothing had been misunderstood or overlooked. Defense counsel objected to the proposed instruction, stating that he was concerned that the jury, if so instructed, would feel compelled to reach a verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel, however, did not recommend any specific language that would satisfy his concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court determined that its proposed instruction would not suggest to the jury that it had to reach a verdict and that the instruction was an appropriate response to the jury's note. It therefore delivered the following instruction at approximately 11 a.m.: \"I'm\n   going to say the following to you, ladies and gentlemen, and then you will continue with your deliberations. By the court's estimation, you have been deliberating for approximately three hours. I know you started yesterday afternoon, and you came in here a little bit after 10:00 today. At this point, I simply suggest that you continue your deliberations. You should review the evidence and the positions of each juror to determine if any evidence has been overlooked or any juror's position misunderstood with respect to either the evidence or the law. Please continue to listen to what each other has to say. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You will continue with your deliberations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After approximately five and one-half hours of deliberations, the jury announced that it had reached a verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   It found the\n   defendant guilty on both charges. He was sentenced to a total effective sentence of five years of imprisonment, execution suspended after one year, followed by three years of probation. The defendant filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant claims that the court's jury instruction to continue deliberations violated his right to a fair trial. Specifically, he contends that the court's jury instruction lacked cautionary language informing jurors to balance their duty to listen to their fellow jurors against their duty not to surrender their own conscientiously held views of the evidence merely to reach a unanimous verdict. The defendant further contends that, by not informing the jury that it was not compelled to reach a verdict, the court effectively informed the jury that it was required to reach a verdict. The defendant claims\n   that these instructional errors operated to coerce the jury in conducting its deliberations and in reaching a guilty verdict. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the outset, we must address whether the defendant failed to preserve his claim at trial. We conclude that the defendant's claim was not preserved. Accordingly, a\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   analysis is required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , as modified in\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), \"a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

See\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude, however, that the claim fails under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because the alleged constitutional violation does not exist and did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Thus, the defendant cannot prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our resolution of the defendant's claim with regard to the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   is pursuant to the following legal principles. \"It is well settled that jury instructions are to be reviewed in their entirety.... When the challenge to a jury instruction is of constitutional magnitude, the standard of review is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled.... In determining whether it was ... reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court's instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement .... Individual instructions also are not to be judged in artificial isolation .... Instead, [t]he test to be applied ... is whether the charge ... as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, our Supreme Court concluded that instructing jurors to consider the opinions of majority view jurors is an acceptable method of facilitating the deliberative process when faced with a deadlocked jury, but that the court must balance the instruction with a cautionary reminder to jurors of their obligation as individuals to give their own verdict without surrendering their conscientiously held views.

The verdict to which each of you agrees must express your own conclusion and not merely the acquiescence in the conclusion of your fellow jurors.

Do not ever change your mind just because other jurors see things differently or to get the case over with. As I told you before, in the end, your vote must be exactly that-your own vote. As important as it is for you to reach a unanimous agreement, it is just as important that you do so honestly and in good conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"What I have said to you is not intended to rush you into agreeing on a verdict.

Such language is not required, however, when the court merely tells jurors to continue deliberating without instructing them in a potentially coercive manner. In the present case, the court merely told the jurors to continue deliberating after the jury reported that it was unable to reach a verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the instruction did not include language potentially\n   coercing the jurors to reach a unanimous verdict, it did not require a cautionary reminder to the jurors of their individual duties not to agree to a verdict unless they personally agreed to it under the court's instructions as applied to the evidence before them. Thus, we conclude that the court's instruction to continue deliberations did not violate the defendant's right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The record shows that, when the jury was having difficulty reaching an agreement, the court gave a brief instruction to the jury to continue its deliberations. The thrust of this instruction \"was not to change any juror's attitude or approach to the deliberations.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In fact, none of the language in the instruction suggested that the jurors should give deference to other jurors' opinions and reevaluate the evidence and conclusions based on the majority view, as instructed in a Chip Smith charge. Rather, the instruction simply encouraged the members of the jury to review the evidence and the positions of each juror to ensure that their inability to reach a verdict was not due to an oversight or misunderstanding of the evidence and the law. Instructing the members of the jury to take more time to deliberate to avoid a potential misunderstanding and oversight is patently different from the Chip Smith charge adopted in\n   <em>\n    O'Neil\n   </em>\n   , where minority view jurors were instructed to reevaluate their positions in light of those of the majority view.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the language in the court's instruction to the jury to continue deliberations did not include language directing jurors to consider why majority view jurors reached a different conclusion, the potential to corrode the jurors' exercise of their independent right to vote on the basis of their own conscientiously held views did not exist.

Accordingly, we conclude that when the court gave its instruction to continue the deliberation process, it neither instructed the jury that the case must be\n   decided, nor precluded the possibility that a disagreement amongst the jurors might occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Furthermore, we reject the defendant's argument that\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Feliciano\n   </em>\n   , the jury reported that it was unable to come to a decision. Id., at 434,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20812\">\n    778 A.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response, the jury received a brief instruction quite similar to the one at issue in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20812\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   When the jury still could not reach a verdict, the court delivered three Chip Smith charges.

On appeal from his conviction, the defendant argued that the Chip Smith charges had been unfairly coercive. Our Supreme Court held that the trial court properly had delivered its Chip Smith charges, and that the charges \"properly informed the jury that each member had the individual responsibility to consider the opinion of the others\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to satisfy him or herself of the correctness of his or her opinion and not merely to acquiesce in the conclusion of others.\" (Emphasis in original.) Id., at 442,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20812\">\n    778 A.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the present case, the defendant claims that\n   <em>\n    Feliciano\n   </em>\n   included an incomplete\n   Chip Smith charge allegedly cured by subsequent appropriate Chip Smith charges that contained language to prevent jurors from being compelled to change their opinions. The defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Feliciano\n   </em>\n   , however, is misplaced. While the defendant correctly concludes that the language of the charge determines whether it is coercive; id., at 440, 441,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20812\">\n    778 A.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he language of the charge does not direct a verdict,\n   but encourages it\"); he appears to misunderstand our Supreme Court's distinction among the various charges given in\n   <em>\n    Feliciano\n   </em>\n   . Our Supreme Court did not consider the brief instruction, similar to the one at issue here, to be an instruction requiring a cautionary reminder, and it did not take issue with the language used in the brief instruction. Id., at 441-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20812\">\n    778 A.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In turn, our Supreme Court's discussion of balancing the encouragement of unanimity and a cautionary reminder to not surrender one's beliefs did not apply to the brief instruction similar to the one at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the basis of our review of the court's charge, we conclude that the court's instruction to continue deliberations did not include language coercing the jury to reach a verdict, and, therefore, the court was not required to provide a cautionary reminder to jurors of their individual duties to give their own verdict without surrendering their conscientiously held beliefs. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   and cannot prevail on his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Detective Ryan McFarland of the New Haven Police Department defined a cooperating witness as a person who enters into a formal agreement with the New Haven Police Department to assist in the investigation of criminal violations occurring in the city of New Haven.
