Cornelius,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the judgment of foreclosure by sale rendered after the entry of a second default for failure to\n   plead. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the present foreclosure action, (2) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to strike the complaint, and (3) the trial court erroneously denied his motion to set aside the second default for failure to plead. We disagree and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 23, 2001, H. Thomas Cornelius\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   executed a $216,000 note (note) secured by an open-end mortgage deed (mortgage) in favor of Express Capital Lending, which encumbered the property located at 1631 Boulevard, West Hartford (property). That same day, the note and the mortgage were assigned to Impac Funding Corporation. The mortgage was subsequently recorded in the West Hartford land records on May 24, 2001. In September 2001, H. Thomas Cornelius executed a quitclaim deed related to the property in favor of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 22, 2010, Impac Funding Corporation assigned the note and mortgage to the plaintiff, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as indenture trustee under the indenture relating to IMH Assets Corp., Collateralized Asset-Backed Bonds, Series 2004-5. On September 25, 2013, the plaintiff filed the operative complaint seeking to foreclose on the mortgage and the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff named the\n   defendant\n   in the foreclosure action because he \"may claim an interest in said premises by virtue of [his] quitclaim deed ....\" On November 19, 2013, the defendant filed a pro se appearance in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 12, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for default against the defendant for failure to plead, which was granted on February 24, 2014. On February 25, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment of strict foreclosure. On March 4, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to open the default, which was granted on March 25, 2014. On June 4, 2014, the plaintiff filed a second motion for default against the defendant for his continued failure to plead, which was granted on June 12, 2014. On June 17, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to strike the complaint, arguing that \"the complaint does not allege notice of default which is a condition precedent to an action for foreclosure.\" On August 4, 2014, the court denied the defendant's motion to strike, reasoning that it was inoperative in light of the second default currently entered in the action. On August 19, 2014, the defendant filed his motion to open the second default. In that motion, he argued that the second default was invalid because he never received notice or a hearing on the motion for default, as purportedly required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-121 (b), and he \"filed a responsive pleading only a couple days after the clerk granted the default for failure to plead,\" namely, a motion to strike. On September 2, 2012, the court denied the defendant's motion to open the second default because \"the defendant did not show good cause to set aside the default\" and \"this was the second default entered against the defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 1, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the foreclosure action, arguing that the plaintiff lacked standing \"[b]ecause the complaint contains no allegation of a causal connection between the plaintiff's injury and any action of the defendant.\" On December 15, 2014, the court held a hearing on the defendant's motion to dismiss and the plaintiff's motion for strict foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, the defendant initially stated that his argument that the plaintiff lacked standing had \"nothing to do with\" the plaintiff's \"ownership or nonownership of the note.\" In an abundance of caution, the court stated that it wanted to \"double check\" the note, which it stated it had previously reviewed at the December 1, 2014 hearing, and the plaintiff presented the note to the court. Because the defendant insisted that he was not presently contesting the plaintiff's ownership of the note, the court informed the defendant that he could challenge standing on this basis later in the hearing if he wanted to and denied the defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds raised in his motion. After its ruling, the court entertained further discussion concerning the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Eventually, the court addressed the plaintiff's motion for strict foreclosure. During that discussion, the defendant interjected that the plaintiff lacked standing because it failed to establish that it was the holder of the note prior to the commencement\n   of the foreclosure action. The plaintiff then presented the court with the mortgage and the assignments of the note and mortgage. The court reviewed the note, the mortgage, and the assignments. In particular, the court observed that the allonge on the note that pertained to the plaintiff stated that the plaintiff became \"entitled to collect the\n   debt as evidenced by the note\" \"[o]n/or before September 25, 2012.\" The court also observed that the assignment of the note and mortgage to the plaintiff \"was dated October 22, 2010.\" The court gave the defendant an opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's evidence, but ultimately it held that the plaintiff had established that it had standing to prosecute the foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 16, 2016, the court rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to establish that it owned the note before it commenced the present foreclosure action and, thus, had standing to prosecute the action.

The plaintiff then produced the note at the December 1 and 15, 2015 hearings, and it produced the mortgage and the assignments of the note and mortgage at the December 15, 2015 hearing. The record expressly reflects that the court carefully reviewed each of these documents at the December 15 hearing. The plaintiff's presentation of the note in court created a presumption that it had standing to prosecute the foreclosure action. The plaintiff's presentation of the assignments\n   of the note and mortgage further buttressed its assertion that it possessed the note prior to the commencement of the foreclosure action because the assignment of the note and mortgage to the plaintiff was dated almost three years before the foreclosure action was commenced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   defendant did not present any evidence that the note possessed by the plaintiff is invalid or that the plaintiff did not possess the note at the time the present action was commenced. On the basis of the foregoing facts, the court properly concluded that the plaintiff had standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We observe that our Supreme Court has found standing in circumstances almost identical to the facts presented in this case.

Second, the trial court made no factual finding as to when the plaintiff acquired the note. No memorandum of decision [accompanied] the court's judgment of strict foreclosure or order on the plaintiff's motion to open judgment and reset the law days. Additionally, no transcript of\n   any hearing in which the court might have made such a finding [had] been provided for our review.\" (Emphasis added; footnote added.) Id., at 832-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201277\">\n    136 A.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The record in the present case does not contain the same deficiencies that were problematic in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff produced the note, the mortgage, and the dated assignments of the note and mortgage at the December 15, 2015 hearing. After reviewing these documents and discussing them with the parties, the court found on the record that the plaintiff possessed the note prior to the commencement of the foreclosure action. The defendant did not offer any evidence that the note presented by the plaintiff was invalid or that the plaintiff did not possess the note when it commenced the foreclosure action. Instead, the defendant repeats his concern that the court did not make a specific factual finding as to the\n   <em>\n    date\n   </em>\n   on which the plaintiff acquired the note. However, our jurisprudence has never required the court to make a specific factual finding as to the date on which the plaintiff acquired the note to establish standing in a foreclosure action. The plaintiff in a foreclosure action merely has to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it possessed the note at the time the foreclosure action was commenced.\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bliss\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20483\">\n    159 Conn.

First, the defendant argues that because the basis for the motion to strike was the plaintiff's failure to issue notice that the note was in default,\n   as purportedly required by the mortgage,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court and this court lack jurisdiction over the present case. Second, the defendant argues that the court violated General Statutes \u00a7 52-121 by concluding that his motion to strike was inoperative and by not considering it on the merits. We conclude that the mortgage's notice provision does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction and that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a threshold matter, the defendant misunderstands the nature of the jurisdiction of our courts. \"Although the term is sometimes loosely used, 'jurisdiction' in proper usage is the power in a court to hear and determine the cause of action presented to it.\"\n   <em>\n    LaReau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reincke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1595213\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/158/486/#p492\">\n    158 Conn. 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 492,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20576\">\n    264 A.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969). \"It is axiomatic that [a court's] jurisdiction is derived from the constitutional or statutory provisions by which it is created, and can be acquired and exercised only in the manner prescribed.

This contractual condition precedent, however, merely implicates the rights and obligations of the parties under the mortgage;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does not implicate the power of our courts to adjudicate a claim based on the terms of the mortgage. Therefore, the plaintiff's purported failure to comply with the mortgage's notice provision did not implicate the jurisdiction of the trial court and does not deprive this court of jurisdiction over this foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We also conclude that the court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to strike. The defendant argues that the court erroneously concluded that his motion to strike was \"inoperative\" because \"[t]he motion to strike was filed on June 17, 2014\" and \"[t]he court did not\n   render a judgment on the default until December\n   16, 2014.\" In particular, the defendant argues that \u00a7 52-121 requires a trial court to consider the merits of a motion to strike even after a default has been entered so long as no judgment has been rendered. We disagree. Section 52-121 (a) provides in relevant part: \"Any pleading in any civil action may be filed after the expiration of the time fixed by statute or by any rule of the court until the court has heard any motion for judgment by default ... for failure to plead ....\" \"We acknowledge that there is support for the proposition that a court commits plain error if, prior to rendering a judgment upon default, the court fails to accept for filing a defaulted party's pleading solely on the ground that the pleading is untimely.\"\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768782\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/140/646/#p662\">\n    140 Conn.App. 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20A.3d%20864\">\n    59 A.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , appeal dismissed,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20905\">\n    309 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20A.3d%20661\">\n    68 A.3d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the present case, however, the court did not deny the defendant's motion to strike because it was untimely. The court denied the motion because it could not act on it while the default was still in effect. \"In an action at law, the rule is that the entry of a default operates as a confession by the defaulted defendant of the truth of the material facts alleged in the complaint which are essential to entitle the plaintiff to some of the relief prayed.... [I]ts effect is to preclude the defaulted defendant from making any further defense and to permit the entry of a judgment against him on the theory that he has admitted such of the facts alleged in the complaint as are essential to such a judgment.... Thus, [a] default admits the material facts that constitute a cause of action ... and entry of default, when appropriately made, conclusively determines the liability of a defendant.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    St. John\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5544898\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/80/767/#p775\">\n    80 Conn.App. 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=837%20A.2d%20841\">\n    837 A.2d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

The defendant was initially defaulted for failure to plead on February 24, 2014. The court granted the defendant's motion to open the first default on March 25, 2014. By June, 2014, however, the defendant still had not filed any responsive pleadings, and on June 12, 2014, a second default\n   for failure to plead was entered. The defendant filed a motion to open the second default two months later, but he did not offer any good cause for opening the default a second time. His only arguments for opening the second default were that the default was invalid because he never received notice or a hearing on the motion for default, as purportedly required by \u00a7 52-121 (b), and he \"filed a responsive pleading only a couple days after the clerk granted the default for failure to plead,\" i.e., a motion to strike.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both of these claims lacked merit. Section 52-121 (b) is irrelevant to this issue; it addresses the proper procedure for the entry of a\n   <em>\n    default judgment\n   </em>\n   , not a default. Additionally, a motion to strike is not a responsive pleading that automatically sets aside a default. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-32 (b) (\"[\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    f a party who has been defaulted under this section files an answer\n   </em>\n   before a judgment after default has been rendered by the judicial authority,\n   <em>\n    the default shall automatically be set aside\n   </em>\n   by operation of law unless a claim for a hearing in damages or a motion for judgment has been filed\" [emphasis added] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to open the second default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded for the purpose of setting new law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Several additional parties with interests in the property were named as defendants in this action, but they have not participated in this appeal.
