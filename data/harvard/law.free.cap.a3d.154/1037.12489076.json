On appeal, the plaintiff claims\n   that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to award her double the amount of her security deposit pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2); (2) failing to find that the actions of the defendant, Eleanor Kiltonic, constituted a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and, therefore, failing to assess punitive damages and to award the plaintiff attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (a) and (d); and (3) finding that the plaintiff was entitled to only a portion of her security deposit plus interest. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court found the following facts: \"On or about October 19, 2010, the plaintiff ... and the defendant ... entered into a written lease agreement for the residential property located at 43 Whitney Avenue, Southington, Connecticut (hereinafter 'the premises'). Upon executing the lease, the plaintiff paid a security deposit in the amount of $1590 to the defendant. The lease term was for eighteen months, with a monthly rent of $795.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"Upon the expiration of the original lease agreement, on or about April 20, 2012, the parties executed a second written lease. The second lease term was for three months at the same monthly rent as the first lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On or about July 20, 2012, the plaintiff vacated the premises. Thereafter, on or about July 27, 2010, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant requesting the return of her security deposit and notifying the defendant of her new address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On or about August 17, 2012, the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff in which the defendant stated she intended to retain [the] plaintiff's security deposit due to alleged damages to the property caused by the plaintiff. The letter contained a detailed list of expenses allegedly incurred by the defendant and deducted the\n   security deposit from said expenses. The defendant concluded the letter by claiming the plaintiff owed her additional funds for repairs to the premises.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff's claim against the defendant contained two counts: in count one, the plaintiff sought, pursuant to \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2), the return of her security deposit, plus interest, and double damages; in count two, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant violated CUTPA, and sought, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 42-110g (a) and (d), punitive damages, costs, and attorney's fees. The defendant filed her answer on October 3, 2012, in which she set forth special defenses, claiming that she sent the plaintiff a letter that listed the damages and informed her that she was retaining the entirety of the security deposit. She also alleged that the plaintiff yelled and swore at her when she refused to return the\n   security deposit. The defendant further alleged that the plaintiff and her dogs ruined the carpeting in the unit, which was installed at the beginning of the plaintiff's tenancy and had cost $1985.29. On October 4, 2012, the plaintiff filed a request to revise the defendant's special defenses. In it, the plaintiff requested that the defendant amend her special defenses to comply with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 10-51 and 10-1. The defendant neither filed an objection to this request, nor amended her special defenses. On December 3, 2012, the plaintiff filed a motion for default for failure to plead, which the court,\n   <em>\n    Abrams, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted on January 11, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff then filed a certificate of closed pleadings. Thereafter, a four day evidentiary hearing took place between May 24, 2013, and March 7, 2014, during which the defendant was self-represented. On July 2, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Woods, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $1094.81. In its memorandum of decision, the court declined to award the plaintiff double damages, attorney's fees and costs, or punitive damages. Rather, the court awarded the plaintiff the\n   return of her security deposit plus interest, totaling $1622.36, reduced by $527.55 for a total award of $1094.81. The court found that the defendant was entitled to withhold $527.55 from the plaintiff's security deposit \"for the costs of the water and sewer bills while the plaintiff occupied the premises, as well as the exterior cleanup costs.\" The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for articulation, and motions for reargument, for reconsideration, and for additur. All of these motions were denied by the court. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is important to note at the outset that \"[i]t is the trier's exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses and determine whether to accept some, all or none of a witness' testimony.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gallo-Mure\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tomchik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2496143\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/699/#p715\">\n    78 Conn.App. 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 715,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%208\">\n    829 A.2d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). With this in mind, we turn to the plaintiff's specific claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We address first the plaintiff's claim regarding the court's failure to award her double damages pursuant to \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2). The plaintiff argues that because the defendant wrongfully withheld her security deposit at the end of her tenancy, the court was required to award the plaintiff double damages under \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2). We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The plaintiff's first lease with the defendant ended on April 19, 2012, and the second lease began on April 20, 2012. By agreement, the defendant retained the plaintiff's security deposit from the first lease and applied it to the second lease, which ended on July 20, 2012. On July 27, 2012, the plaintiff sent the key to the premises to the defendant and\n   enclosed her forwarding address. On August 16, 2012, the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff stating that she was not going to return the security deposit. She enclosed a list of damages that she alleged were caused by the plaintiff, and the cost of repair for each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The damages as listed totaled $4526.99. The defendant stated in the letter that she was retaining the security\n   deposit, which totaled $1591.64 including interest, as partial payment for the damages. She requested that the plaintiff pay the remaining $2935.35 immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In denying the plaintiff's request for double damages, the court stated: \"In the instant case, the plaintiff-tenant notified the defendant-landlord of her forwarding address and requested the return of her security deposit on July 27, 2012. The defendant responded with a letter, mailed on August 17, 2012, accounting for damages to the premises allegedly caused by the plaintiff. Notwithstanding whether the plaintiff actually caused said damages, the defendant satisfied the requirements of the security deposit statute by sending an accounting to the plaintiff within the required thirty day time period. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiff is not entitled to double the amount of her security deposit, plus interest. The court determines that the plaintiff is entitled to the return of her security deposit, plus interest, in the amount of $1622.36.\" The court also stated in its memorandum of decision that the majority of the costs included in the defendant's accounting of damages \"were neither directly caused by the plaintiff, nor beyond normal wear and tear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review and applicable case law relevant to this claim. \"We accord plenary\n   review to the court's legal basis for its damages award....

App. at 309-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For purposes of determining whether to award double damages under this statute, therefore, a court need only determine whether a landlord complied with the statutory requirements, and need not determine\n   whether the landlord's reason for withholding the security deposit was justified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff argues that because the court found that she was not liable for the majority of the damages listed by the defendant, then the defendant had no legal claim to the plaintiff's security deposit, and, therefore, it was wrongfully withheld. The plaintiff then asserts that because the defendant's withholding of the security deposit was wrongful, \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2)\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the court to award the plaintiff double damages. The plaintiff reads the legislature's use of the word \"shall\" in \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) to create a mandatory duty on the court to award double damages in this type of situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because\n   precedent does not command a reading of the statute consistent with the plaintiff's argument, we do not agree.

App. at 309-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the present case, the court found that the defendant complied with the statutory requirements, and, therefore, the sanction of double damages was not invoked. As for the first part of the\n   <em>\n    Kufferman\n   </em>\n   test, the court found, and the parties do not dispute, that the defendant sent a written notification of damages to the plaintiff within the thirty day time limitation, as provided in the statute. As for the second part of the\n   <em>\n    Kufferman\n   </em>\n   test, the court found, and the parties do not dispute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the amount of claimed damages exceeded the amount of the security deposit, and, therefore, there was no balance to return to the plaintiff. In finding that the defendant complied with the statutory requirements, the court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to double damages, regardless of the fact that it later found the plaintiff not liable for much of the itemized damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our review of the record and the relevant case law supports the court's determination that the defendant's actions complied with the statutory provisions, and, therefore, did not invoke the double damages provision. Accordingly, the court's findings were not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plaintiff's second claim on appeal is that the court erred in finding that the defendant's actions did\n   not violate CUTPA, and, therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the defendant's failure to comply with \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) is a per se CUTPA violation.

CUTPA provides that \"[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). \"It is well settled that whether a defendant's acts constitute ... deceptive or unfair trade practices under CUTPA, is a question of fact for the trier, to which, on appellate review, we accord our customary deference....

In her letter to the plaintiff dated August 16, 2012, the defendant justified retaining the plaintiff's security deposit by listing fourteen items of damage, totaling $4526.99, for which she felt the plaintiff was responsible. Included in those items were: \"[l]abor to pick up feces [and] mow lawn\" for which she charged $150; \"sewer bills\" for which she charged $390.14; and \"water bills\" for which she charged $107.89.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the terms of the two leases between the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff was obligated to pay the utilities \"used or consumed on the property\" during the duration of the lease agreement, including water and sewer. Additionally, under the terms of the lease, the plaintiff was obligated to \"maintain the exterior of the property including mowing the lawn ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff and the defendant testified that the water and sewer companies would send a bill to the defendant's house, and the defendant would give it to the plaintiff, who would then pay the bill. The defendant testified that there were outstanding water and sewer bills that the plaintiff did not pay before moving out. The plaintiff testified that she paid all of the bills that the defendant sent to her. The defendant testified, however, that she did provide the bills to the plaintiff\n   and the plaintiff did not pay. The defendant provided to the court copies of three bills from the Southington Board of Water Commissioners, as well as copies of three checks from the defendant to the water company that totaled $131.07. The checks were dated July 23, August 10 and November 9, 2012, and the defendant testified that these checks were in satisfaction of the outstanding bills. The defendant also provided to the court an accounting from the Southington Sewer Department, as well as copies of three checks from the defendant to the sewer company that totaled $321.40. The checks were dated November 8, 2010, April 10, 2012, and May 5,\n   2012, and the defendant testified that these checks were in satisfaction of the outstanding bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendant further testified that after the plaintiff vacated the premises, she had to clean up sixty \"or more\" piles of dog feces from the front lawn, which took her two hours. The defendant estimated that her labor in picking up the feces cost $100. The plaintiff testified that there were only \"a couple piles\" of feces left when she moved out. Additionally, the defendant testified that the plaintiff had not mowed the lawn for \"two months, maybe\" despite the fact that the lease required the plaintiff to take care of the exterior maintenance. The defendant testified that she paid her son in cash to mow the lawn two times because it was \"horrible.\" The plaintiff testified that she had mowed the lawn two days before moving out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \"In the present case, the defendant submitted multiple exhibits during trial in an attempt to establish [the] plaintiff's liability for damages to the premises beyond normal wear and tear. Photographs of the condition of the premises were submitted by the defendant. [The] defendant also provided the court with proof of expenditures to repair the furnace, pay for the water and\n   sewer bills, replace flooring, and cleanup the exterior of the premises, including a large amount of dog waste. After review of the evidence, the court finds that the defendant is entitled $527.55 for the costs of the water and sewer bills while the plaintiff occupied the premises, as well as the exterior cleanup costs. The court determines that the remaining damages claimed by the defendant were neither directly caused by the plaintiff, nor beyond normal wear and tear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the court's award to the defendant of $527.55 represents a setoff, a counterclaim, or a special defense, to which the defendant was not entitled. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review and applicable case law relevant to this claim. \"We accord plenary review to the court's legal basis for its damages award....

The plaintiff cites our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Expressway Associates II\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Friendly Ice Cream Corp. of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"522418\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/218/474/\">\n    218 Conn. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20A.2d%20431\">\n    590 A.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) for the proposition that \"[a] landlord['s] claim for property damage, like back rent claims, usually arise[s] either as part of a suit for damages or as a setoff or counterclaim to a tenant's action for return of a security deposit.\" The plaintiff's characterization of the court's award is mistaken. Under the lease, the plaintiff was obligated to pay the water and sewer bills, and to maintain the exterior of the property. The court heard evidence from the defendant that the plaintiff failed to comply with her obligations, and the court was entitled to credit such testimony. On the basis of the statute, the defendant was entitled to withhold damages suffered by the tenant's failure to comply with the lease agreement. The plaintiff's characterization of this amount as a setoff, counterclaim, or special damage is misplaced. The court correctly followed the dictates of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   in deducting from the security deposit the damages suffered by the defendant as a result of the tenant's failure to comply with her obligations under the lease. Accordingly, the court's findings were not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The defendant listed the following as damage items: rent; carpet cleaning; ceiling in front bedroom; furnace and oil gauge; repair of hole in carpet; repair of holes, fill in and paint walls-entire house; repair and replace tiles in bathroom; labor to pick up dog feces and mow lawn; back storm door; front storm door; mail box and repair post; take trash left on front lawn and in crawl space to dump; sewer bills; and water bills.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Section 47a-21 (d) (2) has since been amended by Public Acts 2016, No. 16-65, \u00a7 37, in ways that are irrelevant to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In reaching this conclusion, we need not determine what outcome might pertain if the court found that the landlord's itemization of damages and list of costs were merely a pretext for failure to return the security deposit, and we leave that issue for another day. In the case at hand, the plaintiff makes no such claim and we note, without deciding, that from the record, the landlord's assertion of damages, even those not proven, did not appear to be a mere pretext for her failure to return the security deposit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The plaintiff argues that the term \"shall\" invariably creates a mandatory duty unless the legislature specifies a contrary intention. Because we agree with the trial court that the defendant abided by the statutory requirements, we need not determine whether the use of the term \"shall\" creates a mandatory duty. We note, however, that the test is not as simple as the plaintiff argues. Although our Supreme Court has \"often stated [that] [d]efinite words, such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature ... [our Supreme Court also has] noted that the use of the word shall, though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Teresa T.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Ragaglia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593949\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/272/734/#p744\">\n     272 Conn. 734\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 744,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%20428\">\n     865 A.2d 428\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005). In determining whether the use of the word \"shall\" connotes a mandatory duty, the test to apply is \"whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience.... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory.... If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.... Such a statutory provision is one which prescribes what shall be done but does not invalidate action upon a failure to comply.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Statewide Grievance Committee\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Rozbicki\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523852\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/473/#p480\">\n     219 Conn. 473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 480-81,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%20819\">\n     595 A.2d 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1991), cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6570626,6570533,6570599,6570651,6570507,6570574,6570713,6570681,6570554,6570587,6570524,6570492\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/1094/\">\n     502 U.S. 1094\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20S.%20Ct.%201170\">\n     112 S.Ct. 1170\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20416\">\n     117 L.Ed.2d 416\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The plaintiff does dispute, as previously stated, whether she was responsible for any of this damage, and, therefore, whether the defendant was justified in deducting the damages from the security deposit.
