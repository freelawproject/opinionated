Broughton, Bobby Hag-gins, and Joe Davis Holifield, minors represented by their respective parents individually and as class representatives, brought this action against the Governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, and various Mobile County and City officials. Jurisdiction was alleged under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343(1) and (3), asserting rights protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988. Injunctive and declaratory relief was sought. A three-judge court was convened in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to restrain defendants and their agents and successors from depriving, under color of law, plaintiffs and others similarly situated of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment that the Alabama vagrancy statute is unconstitutional on a number of grounds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The facts are relatively clear and undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The three Negro minors, together with two companions not parties herein,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were engaged on November 21, 1968, in a handbilling campaign as volunteer workers for the Neighborhood Organized Workers (N.O.W.). The N.O.W. campaign was directed against the downtown Mobile white merchants who were alleged by the organization to be racially discriminatory employers. The message contained in handbills and on placards was addressed primarily to the Negro community and urged that Negroes refrain from making Christmas purchases from the merchants in an effort to pressure them economically into nondiscriminatory hiring.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reacting to the N.O.W. campaign, Mobile Police Chief James Robinson reassigned two Negro patrolmen, Officers Isaac George and Leon Smith, from their predominantly Negro beats to the vicinity of the N.O.W. campaign. Their instructions were to prevent sidewalk obstruction and to arrest any demonstrator who engaged in \u201cintimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">At the scene of the demonstration, the demonstrators were instructed by the officers to keep a six foot interval between themselves to avoid sidewalk obstruction. They complied. The officers then moved on, but returned shortly thereafter upon receipt of a complaint from an unidentified white woman who reported that Joe Davis Holifield had intimidated an unidentified Negro woman as she entered a white merchant\u2019s store. He was accused of telling the Negro woman she had better not be seen emerging with any purchases. He denied any such statement. Nevertheless, on the basis of the white woman\u2019s complaint, <em>all </em>of the demonstrators were arrested by Officer George, who informed them the charge was \u201ccity vagrancy\u201d and transported them to the city jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-15\">At the jail, Chief Robinson conferred with City Attorney Fred Collins and thereafter booked the formal charge as violation of the State vagrancy statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>rather than \u201ccity vagrancy.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bond for each demonstrator was set at $1000, despite a normal practice of release on no more than $300 bond. Subsequently, at varying times for over eight hours, two respected members of the Mobile community, a Negro grocer and a Negro physician who between them held property assessed in excess of $28,000 according to public records, attempted to secure the release of the young demonstrators. Only after a series of delays and denials during a period from approximately 2:00 P.M. until 11:15 P.M. were the plaintiffs finally released on bonds secured by the grocer and the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Plaintiffs, represented by counsel in the City Recorder\u2019s Court, demanded a jury trial. They were bound over to await action of the grand jury. Thereafter the instant suit was filed. One regularly scheduled grand jury term intervened before trial in this Court, but no indictment against the plaintiffs has been returned. When asked for the current posture of the cases, the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Mobile County officially certified them as \u201cawaiting action.\u201d Plaintiffs have been charged <em>generally </em>as \u201cvagrants\u201d; and no specification of the particular subsections upon which the criminal proceeding will be predicated has been officially made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">By answer to interrogatories propounded in the instant case, plaintiffs have learned that they will be prosecuted under section 437(1), (2) and (3). Defendants uniformly state, moreover, that they will rely upon proof that the plaintiffs each \u201cadmitted not working and not going to school, continuing [their] prior practice of loitering in public places\u201d in order to make out a prima facie case before reliance upon section 439.\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants also indicate that prosecution would involve the fourth alternative clause in section 439.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, on the basis of the interroga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tories, contend that this case is ripe for decision with respect to the facial validity of subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 437, as read in conjunction with section 439.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>The Tuscaloosa Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">A loosely-knit coalition of plaintiffs<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> bring this comprehensive class action seeking to vindicate the constitutional rights of the \u201cstudent community\u201d allegedly trenched upon by the Attorney General of Alabama, the Tuscaloosa County District Attorney, and the Tuscaloosa City Prosecuting Attorney. Jurisdiction is alleged under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343(3) and (4), asserting rights protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief as a bar to present or future enforcement of the State vagrancy statute and the enumerated ordinances. They also seek a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, that the State vagrancy statute and the enumerated city ordinances are so vague and overbroad as to be invalid on their face as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. A three-judge court was convened in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2283 and 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">At the outset, we are constrained to conclude that we are unable to entertain so much of the Tuscaloosa case as is predicated upon an attack on the city ordinances. Nowhere in the pleadings is there included the texts of the respective enumerated ordinance sections. The motion to dismiss filed by City Attorney Richard Shelby specifically notes that, while the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint attacks certain sections of the Code of Ordinances of Tuscaloosa, \u201cyet [it] fails to allege either the text or substance of the offending ordinances.\u201d In addition, City Attorney Shelby, in his Answer to the Complaint, notes that <em>no </em>justiciable controversy existed with respect to City Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 23-7 (disorderly houses) and 23-14 (loitering).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the above failure to specifi\u00e9ally append to their complaint an official copy of the relevant ordinance provisions, plaintiffs further failed to introduce certified copies thereof into evidence. Only plaintiffs\u2019 brief contains any attempt to reproduce the enumerated ordinance sections. The pleadings and evidence being wholly lacking of any official or certified copy of the relevant ordinances under attack, we conclude that we are legally precluded in the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>sence of statutory authorization from taking judicial notice of such ordinances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Relief must be denied as to so much of the complaint as pertains to the Tuscaloosa ordinances for failure of plaintiffs to plead or prove the ordinances under which they were arrested and charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">With the justiciable controversy before us limited to the attacks upon the State vagrancy statute, we proceed to a consideration of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On Friday, October 4, 1968, Tuscaloosa police officers, possessing a search warrant for narcotics, made a raid on a curio shop (the \u201cHaight Hut\u201d), licensed under State and city law and catering to what might be generally described as \u201cmod\u201d or \u201chippy\u201d clientele. The law enforcement officials presented the search warrant to Robert Ford, a co-owner of the shop and a university student.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pursuant to the warrant, the officers searched the premises for evidence of L.S.D., amphetamines and other illegal drugs for which the warrant had been secured. Bud G. Silvis, a co-owner of the shop and a university chemistry student, was arrested on a narcotics charge and certain chemicals found in the shop were seized, together with assorted items apparently from shop inventory.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Simultaneously with the narcotics raid, the law enforcement officers searched and subsequently arrested Ford, Ford\u2019s wife Peggy, Mr. and Mrs. William Moody (friends of the Fords), Harold Ledbetter, Michael Stambaugh, and an unidentified student and his date (neither of whom are parties to this case). The arresting officers, after taking the above-named individuals (all of whom are university students) to the police station and conducting a thorough, though apparently fruitless, search of each of them, charged each of them with \u201cvagrancy.\u201d The charges against Ledbetter, Stambaugh, and the two unidentified students were dropped prior to committal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">On October 11, 1968, the Fords and the Moodys appeared in Tuscaloosa County Court. They were told by Judge Mayfield that their cases had not been docketed or, if they had been, that the Sheriff of Tuscaloosa County had not brought the warrants to court. They were told to return on October 17, 1968. They again discovered their cases had not been docketed. Although they have made a number of inquiries, individually and through legal counsel, they have continually received evasive answers from all sources; and, at the time of this trial, they were unable to state with precision either the nature of the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>against them or the posture of their cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Defendants, during testimony at trial, were also unable to inform the court just what was the nature of the charges against the Haight Hut plaintiffs or what is the posture of their individual cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Pursuant to Rule 23(c) (1), Fed. R.Civ.P., \u201cas soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so maintained.\u201d To be maintainable as a class action, a suit must meet all of the requirements set out in section 23(a) and also fall within the ambit of at least one subsection of section 23(b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Following the <em>Eisen </em>guidelines, we determine that the named plaintiffs in <em>Broughton </em>(the Mobile ease) are adequate representatives of a class consisting of all persons whose poverty or lack of apparent means of livelihood renders them susceptible to arrest under the present Alabama vagrancy laws, and against whom the vagrancy laws have been or may be applied to repress constitutionally protected rights of free expression. See Smith v. Hill, E.D.N.C. 1968, 285 F.Supp. 556, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Likewise, based upon <em>Eisen, </em>we determine that the Fords, the Moodys, Konda, Ledbetter and Stambaugh are adequate representatives of a class consisting of all persons whose particular activities or unorthodox way of life renders them susceptible to arrest under the Alabama vagrancy laws <em>on suspicion only </em>(rather than probable cause), and particularly of students against whom the vagrancy laws have been or may be applied in derogation of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">With the respective classes defined, our next consideration is the various motions to dismiss filed by the defendants in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Motions to dismiss were individually or jointly filed in <em>Broughton </em>by the Governor of Alabama, by the Attorney General and the Chief of Police of Mobile, by the Sheriff of Mobile County, and by the District Attorney of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit (Mobile County). In many respects, these motions substantially parallel each other.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The facts in <em>Broughton </em>clearly reveal that Chief Robinson was directly responsible for the arrests, charges and bail involved in the case. City Attorney Collins advised him at least with respect to the setting of bail. Mayor Mims is the chief executive officer of Mobile and is responsible for the conduct of his law enforcement officials. Since the cases against the three plaintiffs are \u201cawaiting action\u201d before the grand jury, District Attorney Booth may well be called upon to prosecute them. The Governor and Attorney General of Alabama are responsible for enforcement of all State criminal laws and exercise at least constructive authority over statewide application thereof. Only Sheriff Bridges has been conclusively shown, by the pleadings and the evidence, to have had absolutely nothing to do with the <em>Broughton </em>case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">For the above reasons,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the various motions to dismiss in <em>Broughton </em>are denied, except as to Sheriff Bridges, which motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In the <em>Baines </em>case, only defendant Richard Shelby, Tuscaloosa City Attorney, filed a motion to dismiss. We previously noted that he expressly challenged plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead \u201cthe text or substance of the offending ordinances.\u201d The Attorney General of Alabama and the District Attorney of Tuscaloosa County filed answers to the complaint, generally denying that the State statute was either unconstitutional on its face or as applied, and generally averring that the complaint fails to state a claim against them individually upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Because we have denied relief on the merits as to so much of the complaint as is predicated on city ordinances neither pleaded nor proved, we find it unnecessary to rule on the motion to dismiss of City Attorney Shelby.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The test applied to a rule 12(b) (6) motion is well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cIn appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 45, 46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80; <em>See generally </em>2A Moore, Federal Practice ff 12.08, p. 2245 n. 6 (1968 ed.). Applying this standard to the answers of the Attorney General and the Tuscaloosa County District Attorney, we are bound to deny their threshold defenses. The answer of District Attorney Lackey implicitly admits that he applied the vagrancy statute to the Haight Hut plaintiffs. The Attorney General, as chief State law officer, defends as constitutional on its face the State statute, though he disclaims any actual knowledge of the application thereof to the particular plaintiffs during the Haight Hut narcotics raid. The rule 12(b) (6) motions, contained in defendants\u2019 answers to so much of the complaint as pertains to the State vagrancy statute, are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">The <em>Broughton </em>defendants contend that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 bars any grant by this court of the injunctive relief against State court prosecution sought by plaintiffs. The question was not raised in <em>Baines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">The facts appear to indicate that no State court proceedings were presently pending in either ease when these suits were filed. It would appear, though we need not decide the question in light of our decision on the merits, that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 is inapposite.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Certainly the anti-injunction statute has no application where bad faith prosecution is merely threatened.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">In light of our declaratory judgment, <em>infra, </em>on the merits prior to the matters coming before any State court to be determined, we find it unnecessary to grant the injunctive relief sought in either <em>Broughton </em>or <em>Baines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">The questions of abstention and injunctive relief are different.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In a case of claimed overbreadth of a statute, the Supreme Court has held \u201cthat a federal district court has the duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction.\u201d Zwickler v. Koota, <em>supra </em>n. 23. We find this duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>particularly compelling here because no State court is presently in a position to decide the validity of the vagrancy statute and our abstention would force litigants to vindicate their constitutional rights by submission to a later criminal proceeding. <em>See </em>McDonald v. Brewer, N.D.Ala.1968, 295 F.Supp. 1135 [May 21, 1968].</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">In <em>Broughton, </em>plaintiffs attack the vagrancy statute on a plethora of constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Likewise, in <em>Baines, </em>plaintiffs attack the State statute on due process, equal protection and reversal of the presumption of innocence grounds, as well as on availability to those seeking to suppress free expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Our consideration of the merits can be brief. The plaintiffs in both <em>Broughton </em>and <em>Baines </em>were charged simply with \"vagrancy,\u201d although the <em>Broughton </em>plaintiffs did succeed, through interrogatories in this civil case, in ascertaining which subsections were applicable to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">For several reasons, we conclude that section 437 cannot be construed alone or, for that matter, only in light of State court interpretations narrowing its application. <em>Cf. </em>Wright v. City of Montgomery, 5 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 867 [Jan. 27, 1969]. Alabama criminal procedure must also be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">First, we note that the definition of a \u201cvagrant\u201d is used disjunctively, <em>i. e., </em>a person merely falling within the scope of but one of thirteen subsections in section 437 may be found guilty of the criminal offense. Brannon v. State, 1917, 16 Ala.App. 259, 76 So. 991. Second, a complaint is sufficient, under current Alabama procedure, if it simply charges that \u201cA.B. is a vagrant.\u201d <em>See </em>note 6, <em>supra. </em>Third, we note that proof of vagrancy need only be adduced at trial under any one of the thirteen subsections under which the State chooses to prosecute. Flandell v. State, 1944, 31 Ala.App. 520, 19 So.2d 401. Fourth, Alabama criminal procedure does not provide an accused with a right to a bill of particulars whereby he may narrow the application of section 437 to the precise subsections to be applied against him. <em>See </em>note 6, <em>supra. </em>Collier v. State, 1918, 16 Ala.App. 425, 78 So. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In light of the interaction of the substantive statutory offense and Alabama criminal procedure, we find it necessary to consider but one of the numerous constitutional challenges to the statute, alleged by plaintiffs in both cases.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">We hold and declare that section 437 of Tit. 14, Code of Alabama, 1940 in its entirety, when considered with applicable Alabama criminal procedural law, is so vague that it violates the fair notice requirements of due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and is unconstitutional and void.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">According to evidence introduced at trial, it is not clear that any plaintiff charged with vagrancy under the State statute has a State court proceeding pending against him. This court finds it unnecessary to consider the request made for injunctive relief against future State prosecution.

Although involving unrelated activity by city police at an off-campus demonstration and in conjunction with a narcotics raid separated by three weeks time and affecting different plaintiffs, the <em>Baines complaint </em>was predicated upon a First Amendment theory implying, in effect, that the Tuscaloosa police were engaged in a concerted campaign to suppress free expression by the student community. On its face the complaint may be sufficient to support a class, represented by the diverse plaintiffs, constituting the entire student community. Yet, Fed.R.Oiv.P. 23(c)(1) states: \u201cAn order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may. be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.\u201d We are constrained to narrow the originally asserted class after reviewing the pleadings and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">First, for failure to plead and prove the relevant ordinances, the challenges to the several Tuscaloosa ordinances are no longer material to a decision on the merits of this case. Second, the State statute was used <em>not in </em>the <em>context </em>of a First Amendment protected activity such as occurred in <em>Broughton, </em>but rather as a \u201ccatch-all\u201d charge on which to make simultaneous arrests and searches of suspicious persons at the scene of a narcotics raid. Finally, the individual plaintiffs seeking to represent the student community as \u201capprehensive\u201d about engaging in First Amendment protected activities include not only the Haight Hut plaintiffs who attended the rally at which Baines and Phillips were arrested for ordinance violations, but also four individuals who were wholly uninvolved in the Haight Hut incident and who were merely present at the later rally.

Each avers that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; that the vagrancy statute relates to individual conduct and cannot be challenged by class action; that plaintiffs simply may not maintain their suit as a class action (presumably, though never amplified, on some basis grounded in Fed.R.Civ.P. 23) ; that the complaint shows a pending State court prosecution is underway and relief must be confined to State court; that all matters of defense to a State court prosecution, including challenges based upon federal constitutional claims, should be considered and determined in State courts; that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 precludes federal court injunction of State court proceedings; and that the plaintiffs have adequate remedies in State court. In addition, the motion by the Governor and Attorney General contends that the 5-day notice provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284 was not complied with so that they should be dropped from the case; and it notes that the complaint merely named them in their official capacities, implying that there was no enumeration of any action on their part with regard to the factual application of the State statute. Similar contentions are made by all other defendants, with Chief Robinson claiming that the sole allegation as to him is that he set the bail of each plaintiff at $1000. Only Sheriff Bridges\u2019 motion expressly disclaims <em>any </em>involvement in the vagrancy arrests and <em>any </em>past attempt to apply the vagrancy statute against the plaintiffs or their class. Finally, the motion of the Mobile City officials asserts that this Court is without jurisdiction in this case since the complaint fails to raise either a substantial claim of statutory unconstitutionality or a substantial federal question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\">.
