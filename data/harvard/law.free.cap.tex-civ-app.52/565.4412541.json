San Antonio &amp; A. P. Ry. v. Robinson, 73 Texas, 284; Baker v. Ashe, 80 Texas, 360; Taylor B. &amp; H. Ry. Co. v. Warner, 88 Texas, 647; Emerson v. Mills, 83 Texas, 388; Houston, E. &amp; W. T. Ry. v. Hardy, 61 Texas, 232.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-4\">A charge that if defendant\u2019s servants failed to warn plaintiff of the approach of an engine so that plaintiff could have gotten to a place of safety, as an ordinarily prudent person would have done under like circumstances, is in effect an instruction that an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances would have warned plaintiff of the approach of the engine and thus assumes a fact in dispute, and is therefore a charge on the weight of the evidence. Texas &amp; P. Ry. v. Roberts, 20 S. W., 960; Drumm S. &amp; F. Co. v. Bell, 29 S. W., 796; Austin v. Talk, 26 Texas, 130; Johnson v. Ry., 21 S.

The court having sustained defendant\u2019s objections to the remark made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his closing address and instructed the jury to disregard it, we must presume the jury heeded the court\u2019s instruction and that the remark did not affect the verdict. (San Antonio Traction Co. v. Parks, 97 S. W., 510; De La Vergne etc. Co. v. Stahl, 24 Texas Civ. App., 471; Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. v. Smith, 24 Texas Civ. App., 127; Brown v. Perez, 89 Texas, 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">2. When all parts of the charge which have reference to the subject matter of that part complained of by the third assignment of error, are read and considered together (as must be done, Rost v. M. P. Ry. Co., 76 Texas, 168; Dallas Consol. Elect. Ry. Co. v. English, 93 S. W.,1098; Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. v. Blachley, 109 S. W., 998), the part complained of is not obnoxious to the objections urged. The three grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>of negligence alleged by plaintiff, and which, the evidence tended to prove, were plainly submitted by the charge. Its meaning is clear, that if plaintiff was injured as alleged and defendant\u2019s servants operating the engine were guilty of any or all of the acts alleged by him, whether they be regarded as acts of commission or omission, and if such acts, or any of them, were negligence, and, if negligent, such negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, he was, if free from contributory negligence, entitled to recover. No fact is assumed by the charge, but every essential one alleged is left'to the jury\u2019s determination, as well as the question, if plaintiff was injured, whether the facts alleged as negligence, if proved, <em>in fact, </em>constituted negligence, and, \"if negligence, whether it was the proximate eause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">3. To have given defendant\u2019s special charge No. 3, the refusal of which is complained of by the fourth assignment, would have deprived the plaintiff of any right he may have had of recovery on the ground of discovered peril, which is not affected by contributory negligence. (Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Breadow, 90 Texas, 26; Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Staggs, 90 Texas, 461; Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Murray, 99 S. W., 144; San Antonio Traction Co. v. Kelleher, 107 S. W., 65.) By the fifth paragraph of the main charge the jury was instructed, that \u201cIt was the duty of the plaintiff to use ordinary care to'prevent injury to himself, and if you believe from the evidence that as the train approached him, he knew of the approach of same, or would have known of it by the use of ordinary care, and that he continued to stand where he was or moved nearer to the track, and that in so doing \u2014 if you find that he did so \u2014 he was guilty of negligence, and such negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of his injuries, if any; or, if you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff heard the approach of the engine, and that he failed to look and see which track said engine was taking, and that such failure, if any, on his part was negligence, and such negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of his injuries, if any, then in either of these events \u2014 if you so find \u2014 you must return a verdiet for the defendant, unless you find for the plaintiff under paragraph III of this charge.\u201d This presented the defenses of contributory negligence, as pleaded by defendant, as favorably as it had any right to demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">4. Our conclusions of fact dispose of the fifth assignment of error adversely to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">There is no error in the judgment and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>Affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
