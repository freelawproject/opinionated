Green, Lib Hart and Mildred Hart, surviving wife and children respectively of C. C. Hart, who died intestate on November 6, 1889, brought this suit of trespass to try title to recover from the' appellees a tract of land situated in Hood County, and to have declared void two certain judgments of the District Court of that county in favor of G. A. Rucker, wherein the title had been divested out of these plaintiffs and vested in the said Rucker. Issue was properly joined and a trial had before the court, which resulted in a judgment in favor of the defendants, and the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">C. C. Hart died seized of the lands in controversy, but appellants can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>not recover unless they succeed in avoiding the two judgments referred to and hereafter set out. The validity of the first judgment, which for convenience will be referred to as judgment in cause No. 948, is first attacked by an objection to the same when offered in evidence by appellees. The judgment itself is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-3\">\u201cS. A. Hart v. J. E. Arrington et al., under date of October 10, 1895.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADp\">\u201cThis day this cause coming on to be heard the plaintiffs appeared by attorneys, the intervener 6. A. Eucker appeared by attorney, and the defendants J. E. Arrington and J. C. Archer appeared in person and disclaimed any interest in the subject matter of the suit, and the defendants A. J. Eigsby and John Kuykendall appeared not, but wholly made default, though they were duly and legally served to appear, and it appearing that the defendants Hal Caulder and Ed Caulder, and Ft. Worth &amp; Eio Grande Eailroad Company, have not been cited, plaintiffs and intervener discontinue their suit as to them. A jury being waived, all matters of facts as well as of law were submitted to the court, who, after hearing all the evidence and argument of counsel, is of the opinion that the plaintiffs Mrs. S. A. Hart, and Lib Hart, and Mildred Hart, and the intervener G. A. Eucker, do have and recover of the defendants A. J. Eigsby and John Kuykendall all the right, title and interest which they have in and to the following described tract of land, to wit: All the land described in plaintiff\u2019s petition, and that all the title which the said A. J. Eigsby and John Kuykendall have in said tract of land be divested out of them and vested in the plaintiffs and intervener, and that they have their writ of possession against said defendants; and further, that the defendants J. E. Arrington and J. C. Archer go hence without day and recover of plaintiffs and intervener their costs of suit, for which let execution issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cThe court further finds that the plaintiffs, Mrs. S. A. Hart and Lib Hart and Mildred Hart, through their attorneys of record A. E. Cushman and Eiddle &amp; Martin, have entered into an agreed judgment and compromise with the intervener G. A. Eucker, as to the disposition of the land involved in this suit, and the court, after carefully examining the same, finds it to be for the best interests of the plaintiffs that said agreement and compromise be made, approves the same and enters his decree upon said agreement and compromise. It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the plaintiffs Mrs. S. A. Hart, Lib Hart and Mildred Hart, do have and recover of the intervener, G. A. Eucker, the following described tract of land, being a portion of the 1160-acre survey of land in Hood County, Texas, patented to Pleasant Thorp, assignee of J ames S.

Rucker all costs in this behalf expended, for which let execution issue. It is further ordered that the said G. A. Rucker have his writ of possession for the above described tract of land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The suit of S. A. Hart v. J. E. Arrington et al., Eo. 948, was an action by the present plaintiff, S. A. Green, for herself and as next friend for the other plaintiffs in this case, then minors, to recover the land in controversy from the defendants therein, and was instituted by a firm of attorneys under a contract entered into with Mrs. Green, whereby she agreed to convey to said attorneys one-half of all lands which they might recover for herself and children. G. A. Rucker intervened in the suit and claimed the land as against the plaintiffs and defendants, but no citation was ever issued or served on the plaintiffs and no guardian <em>ad litem </em>was ever appointed by the court to represent the minors, and no answer of any kind was ever filed by the plaintiffs after such intervention, nor was there any power of attorney filed among the papers authorizing the attorneys of plaintiffs to confess judgment, and for. these reasons appellants objected to the introduction of the judgment in evidence, and now insist that the overruling of such objection was error. The propositions under the assignment presenting this question also raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>in a general way the objection that the judgment was obtained through fraud by means of a conspiracy between the attorneys for plaintiff and the intervener, and such an objection appears to have been made to the evidence when offered, but it is a sufficient reply to this objection to say that fraud, which, of course, would hardly appear upon the face of the record, must be shown by extrinsic evidence to be weighed by the court or jury trying the case, and could not therefore constitute an objection to the introduction of the judgment in evidence. (Maverick v. Salinas, 15 Texas, 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">The objection first stated, however, requires us to determine whether or not it was necessary for the plaintiffs in cause Ho. 948 to be served with a citation on the intervener\u2019s pleadings, seeing that the judgment recites that the plaintiffs \u201cappeared by attorneys.\u201d We have resolved this question in the negative. Under article 3498u, Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes, appellant Mrs. Green, as next friend to her minor children, was authorized to institute the suit, and in prosecuting it she had the same rights as though she had been the guardian of such minors, with certain exceptions which do not affect this controversy. This, we take it, placed the minors upon the same footing with other litigants and removes from the consideration any question of the effect of their nonage.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">But this conclusion only brings us to a consideration of the real question presented by appellants, and that is that all of the plaintiffs in that case, including the mother, should have been cited to answer the intervention, and the case of Harris v. Schlinke, 95 Texas, 88, and the line of cases following it, are pressed upon us as being decisive of the matter. But with that decision there can be no quarrel in this, as the following excerpt from the opinion stating the only question before the court will show: \u201cThe only question presented in this case is, Did the court have jurisdiction of the plaintiffs in this suit to render judgment against them upon the cross-bill filed by the defendant Schlinke, there being no service upon the plaintiffs, they not having appeared in the case after the cross-bill Was filed?\u201d And so, in the other authorities cited by appellants, a service upon the opposite party of the new cause of action pleaded was only required in those cases where there was not an appearance, and in the nature of things this must be so, since undoubtedly service of citation is waived by a legal appearance. See Smithers v. Smith, 35 Texas Civ. App., 508; Mueller v. Heidemeyer, 49 Texas Civ. App., 259, in each of which cases a writ of error was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We think the judgment on its face sufficiently disposes of the subject matter and of the parties, and is not subject to any of the objections urged in appellants\u2019 brief, and the court therefore committed no error in admitting it in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The refusal of the court to vacate the judgment is made the next ground of attack, but in this, too, we rule against appellants. Without deciding whether this is a direct or a collateral attack on the judgment (see Scudder v. Cox, 35 Texas Civ. App., 416, and authorities there cited), but treating it as a direct attack for fraud, we are of the opinion that not only is the finding of the court upon that issue supported, but in fact we find no evidence whatever of fraud on the part of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in that case. The charge of fraud ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>pears to grow out of the fact that the attorneys for plaintiffs entered into the agreement shown in the judgment, whereby the intervener, Rucker, should recover one-half of the land, when perhaps Rucker could not upon a trial have recovered anything, as an effective means of divesting the title of the minor children to the land awarded to Rucker, which was immediately thereafter conveyed to the attorneys as their share. of the recovery under the contract with Mrs.\" Hart. The testimony shows that the whole matter was fully explained to the district judge, and the most, therefore, that can be said of it is that the proceedings were irregul\u00e1r, but it may be doubted that even this is true, in view of article 3498v, Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes, which reads as follows: \u201cSuch next friend, or the attorney of record of such minor may enter into such agreed judgment or compromise in such suit as the court may approve, and the decree entered upon such agreement or compromise, when approved by the court, shall be forever binding on said minor, and can divest title out of the minor or vest it in him, when the court is satisfied such decree is for the best interest of the minor under all the circumstances ; and the court may hear evidence touching upon such agreement or compromise before approving the same.\u201d 1</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">These conclusions result in an affirmance of the judgment as to those appellees claiming only the lands involved in cause Ho. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The second judgment, attacked both by an objection to the evidence and error to the court\u2019s failure to vacate it, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cC.

(Stanley v. King, 45 Texas Civ. App., 414; Houston, E. &amp; W. T. Ry. Co. v. Skeeter Bros., 44 Texas Civ. App., 105; Watt v. Parlin &amp; Orendorff Co., 44 Texas Civ. App., 438.) It would appear upon sound reason that a judgment rendered where no case has been stated or attempted, to be stated, is as much a judgment upon a matter <em>coram non judice, </em>whatever may be the jurisdiction of the court rendering it, as a judgment upon a case, however perfectly stated, before a court not authorized to hear and determine it. In such a case, as where the record affirmatively shows a want of jurisdiction over the parties or subject matter, the judgment ought, we think, to be treated as a nullity, both on direct and collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">It follows from this that the judgment of the District Court of Hood County must be reversed as between these appellants and those appellees claiming the lands awarded to Bucker in the judgment rendered in cause Ho. 996, and there being no contention that such appellees have title except upon the theory of the validity of such judgment, judgment is here rendered in favor of appellants as to so much of the lands in controversy. Affirmed in part and reversed and rendered in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">OPINION ON MOTION POR REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On this motion for rehearing .by those appellees as against whom we reversed and rendered judgment in appellants\u2019 favor, our attention has been called to the fact that in the court below there were certain pleas seeking a recovery for improvements in good faith, and it therefore becomes our duty to remand this branch of the case for a trial upon that issue. It can not be held, as matter of law, that these appellees can not recover for their improvements made in good'faith merely because they claim title under a void judgment. See Hetzorg v. Green, 26 Texas Civ. App., 119, and cases there cited. Since the cause is to be remanded these appellees will also have an opportunity to be heard on their plea over against their warrantors. The cause is therefore remanded for trial upon the above issues only. Motion, granted in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in par\u00ed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
