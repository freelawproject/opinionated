The evidence shows that appellee at the time of his injuries was working upon a scaffold erected by himself and another by the command of W. H. Gilmartin, one of the appellants, for the purpose of removing material from the walls of a building that appellants, as contractors, had. undertaken to remove. Appellee charged that the scaffold was insufficient for the labor required of him, and that appellants were guilty of negligence in failing to provide him with a safe place to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">Appellants pleaded that appellee was an experienced laborer in the character of work he was doing, and an experienced and competent 'scaffold builder, and fully understood whatever insufficiency there was, if any, in the scaffold, and knew and fully understood the danger involved in its use, and therefore assumed the risk of the injuries of which he complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">The vital question presented to us is the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment. Ye quote the following extracts from appellee\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-15\">\u201cMy name is Sam Kilgore; am thirty-nine years of age \u2014 forty years old the 17th of next July. I got hurt last spring. Am about six feet tall. Before I got hurt I weighed 220. At the time I got hurt I was working for Gilmartin and Tierney- \u2014 W. H. and Dan. Last spring, about the 20th or 22d of May, on the evening of the 22d, he (Gilmartin) ordered me to build a scaffold to take down some brick down here at the old drugstore that got burned out; ... he says, \u2018y\u00b0u are an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>experienced scaffold builder, I will get yo\u00fa to build it;\u2019 ... I says, \u2018I will have to have somebody to help me;\u2019 he says, \u2018Get two men to help you,\u2019 and I got two men to help me and started to build the scaffold; I says, \u2018What you going to build the scaffold for?\u2019 He says, \u2018Just to take down that brick back there- \u2014 just a light scaffold \u2014 just build a light scaffold \u2014 just a couple of men on it;\u2019 I says, \u2018All right.\u2019 I taken a two-by-twelve and nailed that to the upright or girder that runs through the building, and then put up uprights two by twelve on the other end against the brick wall, and made it substantial on the girder below that was in the basement; that was on the inside, and I was nailing the centers and had the boys holding it, and he says \u2018Two or three spikes in each one will do; don\u2019t be there all day;\u2019 I says, \u2018All right; I will get it up as quick as I can\u2019 \u2014 Gilmartin said that; that was his orders, standing right there until I got the scaffold done; he says, Tt is only just for to take down those brick of that wall, to keep them from falling on anybody, down to that big iron lintel;\u2019 I says, \u2018All right;\u2019 I can\u2019t always dictate with a man about a scaffold because I never had a scaffold fall in my life, and I have worked all over the country on scaffolds; he says, \u2018Just to take that brick down;\u2019 and I went ahead and built it like he instructed inc; we taken the brick down; I got on the scaffold and helped them take down and laid them on the joists; as soon as we got the brick down \u2014 we got them down quickly \u2014 he goes ahead and says, \u2018Let\u2019s take that lintel;\u2019 I says, \u2018The scaffold ain\u2019t sufficient to take'dhat lintel down; that lintel weighs about twelve or fourteen hundred pounds;\u2019 he says, \u2018Well, we can take it off the wall and lay it over here;\u2019 I says, \u2018All right,\u2019 and me and two more fellows got there and . . . We eased it down to the studding,, and he turned around after we got that , . . . He says, \u2018I want that lintel up here;\u2019 from there over there it was about fourteen feet back to the wall and the landing on the main joists of the building; .he says, \u2018I want the lintel'here;\u2019 he says, \u2018The best way to get that up here is to get some plank, and let\u2019s lay up a string of plank and drag it up here;\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018Just as .you say; I am here under your' orders;\u2019 but the lintel is a big bow in like a cradle \u2014like a bellows, ( ), \u2014 and it was on that side, and we could not turn it over at the place where it was,' and he ordered it turned over; well, we turned it over, and it jarred the scaffold pretty well, and we all started to pull it.; we pulled it up to the place where we was .going te lift it and land it,' but \u2018Ho,\u2019 I. says, \u2018that is as far as we can go;\u2019 I says, \u2018What can we do now?\u2019 He says, \u2018Well, just take the rope off; we can lift it up;\u2019 I says, \u2018As soon as you,put your men down here \u2014 enough men to get around this to lift it up over there \u2014 this scaffold is going to break;\u2019 I says,.\u2018There is too many plank on here, and it is -not strong enough;\u2019 he says, \u20180-,\u2019 (speaking in his way, rashly) \u201cit is sufficient,\u2019 and he jumped down himself, and with four or five other men down on there, and me down there \u2014 that makes seven or eight men on the scaf<em>fold </em>\u2014 we all got around it, and he got around it himself, and I toted on the load next to the landing, and he says, \u2018Give the word, and we will lift;\u2019 I says, \u2018I am a little feared on this scaffold, but, if we go we go, that is all; you are here with us \u2014 makes it safer, and lift quicker;\u2019 I give the word and made a lift at this lintel on the scaffold, and we failed to lift it that time; I straightened up- and.I says, \u2018Boys, you haven\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>done nothing; let\u2019s lift this thing away; don\u2019t be afeared of the scaffold; if it is going to fall it will fall; the man that is paying you is on here;\u2019 everybody got around, and me and he both give the word at the same time, \u2018Lift,\u2019 and we never did remember coming up; it went down; just broke a two-by-twelve right half in two and went down. . . . The stringer broke half in two, right at the middle. . . . The nails did not pull out; it just snapped right half in two; had too much load right at the place; they was all right in one place, and lifting in a bunch, and the length of the plank from the other pudlock made all that weight on that, and that heavy lintel and seven or eight men, when we made the spring to lift we threw more forcible power \u2014 you know it just snapped right half in two. . . . When 1 called attention to Mr. Gil-martin that I was afraid the scaffold was not sufficient for the heavy weight, he says, \u20180, hell; it was plenty; it was good enough,\u2019 and just jumped down himself to show it was good enough; that he would risk himself; that we ought to risk ourselves on it; and got hold of the end of the thing himself, and went down in the basement himself. Except for his orders to put that heavy lintel on the platform I would not have done it. . . . The business I generally follow is scaffolding and cement finisher, cement work, concrete, . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On cross-examination appellee testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cGilmartin told me to build that scaffold because I was, an experienced scaffold builder;. he knew I was, because I had just finished a building, and I had worked for him off and on four or five years; 1 had built scaffolds when I worked for him. I had worked for other contractors in the last ten years \u2014 for every contractor in Fort Worth \u2014 built scaffolds for them; used to build scaffolds for Brice. I was actually an experienced scaffold builder; I knew how to build them, and how strong to build them, and all about it, I was probably just as good a scaffold builder, if not better, than Gilmartin himself; 1 was better. I built this scaffold, and before I got on it to move that lintel I told Gilmartin that I didn\u2019t think it was safe \u2014 that I thought it was too weak; I thought it would break with me; he had the scaffold built to take a few bricks down; he did not have it to lift the lintel at all. When I went to remove the lintel I protested, and told him I thought it was too weak\u2014 that I didn\u2019t think it would hold the lintel; but 1 did go ahead and attempt to move it; he told us to go ahead, and, of course, he was paying us, and I just kept on. I could have quit his work if I had wanted to, but I knowed it was not no use to quit when there was a lot of men there ready to go to work right in my place. I could have quit if I wanted to.\u201d Q. \u201cIf Gilmartin had told, you to jump out of one of those windows, and you knew it was not safe to jump out, you would quit before you would jump, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d A. \u201cWell, that ain\u2019t any question.\u201d \u2022 Q. \u201cYou would not have jumped out of the window because he told you to?\u201d A. \u201cNo, I guess not; if it would not have been so high I expect I would. If it had been away up yonder, four or five stories, I would have quit him before I would have jumped. I knew this scaffold was not safe to move this lintel; at least, I did not think it was. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We see no escape from the conclusion that appellee, in law and in fact, voluntarily assumed the risk of the injuries he received. In eases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>where an employe, such as was appellee, undertakes a work with full knowledge of the defect of which he complains, and with full knowledge of the danger involved in its use, and with time for deliberation, he is held to have assumed the risk of a resulting injury, notwithstanding the work may have been performed over his protest and by the express command of the master.
