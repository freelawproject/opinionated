The statute laws of Arkansas provide as follows: \u201cIt shall be lawful for married women to make executory contracts and to execute letters of attorney containing a power to convey real estate as agent or attorney, which shall have the same force and effect as those made by unmarried women. Kirby\u2019s Digest, sec. 5209.\u201d Other provisions of the Arkansas law (Kirby\u2019s Digest, secs. 5214, 5217, 5219 and 5220) were pleaded and proved. Lex loci contractus controls. Merrieles v. State Bank, 5 Texas Civ. App., 483; Life Ass\u2019n v. Harris, 94 Texas, 34, 35. This contract is enforcible under the laws of Arkansas, the common law disability of coverture having been removed by statute. Roberts v. Wilcoxon, 36 Ark., 355; 43 Ark., 29; 47 Ark., 235; Abbott v.

The facts show that the consideration for the note was a previous debt due to the appellant from the husband of the appellee, and for the payment of which this note was given. The testimony also shows that the appellee at the time of the execution of the note was a married woman residing in Bowie County, Texas. We think under her plea and proof of coverture she is amply protected against any liability upon the note. There was no dispute as to those facts, and there can be no doubt as to the application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
