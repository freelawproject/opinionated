The new provision would prohibit abortion with three exceptions. The exceptions, in which abortion would not be prohibited, are to prevent the death of the pregnant woman and in reported cases of rape or incest. The new provision would prohibit state or local government authorization, support or funding of abortions that are outside the three exceptions. The new provision does not itself establish penalties or sanctions for persons who are involved with prohibited abortions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Each petitioner alleges that the ballot title does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and each petitioner suggests alternative language. ORS 250.085(2). In addressing these contentions, we review the ballot title for \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"Au6\">(Subject of the Measure)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Petitioners Klauss and Gernegliaro argue that the Caption does not \u201creasonably identify\u201d the subject of the measure because \u201cthe subject matter is the elimination of rights.\u201d It is true that the <em>effect </em>of the measure <em>may </em>be to prohibit certain presently permissible activity. Nonetheless, the subject matter of the measure is the prohibition of abortion, the Caption states as much, and it thus complies with the requirements of ORS 250.085(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">THE QUESTION</p>\n<p id=\"A9h\">(Chief Purpose of the Measure)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Petitioners Klauss and Gernegliaro again assert that the question does not \u201cplainly phrase the chief purpose of the measure\u201d and that it is \u201cpartial and inaccurate\u201d because it fails to inform voters that the chief purpose of the measure is \u201cto unconstitutionally restrict existing rights.\u201d The \u201cchief purpose\u201d of a measure is the most significant aim or end which a measure is designed to achieve. <em>Reed v. Roberts, </em>304 Or 649, 654, 748 P2d 542 (1988). As we stated above, although an effect may be to prohibit certain presently permissible activity, the measure is designed to prohibit abortion. There is no plainer way to state it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Petitioner Oregon Citizen\u2019s Alliance claims that the term \u201cpregnant woman\u201d in the question should be replaced by \u201cmother\u201d because the term \u201cmother\u201d is the language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>measure and would thus \u201cbe the controlling constitutional language in case the measure were adopted.\u201d The Attorney General responds by stating that \u201c[s]ince without doubt all will agree that the proponents\u2019 \u2018mothers\u2019 are pregnant women, the ballot title properly uses the accurate and neutral term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">There is no doubt that only pregnant women can obtain abortions. The Attorney General\u2019s wording adequately explains the chief purpose of the measure. The issues of when life begins or when someone becomes a mother are not decided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">THE EXPLANATION</p>\n<p id=\"ASh\">(Summary and Major Effect)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Petitioners Klauss and Gernegliaro renew their arguments about elimination of rights, stating that the measure \u201cattempts to take away a woman\u2019s right to be free form [sic] gender based discrimination.\u201d As the Attorney General correctly points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cAssuming <em>arguendo </em>that the measure would \u2018take away a woman\u2019s right to be free from gender based discrimination,\u2019 it would do so only by eliminating or limiting her right and opportunity to have an abortion. Thus, nothing is left unsaid when the ballot title informs voters of what the measure does.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Petitioner Oregon Citizen\u2019s Alliance maintains that the Explanation should include the phrase \u201c[m]akes abortion for reasons of social convenience, which are outside the three exceptions, against public policy\u201d because this statement more accurately summarizes the measure and its major effect. They further maintain that the phrase \u201cin which abortion would not be prohibited\u201d in the third sentence is \u201cunnecessary verbiage.\u201d The measure does not purport to make a statement about public policy; it simply prohibits certain activities. With respect to this petitioner\u2019s second complaint, because the disputed language substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1)(c), we see no reason to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Petitioner Kane objects to the last two sentences of the Explanation as conjecture and speculation. We agree with Petitioner Kane that the last two sentences of the Explanation are conjecture. In this case, we have a situation where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>major effect of the measure corresponds directly with its purpose. Although it is possible to speculate on secondary effects of the measure, it is inappropriate for the Attorney General to choose two potential secondary effects from a universe of such effects and to place them in the Explanation. The Explanation may contain up to 85 words, yet there is no requirement that it do so. A ballot title, although it may have extremely far-reaching ramifications, may require relatively few words to explain. A greater number of words may obfuscate as well as clarify.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In summary, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">AMENDS OREGON CONSTITUTION TO PROHIBIT ABORTION WITH THREE EXCEPTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">QUESTION: Shall state constitution prohibit abortions except to prevent death of pregnant woman and in reported cases of rape or incest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">EXPLANATION: Adds new provision to Oregon Constitution. The new provision would prohibit abortion with three exceptions. The exceptions, in which abortion would not be prohibited, are to prevent the death of the pregnant woman and in reported cases of rape or incest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Ballot title certified as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> The full text of the proposed initiative measure is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">\u201cArticle I of the Oregon Constitution is amended by addition of a new Section 41:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">\u201c41. Notwithstanding any provision of this Constitution, abortion is prohibited except to prevent the death of the mother and in reported cases of rape or incest.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\"> ORS 250.085(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-14\">\u201cThe court shall review the title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and 250.039, and shall certify a title meeting this standard to the Secretary of State.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\"> ORS 250.035(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">\u201cThe ballot title of any measure to be initiated or referred shall consist of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHW\">\u201c(a) A caption of not more than 10 words which reasonably identifies the subject of the measure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">\u201c(b) A question of not more than 20 words which plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure so that an affirmative response to the question corresponds to an affirmative vote on the measure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">\u201c(c) A concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b643-9\">CARSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Azk\">dissenting</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">For the most part, I agree with the ballot title certified by the majority. However, I disagree with the approval of the Attorney General\u2019s substitution of the words \u201cpregnant woman\u201d for the word \u201cmother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">ORS 250.085(4) provides that the court shall review the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title for \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of ORS 250.035 and 250.039. The issue is whether the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title \u201creasonably identifies\u201d the subject matter of the measure, plainly phrases the chief purpose of the measure, and summarizes \u201cthe measure and its major effect.\u201d Where the Attorney General goes beyond his statutory authority and needlessly substitutes his language for the language of the measure, he has not substantially complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The Attorney General argued that \u201c[s]ince without doubt all will agree that the proponents\u2019 \u2018mothers\u2019 are pregnant women, the ballot title properly uses the accurate and neutral term.\u201d The majority apparently concurs and allows the Attorney General to decide that the proponents of the measure do not mean what they say, but rather that they mean the measure to apply to a \u201cpregnant woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">By simply reasoning that the words \u201cpregnant woman\u201d are \u201caccurate and neutral,\u201d the Attorney General has created a ballot title that textually differs from the proposed measure itself. Whether \u201cpregnant woman\u201d is an \u201caccurate\u201d description of the persons who potentially are subject to the measure\u2019s prohibition is a moral, philosophical, ethical, or biological question. Yet, by accepting the Attorney General\u2019s use of \u201cpregnant woman\u201d in the question and the explanation, the majority decides a legal question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Nor is the neutrality of the term \u201cpregnant woman\u201d as evident as the majority suggests. The current debate about abortion is as much a battle of words as it is a battle of ideologies. The Attorney General recognizes as much by asserting \u201cthat an important part of the strategy of both \u2018pro-life\u2019 and \u2018pro-choice\u2019 advocates is to define and redefine terms.\u201d To accept one term for the named person who potentially is subject to the measure\u2019s prohibition is to reject another term and all the belief system that goes with it. There are no neutral terms in this debate, which is why we should adhere to the deliberate language of the proponents of the measure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">When the language in the measure is unambiguous, it is not the job of the Attorney General or of this court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>substitute their interpretation of the measure for the language of the measure itself. The term \u201cmother\u201d is \u201clanguage taken directly from the proposed amendment itself. No paraphrase would serve as well because the term * * * would be the controlling constitutional language in case the measure were adopted.\u201d <em>ACLU v. Paulus, </em>282 Or 539, 543, 580 P2d 168 (1978). However, in future litigation, a party undoubtedly will argue that the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation, with the majority\u2019s blessing, is the proper interpretation of the wording of the Constitutional Amendment. <em>See State v. Wagner, </em>305 Or 115, 138-39, 752 P2d 1136 (1988), <em>vacated and rent\u2019d for further consideration </em>492 US_, 109 S Ct 3235, 106 L Ed 2d 583 (1989) (the ballot title prepared by this court makes \u201ccrystal clear\u201d the proper interpretation of a constitutional provision); <em>see also Rogers v. Lane County, </em>307 Or 534, 539, 541-45, 771 P2d 254 (1989) (discussing the use of material in the official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet as an aid to construction). It will be difficult, if not impossible, for this court to retreat from today\u2019s interpretation regardless of the merits of any argument presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Absent a compelling argument by the Attorney General that the substituted term he has chosen will aid voter comprehension, the language in the proposed measure should be used. <em>See Glerum v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 22, 27, 774 P2d 1093 (1989) (\u201c[wjhere, as here, the measure consistently refers to \u2018timber\u2019 rather than \u2018logs,\u2019 it is not permissible to reach beyond the unambiguous subject (\u2018timber\u2019) chosen by the legislature and substitute a [different] word\u201d). The measure says mother and the ballot title should say mother. This court, inadvertently I believe, has entered this important debate and taken sides. Whether the side taken is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d is not the point: This court should not now be a party to the debate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-7\">Van Hoomissen, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> The majority is not the first to wander inadvertently into this linguistic thicket. <em>Former </em>ORS 163.060, prior to its repeal in 1969 <em>(see </em>Oregon Laws 1969, chapter 684, section 17) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201c163.060 Abortion producing death of child or mother.

I would hope not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
