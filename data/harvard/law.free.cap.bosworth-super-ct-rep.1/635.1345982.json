In November, 1854, judgment was entered for defendant for costs. Plaintiff, on an affidavit to the effect, that the note was transferred to him by an assignment made by Currie for the benefit of his creditors, moves to set aside the judgment and execution, on the ground that, being trustee of an express trust, he could not be charged personally with the costs of the action, except for mismanagement or bad faith in the action, to be determined by special order of the Court, and that no such order has been made.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b645-9\">Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApE\">As the plaintiff sued in his own right, without alluding, in his complaint, to his representative character, \u00a7 317 of the Code, does not apply. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">To become entitled to the immunities, provided by that section, he must present a case falling within it, and come before the Court in a character which it protects, and seek to recover in \u25a0that character.
