Milbank <em>&amp; </em>Co. <em>v. </em>A. Dennistoun &amp; Co.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b256-5\">The plaintiffs, at New York, in June, 1846, shipped to the defendants, at Liverpool, 5,000 bbls. of flour, per \u201cN. Biddle,\u201d and 3,000 per \u201cGeorgianna,\u201d for sale, and by letter of June 25th, 1846, said, \u201cYou will please make no disposition until we give you our wishes, per 1 Caledonia,' unless 22s. in bond is attainable, in which case, if in your judgment, you deem it our interest to accept that sum, please to do so.\u201d On the 2lth of June, 1846, per steamer \u201c Caledonia,\u201d the plaintiffs wrote to defendants thus: \u201cWe fear the first introduction for consumption may tend to continue low prices, as they will probably be large immediately on the passage of the new bill.\u201d (Meaning, by the new bill, the British Com Law Bill, reducing the duties on foreign breadstuffs, then before Parliament, which received the royal assent on, the 21th of June, and went into operation three days after.) \u201cBelieving that after the stocks now in bond shall have been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., that an improvement may ensue, we would express our desire that these parcels may be withheld from the market, until the operation of the new law shall have produced its results. We hope we may not err in assuming its passage; though, if 22s. in bond is attainable on arrival, and you think our interest dictates such sale, please so dispose of it.\u201d The defendants received this the 12th of July.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b256-6\">By a letter of the 31st of July, and received by the defendants on the 12th of August, 1846, the plaintiffs say: \u201cWe suppose that ere this the crop of wheat has been ascertained, as to its probable yield, and the grain and flour conformed to such result. We therefore ask you to exercise your discretion in effecting sales for us.\u201d On the 4th, 5th, and 7th of August, 1846, the defendants sold the \u201cN. Biddle\u201d flour, at prices which produced $2 11 per bbl. net, being out of bond, and the duties on it having been paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b256-7\">The defendants advised the plaintiffs of such sale, by a letter dated the 18th of August, 1846, in which letter the defendants said that,\u2014\u201c After writing you on the 3d inst., we were induced, by the continued fine appearance of the season, to sell your flour by the \u2018Nicholas Biddle \u2019 at 21s., as per note above; and. this we now regret, as on the 11th or 12th inst., a great change took place in the weather, and the potato crop was completely blighted.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b256-8\">The flour, per the \u201c Georgianna,\u201d being of the same quality, was sold at later periods, and at prices which would have made .the flour, per the \u201cN. Biddle,\u201d produce, With interest to the day of trial, $14,530 29 more than the plaintiffs realized from it. In an action to recover this sum as damages, on the grounds that such a loss had been sustained by reason of the defendants disobeying the orders given to them, and by reason of their negligent performance of their duty, as such factors and agents, it was Md,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b256-9\">1. In determining the question, whether the defendants violated their instructions, in selling at the time they did, the letters of the 25th and 27th of June are the only letters to be considered, to ascertain the precise instructions under which the defendants were then acting, as they had then received no others which gave any.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>2. The letter of the 27th of June is not fairly susceptible of two interpretations, and it is the duty of the Court to construe it, and declare its meaning.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-5\">3. As 22s., in bond, could not be obtained, on arrival of the flour, it was the duly of the defendants to withhold the flour from market until the stock in bond, on the passage of the Corn law, had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c. If it was sold before that, it was sold before the defendants were authorized to sell, and they are liable for the consequences of that act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-6\">4. It was the right and duty of the defendants, after the stock, then in bond, had been introduced into the market, and had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., to determine, in the exercise of good faith, and of proper care and diligence, whether, and when, the Corn law had produced its results, and also to determine, thereupon, when their duty and the interests of the plaintiffs required them to sell, acting under such instructions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-7\">If they did not sell until after such introduction and reduction, they are not liable, unless they failed to exercise the care and diligence which a prudent consignee, acting on his own account, and with the knowledge or information which the evidence shows they possessed, would have exercised.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-8\">5. If they failed to exercise that care or diligence, or disobeyed their instructions, as above explained, in selling before the change in the market, of which they speak in their letter of the 18th of August, they are liable. If they did not do either, they are not liable. If they did do either, they are liable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-9\">6. After the change in the market, mentioned in that letter, it was their -duty to act with reference to the interests of the plaintiffs; as they would be affected by that change and the causes that produced it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-10\">7. Under the letter of the 31st of July, and received on the 12th of August, 1846, the defendants were bound to exercise good faith, and reasonable care pnd diligence\u2014such care and diligence as a consignee, of ordinary care and prudence, not coerced by any necessity to sell, and acting on his own account, would have exercised under the same circumstances. Whether they exercised such care and diligence, was a question of fact, to be determined by the jury. If they failed to exercise it, in selling when they did, they are liable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-11\">8. To ascertain the damages which the defendants are liable to pay, if liable at all, the jury must, upon a consideration of all the evidence bearing upon the questions, at what time the market prices began to advance, what continued to be the tendency of prices, and what must have been the views of men of prudence, having such information as the defendants had, and acting with reasonable care and diligence, as to the time when this flour might have been .sold, without justly incurring the imputation of having acted without reasonable care and diligence, ascertain <em>that day, </em>and then determine what price could have been obtained for it at that time, in selling it in the usual mode, and in the exercise of proper care and diligence. The defendants should be charged with that price, and be credited with advances made and charges paid, and the further expenses that would have accrued, and interest on them, to the time when the price of the flour would have been realized by them. The balance, with interest to the time of the verdict, is the sum the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b257-12\">9. The jury having found, under a question specially submitted, that the defendants, in selling at the time they did, failed to exercise that care and diligence which prudent consignees, having the information which the defendants then had, and acting on their own account, would have exercised, it was also held, that the vari-</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>anee between the fact found, and a declaration which, in addition to alleging a disobedience of orders, also averred that the defendants acted \u201ccarelessly, and negligently, and inattentively, sold prematurely, and for less than they could have \u25a0 obtained; if they had faithfully performed their duties,\u201d was immaterial, inasmuch as the act of April 11, 1849, (Laws of 1849, p. \u00cdOS, \u00a7 2, Sub. 1) applied sections 169 to 1\u00cd6 of the Code, inclusive, to future proceedings in civil actions which were pending when the Code took effect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-5\">Judgment, on a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $T,829 62, affirmed.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-6\">(Before D\u00fceb, Bosworth, and Slosson, J.J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b258-7\">Argued, March 12;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Amo\">decided, May 16, 1857.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">This action came before the Court at General Term, on an appeal by the defendants, from a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial. It was put at issue prior to the Code, and the pleadings are drawn under the pre-existing practice. The complaint contains the common money counts, and two special counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The first special count states, that the plaintiffs are, and were merchants and copartners in trade in Hew York, and the defendants are, and were merchants and factors; and partners trading in Liverpool, the consignment to the defendants in June 1846 of 5,000 bbls. of flour, worth $35,000, for sale, under instructions as to selling it, which the defendants received and agreed to obey,' but which they violated by selling before they were authorized to sell, and \u201c in such sale, conducted themselves negligently, carelessly, and without due attention to their duty, as such factors of the plaintiffs, and through such carelessness, negligence, and-inattention, sold the said merchandise prematurely, and before the same ought to have been sold by the defendants,\u201d and at low and insufficient prices, whereby the plaintiffs were damaged to the amount of $20,000. The second special count reads thus, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">\u201c And also, for that whereas the said defendants, heretofore, to wit, on the eighteenth day of July, in the year last aforesaid, at Liverpool aforesaid, received a certain other large quantity of merchandise, to wit, other five thousand barrels of flour, of the said plaintiffs, of great value, to wit, of the value of thirty thousand dollars, at Liverpool, to be there taken care of, dealt with, disposed of, and sold by the defendants as factors and agents of. the plaintiffs in this behalf,- for a reasonable reward, to be allowed to them by the said plaintiffs in this behalf, whereby it became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and was the duty of the plaintiffs, among other things, to obey the orders of the said plaintiffs, touching the sale, management, and disposal of the said last mentioned merchandise; and in consideration thereof, the defendants then and there undertook and promised to the plaintiffs to perform and fulfil their duty as factors of the plaintiffs in this behalf, to wit, on the day and year, and at the city and county of New York aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">\u201cYet the defendants, their promise in form last aforesaid made, not regarding, but contriving and intending to deceive and defraud the plaintiffs in this behalf, and contrary to their duty as their factors, and contrary to the orders of the said plaintiffs in this behalf, given to, and received by the defendants, and carelessly, and negligently, and inattentively sold the said merchandise prematurely, and for low and insufficient prices, and for less prices than they might and could have had and obtained therefor, if they had well, faithfully, and diligently performed and fulfilled their duty as factors of the plaintiffs in this behalf; and thereby the plaintiffs lost the difference in price which they would have received if the defendants had properly conducted themselves in this behalf, which difference in price amounts to a large sum of money, to wit, twenty thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The' defendants plead, (first), <em>non-assumpsit, </em>as to all the alleged premises, except as to the sum of $153.95 parcel of the said several sums of money, and as to that sum, (second) a tender thereof before suit brought, averring a continuing readiness, and present offer to pay it. The plaintiffs replied to the second plea, admitting the tender, and took the money as a satisfaction <em>pro tanto.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The action was brought to trial, before Mr. Justice Bosworth and a jury on the 27th of May, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">On the trial, it appeared that, at the time of the transactions in question, the plaintiffs were commission merchants in New York with a branch house in New Orleans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\">The defendants were commission merchants in Liverpool, with a branch house in New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-10\">In the month of June, 1846, the plaintiffs shipped to the defendants 5000 barrels of flour by the ship Nicholas Biddle, and 3000 barrels by the ship Gieorgianna. The flour was all of the same quality, and arrived about the same time, and was all consigned to the defendants as factors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The plaintiffs sent two letters of instructions, one dated June 25, 1846, and the other, more particular and explicit, dated June 27 of the same year, which letters were both received by the defendants before the flour arrived. The British Corn Law Bill reducing the duties on foreign breadstuffs was then before Parliament, and the flour was shipped and the instructions were given in view of the immediate passage of that law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">The bill received the royal assent on the 27th of June, 1846, and went into operation three days after.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">The defendants sold the 5,000 barrels per Nicholas Biddle on the 4th, 5th and 7th of August, at such prices as to give the plaintiffs but $217 per barrel; net.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">Before they sold the Georgianna flour, one .of the plaintiffs reached Liverpool, and that shipment was not sold until September, October, and November following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\">If the Biddle flour, which was of the same quality, and which arrived at the same time, had been held as the Georgianna, it would have netted the plaintiffs, computing interest up to the day of trial, $14,530 29 more than they received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">The plaintiffs claimed this sum as their damages for the alleged sacrifice of their flour. Under the rules of law, as stated by the Court, the jury found that the defendants would have been excusable had they sold the flour at an earlier day than, according to the claim of the plaintiffs, it could properly be sold, and the verdict was rendered for the value of the flour on that day, to wit, for $7,829 62.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">The letters, dated June 25th and 27th, 1846, are as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-11\">\u201cNew York, June 25, 1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-12\">\u201c Messrs.

This flour is from the best Cincinnati mills, and in fine order, having been forwarded directly from flat-boats to ships. We are induced to hope for its sharing a better fate than ordinary shipments from N. Orleans, as we trust it may arrive out in sweet condition. When shipping we had hoped for a better market than the prospect now justifies. We fear the first introductions for consumption may tend to continue low prices, as they will probably be large immediately on the passage of the new bill. Believing that after the stocks now in bond shall have been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., that an improvement may ensue, we would express our desire that these parcels may be withheld from the market until the operation of the new law shall -have produced its results.

Until it had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., the time would not arrive at which, nor the contingencies have happened on which the contemplated results would have been produced, and could be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u201c But it was both the right and the duty of the defendants, in the exercise of good faith, and proper care and diligence, to determine, after the stock in bond had been introduced into the market, and had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., whether, and when the law had produced its results within the proper meaning of the word, \u2018results,\u2019 as I have explained it\u2014and also to determine, thereupon, when their duty and the interests of the plaintiffs required them to sell, acting under such instructions.\u201d \u201c If, in selling at the time they did, they sold before the stock, in bond, had been introduced into the market, and had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., they sold before they were authorized to sell, and are liable for the consequences of that act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201c If they did not sell until after these two events had occurred, they are not liable, unless they failed to exercise that care and diligence which a prudent consignee, acting on his own account, and with the knowledge or information which the evidence shows they possessed, would have exercised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Whether the Judge, in submitting the question, in answer to which the jury found the particular facts, above quoted, expressed any views, as to what must be understood by the words, \u201creduced , by consumption,\u201d &amp;c., the case does not disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Those views, if any were stated, must be deemed to have been satisfactory to both parties. If it is to be assumed, that none were stated, then it is to be observed, that it does not appear that either party desired any particular instruction on that point, and that that matter was treated as one in respect to which the expe-. rience and intelligence of the jury required no aid from the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">We think this part of the case was submitted to the jury in a form as favorable to the defendants as they had a right to ask, if there was evidence which warranted any submission of the questions of fact, on which, they passed and rendered their verdict,</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The flour was sold on. the 4th, 5th, and 7th of August, at 21s., duty free, except 100 bbls., which were sold at 21s. 6d.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">There is evidence enough to justify a jury in finding, that, from the 18th of July, when the flour arrived, until about the middle of August, the prices were rather declining, and that there was no sensible diminution of the stock in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">s.d.tos.d.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Defendts\u2019 letter of July 3d, 1854, quotes N. Orleans at 24 -25</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">ft tt tt \u201c 18, it tt tt ft 23 -25 tt tt tt Aug. 3, tt tt ft ft 22 -24 <em>u </em>it tt \u201c 18, \u00cd\u00cd tt ft ft 23 -25 it tt tt Sept. 3, it tt ft ft 23.6-25 tt tt it \u201c 11, tt tt tt tt 26 -27.6 tt tt tt Oct. 3, it it ft tt 28.6-29 tt tt tt \u201c 19, it ft tt tt 33 -34</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">John Parke says, the highest price obtainable for New Orleans flour, in bond, between the 15th of June and the end of July, 1846, was 20s. and duty paid, was 28s. The prices were declining a little between the 18th of July and the 10th of August.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">John Harnett says, the highest price, between the 15th of June and the 31st of July, 1846, was on the 14th of July; and then, duty paid, it was 22s. The price of such flour, immediately on the passage of the act, duty paid, was between 21s. and 22s. '</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">John Francis Godwin says, the highest price obtainable for such flour, between the 15th of June and the end of July, 1846, in bond, was 22s., and he thinks this was at the end of June. The prices, from the 18th of July to the 10th of August, were constantly declining.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The jury might very well find that an improvement of prices had not commenced, between the passage of the Corn Law and the sale of the flour; that as soon as samples could be procured, and about the 21st of July, the 5000 bbls. were put into the market, to be sold, by a broker; that the discharging of the flour was not begun till about the 27th of July; and that it was sold about as soon as it was placed in store, the sales being on the 4th, 5th, and 7th of August.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">The jury might also have found, on the evidence, and properly too, that there had been no such reduction, by consumption, &amp;c., as to effect an improvement of prices, or as would furnish any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>basis for judging that such anticipated improvement was not morally certain to result. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">On the 3d of July over two millions of quarters, of wheat and flour together, had been cleared at the Custom House, at the minimum duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Up to the 18th of July, \u201cthe.importations of foreign grain and flour had been large, and dealers were disinclined to buy, except for immediate use, and prices were further depressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Mr. Harnett says, the quantity of stock of foreign grain in the United Kingdom, from the 18th of July, 1846,-to the 10th of August following, was unprecedentedly large\u2014never so large before, in his recollection. There was about a million and a half barrels of flour, and about two millions to two millions and a half of wheat in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">We cannot doubt that there was sufficient evidence of a violation of instructions to call for the submission of that question, as a question of fact, to the jury, and that the jury have determined it against the defendants, on evidence which warrants their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The jury were also instructed, that, if before the change had occurred in the market, of which the defendants spoke in their letter of the 18th of August, the stock in bond had been introduced into the market and had been reduced by consumption, and thereupon the defendants, in the exercise .of good-faith and proper care and diligence, had determined, or might fairly determine, that the law had produced its results, as the word \u201cresults\u201d had been explained to them, they were not liable for selling at the time they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The jury were then advised, if the defendants could not rightfully have sold before the change in the market alluded to in that letter had commenced, by what legal rules they should be governed, in determining when the defendants might justifiably have sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">On the 12th of August, they had received the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 31st of July. The jury were instructed, that the defendants, in order to discharge their duty to the plaintiffs, properly, under the instructions given to them by that letter, \u201c were' bound to exercise good faith and reasonable care and diligence; such care and diligence as a consignee of ordinary care and prudence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>not coerced by any necessity to sell, and acting on his own account, would have exercised under such circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">And if they found against the defendants, on the question of a proper performance of duty, <em>\u201c </em>they would look at all the evidence bearing upon the question, at what time the market prices of flour began to advance, what continued to be the tendency of prices, and what must have been the views of men of prudence having such information as the defendants had, acting with reasonable care and diligence, as to the time when the flour might have been sold without justly incurring the imputation of having acted without reasonable care and diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201c When you shall have fixed that time, upon a careful consideration of all the evidence before you, you will determine what price the defendants could have obtained for it then, in selling it in the usual mode, and in the exercise of proper care and diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201c With that price you will charge them,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">It was urged, with much ability, that if the jury should answer the first special question in the affirmative, an affirmative answer to the second would follow as a matter of course\u2014as a mere sequence to the first answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">We do not think that this conclusion is necessarily correct, nor necessarily a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The jury may not have found, or intended to find, any intentional bad faith on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">And they may have considered, that although the defendants had concluded that the events had occurred which left them at liberty to judge whether the new law had produced its results, and before selling, had judged that the law had produced its results, and that therefore they could properly sell; yet, even under that favorable view for the defendants, in selling at the time they did, they failed to exercise that care and diligence which prudent consignees, having the information which the defendants then had, and acting on their own account, would have exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Hence they may have been of the opinion that whether that view was taken of the case, or whether the conduct of the defendants, as factors, not absolutely prohibited from selling, but authorized to sell, if they had concluded, on a fair exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of care and diligence and of their judgment formed on the information which the evidence showed they possessed, \u2022 that the interests of the plaintiffs required such a sale as was made\u2014that there was a negligent and careless performance by them of these duties, for the consequences of which they should respond to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We think that the case was submitted to the jury as favorably, at least, as the facts of the case justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">By the letter of the 27th of June, the defendants were not at liberty to sell, oh arrival, unless 22s. in bond could be then obtained\u2014that was equal to 25s. duty free.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The \u201cN. Biddle\u201d cargo reached Liverpool on the 18th of July. That was the day of its arrival there. A sale of it was forbidden unless, on \u201c arrival,\u201d 25s. duty free could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">If that price could not then be obtained, the defendants were required to withhold the flour \u201cfrom the market,\u201d for a period thence to ensue, and until certain contemplated results, particularly stated in the letter of the 27th of June, as anticipated by the plaintiffs, should have been produced, or ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The defendants, when prohibited from selling on arrival at less than 22s. in bond, could not immediately take the flour out of bond, and sell it for a price which would not be equivalent to 22s. in bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">But instead of withholding it from the market, it was placed in the hands of a broker to be offered in the market as soon as samples of it could be procured, and before the discharging of the cargo from the vessel had been commenced. Actual sales commenced about, if not quite as soon as the whole cargo was discharged. It was sold, after the defendants,, by their circular accompanying their letter of the 3d of August, or by the letter itself, had informed the plaintiffs that the weather for the then \u201clast two or three days have been unsettled,\u201d and that \u201cIndian corn has been in much better demand, in consequence of the accounts from Ireland of the potato crop being very alarming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">This sale, the defendants, in their letter of the 18th of August, said they regretted, \u201c as on the 11th or 12th inst. (August) a great change for the worse took place in the weather, and the potato crop was completely blighted.\u201d The circular forming part of that letter states that \u201c the bulk of the new wheat will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of poor quality, and in indifferent if not in bad condition, owing to the wet weather which has prevailed during the last fortnight.\u201d New Orleans flour had then advanced \u201c 2s. per barrel, with every prospect of a further advance,\u201d and they also wrote, \u201c we accordingly hold your 3,000 barrels, <em>ex </em>' Greorgianna,\u2019 in the hope of better prices, in which we trust we shall not be disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">This was written after the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 31st of July had been received, which confided the matter of selling entirely to the discretion of the defendants. (That was received on the 12th of August.) I say that letter confided the matter of selling entirely to the discretion of the defendants. It was so construed in the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">But that discretion was given on the supposition, as expressed in that letter, that, ere then, <em>\u201c </em>the crop of wheat has been ascertained, as to its probable yield, and the grain and flour conformed to such result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">That supposition was erroneous. The letter of the 3rd of August, written before any flour was sold, stated that causes were then operating, and of so marked a character that they excited public attention, and which by the 12th of August had produced a marked advance in the market, and a general conviction of a still further advance, in consequence of their effects on the quality as well as probable yield of the crop of wheat of that season.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">These facts, are quite conclusive to show, that the instructions to withhold the 5,000 bbls. from the market, were disobeyed, or entirely disregarded, and that no attention was paid to the limitation as to price, which the defendants were required to obtain, as a condition to the right to sell, and that the sale was made while prices had a downward tendency, and when they had reached the lowest point, while the flour sent by the \u201c Greorgianna,\u201d and covered by the same instructions, was withheld from the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Why one cargo should have been immediately put in the market, and sold, and the other withheld, and why the larger instead of the smaller cargo should have been sold, it is difficult to conjecture, unless it was the intention of the defendants, in placing samples in the hands of a broker, merely to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>quality and value ascertained, while the broker, on the contrary, acted on the assumption and belief that he was authorized and expected to sell, and having sold, the defendants deemed it best or found it necessary, to complete the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The evidence that, the defendants disobeyed the instructions which they received from the plaintiffs, seems to us to be very strong, and the conclusion most favorable to the defendants is, that such disobedience resulted from a want of, or a failure, on their part, to exercise, that reasonable care and diligence which was essential to a proper performance of their duty, as factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendants also complain of the construction given at the trial, to the letter of the 27th of June.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The language of that letter is: \u201cWe fear the first introductions for consumption may tend to continue low prices, as they will, probably, be large, immediately on the passage of the new bill. Believing that after the stocks, now in bond, shall have been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., that an improvement may ensue, we would express our desire that these parcels should be withheld from the market until the operation of the new law shah have produced its results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The plaintiffs, doubtless, expected that the importations would be large, in anticipation of the passage of the new law, and that they would be released from bond, by the owners or consignees, availing themselves of the opportunity of releasing it, by paying the minimum duty, immediately on the passage of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Parke testifies that, \u201c the stock in bond, previous to the passing of the Corn Law, was large, in consequence of its accumulating, in anticipation of the reduction of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Harnett testifies to the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The circular to defendants\u2019 letter of the 3d of July, states that \u201c the whole stock of foreign grain and flour in this port, and throughout the kingdom, upwards of two millions of quarters of wheat and flour together, has been cleared, at the Custom House, at the minimum duty, viz. 2s. 5d.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The charge was, that \u201c the obvious meaning of these instructions is, that these parcels were to be withheld from the market, until the operation of the new law should have produced its results in view of the effect produced, as well by a reduction of the stock then in bond by consumption, &amp;c., as by the intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>duction of large quantities into the market by means of the duty being diminished.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201c The question is whether they sold without waiting until the operation of the new law had produced its results, in the sense which I have stated; or to express my views more clearly, without waiting, until the defendants in the exercise of fair diligence and good faith might have supposed and believed upon the information which the evidence shows they had, that such results had been ascertained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201c The defendants were to judge, when the new law should have produced its results, within the meaning of the word ' results,\u2019 as used in that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\"><em>\u201c </em>They were bound, at all events, to withhold the flour from the market, until the stock in bond had been reduced by consumption,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u201c If, in selling at the time they did, they sold before the stock in bond had been introduced into the market, and had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c., they sold before they were authorized to sell, and are liable for the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u201c If they did not sell until after these two events had occurred, they are not liable, unless they failed to exercise that care,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">There can be no pretence, as we think, that the jury could have understood from this charge, that the defendants were bound to wait, before exercising their judgment, whether the law had produced its results, until importations should have been introduced into the market, other than those in bond, at the time of its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">They were expressly charged, that if the defendants did not sell before the stock in bond had been introduced into the market, and had been reduced by consumption, &amp;c.,\u201d \u201cthey were not liable,\u201d unless guilty of a neglect of duty, by reason of their failing to exercise proper care and diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">It is also objected, in the points, that \u201cthis part of the charge is vague and indefinite, and, in effect, left it to the jury, to fill in under the ' &amp;c.,\u2019 whatever their fancy might have suggested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">We think that the use, in the charge, of these words from the letter, presented the case more favorably for the defendants than it would have been by the omission of the \u201c &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">The result which it was anticipated would improve prices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>was a \u201creduction.\u201d of the quantity in bond, after it had been introduced into the market, by its consumption, or other causes, in addition, which should prevent its being capable of being sold in the market for human food.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Whatever causes, other than actual consumption, under the evidence, the jury might think had produced such results, and which they might fill in under the \u201c &amp;c.,\u201d was beneficial to the defendants, in the process of finding an early day, at which they would be justified in selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">But the charge was not excepted to, at the trial, on account oi the use of the \u201c &amp;c.,\u201d or on account of its vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The defendants object that the pleadings do not warrant a recovery, either on the ground of fraud, or of negligence, or of a want of skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The pleadings were drawn before the Code was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The act of April 11th, 1849, applied sections 169 to 176, inclusive, of the Code, to future proceedings in civil actions, which were pending on the 1st of July, 1848. (Laws of 1849, p. 705, \u00a7 2, Sub. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">By \u00a7 169, no variance between the allegation in a declaration, and the proof, can be deemed material, unless it shall have actually misled the defendant, to his prejudice, in maintaining his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">If a defendant alleges he has been misled, he must prove that fact to the satisfaction of the Court, and in what respect he has been misled. <em>(id.)\u2014Catlin </em>v. Gunter, 1 Kern. 368,373; <em>Harmony </em>v. <em>Bingham, </em>1 Duer, <em>209-210.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">The 2d count states, the receipt of the flour, to be sold by the defendants, as factors and agents; their duty to obey orders, and their promise to perform their duty as factors; a disregard of their promise; and that, \u201c contriving and intending to deceive and defraud the plaintiffs in this behalf, and contrary to their duty as factors, and contrary to the orders of the said plaintiffs, in this behalf, given to and received by the defendants, and carelessly, and negligently, and inattentively, sold the said merchandise prematurely, and for low and insufficient prices, and for less than they might and could have obtained therefor, if they had well, faithfully, and diligently performed and fulfilled their duty, as factors of the plaintiffs in this behalf; and thereby the plaintiffs lost the differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ence in. price which they would have received, if the defendants had properly conducted themselves in this behalf, which difference in price amounts to a large sum of money, to wit, twenty thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The breach, of the duty and promise stated, is alleged, in this count, to consist of the careless, negligent, and inattentive manner in which the defendants acted, in selling the flour. It is also alleged, that damage ensued, to which the plaintiffs would not have been subjected, if the defendants had faithfully and diligently performed their duty, as factors of the plaintiffs in this behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We think that this is, in substance, the matter submitted to the jury, by the second question, which they answered in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Even if the first special instruction, which the defendants requested should be given to the jury, was proper in the absolute and unqualified form in which it was stated, it is not easy to perceive why the second special question might not properly have been submitted to the jury, if there was evidence to justify the submission of the inquiry it embraced, as a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We do not think that any error was committed, to the prejudice of the defendants, either in the charge to the jury, or in the admission of evidence, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
