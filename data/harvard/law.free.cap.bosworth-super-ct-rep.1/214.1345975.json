Conover and John J. Conover, v. Ann Cornelia Hoffman.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-7\">A general power to sell real estate given by will to the executors, as such, and not by their names as individuals, is not revoked by the refusal of one of them to act, but survives to, and vests in those who qualify.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-8\">Such a power is not revoked by a codicil devising the estate to the executors in trust to make an equal division thereof among the children of the testator and their heirs. When there are no express words of revocation, the provisions in a codicil are never construed as revoking those of the will, unless they are so entirely repugnant that, to give effect to those in the codicil, those in the will must wholly fail.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-9\">There is no such repugnancy between a power to sell and a trust or power to divide. A general power to sell given to executors, includes an authority to sell for the payment of debts; and to the execution of such a power, the rights of devisees and heirs have always been held subordinate; and the power previously given can no more be taken away by a direction to divide the estate than by a devise of the estate itself.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-10\">When the power exists for any purpose, a <em>iond fide </em>purchaser is protected, no matter for what purpose the power is in fact exercised. A power to sell, and a power to divide, are so far from being incompatible, that the exercise of the former may be necessary to the proper execution of the latter; tk'at is, a sale may be necessary to enable the trustees of the power to make a just and equal division.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-11\"><em>Beld, </em>in the principal case, that a purchaser from -the executors acquired a valid title, disentangled from any trust, and freed from any limitations, \u00a1created by the will.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-12\">Judgment at spedial term affirmed with costs.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b224-13\">(Before Boswobth <em>&amp; </em>Slosso\u00fct, J.J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b224-14\">Heard, March 2;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWv\">decided, May 16.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-15\">This action was brought to compel the specific execution of a contract relative to the purchase and conveyance of real estate.

John Thompson and Hannah Smith, the widow of the testator, being dead, the surviving executors, James Boorman and Matthew St. Clair Clarke, by a deed dated December 26th, 1829, sold and conveyed certain premises belonging to the estate of Smith, among which was the lot in question, to Robert Dyson. This conveyance recites that it was made in pursuance and by virtue of the powers of sale in the will, and purports to be made for a valuable. consideration paid by Robert Dyson. The son and three daughters of the testator, his only heirs-at-law, with the husbands of the daughters, joined in the deed ratifying and confirming the sale, and releasing all manner of right, title, and interest which any of them had in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">\u201cWere these powers of sale properly executed and exercised in the conveyance to Dyson ? A conveyance by executors is not invalidated by the neglect or refusal of any one executor to act. (Laws of 1813, page 366.) Andrew Foster, who thus refused, is to be regarded as if not named in the will; and there is no doubt that powers thus given would continue to the survivors. The authority to sell was to his executors thereinafter named, and the survivor and survivors of them, or such other person or persons who may lawfully obtain the right to execute the will. It was given to them not by name, but in their capacity of executors. The law vests the right in the survivors. (Sugden on Powers, page 146, 4 Hill, 493.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">The will itself continues it in them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">As to the exercise of the power, the testimony of James Boor-man, one of the executors, (exhibit C) shows that at the time of the sale to Dyson, the estate consisted principally of vacant lots and unimproved lands, there being a claim against it of about $14,000, which there were no means of paying but by a sale. That the parties in interest under the will agreed upon a valuation of the property, and a portion was sold to Dyson at the valuation put upon it, and that such sale was fairly made, and for the full market value at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">The will gives the right of disposing of the property at private sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">From a view of the will alone, and of the action of the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tors under it, the conclusion is clear that all the interest of James R. Smith in the lot in question passed, by the conveyance to Robert Dyson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">On the 30th of May, in the same year, the testator executed a codicil to his will, making some modifications of the dispositions of his property, which, it is contended, are repugnant to and revoke the authority to sell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">The codicil sets out with a ratification of the will in the following terms:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\"><em>\u201cI do </em>hereby <em>ratify and </em>confirm my will in all respects, except so far as any part thereof may or shall be revoked or altered by this present codicil, and in addition to the powers granted in and to my said executors in relation to my said estate, I do now hereby authorize them to lease the same estate or any part thereof, except such as shall otherwise be disposed of in their discretion, and as They shall find the situation of my affairs require.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">The only power given by the will being the authority to sell, we would naturally expect explicit words of revocation to withdraw powers so distinctly given and fully confirmed and enlarged; that such a sudden change of intention would be clearly and unmistakably manifested. Ho such implication will arise from any disposition in a subsequent part of the codicil which can be carried into effect consistently with the exercise of these powers, and can be reconciled with them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">\u201c In examining the codicil, it is considered in the connection with the will, and the two treated as one instrument, and the intent of the testator is to be gathered from the whole; the codicil being no revocation of the will further than such revocation is particularly expressed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-10\"><em>Westcott </em>v. <em>Cady, 5 </em>Johns. Chy. R. 343. <em>Hone </em>v. <em>Van Schaick, </em>3 Barb. Ch. R. 488, Williams\u2019 Exrs., page 8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-11\">The provisions of the codicil, so far as it is necessary to recite the same, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-12\">To the widow is given a portion of the testator\u2019s real estate for life, with the right to devise the same to his children, and to sell the same with the consent of the executors, except the homestead, and to enjoy the proceeds for her life; the executors are directed to invest and pay her the income of twenty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>thousand dollars during her life. They are then further directed to convey other portions of his real estate to certain named devisees, and to sell specified parts for the purpose of raising annuities for the objects mentioned. After making bequests, requiring about $7,00(3, the testator proceeds as follows: \u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, of every kind and nature whatsoever, and wheresoever situate, I give, devise and bequeath unto my said executors, in trust that the same shall be equally divided among my four children, share and share alike, and to their respective heirs. My will further is, that my son James and my daughter Elizabeth shall each have the sum of fifteen hundred dollars set apart by my said executors for their support and maintenance until they arrive at the age of twenty-one ; and if that sum shall not be found sufficient, my executors shall take such further sum from their respective shares of my estate as shall be necessary, and I do hereby give the tuition, care and guardianship of my said son James and my daughter Elizabeth to my said wife. My will further is, that my son James shall not come into the full possession and enjoyment of Ms portion of my estate, until he shall arrive at the age of twenty-five years, nor shall he have the power to pawn, pledge, mortgage or dispose of in any way, the same or any part thereof, before the expiration of that time, but shall be entitled to receive the income arising from his portion between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five. I further direct, that my daughters Janet, Hannah and Elizabeth, if she should arrive at the age of twenty-one, shall have the privilege of expending and appropriating by and with the consent of the executors, one-third part of their portion of my estate herein devised to them, in such manner as they may think proper, and over which, when so appropriated, they shall have absolute control; and the remaining two-thirds of the portions or shares of my daughters, shall be held separate and distinct, and not liable to the control, debts or engagements of either of their husbands which they now have or may hereafter have, as well those who are married as she who may hereafter marry, giving, however, to the husbands of either or all of them, in case the wife shall die first, either with or without issue, the income of said reserved part of my estate as long as he shall Eve, arising from his wife\u2019s portion, and after Ms death then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the child or children of my said daughter so dying; and if either of my daughters shall die without lawful issue, or having issue which shall not attain the age of twenty-one years and without issue, then the share or portion of my said daughter, after the death of her husband, or if there be no husband living at her death, shall go and be divided among my other children, share and share alike, and to their issue in case of the death of either of them, share and share alike, such issue to take the portion that would have belonged to his, her, or their father or mother.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqB\">The foregoing are the chief provisions of the codicil. If there has been a revocation of the powers of sale, it must arise from this disposition of the residue and remainder, there being no express revocation and no other clause affording the least ground for inferring such an intent. Is this such a disposition of the estate by the testator that, (as stated by the answer), the executors had not the power to convey his real estate in fee and make good title thereto ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">The natural signification of the language used does not lead to this conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">The will gives the authority to sell the whole or any part of the estate; the codicil ratifies and confirms the will, except so far as the same, or any part thereof, may or shall be revoked or altered thereby, and adds to the authority the right to lease also the estate or any part thereof, except such as shall be otherwise disposed of in their discretion, and as they shall find the situation of his affairs require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">In a subsequent part of the instrument there are specific devises of certain portions of the estate, not including the lot in question, which, so far as those portions are concerned, revokes the authority and gives effect to the exception. To suppose that the testator, after renewing and extending the powers of sale over the estate, had in the same breath rendered them nugatory by otherwise disposing of the whole estate, would be a forced and unreasonable construction, while to confine the meaning of the expression \u201c otherwise disposed of\u201d to those devises, would be in accordance with the principle of attempting to give effect to all the expressions and provisions of an instrument and of seeking to reconcile apparently conflicting ones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">It is a sound rule that the dispositions of a will are not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>disturbed by a codicil further than is absolutely necessary to give it effect. <em>(Kane </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>5 Sandford, 467.) The former interpretation would be substantially a revocation of the whole will thus ratified and confirmed, for the only object left for keeping it alive, would be the nomination of executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">The supposition most naturally arising from the phraseology of the disposition is, that the testator expected the residue and remainder of his estate to be a mixed fund, consisting of the real estate not disposed of by him specifically, and not sold by the executors, together with the proceeds of real estate sold by them in their discretion, and not needed for the legacies and annuities, and that these he meant to blend together for the purpose of division as the whole estate, except specified portions, had been for the general purposes of payment of debts, legacies and other charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">Where the words of a will, says the Chancellor in the case of <em>Covenhoven </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>2 Paige, 122, are capable of a twofold construction, that should be adopted most consistent with the intention as ascertained by the other provisions of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">The exercise of the authority to sell as might be for the interest of the estate, is not only not inconsistent with the directions for the division of the residue into shares, but, from the testimony of Mr. Boorman, it would appear to have been necessary to carry it into effect, nor would the sale interfere with the limitations on those shares. The interests of the immediate, and the contingent rights of the executory devisees could be preserved for them more beneficially in this shape.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">Throughout the codicil there are intimations of reliance on the discretion of the executors, and of continued confidence reposed in them. The widow is allowed, with their consent, to convert the real estate devised to her into money: each daughter, with their consent, is to have the one-third part of her share, and they are empowered to take such proportion of the shares of the two younger children as they may think necessary to support and educate them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">They are entrusted with the proceeds of portions of his real estate directed to be sold, and other sums of money, the income of which they are to devote to the purposes mentioned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>testator, and which, in the contingencies specified by him, are to become part of his residuary estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">There is no strong inference arising from the greater security of real estate, of an intention that the trust should attach to the land. The testator has shown in other dispositions, his confidence in the judgment \u00aband integrity of the executors. If the devisees should lose by any change made in the estate by them, it would be because the testator has chosen to bestow it in the shape the executors might impress upon it, apparently preferring to incur what he must have considered a slight risk, for the sake of having lodged somewhere powers so advantageous in the management of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">From an examination of the other provision of the codicil, in connection with the situation of the testator\u2019s family, and condition of his estate, additional evidence is derived of an intention to continue this authority in the executors. <em>(Irving </em>v. DeKay, 9 Paige, 521; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Van </em>Nostrand, 2 Comstock, 436.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">The estate was chiefly real, consisting principally of vacant lots and unimproved lands: it was largely in debt, and the testator gives annuities and legacies requiring from thirty to forty thousand dollars. These debts and bequests were a charge upon the real estate <em>(Bench </em>v. Byles, 4 Maddocks, 187) to pay which it would be necessary to make sales, and from the necessity would naturally be inferred the gift of the power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">Without a sale of part of the property, his daughters, who may be presumed to be the direct objects of his bounty, and for whose maintenance and support he would be most anxious to provide, might not receive any benefit from a gift of this nature; for their shares, thus tied up, and in unproductive property, would either not vest in them at all pr only on the happening of a contingency which might not\" occur for a long period of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">The division of such an estate into shares, and the subdivision of those shares, would be greatly facilitated by its conversion into money, or by creating from sales a fond out of which to provide for equality of partition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-10\">The expressions used by the testator in denying to his son till twenty-five years of age, the power to pawn, pledge or mortgage his share, and in giving to the daughters the privilege of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>expending and appropriating a third part of theirs, and the directions given as to holding the daughters\u2019 shares so as not to be liable to the control, debts or engagements of their husbands, show that he must have expected his executors would sell part of his estate, it being almost entirely real.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">If it were a question of doubtfully conferred powers, the language of the will and codicil, the dispositions made by them, and the condition of the estate, are such as to strongly imply that the powers of sale were intended to be granted. The supposition becomes much stronger where the authority has been distinctly and clearly given; and not only is there no express revocation, or even intimation of a change of the testator\u2019s purpose, but the other provisions are such as to indicate the wish to continue it, and the only disposition from which a revocation can be implied as being repugnant to the authority, can be best carried out without conflicting with it or defeating testator\u2019s intentions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">The position that the devise of the residue and remainder, and the limitations thereon, is repugnant to the powers of sale, and that the former, as expressing the'latest intention, is to prevail, is untenable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">To render a subsequent provision repugnant to a previous one, the last must be entirely incompatible with the first; so that if effect be given to the last, the other must entirely fail. <em>(Sweet </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>2 Comstock, 73.) Such, as has been seen, is not the case here: even if it were, the general intent distinctly manifested is to be carried out at the expense of the special intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">4 Kent\u2019s Com. p. 597 and notes; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Amidon, </em>10 Paige, 235; <em>Covenhoven </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>2 Paige, 122.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">If it be considered as established that the testator meant to subject the whole estate, except the land specifically given to devisees, to the control of the executors, so as to enable them to make sales for the purpose of paying debts and legacies, and of dividing the residue into shares, it would follow that the premises sold by them would be extricated from the trust; and it being undeterminable in whom the interest in the proceeds might eventually rest, to render the sales effectual they must have authority to give full receipts discharging the purchasers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-10\">At the time the sale was made, as stated by Mr. Boorman,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cThe assets of the estate were resolved almost or entirely into real estate, subject to a claim thereon by the estate of the widow Hannah of about $14,000. That no means existed of paying <em>off </em>the said claim but by a sale of portions of such real estate, nor of ascertaining the value of the residue in order to apportion it into shares in accordance with the provisions of the will of the testator, but by a sale of the whole of the same. That a portion thereof was sold to Robert Dyson, and the parties in interest became purchasers of the residue according to their respective claims on the estate.\u201d '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">The executors were authorized to sell in their discretion, and as they should find the situation of his affairs required. If they, as appears to be the case, considered it requisite to sell for the purposes of division, under the principle of the cases of <em>Haxtun </em>v. <em>Corse, </em>2 Barbour, 506; <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Pell, </em>3 Edwards, 251; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>5 Barbour S. C. R. 190\u2014\u201cthat where conversion is necessary to carry out the testator\u2019s wish and prevent injustice, sales, as far as made, worked a conversion,\u201d the real estate sold by them would be converted into personal estate, and the distributees, when entitled, would take their shares in the proceeds of the sales as if these shares had been left to them as money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">To these proceeds in the hands of the executors the trust for their benefit would attach, and to them alone must the parties in interest look.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">The sale to Dyson to discharge the indebtedness to the estate of the widow, the executors clearly had the right to make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">The debts, legacies, and annuities being a charge upon the real estate, would have to be provided for and discharged before the residue and remainder could be determined and divided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">In the case of <em>Bradhurst </em>v. <em>Bradhurst, </em>1st Paige, p. 331, a testator, after giving his real and personal estate to executors in trust to and for the uses and purposes mentioned in the will, disposed of portions of his real estate, and then directed them to pay certain annuities, and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his real estate he gave to his grandchildren, at twenty-.one, The income of the estate was insufficient to pay all the annul: ties, and it was held that the executors were authorized to sell such part of the estate as would enable them to raise a sufficient sum to purchase the annuities. In that case the whole estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>was given in trust for the purposes of the will, but the testator has in substance done the same thing in the present instance, for a charge is in effect a devise <em>pro tanto </em>to pay the debts and legacies. (2 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, \u00a7 1131 and notes.) The separation of the real estate from the personal in the gift of the residue, in that case, makes it a much stronger authority in favor of the existence of the power in this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The power to sell for this purpose must include the right to discharge the purchaser from looking after the application of the purchase-money. Each successive purchaser of the lot in ques- ' tion could not be expected to inquire whether more of the real estate had been sold than was requisite to pay the indebtedness, or if the proceeds of that particular lot had been devoted to that purpose. (Story Equity Jur. \u00a7 1131.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">The question has been raised as to the validity of the limitations on the shares of the daughters, whether they are not too remote as depending on an indefinite failure of issue. If they were determined to be illegal, the conveyance of the four children of the testator and the husbands of the daughters uniting with the executors would undoubtedly vest the whole estate in the purchaser; but the title, as based upon the right of the executors to sell, appears from a general survey, of the will and codicil to be so fortified and unassailable that it seems unnecessary to seek to strengthen it further, by attacking them. They can stand without conflicting with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The conclusion arrived at is, that the codicil has not revoked the powers of sale given by the will; that such powers were properly exercised in the sale of the lot in question to Robert Dyson; and that by their conveyance all the right, title, and interest of James R. Smith, in and to the said premises, were vested in Dyson, who held them disentangled from any trust and unembarrassed by any limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">Robert Dyson conveyed this lot with others to Matthew Saint Clair Clarke, one of the executors, and his wife, one of the daughters of the testator, by a clear, absolute conveyance, purporting to be for a good consideration paid by them. The parties to whom they conveyed took from them, not as devisees but as purchasers from Dyson, and cannot be charged with notice of any restriction. Each deed forming a link in the chain of title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>is an absolute conveyance and for valuable consideration, containing no suggestion of any cloud or embarrassment thereon; and by a succession of these, it has come into the hands of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The answer of the defendant admits the title to have been in James R. Smith at his death. The Register\u2019s searches hereto annexed show that there were no incumbrances on the premises at the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">My opinion therefore is, that the plaintiffs have a valid title thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">Ail which, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">January 12, 1857,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">\u2018\u2018M.

That she receive and accept the deed tendered by the plaintiffs of the premises in question; and that she pay unto the plaintiffs the sum of twelve thousand dollars, with interest from the first day of April, 1856. That she execute and deliver <em>to </em>the plaintiffs her bond, secured by mortgage upon the said premises, payable as in the said contract specified, to wit: one thousand dollars on the first day of April, 1857; one thousand dollars on the first day of April, 1858; and twelve hundred and fifty dollars on the first day of April, 1859; with interest on said several sums until paid, to be computed from the first day of April, 1856, and payable half yearly; said mortgage to be a subsequent lien to a mortgage for ten thousand dollars, to be executed by the said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-13\">And it is farther ordered and adjudged; that the defendant pay the costs of this action, taxed with allowance at $326 18, unto the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>From this judgment the defendant appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-5\"><em>E.

We observe, in addition, that, so far from there being any incompatibility between a power to sell and a power to divide, the exercise of the former may, frequently, be necessary to that of the latter, that is; a sale of portions of the estate may be necessary to enable the trustees of the power to make a just and equal division of the whole, and hence, when a power to sell is not expressly given, its existence, as incidental to that of a division, may reasonably be implied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
