From the judgment entered on the 3d of October, 1856, on such decision, the plaintiff appealed to the General Term. The complaint stated in substance, that shortly prior to February, 1853, a joint-stock company was formed, called the \u201cUnited States Express Company,\u201d to carry money, packages, and property, and transact the general express business, and its principal office was in the city of Hew York. It consisted of over seven associates; its capital stock amounted, nominally, to $500,000, divided into 5,000 shares of $100 each. Receipts, for instalments called in and paid on each share, had been issued to the several stockholders, in the form of that issued to George Ely, one of the associates and the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-9\">\u201c United States Express Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-10\">\u201cReceived of George Ely, Esq., One thousand dollars, being twenty per cent., the first instalment, upon fifty shares of the capital stock of the United States 'Express Company held by him, for which stock,, scrip will be issued upon the surrender of this receipt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-11\">\u201cDated, 4th February, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-12\">\u201cC.

To carry out that object, an agreement, (the validity of which was not called in question,) was entered into between the two companies, bearing date the 7th of March; 1853, which was executed \u201cby John Butterfield\u201d and six others, \u201c trustees of the American Express Company, of the first part, and the defendants, Henry Dwight, Jr., and Hamilton Spencer, on behalf of the United States Express Company, of the second part.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">By this agreement the United States Express Company was to buy, and the American Express Company, was to issue, on or before the 30th of April, 1853, to the parties of the second part, for the stockholders of the United States Express Company, full scrip for 2,000 shares of the capital stock of the American Express Company, in such sums and for such persons as the parties of the second part should direct. The parties of the second part agreed to pay for said shares, on delivery of the scrip, $200,000, of which $100,000 was to be divided among those being stockholders of the American Express Company at the time of issuing said 2,000 shares of stock, ratably in proportion to the stock they then held. The other $100,000 was to be held for the benefit of the then stockholders of the American Express Company, and such as should come in under said agreement. The parties of the second part agreed that, on the fulfilment of said agreement, the United States Express Company should be deemed merged in the American Express Company, and its separate organization given up; and that all the stockholders of the United States Express Company, who so desired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>might become purchasers of said 2,000 shares, in the proportion in which they might own stock in the United States Express Company on the 30th of April, 1853. That if any of them should decline to become such purchasers, \u201c and should, within thirty days thereafter, give notice to said Spencer, who should, within twenty-four hours, notify the parties of the first part that they so declined,\u201d then the said parties of the first part agreed to become subscribers for the said stock, to an amount not exceeding $100,000, held by the parties so declining, and repay to each the sum paid on each share of stock, being $20, with ten per cent, on such sum so paid, and the stock in the American Express Company, which such persons so declining would have been entitled to under said agreement, should be issued to said parties of the first part, on their paying the balance, if any remaining to be paid, on the subscription to the stock of the United States Express Company. The stock to be issued under said agreement was to be of the increased stock of the American Express Company. Within thirty days after the 30th of April, 1853, a stock dividend of $99,500 was to be made as follows : $49,500 among those being stockholders of the American Express Company at the date of said agreement, and $50,000 among those who might become stockholders under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">The American Express Company, as thereby constituted,, assumed all the property of the United States Express Company, and its value, at a sum agreed upon, was allowed as part payment of the undisposed $100,000, of the purchase-money for the stock in the American Express Company. It was also alleged that the agreement contained other provisions which need not be stated. The complaint averred that both companies approved and ratified the agreement, and on the 30th of April, 1853, the $100,000 which was to be divided among the stockholders of the American Express Company, was paid. That when the said agreement was made, $20 had been called in and paid on each share of the stock of the United States Express Company; and to carry out said agreement, and pay certain general expenses already incurred, a further call of $24 per share was made on its stockholders, payable on the 25th of April, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\">It also averred that the residue of said $200,000 had been paid by the United States Express Company, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>American. Express Company proceeded, pursnant to said agreement, to issue scrip, or certificates of its increased stock, to such persons, being stockholders in the United States Express Company, as said Spencer and Dwight directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">That when said agreement was made, George Ely, of Rochester, held a receipt or certificate, (a copy of which is already set forth.) That on the 23rd of April, 1853, the plaintiff bought it from Ely and paid him for it the full amount Ely had paid in, viz. $1000, and a premium of <em>$500, </em>and Ely, by an instrument in writing, assigned and delivered it to the plaintiff. It averred that the plaintiff, as such purchaser, became entitled to the benefit of said agreement, and to 20 shares of the increased stock of the American Express Company, as his proportion thereof. It averred that he offered on the 25th of April, 1853, to pay the said call of $24 per\" share, and. that the President and Treasurer of the United States Express Company refused to receive it, or to allow him to make the payment. That after the 30th of April, 1853, he' required Spencer and Dwight to direcj; the American Express Company to issue to him, his proportion of the increased stock of the American Express Company, which they refused to do. That Spencer was notified of the plaintiff\u2019s purchase on the 23rd of April, 1853, and was requested by the plaintiff and by sEly to have issued, and the American Express Company was requested to issue, to the plaintiff his proportion of such increased stock. That Spencer has repeatedly refused to so direct, and the latter Company has declined to issue any stock to the plaintiff, on the ground that they had issued all which was to be issued, and to such persons as Spencer and Dwight had directed. It averred that the stock to which the plaintiff is entitled has been issued to, and stands in Spencer\u2019s name, and that in May, 1853, the American Express Company declared a dividend of 25 per cent., which entitles the plaintiff to five additional shares, which also stand in Spencer\u2019s name, and that said 25 shares are worth $150 per share. The complaint prays, <em>inter alia, </em>for a judgment compelling the American Express Company to issue to the plaintiff 25 shares of its increased stock, and Spencer to surrender the scrip therefor issued to him, and that Spencer and Dwight be compelled to do whatever is necessary to accomplish this result, and that they pay the damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the plaintiff has sustained, to the amount of $5000, and his costs of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">The defendant, Spekcer, who answered \u201cboth individually and as the President of the United States Express Company,\u201d and the defendant, Dwight, interposed an answer, and in and by it alleged that, by the terms of the agreement of the 7th of March, 1853, it was provided that the notice to be given by stockholders in the United States Express Company who might elect not to become purchasers of the stock of the American Express Company, should be given within 30 days after the delivery of that agreement, and not within 30 days after its date, as stated in the complaint, and that it was delivered on the 16th of March, 1853, and not before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">That on or immediately after the 16th of March, 1853, Spencer sent to Ely a letter or notice, stating the making of said agreement and its contents, (a copy of which is set forth in the answer,) and that Ely replied by a letter dated the 9th, and mailed the 14th of April, in which he declared his election not to become a purchaser of stock in the American Express Company and also declared his election to receive the instalment of $1000, which he had paid into the United States Express Company, with 10 per cent, in addition thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">That Spencer received this letter on the 15th of April, 1853, and that there was inclosed in it, the said receipt or certificate, a copy whereof is hereinbefore set forth. That Spencer within 24 hours thereafter gave the notice required by the said agreement to the parties of the first part thereto, and Spencer was thereupon directed to inform James Y. P. Gardner, of Utica, that he could have the stock Ely had declined to take. That on the 16th of April, 1853, Spencer telegraphed to Gardner accordingly, and stated that he must pay $1100 to be entitled to the stock; and on the same day, Gardner, by telegraph, accepted the offer, and agreed to take the stock and remitted the $1100 by mail to Spencer, which Spencer received on the'lSth, and the same was credited on the books of the United States Express Company. That Gardner thereby became owner otf said shares, and a stockholder in the United States Express Company, and on the 20th of April, 1853, paid the call of $24 per share on the said fifty shares and on other shares held by him, and the treasurer there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>upon issued a stock receipt to Gardner, dated the 25th of April, 1858, which stated that the United States Express Company had received from him $6420, being 24 per cent, the second instalment upon <em>267i </em>shares of the capital stock of said Company, \u201cfor which stock, scrip will be issued on the surrender of this receipt,\u201d and that such receipt was received by Gardner on said 20th of April, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">That the sale was made to Gardner and the moneys received from him, and the said stock receipt was issued to him, solely by reason of Ely\u2019s said letter to Spencer of the 9th of April, 1853, and in reliance thereon, and without any notice that Ely intended to claim or exercise any right over said fifty shares of stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">That after said offer was made to Gardner and on the 16th of April, 1853, Spencer wrote to Ely, acknowledging the receipt of his letter of the 9th of April, and informed him that the $1,100 due to him was subject to his order, and would be paid as he should direct, and re-inclosed the said receipt, \u201cwith an authority endorsed thereon to transfer the same, and requesting said Ely to return the same, with his signature, to said authority, as a matter of convenience in doing the business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">That when the plaintiff offered to pay the call of $24 per share, he offered to pay on condition of receiving from the United States Express Company a stock receipt for said fifty shares, and his demand was refused on the ground that the said shares had been sold to, and were owned by, Gardner, and that Ely had given notice of his election as hereinbefore set forth, and that the plaintiff was then so informed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-8\">That the twenty-five shares issued to and standing in the name of Spencer, were issued to him, in terms, in trust, in order to close the arrangements between the two companies, and he claims no property therein; and that he told the plaintiff before this suit was brought, that he would not transfer it until the rights of the plaintiff and of Gardner to it were determined, and that in all the transactions detailed in such answer, Spencer has acted in his official capacity as President of the United States Express Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-9\">The answer put in issue the allegations of the complaint, as to the time of the plaintiff\u2019s purchase and the amount of consideration paid by hirn, and as to a demand by him upon Spencer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>direct the American Express Company to issue stock to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff gave notice of his purchase on the 23rd of April, and avers it was not given prior to the 25th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-5\">It insisted that Gardner is owner of said fifty shares, and as such entitled to the benefits of the said agreement between the two companies, and denied that said shares of the .American Express Company\u2019s stock are worth $150 each, or that the plaintiff has sustained, or is entitled to recover any damage. It insisted that Ely could not make any valid transfer of said fifty shares after having given the notice aforesaid, and after it had been acted on and the stock sold, as detailed in the answer, and prayed a dismissal of the complaint, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">On the trial, and for the purposes of it, the necessity of proving the tender, demand, and refusal mentioned in the complaint, was waived by the defendants. It was proved that the agreement, dated the 7th of March, 1853, was delivered on the 16th of that month.

He stated that the condition.of the stock had not been changed, and would not be while he was away; that no alteration or transfer of the stock to another could be made without his direction, and that he had made no disposition whatever of my stock previous to 'his leaving Hew York, and that it still stood in my name, where it would remain, as I desired.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">Mr. Spencer\u2019s testimony as to that interview was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">\u201c I had an interview with George Ely and Abraham P. Ely at Rochester, just at evening, on the 21st of April, 1853. It was on my return from Buffalo. I had business to transact with Abraham P. Ely, who was the agent of the United States Express Company, to pay him off, and 'close his connection with the company. After completing that settlement, just as I was leaving the office for the oars, George Ely mentioned to me that he had arranged, or concluded, or determined to retain hig stock, I cannot give his exact words. I replied \u2018have you\u2019 (or substantially so) \u2018 I am glad to hear of it, for I think you will find the stock profitable, and I should be glad to have the original subscribers make the profits, if any.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-9\">He talked a little farther in regard to the probable profitableness of the stock, and then I left. Hot a word was said in regard to the condition of the stock not being changed, nor about the stock standing in his name, nor in regard to this; that a transfer of the stock would not, and could not, be made in my absence, or that I h\u00e1i made no disposition of the stock. Hothing whatever was said as to the stock during this conversation, except at the commencement, when Ely said he had arranged, or concluded, or determined, to keep the stock. \u00cd did not say that the condition of the stock had not been changed, and would not be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>in my absence, or that it could not be in my absence.

I have a very distinct recollection of that conversation of the 21st of April; my attention was called to it the next week, on my return to New York. I state that these things were not said, both from distinct recollection that they were not said, and because I know they could not have been said without my recollecting, nor without my telling Ely a falsehood. I have three reasons for saying that no such conversation took place:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">\u201c First.

By the agreement of the 7th of March, 1853, the time for the stockholders of the United States Express Company to notify Spencer, that they declined to become purchasers of the stock of the American Express Company, was, thirty days after the delivery of such agreement, which took place on the 16th of March, 1853.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-14\">George Ely, of Rochester, who was an original subscriber for fifty shares of the capital stock of the United States Express Company, by a letter directed to Spencer, dated April 9,1853, and received by the latter on the 15th of said April, notified Spencer that he declined to become a purchaser of stock in the American Express Company, and that he elected to receive $1,000 being the first instalment paid on the fifty shares held by him,, with 10 per cent, in addition, and in such letter inclosed and sent to Spencer the receipt of the 4th of February, 1853, which had been given to Ely when he paid the first instalment, the form of which is, as stated in the complaint. Spencer within twenty-four hours after receiving such notice and receipt, in order and with intent to notify the parties of the first part to the agreement of the 7th of March, 1853, that Ely had so declined, was about leaving his office to go to the office of said parties at Ho. 10 Wall street, to serve them there, with a notice, in writing, that Ely had so declined, when John Butterfield one of said parties entered the office of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Spencer, who then informed said Butterfield that said Ely had so declined, and exhibited to him the said letter from said Ely. It was then agreed by said Butterfield and Spencer, that James Y. P. Gardner of Utica, H. Y. might become a purchaser of said stock, if he desired to do so, all which occurred within said twenty-four hours. It was also then and there agreed that Spencer should send a telegraphic dispatch to said Gardner to the effect that he could become a purchaser of fifty shares of said stock. Such a telegraphic dispatch was then and there written and handed to said Butterfield to be forwarded by him, as he was a Director in the telegraphic company and could transmit the dispatch without charge to said Gardner and the same was by Butterfield forwarded to said Gardner. Gardner received the same on said 16th of April: He replied by telegraph to Spencer, the same day, accepting the offer, and the same day mailed to Spencer a bank-draft for $1,100, to pay the first instalment and ten per cent, thereon, which was received by Spencer on the 18th of April, who obtained thereon the amount thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AG\">Ely, by notifying Spencer that he declined to become a purchaser of stock in the American Express Company, and by sending back with such notice his receipt for the instalment paid by him, and by the acts of Spencer in giving notice thereof, as aforesaid, within twenty-four hours thereafter, to said John Butterfield, and selling the stock to Gardner, pursuant to the said agreement between Spencer and Butterfield, divested himself and was deprived of all right and power to reassert any rights as owner of said stock, or to make any valid sale or disposition thereof. To this the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">Spencer\u2019s letter to Ely, of the 16th of April, 1853, inclosing in it the receipt, for the purpose of having Ely sign the power of attorney drawn on the back of it, gave Ely no right or power to renounce the election declared in his letter of the 9th of April. To this the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted. The conversation between Ely and Spencer, at Rochester, on the 21st of April, after Gardner had bought the stock, and paid one thousand one hundred dollars on account of it, could not operate to annul ' the rights which Gardner had acquired by his purchase, or to restore to Ely any rights to or power of disposition over the stock.

But, for the relief and benefit of. the United States 'Express Company in their associate capacity, as well as for the relief of such of their stockholders as might prefer to withdraw from the association and not become contributors to the funds requisite to enable the latter to perform their agreement, it was also provided as follows,\u2014\u201c if any Of the stockholders of the United States Express Company shall decline to become purchasers of the stock of the American Express Company, under this contract, and shall, within thirty days after the delivery hereof, give notice to Hamilton Spencer\u201d (the then President of the United States Express Company), \u201cat 170 Broadway, in the'city of New York, who shall, within twenty-four hours after, give the like notice in writing to the parties of the first part,\u201d (seven individuals described in the agreement as trustees of the American Express Company), \u201cat their office, No. 10 Wall street, New York, that they so decline, the parties of the first part- shall become-subscribers for the stock of the United States Express Company, to an amount not exceeding $100,000, held by persons so declining, and shall repay to each the sum he has already paid in on such stock, being the sum of $20 on each share, together with ten per cent, upon such sum paid in, and the stock in said American Express Company which such person would have been entitled to under this contract shaft be issued to Said parties of the first part, upon their paying \"the balance, if any remaining to be paid, on the subscriptions to the stock of the United States Express Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The true construction of this agreement has a very important bearing upon the effect of the election afterwards made by Ely, the assignor of the plaintiff herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">It is observed, therefore, that, irrespective of the stipulation that in a certain contingency the seven trustees would take and pay for stock of declining stockholders to the amount of $100,000, the United States Express Company were bound to take and pay $200,000,' for 2,000 shares of the stock of the other association.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">To this they were bound, whatever might be the amount of stock held by their declining stockholders, whether greater or less than the amount of $100,000, which, upon certain conditions, the trustees agreed to take; and they were so bound whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>condition, upon which the trustees should become bound to take any of the stock, was complied with or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The obligation assumed by the said <em>trustees </em>was conditional; to bind <em>them </em>to take the stock two things were made essential conditions precedent, viz. that the declining stockholders should, within thirty days, give notice to Hamilton Spencer of their election to decline becoming purchasers of the stock of the American Express Company; and that he, within twenty-four hours thereafter, should give the like notice in writing to the said trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">If the stock held by persons so declining amounted to more than $100,000, then the trustees were not bound to take the excess, but the United States Express Company, (composed of the persons who continued to be stockholders under the arrangement), must take and pay for such excess; and if no notice was given to the trustees within the twenty-four hours mentioned in the condition, then the United States Express Company, by the express terms of the agreement, were bound to receive and pay for the whole $200,000 of stock in the American Express Company, unaided by any contribution thereto by such trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The United States Express Company had thus, in its associate capacity assumed a heavy responsibility, looking primarily to its several stockholders for the contributions necessary to enable the Company to perform the agreement, but securing the privilege, (in case any of its stockholders should elect not to become parties to the purchase and contribute accordingly) of calling upon the trustees to aid to the extent of $100,000, by taking stock of declining stockholders to that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The importance of this view of the construction of the agreement is this: that it appears, thereby, that the United States Express Company, in its associate capacity, had a deep interest in the election about to be tendered to the individual stockholders therein, and were in a condition to become parties to such election, when tendered and acted upon by the several stockholders. In the first instance, that Company on the one hand and the individual stockholders making their respective elections on the other, were the proper parties to the contract which was to result from such election.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">It is not material, in the views entertained of this case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>other respects, to determine whether this Company was <em>bound </em>to give the notice, within the twenty-four hours, to the trustees, or to permit the trustees to take the stock of their declining stockholders without such notice; for if they were so bound, then it is conceived to be quite clear, that, upon a binding election to withdraw being declared by any stockholder, the right of the trustees, to the stock, instantly attached, and the obligation of the Company to permit the trustees to take and pay therefor precluded any revocation of the election so declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">And if not so bound\u2014and that appears to be a construction best according with the provisions of the agreement\u2014the Company were at liberty to give the notice to the trustees within the twenty-four hours stipulated in the condition, or to forego the benefit of that privilege and perform their agreement, unaided by any contribution from the trustees; and in such case the Company, acting in this respect on behalf of the stockholders, who did elect to continue such and pay their proper contributions, would hold or dispose of the stock, of the declining stockholders, as they thought proper; and in this, there was no technical difficulty founded in the idea of a surrender of the shares to the Company collectively, since the agreement of consolidation itself plainly contemplated the extinction of all the stock of the United States Express Company, and the issue of stock of the American Express Company, in lieu thereof, to such persons as the first named Company, by Dwight and Spencer acting on their behalf, should direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In every aspect of the agreement, therefore, it was the United States Express Company, in its associate or aggregate capacity, which had assumed the obligation to pay the $200,000, and, in view of that obligation was interested, primarily and chiefly, if not exclusively, in the election which was about to be offered to the respective stockholders therein. And this rendered it eminently proper to provide that the person who was to receive notice of the election, to be so tendered and declared, should be Hamilton Spencer, the President of the Company, and that he and Dwight, on the behalf of the Company, should direct to whom the stock in the American Express Company should be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Nor is there any difficulty, in this view of the rights and posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tion of the United States Express Company, arising from the fact that it was about to deal and did deal with the individual members of its own association. Whatever difficulty, if any, might exist at law, there is none in equity in regarding the Company as acting in this respect on behalf of, or as in truth consisting of, such stockholders as should continue to hold stock under the agreement for the consolidation, and should contribute thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">With this condition of the rights and responsibilities of the United States Express Company, the action of that company, by its Board of Directors, (as appears by the notices issued), was in precise correspondence. By order of the board, Spencer, as President, notified the stockholders of the fact of consolidation and of its material provisions, and offered to each stockholder his election to become a purchaser of stock in the American Express Company under the arrangement, or to decline and return his receipt for the instalment he had paid upon his stock, with the assurance that if, within thirty days, he gave notice in writing to Spencer, at the Company\u2019s Office, the amount of such instalment, with ten per cent, in addition thereto, would be refunded to him. They thus became the direct and immediate parties to the election tendered, and to the offer of repayment. Whether the trustees, of the other company, would be required to make, the repayment or not was not ascertained, and if at all required, the extent, to which the obligation, by the trustees to take to the amount of $100,000, would suffice to cover the stock of declining parties, could not be ascertained. The offer of the election and the offer to repay to the stockholder was, therefore, in this stage of the transaction, a matter simply and only between the Company and its stockholders respectively. And such was in form, substance, and effect, the circular notice issued by the President of the Company, by order of the Board, as set forth in the case herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The result of these views seems quite inevitable. The notice sent by the Company to Ely was an unequivocal offer, in which his choice was tendered to him to come in under the new arrangement and share its burdens and responsibilities, with the chance of its profits, or to withdraw from the enterprise, with the assurance that if he declined to become a purchaser of the new stock, and should, within thirty days,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>give notice that he so declined, and send back the receipt he held, for the instalment already paid, he should receive the amount of such instalment, with ten per cent, in addition. The acceptance of this offer completed a contract between the parties. Within the thirty days Ely wrote to the President of the Company, in the most unequivocal manner, declining to receive stock in the American Express Company, and electing to receive back the sum of $1,000 (the instalment paid by him), with ten per cent, in addition thereto, and in consummation, on his part, of all that he could do to make his acceptance of the Company\u2019s offer perfect, he returned, to the Company, the receipt held by him, as the voucher for such instalment, and the only evidence in his possession, of his claim to any stock in the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">These transactions constituted a contract, binding upon both parties. An offer by the one, duly tendered to the other, and by the latter unconditionally accepted: and from the time of such acceptance the contract was irrevocable, except by mutual assent, Ely, on the one hand, could insist upon its performance by the Company, and for the same reason he was bound, beyond the power,, (of his own mere will,) to retract his acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Such a condition of things between two individuals would present no question open to discussion. That an offer thus communicated by letter, when accepted by letter, becomes a contract binding according to the terms of' such offer, and binding upon both parties, is not doubtful. Although doubt has formerly been suggested as to the precise moment when an acceptance takes effect, <em>i. </em>e., whether on forwarding the letter of acceptance, or on its receipt by the party making the offer; even that is not now doubtful in this State \u2019 since the decision of <em>Mactier </em>v. <em>Frith, </em>6 Wend. 103; and before that decision, it was clear that such offer made and sent, followed by an acceptance duly received, constituted a complete and binding contract, irrevocable by either party.\u2014See cases cited in the above case, Story on Cont\u2019s, \u00a7 384, and cases cited in the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">It does not appear to us necessary to discuss at length the question, whether the enclosing of the receipt to Ely, with a request to him to sign the power of attorney endorsed thereon, gave Ely any right to revoke his assent to the sale, or indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>any dissent therefrom, by Spencer, on behalf of the Company. In our view, it was a ratification, or rather a recognition of the fact, that the contract was mutually assented to. Though it was not strictly necessary, that any such power of attorney should be signed, it was requested, for the convenience of the Company, and as a suitable voucher to them, in their subsequent use or disposition of the stock. The receipt was not returned to Ely as an opening of the matter for further negotiation. The act and the letter accompanying the receipt, both proceed upon the idea that the contract had been entered into, and'that its actual performance was in the contemplation of the parties. We fully concur in the decision at Special Term upon this point. The act neither gave, nor was intended to give to Ely a right to renounce the election he had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Such being the respective rights of the Company and Ely, the stock or the privilege of coming into Ely\u2019s place,- as a subscriber was actually sold by Spencer to Gardner, who paid the sum of $1,100 therefor to the Company. Whether Spencer, as President, had the authority, on behalf of the Company, to make the sale to Gardner or not\u2014he did make such sale, and the Company received the money and adopted the sale. They set it up as their defence herein. It does not lie with Ely or his assignee to deny that authority. So whether it was the duty of Spencer to give the notice to the trustees of the American Express Company within twenty-four hours, and tender the privilege to them, is a question between the trustees and Spencer, or the trustees and the U. S. Express Company. Although the questions were raised on the argument of the appeal, whether Spencer did sufficiently offer the stock to the trustees, and whether he sold it to Gardner by their consent, it is, for the reasons stated, unnecessary for the purposes of the decision to answer them. If by the agreement of consolidation the trustees acquired a right to the stock of a declining stockholder, whether Spencer gave them the written notice or not, then most clearly that right became fixed the moment Ely\u2019s election was duly declared\u2014and if the right of the trustees depended upon,their being notified by Spencer, then a sale, by the Company, without giving the trustees any notice, should not be complained of by such trustees, and was at'the option of the Company. Much more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>then was the sale to Gardner conclusive upon Ely if the trustees consented thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">As before suggested, the Company, in our opinion, acquired a full right to the stock the moment Ely elected to accept the offer which Spencer as President tendered to him, and we now add that after the sale to Gardner, Ely could not retract and claim the stock, whatever may have been the purport of the conversation between Spencer and himself on the 21st of April. In regard to that conversation there is a conflict of evidence. The testimony of the two parties thereto presents it in a very different aspect. The finding of the court does not explicitly state to which of them credence was given, but it will suffice to say, that, for the reasons above stated we quite agree with the conclusion at special term, whichever of the two parties be taken to give the more accurate account of what occurred,</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">If these views are correct the judgment at special term must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">It is proper however to add, that, in relation to the plaintiff, we are entirely agreed that he stands in no better situation, in this controversy, than his assignor Ely would have done. At the time of the alleged sale to him, by Ely, the plaintiff\u2019s agent examined the power of attorney upon the certificate, which Spencer had forwarded to Ely for Ms signature, and mquired the cause of its bemg there, and was then informed by Ely \u201c M substance of the reason why it was there.\u201d If so, then the plamtiff, by his agent, knew of the very facts wMch under the opmions above expressed, concluded Ely and deprived him of the power to reclaim the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">True, Ely says, he also informed him of Ms conversation with Spencer, but as before remarked, that conversation would not avail to reinstate Ely in the ownersMp of the stock, and although, the fact, of a sale to Gardner, was not known to Ely or to the plaintiff\u2019s agent, there was enough to put him on inquiry by wMch he would have learned the true condition of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The judgment should be affirmed. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
