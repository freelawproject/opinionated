The facts established by the evidence are as-follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">\u201c About the first of May, 1854, the defendants borrowed of the firm of Gildemeister &amp; Ueustaedter the sum of one thousand dollars, to be returned in a week. Before the money became payable, the defendants applied to that firm to get a note discounted, and upon the suggestion of Gildemeister that he had a friend who could get a note discounted if defendants had any collateral security, the defendants placed in his hands the note now in suit, dated December 15, 1853, made by the defendants for $1,283 27, payable six months after date, to the order of. themselves (the defendants) and delivered to Gildemeister as collateral security for its payment a note for two thousand dollars, dated Eebruary 20th, 1854, at three months made by Ryder and Malony to the order of G. S. Mott, and by him endorsed to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">Gildemeister took the note in suit to the plaintiff, and asked him to get it discounted, and told him that he wanted it for a friend, but without stating for whom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">The plaintiff told Gildemeister in reply to the application that if he would get some collateral security, he, the plaintiff, would get the note discounted. Gildemeister then gave him the note in suit, and in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s requirement that he should \u201c get \u201d some collateral, gave him also the two thousand dollar note, made by Ryder and Malony, which he had received from the defendants, as collateral security for the note in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">As the note of Ryder &amp; Malony would become due before the other note matured, Gildemeister told the plaintiff to collect it and credit it in his account with Gildemeister &amp; Heustaedter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\">The plaintiff then took the two notes to the Bank of the Republic and <em>le\u00edi </em>the note in suit for discount with the Ryder &amp; Malony note as collateral security, and it was discounted by the bank, on the 12th day of May, and the proceeds were paid over to Gildemeister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\">On the 23d day of May (twenty-four days before the note in suit became due,) the $2000 note of Ryder &amp; Malony was paid at the Bank of the Republic, and the plaintiff drew a check for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the money. It does not appear that at that time, or at the time the notes were delivered to the plaintiff, or at any intermediate time Gildemeister &amp; Neustaedter owed the plaintiff in account anything. But in the previous April the plaintiff had procured a note of Gildemeister &amp; Neustaedter for $2,226 46, to be discounted with his endorsement at the same bank, and that note would become payable on the 5th of June, then ensuing. On the day the $2,000 note was paid, or on the following day, May 24th, Gildemeister &amp; Neustaedter failed; and on the 24th of May the plaintiff, by arrangement with the bank, took up the $2,226 46 note, although not yet due, applying -towards its payment the $2,000 paid in upon the note of Byder &amp; Malony, and the note in suit not being paid at maturity the plaintiff has brought this action against the defendants to collect that also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">It further appears that shortly before the note of Byder &amp; Malony became due, they made an arrangement with the defendants for a partial renewal of this note, and they paid to the defendants five hundred dollars and gave a new note for fifteen hundred dollars, whereupon the defendants agreed that they would take up the $2,000 note and restore it to the makers. In pursuance of this arrangement the defendants, in fact, paid the two thousand dollar note at the Bank of the Bepublic when it became due, and before they did so one of the defendants \u201cwas informed by Mr. Gildemeister of what had passed between him and the plaintiff in relation to it.\u201d But there is not in this or in anything else testified to, any satisfactory proof that the defendants ever sanctioned or intended to sanction the application of this note to any other purpose or indebtedness, except to the note now in suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-6\"><em>Jer. Larocque, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Anq\">moved for judgment on the verdict, and contended, 1. That the plaintiff having received the Byder and Malony note from Gildemeister and Neustaedter, with authority to collect and credit it in account, and having had no notice until long after he had applied its proceeds to the payment of the $2,226 40 note, of any equity in favor of the defendants, or that they had ever held the Byder &amp; Malony note, had clearly the right to apply the proceeds of the Byder &amp; Malony note as he did apply them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>2. If Eyder &amp; Malony had themselves paid their note at its maturity, the transaction would have been the same as if they had paid it to Gildemeister &amp; Heustaedter, to whom Slingerland &amp; McFarland had transferred it, and Gildemeister &amp; Heustaedter had then paid over its amount to the plaintiff, in part payment of the $2,226 40 note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">S. The Ryder &amp; Malony note did not bear the name of the defendants in any form. Gildemeister &amp; Heustaedter were its lawful holders by delivery from the defendants themselves, and with the right to collect it and transfer it. That was the intention of the transaction, as it matured before the note in suit. There is no question, therefore, in the case of a conversion of property, such as arose in the cases of <em>Stalker </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>and <em>Coddington </em>v. <em>Bay, </em>cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">4. There was no mistake or ignorance of fact on the part of the defendants when they paid the Eyder &amp; Malony note. On the contrary, it was with full notice from Gildemeister that Gildemeister &amp; Heustaedter had delivered it to the plaintiff to collect and credit it in theiraccount. It was, therefore, a voluntarypayment by the defendants themselves; and the defendants, after having paid it, are not at liberty to contest the right of the plaintiff which they thereby admitted. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Dutcher, </em>9 Cowen, 674, and cases cited; <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>4 Cowen, 250; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>2 Cowen, 428; <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Birdsall, </em>2 Cowen, 419; <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Weyer, </em>5 Hill, 389.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">5. Even if the payment of the Eyder &amp; Malony note could be considered, <em>pro tanto, </em>as a payment of the note in suit, the defendants had no right of action against the plaintiff, after such voluntary payment, to recover the balance; and, having no right of action, cannot recover that balance by way of counter-claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">6. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-9\"><em>Joshua M. Van Cott, </em>for the defendants, argued the following points.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-10\">I.\u2014The note in suit was paid out of the proceeds of the collateral note, which matured first, (20 J. R. 646, <em>Bay </em>v. <em>Coddington; </em>6 Hill, 93, <em>Stalker </em>v. McDonald; 2 Kernan, 313, <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Mathews.) </em>The plaintiff is not a <em>bond fide </em>holder of the collateral note, except to the extent of the principal note. II.\u2014The doctrine of estoppel has no application to the case.\u20143 Kernan, 316,1 Greenl. Ev <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u00a7 207; 8 Wendell, 483; 2 E. D. Smith\u2019s R. 14; 4 Barbour, 495; 5 Denio, 154; 3 Hill. 219; 2 Kernan, 100. (1.) It was a condition of the discount of the principal note that the plaintiff should hold, and of course be paid, the collateral; and the bank had a clear right to have it paid.\u2014(2.) As between plaintiff and defendants, the collateral was paid by its makers. They in fact paid it, a part in cash and part by a new note. The mode of doing it was of no consequence, and did not affect the original transaction or the rights of the parties to it.\u2014HI. The plaintiff held the balance of the proceeds of the collateral note, subject to the order of the defendants; who, upon the principle of the first point, are entitled to recover it on their counter-claim. IY. Under the power reserved to the Court, judgment should be rendered for such balance, with interest and costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b465-6\">By the Court. Woodruff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT5\">If the General Term will suffer their duties to be so far extended that, by consent of the parties, they will assume to determine all questions of fact and law, their labors will not only be greatly complicated, but will embrace a class of duties which the law has devolved upon others. We are called upon, on this occasion, to review the evidence taken, at what it would be a misnomer to call a trial, and to find the facts which, in general, it is the duty of the jury to find, and then to decide the law applicable to those facts. And this we are to do without having the witnesses before us, or any opportunity to judge of their intelligence, or, from their manner, to estimate the degree of confidence which ought to be reposed in the language they use.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">We have, nevertheless, addressed ourselves to the subject, and if we should err in our conclusions of fact, we should regret more deeply than we now do, that the facts were not determined by the jury, who were empannelled for that express purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">(The opinion, after recapitulating the facts as above stated, proceeds as follows:)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Although the plaintiff was not (on the 12th of Hay, 1854) informed of the names of the defendants, he knew that Gildemeister was acting in this matter as the agent of the friend for whom he desired to procure the discount, and he received the notes and procured the discount with that knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>And although the agent, Gildemeister, told him, \u201cas the $2,000 note of Ryder and Malony fell due before the other, to collect it and credit it in our account\u201d (i. <em>e. </em>Gildemeister and Eeustaedter\u2019s account), yet it does not appear that thi\u00a7 was for any other purpose than as security for the note so to be discounted. There was no express authority to apply the money which would be paid in, to any other indebtedness\u2014nd other indebtedness then existed. As the note was made by third parties, who in due course of business might be expected to pay the note at its maturity, nothing was necessarily implied in this instruction but what it would be the plaintiff\u2019s duty to do, and his right to do, if he retained possession of the two notes. And in view of the other testimony to the acts and admissions of the plaintiff, in relation to the notes in question, the just conclusion is, that he received and held the $2,000 note as collateral security for the note now in suit, and as security for that alone, and that \u25a0 this was the actual understanding of the parties at the time. It was all that he required as a condition of getting the note discounted. It was all that there was any motive to offer him. It was all that Gildemeister could offer him, without practising what in judgment of law would be a fraud upon the. defendants. And the plaintiff having notice that Gildemeister was procuring the discount for a friend, knew, or had reason to know, that the securities offered belonged to the friend for whom he was acting, and he therefore knew that any application of the $2,000 note to any other debt would be a violation of the rights of such friend; at all events, there was enough to put him on enquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The better conclusion is, that neither he nor Gildemeister contemplated any fraud; it is rather to be presumed that they did not; and the whole evidence, taken together, is not only in harmony with, but sustains the conclusion that the $2,000 note was received by him and held as collateral security for the note in suit, and for that only. He so treated it; he himself endorsed it with the term \u201c collateral.\u201d He so used it, delivering it to the bank as security for the note in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The conclusion is irresistible that the application of the proceeds of the $2,000 note to the note of Gildemeister and Ueustaedter, discounted the previous April, and not yet due, was an expedient resorted to by the plaintiff upon the failure of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>firm to divert a security, held for a different purpose, to a use to which it was not designed, and to which he had no right to apply \" it, and to which he knew he had no right to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">If this conclusion rested upon otherwise nicely balanced testimony, it would be greatly strengthened by the suspicious manner, out of the usual course of business, in which it was done. Applying it to a note not due for some eleven days thereafter, as if apprehensive that the friend for whom the note in suit was discounted would seek to arrest the money in that stage of the transaction; for at that time the plaintiff had no reason to suppose that the note was not paid in due course by the Messrs. Ryder and Malony.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The $2,000 note belonged to the defendants. It was placed. by them in the hands of Gildemeister as security only for the note in suit. It was placed by Gildemeister in the plaintiff\u2019s hands for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Gildemeister had no authority to use it for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The plaintiff made no advance upon it except to procure the discount of the note now in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">If Gildemeister attempted to authorize the plaintiff to apply its proceeds to any other debt, it was a fraud upon the defendants, and the plaintiff could only hold it for the amount of his advances or liabilities incurred upon the faith thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">But in truth the'whole evidence does not warrant us in finding that Gildemeister ever agreed that it might be applied to any other debt, or that the plaintiff received it upon that understanding, or condition, or that the defendants sanctioned such an application of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">It is strenuously insisted that the payment of the $2,000 note, by the defendants themselves, pursuant to their\u2019 arrangement with Ryder and Malony, was a voluntary payment to the use of the plaintiff, which placed the whole of the money at his free disposal, to be applied, if he thought proper, to the note he had endorsed and procured to be discounted for Gildemeister and Neustaedter.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">The payment ought not to be so regarded. It was according to the intention of the parties, when the note was delivered (as security for the note in suit), that it would and should be paid at maturity. It was according to the natural, usual, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>regular course of business, that it should be so paid. The payment was in discharge of an express understanding with Ryder and Malony, that the defendants would pay it, and restore it to them. It was, therefore, their duty to pay it, as they did, without involving Ryder and Malony in any question or controversy on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The utmost that can reasonably be inferred from what may properly be regarded as a consent that the plaintiff credit the proceeds is, that he was to retain them until the note in suit became due. This is entirely consistent with the testimony of Grildemeister, and with the other evidence that the Ryder and Malony note was received by the plaintiff as collateral security for the note in suit only, and, when so understood, it was proper, and in accordance with an honorable regard to that understanding, for the defendants to pay in the money, as it was upon other grounds, above suggested, their duty to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It follows, from these views, that the plaintiff has not only been paid the amount of the note in suit, but he has also received the difference between the amount of that note, $1,288 27, and $2,000, which difference is the defendants\u2019 money. This difference they demand, by way of counter-claim, in this action, and should be allowed to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It seems to us, that under the view we have taken of the facts proved, there are no legal principles involved in regard to which there is doubt, or respecting which there was any difference between the counsel on the argument. It was rather the application of obvious and well settled rules, to the proofs, that was the subject of contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">That, Grildemeister had no right to appropriate the note to his own debt, even if he attempted to do so, is quite clear, and that the plaintiff taking it in fraud of the defendants\u2019 rights, could only claim to the extent of his advances upon the faith thereof, is not, since the case of <em>Stalker </em>v. McDonald, 6 Hill 93, open to discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">And, on the other hand, that money voluntarily paid to one who claims a right to receive it for his own use, and paid with knowledge of all the material facts, cannot be recovered back, is equally well settled. The cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel are full to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>But in our judgment the facts proved in this case do not admit of the application of this latter principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Our conclusion is, that the defendants should have judgment for the sum of \u00a7716 73, with, interest from the time of the application of the money, May 24th, 1854, with the costs of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
