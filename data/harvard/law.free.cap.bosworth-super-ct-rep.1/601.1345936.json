The only questions presented by the appeal relate to decisions of the Court at the trial, permitting the defendants Smith &amp; O'Hara to be examined as witnesses in their own behalf. The action was tried in October, 1856, before Bosworth, J., without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-9\">The plaintiffs, before commencing this action, had recovered a judgment against the defendant Morrell, and had purchased other judgments recovered against him by third persons, on all of which executions had been returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">This action was brought by them as such creditors, to procure transfers of property made by Morrell to O\u2019Hara, to be set aside as fraudulent and void, and for other relief, as hereinafter stated. The complaint states, the recovery of the judgments, the issuing of executions thereon, and the return of the same unsatisfied, and the assignment to the plaintiffs, of those recovered by other persons as plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-11\">That Morrell was a manufacturer of blank books and stationery in the city of Hew York, having a store containing blank books and stationery, worth from $10,000 to $12,000, and machinery and stock in his factory worth about $14,000, the machinery being subject to a chattel mortgage for $5,500, held by John Campbell &amp; Co. (a firm composed of the defendants Campbell &amp; Smith), and being worth some $1500 less than the mortgage upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-12\">That after Morrell contracted the debts on which the judgments were recovered, and in or about October, 1852, he failed in business and stopped payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>In anticipation of and shortly previous to such failure, \u201che conspired with the defendants Smith &amp; O\u2019Hara, to dispose of his property in fraud of his creditors, and to conceal or cover up the same so that his creditors could not reach it, and\u201d * * \u201cin</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">pursuance of this scheme, and with intent to delay and defraud the said creditors, the said Smith and O\u2019Hara mutually arranged and agreed, that after the transfer should be made to O\u2019Hara, as hereinafter mentioned,\u201d the chattel mortgage should be foreclosed and the property sold and bid in by Smith; and O\u2019Hara should pay Smith the difference between the price at which the property sold and the amount of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-6\">\u201c The defendants Smith, O\u2019Hara, and Morrell, further arranged and agreed that all the property in the store and factory should be transferred and delivered to O\u2019Hara, at the nominal price of $8,000, which the said O\u2019Hara should pay in notes, and which notes Morrell should use in effecting favorable compromises with his creditors.\u201d * * \u201c It was further arranged and agreed between the defendants, that the defendant O\u2019Hara should go on, in his own name, with the business previously conducted by Morrell, and should employ Morrell as managing agent, at a nominal salary of $1,000 a year; that the business should be thus continued for two years, to give Morrell an opportunity to buy up at a low rate the claims against him held by his creditors, and at the end of that time O\u2019Hara should pay over and re-deliver to Morrell all the residue of the property and effects, and the proceeds and profits thereof, after deducting $4,000 a year for his own compensation, and the amount of the notes so given by him as aforesaid;\u201d and \u201cif Morrell could procure a purchaser of said property at a fair price, the said O\u2019Hara should sell the same to said purchaser in his own name, and after making the deductions above mentioned, should pay over the balance to said Morrell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-7\">\u201cIn pursuance of this arrangement,\u201d Smith foreclosed the mortgage and bought the property for $4,000, and immediately transferred it to O'Hara, who paid Smith $5,500 therefor, and Smith paid over this money to said firm of John Campbell &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-8\">\u201cAlso, in pursuance of said arrangement,\u201d the other property of Morrell in the factory, and that in the store, were transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>by Morrell to O\u2019Hara for said sum of $8,000, paid in notes as aforesaid, who continued in the business, employing Morrell as managing agent, and the said O\u2019Hara has made a large profit thereon, at least $5,000 a year; and the said O\u2019Hara still continues in said business, and in possession of the said goods and property, or the proceeds and profits thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">Wherefore, the plaintiffs demanded judgment, that the transfer made by Morrell to O\u2019Hara be adjudged fraudulent and void, that a receiver be appointed to tahe-possession of the said property, and the proceeds and profits thereof '; that O\u2019Hara account to the receiver for the profits of said stock and manufactory, and that Campbell and Smith be compelled to pay to the Receiver the $1,500 which Morrell had paid to Smith,- and that the receiver apply the property he might receive, to pay the said judgments held by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">Campbell and Smith answered jointly, and O\u2019Hara put in a separate answer, denying the conspiracy and all fraud. Morrell did not answer the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-7\">On the trial the plaintiffs examined Morrell as a witness in their behalf, and be gave evidence tending to establish all the allegations of the complaint, except as to the recovery of the judgments, the issuing of executions thereon, and. the return of the same unsatisfied. And he also \u201c gave evidence tending to prove that the transfers of property alleged in the complaint to have been made by Morrell to O\u2019Hara were made in .pursuance of a preconcerted scheme between Morrell and the defendants Smith and O\u2019Hara, thereby to defraud the creditors of Morrell, and hinder and delay them in the collection from him of their just claims and demands against him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-8\">\u201cAfter the plaintiffs had rested their case, the defendant, Augustine Smith, offered himself as a witness, whereupon the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel enquired, in whose behalf he was offered? To this, it was answered, that he was offered for the defendants generally, including Augustine Smith, and excluding the defendant Morrell. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to said Smith being examined in his own behalf, and also to his being examined for the defendants generally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-9\">The Court overruled each of said objections, and to such deci- \u2019 sion the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then and there duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>O\u2019Hara was also offered, when the same proceedings were had as when Smith was offered, and the same decision was made and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">Smith, and O\u2019Hara, were severally sworn and examined, on behalf of all the defendants, including himself, and excluding the defendant Morrell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">The Court gave judgment for. the defendants, O\u2019Hara, Campbell, and. Smith, dismissing the complaint as to them. From that judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-7\"><em>D. D. Field, </em>for appellants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-8\">Insisted that, the defendants, O\u2019Hara and Smith, were not competent witnesses for themselves. They were not united in interest with Morrell so as to make them competent, because he had been examined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-9\">The test, under section 397 of the Code, is this: Could Morrell have been called by his co-defendant as a witness for them, or could they have been called for him? If this could have been done then he is not <em>\u201c </em>united in interest\u201d with them. That they could have been called for each other is clear, under section 397, 10 Barb. 112; 1 Kern. 131; 3 Kern. 266.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-10\">The expression \u201c united in interest\u201d is used in section 119,157 and 306. Under section 119, it is clear that if either Morrell, O\u2019Hara or Smith, had commenced an action in respect to the assigned property, he need not have joined the others with him. Under section 156, it is clear that Morrell could not have verified an answer for O\u2019Hara and Smith. And under section 306, it is clear that the Court could give costs against Morrell, and for O\u2019Hara and Smith. Indeed that was done in this very judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-11\">Indeed, the union of interest intended by section 397, is such as must necessarily make the judgment a joint one, whatever it be.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-12\"><em>C. O' Conor, </em>for respondents,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQR3\">made and argued the following points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-13\">First Point.\u2014The 397th section of the Code covers this case. The part in italics was passed in 1849, and sections 390 and 391 are original sections. The case of <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Doc &amp; Roe, </em>2 Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Rep. 140, shows that it is not whether a party be a joint contractor or joint conspirator, that allows him to be a witness, but the fact that he is sued as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\">Second Point.\u2014The exception rests upon a criticism upon the words, \u201cunited in interest.\u201d This criticism will not avail: because\u2014\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-6\">1. The word conspiracy denotes being united in interest, and a joint design, 18 Wendell, 343.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">2. Morrell did swear to a joint fraud, a joint illegal act; - and before the Code, to have permitted such testimony would have been against fundamental principles, 19 Wendell, 293.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-8\">3. It being clear that the defendants were charged to have been united in a fraud; this is being united in interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-9\">See Webster. Definitions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-10\">To interest\u2014means, to concern, to affect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-11\">Interest (noun)\u2014concern.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-12\">Interested\u2014made a sharer; affected; concerned in a cause, or in consequences.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-13\">Third Point.\u2014The Legislature never could have intended to allow a defendant, to conspire with the plaintiffs to charge himself and selected co-defendants with frauds, and prevent such co-defendants from denying such a charge. If they did, there is no protection under the Code for life, liberty or property.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b616-14\">By the Court. Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atq\">Whenever one, of several defendants, \u201c who are joint contractors, or are united in interest, is examined by the adverse party,\u201d the other of such defendants may offer himself as a witness to the same cause of action or defence, and shall be so received. (Code, \u00a7 397, 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">Were the defendants, Morrell, O\u2019Hara, and Smith, \u201c united in interest,\u201d within the meaning of those words as used in \u00a7 397 of the Code, as they stood before the Court when O\u2019Hara and Smith were permitted to be sworn ?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">It is quite clear that those words do not denote and include those defendants only, against all of whom, a plaintiff, prior to the Code, must have recovered, or recover against none.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">Uor do they designate and include only such defendants as are jointly liable on contract. In actions of assault and battery, trespass, trover, and other actions of tort, which in their nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>may be joint or several, and which, before the Code, might have been brought against each wrong-doer separately, or against all jointly, and in which, if several were joined as defendants, the plaintiff might recover against some, although he failed to recover against others; one defendant cannot be a witness for his co-defendant, after evidence has been given by the plaintiff, which is sufficient to charge all as joint wrong-doers; to prove any fact, which, if true, and if proved by competent testimony, would exonerate all from liability, or which would mitigate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The reason is, that as to such matter he is jointly interested with his co-defendants, and all being joint wrong-doers when sufficient evidence has been given to establish a joint liability; whatever damages the plaintiff has sustained, he is entitled to recover against all. In such an action, after proof of such facts, there cannot be separate verdicts, in favor of the plaintiff, against the different defendants. <em>(Dean </em>v. <em>Thornton and </em>Dutton, 3 Kern. 266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">This case decides, that if the plaintiff had proved by witnesses, not parties to the record, that Morrell, O\u2019Hara, and Smith, had concocted and agreed between themselves upon a scheme by which the property of Morrell should be transferred to one of their number for the purpose of defrauding Morrell\u2019s creditors, and in pursuance and execution of such scheme, and with that intent it had been so disposed of by Morrell; neither of such defendants could have been a witness for the others to disprove such cause of action. Such evidence, if given by a third person, would,as effectually exonerate all, as either, and as to such matter, they would be jointly interested. <em>(Beal </em>v. Finch, 1 Kern. 135-6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">When a combination among several to commit, a wrong is established, each is responsible for the acts of the other, which are done in execution of, and pursuant to the agreement or scheme, in which they united to do the wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">It can make no difference, that the pecuniary interest of Morrell to prove the fraud, was greater than his interest to disprove the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">This proposition may be illustrate4 by a variety of cases. One will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>A plaintiff sues A. B. and C. D. on a note bearing the signature, \u201c A. B. &amp; Co.,\u201d and signed in the firm\u2019s name by A. B., alleging that the defendants were partners doing business under the name of A. B. &amp; Co., and that they made the note in their co-partnership name.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In such an action, before the Code, the plaintiff must have recovered against both defendants or neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On the trial, the plaintiff may now call A. B., and prove by him that C. <em>t). </em>was his partner when the note was given, and that it was given in the due course of the partnership business. In such a case, C. D. would be clearly admissible in his own behalf to disprove the cause of action, which A. B. had been examined to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">And yet in such a case, A. B.\u2019s pecuniary interest would be in favor of the plaintiff, because by establishing the fact that C. D. was his partner, he would be benefited by subjecting him to a liability to pay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">And yet, in such an action, if C. D. had put in an answer, under which the evidence was admissible, A. B. might be called by him to prove that C. D. was a minor, or a married woman, and therefore not liable at all, although an actual joint contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\"><em>Brumskill </em>v. <em>James &amp; </em>Eaglesum, 1 Kern. 294; <em>Marquat </em>v. Marquat, 2 Kern. 336: This shows, that whether the action be contract or tort, the pleadings alone, and the cause of action which they state, are not the exclusive tests by which to determine whether several defendants are united in interest, in respect to matters in relation to which the testimony of some oj;None of them has been given or may be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">This Court has decided, at General Term, that in an action against the members of a firm, upon a guaranty of the debt of a third person in the firm\u2019s name, where one defendant plead that it was signed by the other partner without his knowledge or consent, and in a matter not relating to the partnership business, he might call the partner who signed the firm\u2019s name, to prove the facts, and that, the proof being satisfactory, the defendant so pleading was entitled to a verdict, and the plaintiff could have a verdict and judgment against the other defendant. <em>(Claflin </em>v. Butterly, 5 Duer, 237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>But such an action as the pleadings state it, and the plaintiff seeks to enforce it, is one in which the defendants are joint contractors, or partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Hence it is obvious that it does not depend solely upon the nature of the action, nor upon the fact that several defendants are sued as joint contractors, or joint wrong-doers, whether one can be called as a witness for the other, or in other words, whether they are united ^in interest\u2014as to the matter, in respect to which, one may be called to testify for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In all actions, whether of contract or tort, one defendant may be a witness for his co-defendant, to prove that the latter was never hable, when that proof consists of facts which, though true, could be of no benefit to the testifying defendant, when proved by witnesses other than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">So in all actions, whether of contract or tort, there may be matters of defence which neither defendant is competent to prove on behalf of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">But in all actions, whether they be actions of contract or tort, whenever a plaintiff calls a defendant, and, by examining him, gives evidence tending to establish a cause of action against all jointly, and by establishing which all may be charged with the whole amount for which either would be liable on the same facts, if sued alone, the other defendants may be examined as witnesses to the same cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">That disproving that cause of action will wholly defeat the right of the plaintiff to recover against either defendant, is no answer to the right of such a co-defendant to offer himself, and to be received. Such a result will follow in all cases in which neither defendant was guilty of a fraud, unless all had conspired to commit one.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">We think the defendants Smith and O\u2019Hara were \u201cunited in interest\u201d with Morrell, within the meaning of those words, as\" used in \u00a7 397 of the Code, as to the cause of action, which Morrell had been examined to prove, and which the evidence given by him tended to establish, and that, in consequence of his having been so examined by the plaintiffs, they severally had the right to offer themselves as witness to the same cause of action, and to be examined accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
