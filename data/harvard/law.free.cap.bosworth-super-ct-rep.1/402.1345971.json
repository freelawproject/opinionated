The examination, by the plaintiff, of his assignor of the cause of action, does not, as the code read in October, 1855, authorize a defendant to be examined in his owp frehalij except as to the same matter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-12\">Meld, that as he offered himselfj as a witness, \u201c generally on his own behalf,\u201d and as . the offer was understood and treated by the Court and counsel as an offer to examine him on matters, as to which the assignor had not been examined, or not at all, the offer was properly excluded. On an appeal from a judgment in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>action tried before a jury, the action will not be examined, as to its general merits, upon the whole evidence; whether the verdict is against evidence can only be considered by the Court at General Term, upon an appeal from an order granting or refusing a new trial</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AuE\">(Before Bosworth &amp; Woodruff, J.J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b413-5\">Heard, June 9;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXl\">decided, June 27, 1857.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">This action was brought against Frederick Gr. Richardson and David Woods, as defendants, and comes before the Court, on an appeal, from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, taken by the defendant; Richardson only. It was tried before Mr. Justice Campbell and a jury in October, 1855. It is brought to recover the amount payable by eight several instruments, in writing, called in the complaint promissory notes, They are, all, of the same date, and in the same form, but are for different amounts, and payable on demand, after different periods, The one first payable reads thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">\u201c New York, April 22d, 1850. $258,75:100. \"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">For value received, we jointly and severally promise to pay O. L. Brown or order, in merchandise, on demand, after Nov. 1, 1850, two hundred and fifty-eight 75-100 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-9\">Endorsed F. G. Richardson</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-10\">C, L. Brown. David Woods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-11\">The complaint after averring that the defendants made each of said notes and describing them proceeds thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-12\">\u201cThis plaintiff further says, that said notes were duly endorsed by the said O. L. Brown to this plaintiff, and that he is the lawful owner and holder of said promissory notes; and although the said notes became due and payable, and the payment thereof was duly demanded of said defendants before the commencement of this suit, yet the said defendants have not paid the same or any part thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-13\">It then avers that the defendants \u201c are now justly indebted\u2019 to the plaintiff in the full amount of each of such notes, with interest from their dates, and prays judgment therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-14\">The answer of Richardson, <em>inter alia, </em>puts in issue the allegations, as to the endorsement of the notes to the plaintiff, and as to his being the lawful owner and holder of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-15\">On the trial, <em>C. L. Brown, </em>was admitted as a witness for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>plaintiff, against the objection and exception of the defendant, the objection being, \u201c that the complaint does not show any sufficient transfer of the notes, upon which this action was brought.\u201d When the plaintiff offered to read the notes in evidence, the defendant \u201cobjected on the same ground as raised to the witness,\u201d which was over-ruled, and he excepted; when the plaintiff rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">' \u201c.The defendants\u2019 counsel moved for a dismissal of the complaint, on the ground that the notes or contracts stated in the complaint were not negotiable or transferable as promissory notes, and that there was no transfer proven to entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action; which motion was denied, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">The .evidence of an actual sale and delivery of the notes, by C. L. Brown to the plaintiff, was explicit and uncontradicted, and was given by Brown, on his cross-examination, by the defendants\u2019 counsel.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">\u201c The defendants\u2019 counsel called <em>Frederick G. </em>Fichardson, one of the defendants in this action, generally on his own behalf, to whom the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, which objection the Court sustained, and the defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\">The plaintiff obtained a verdict, under a charge, from the Court, which is not set out in the case, and to which no exception appears to have been taken. Judgment having been entered on the verdict, the defendant, Richardson, appealed from it to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-9\"><em>John Cook, </em>for the appellant, contended that,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-10\">\u201c The Judge erred in allowing these alleged notes to be read in evidence under the defendant\u2019s exception, they not being either negotiable or promissory notes, but a mere memorandum to have an amount in merchandise, and this complaint is wholly defective in the necessary form and averments to recover on these memorandums, falsely called promissory notes, as for money, when they are a contract only to deliver goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-11\">\u201c Also, the Judge erred in not dismissing this complaint, as moved for by defendants, upon the plaintiff resting.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-12\"><em>John </em>Andrews, for plaintiff and respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>By the Court. Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arg\">The defendant, Richardson, offered himself, \u201cgenerally on his own behalf,\" as a witness, and was excluded. To the decision excluding him, his counsel excepted. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor, of the causes of action stated in the complaint, was examined as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff. But the examination of such assignor did not authorize the defendant to be a witness <em>generally </em>on his own behalf, but only \u201c to the same matter \u201d as to which the assignor had been examined (this action having been tried in October, 1855).\u2014Code, \u00a7 399; Laws of 1851, p. 903. It is apparent from the case, as we think, that this offer was made, and that the Court and counsel treated and understood it, as an offer to examine Richardson to matters as to which the plaintiff\u2019s assignor had not been examined, and that the defendant, Richardson, did not desire to be examined at all, if the examination was to be restricted to the same matters to which the assignor had been examined. The offer thus viewed was properly rejected. This exception is not noticed in the printed points of the appellant, submitted on this appeal; but, finding it upon the record, it seemed to us that it should not pass unnoticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">But the appellant\u2019s counsel contends that the complaint is fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">It is true that, the notes are not negotiable in such sense, that an assignee of them could maintain an action upon them at common law, in his own name. But they are vendible and assignable. They are correctly described in the complaint. The complaint states, that they were duly endorsed to the plaintiff, that he is the lawful owner and holder of them, and that payment of them, before the commencement of this suit, was duly demanded, and that no part of them has been paid. These allegations having been put at issue, are sufficient to admit proof of an absolute sale and delivery of the notes to the plaintiff, and of a demand of payment of them, and of a refusal by the defendants to pay<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We must presume that the cause was submitted to the jury under proper instructions, as the charge does not appear in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>We are not at liberty to review the evidence, as to the general merits of the action, as no appeal has been taken from any order of the special term, denying a motion for a new trial. We cannot ascertain from the case before us that the defendant applied to the special term for \u00e1 new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Hone of the exceptions, presented for our consideration, being well taken, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"> See <em>Prindle </em>v. <em>Caruthers, </em>15 N.
