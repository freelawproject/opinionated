Appellant raises <em>inter alia </em>claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecuto-rial misconduct, involuntariness of his plea, newly-discovered evidence, and the prosecution\u2019s breach of the plea agreement, as grounds for withdrawal. Because the trial court acted within the broad discretion conferred by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) in rejecting Acevedo\u2019s contentions, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-19\">On April 17, 1985, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Acevedo for aiding and abetting, and for conspiracy to affect interstate commerce by extortion, robbery, and kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1951 (\u201cGordon\u2019s Jewelry\u201d case, Criminal No. 85-108(GG)). Acevedo retained Julio E. Gil de Lamadrid and Julio Morales S\u00e1nchez to represent him in the Gordon\u2019s Jewelry trial. Acevedo had been on trial on similar charges involving the robbery of jewelry (\u201cTaillex\u201d case, Criminal No. 84-373(HL)). Attorneys William M. Kunstler, Ronald L. Kuby, both appearing <em>pro hac rice, </em>and Luis F. Abreu-Elias, local counsel, represented Acevedo in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-20\">On April 25, the jury in the Taillex ease returned a guilty verdict. Faced with the prospect of other trials, appellant \u2014 through his son \u2014 first contacted an Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) with the intention of reaching an agreement in the Gordon\u2019s Jewelry case. AUSA\u2019s office refused to negotiate except through an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>In a letter dated May 1, Acevedo unconditionally appointed Morales and Lamadrid as his exclusive representatives for any present or future indictment returned against him. On June 4, the parties reached a plea agreement. The government agreed to recommend a sentence of 20 years imprisonment in the Gordon\u2019s Jewelry case, to be served concurrently with a 28 year term in Taillex, and not to seek any fines or forfeiture of appellant\u2019s property in Puerto Rico. The agreement, however, did not bind civil or criminal law enforcement authorities of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In return, Acevedo promised to plead guilty in Gordon\u2019s, plead guilty to a future RICO indictment based on \u201cnumerous murders and robberies,\u201d and waive his right to appeal the Taillex conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On June 4, Acevedo filed in the district court a <em>pro forma </em>petition to enter a guilty plea to the Gordon\u2019s Jewelry indictment. Appellant stated in the form that he had a college degree, was not under the influence of narcotics, and had not been hospitalized for an emotional condition. He expressed satisfaction with counsel Lamadrid and Morales\u2019 performance. He further stated that he understood the charges against him, the maximum sentence which could be imposed, and the waiver of a panoply of federal constitutional rights which a guilty plea would entail. Appellant affirmed he pled guilty, uncoerced, and only because in fact he was guilty. Counsel certified having explained the charges, the consequences of a guilty plea, and that he pleaded understandingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On that day, the district court held a change of plea hearing, which corroborated in all respects appellant\u2019s assertions in the plea petition. The court below entered a finding of competence to plead. The court read the indictment, explained to appellant the elements of the offenses, and the maximum penalties provided by law, to which appellant responded he understood. The court introduced the plea agreement into the record. The trial judge clarified that a plea agreement under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B), as here, did not bind the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the judge could reject the government\u2019s recommendation and impose the maximum penalty authorized by law. The judge also explained that, if he rejected the recommendation, defendant had no right to withdraw the plea. Appellant stated he understood this.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Assistant United States Attorney H. Manuel Hern\u00e1ndez proceeded to summarize the evidence against Acevedo. According to the government, several individuals kidnapped a manager of a Gordon\u2019s jewelry store, coerced him to provide certain information and materials, and then robbed over $400,000 worth of jewelry from the store. A conspirator would testify as to Acevedo\u2019s involvement in the planning of the robbery. The government would present evidence that Acevedo, the president of a jewelry distribution business, had subsequently bought the stolen jewelry for $30,000. Even though Acevedo did not narrate his own version of events, he openly admitted in court to the acts charged in the indictment. Apparently recognizing the strength of the evidence, counsel Lamadrid conceded he lacked proof to rebut the government\u2019s case. Only then did the district court accept his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Sentencing in Taillex was held on June 5. The government recommended there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">The defendant, as part of [the plea] agreement has already pled guilty and has agreed to save the government the expense of going through several trials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and an appeal. We view that as something of value ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">We believe the defendant did give us some information of value and we believe [the recommended sentence] would be ... appropriate ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">Joint Appendix at 87.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">It is alleged that the government\u2019s recommendation was less than enthusiastic. Attorney Kunstler further claims error on the ground that, prosecutorial remarks linking appellant to organized crime, \u201cundercut\u201d the recommendation in Taillex. The remarks were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">AUSA (Hern\u00e1ndez): ... [W]e submit this court cannot sentence in a vacuum ... You heard the testimony of Chichi Der-ieux who is an admitted member of organized crime ... We believe that it\u2019s appropriate for this court to consider in its sentencing that [Acevedo is not] a one time offender here who got mixed up in something for the first time in his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">This is a man who has been involved in many, many crimes. [T]he court ... has had much evidence before it about Mr. Acevedo[\u2019s] ... involvements in organized crime here in Puerto Rico.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">Joint Appendix at 75-76.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The Taillex court sentenced Acevedo to consecutive terms of 15 and 20 years and imposed a $10,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"AWfT\">Against this background, on June 17 (12 days after the Taillex sentence), but prior to sentencing in this case, appellant through counsel Lamadrid and Morales filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In a sworn statement, Acevedo asserted his innocence, and claimed, without any details, to have exculpatory evidence to prove it. He further alleged lack of understanding as to the consequences of guilty pleas in the Gordon\u2019s Jewelry and RICO cases. With respect to the court\u2019s voluntariness finding, he allegedly became \u201cemotionally depressed\u201d after the Taillex conviction and remained as such throughout the change of plea hearing. Acevedo claims he pled guilty only to spare himself and his family the burdens of another trial. Concededly, he pled guilty against the advice of counsel Morales and Lamadrid.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">In support of the withdrawal motion, attorney Kunstler objected to the waiver of the Taillex appeal. In a sworn statement, he claimed lack of knowledge of the plea negotiations affecting the Taillex case in which he had represented Acevedo. Kun-stler stated that Morales and Lamadrid did not try the Taillex case. From that he inferred counsel were not competent to advise Acevedo about the likelihood of success on a Taillex appeal. Kunstler essentially claimed that counsel negligently waived the Taillex appeal without evaluating its merits. S\u00e1nchez and Lamadrid filed a motion rebutting the allegations of incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">On November 15, the district court in the Gordon\u2019s Jewelry case sentenced Acevedo to 35 years imprisonment,, to be served concurrently with the Taillex sentence. Acevedo again maintained his innocence, and claimed that counsel and others had erroneously advised and induced him to plead guilty. Without holding an evidentia-ry hearing, the district court denied the motion to withdraw. This appeal ensued. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">Defendant\u2019s right to withdraw a guilty plea is not absolute. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Burnett, </em>671 F.2d 709, 712 (2d Cir.1982). A court may grant a withdrawal application filed before sentencing upon a defendant\u2019s showing of a \u201cfair and just reason.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d), codifying <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927); <em>see </em>Annotation, <em>Withdrawal of Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere Before Sentence, Under Rule 32(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, </em>6 A.L.R.Fed. 665 (1971 &amp; Supp.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">Although the standard for a presentence withdrawal remains a liberal one, this court will not set aside the district court\u2019s findings unless a defendant unequivocally shows an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Keefe, </em>621 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1980); <em>N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cordero v. United States, </em>533 F.2d 723, 725 (1st Cir.1976). What <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>constitutes a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason in light of the abuse of discretion standard is best resolved by the courts on a case-by-case basis. <em>See </em>Rule 32(d) advisory committee note.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Several factors are relevant. One consideration, albeit insufficient <em>per se </em>for withdrawal, is defendant\u2019s assertion of legal innocence at the time of his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Barker, </em>514 F.2d 208, 221 (D.C.Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1013, 95 S.Ct. 2420, 44 L.Ed.2d 682 (1975) (citing <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970)). However, if defendant\u2019s factual contentions create no \u201clegally cognizable defense\u201d to the charges, \u201che has not effectively denied his culpability,\u201d and the motion can be denied. <em>Id. </em>at 220. The district court may also ascertain the reasons why the defenses raised in the withdrawal motion were not brought to the court\u2019s attention at the time of the original pleading. <em>United States v. Kobrosky, </em>711 F.2d 449, 455 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The amount of time between the guilty plea and the filing of the motion should also be considered. \u201cA swift change of heart\u201d reduces the likelihood of prejudice to the government from permitting withdrawal, and strongly indicates that the plea was entered in \u201chaste and confusion.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>514 F.2d at 222 (\u201c[e]ven where the plea was properly entered [under Fed.R. Crim.P. 11] ... the standard for judging the movant\u2019s reasons for delay remains low where the motion was filed only a day or so after the plea was entered\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. Crosby, </em>714 F.2d 185, 192 (1st Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1045, 104 S.Ct. 716, 79 L.Ed.2d 178 (1984) (eight week interval, not swift enough); <em>Keefe, </em>621 F.2d at 20 (twenty day delay, same result); <em>N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cordero, </em>533 F.2d at 726 (motion denied for two week delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Certain factors which suffice for a postconviction remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 satisfy as well the less stringent burden of Rule 32(d). <em>See </em>advisory committee\u2019s note, <em>ante. </em>Among those is the prosecution\u2019s breach of a plea bargaining recommendation which results in a miscarriage of justice or is fundamentally unfair. <em>See Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962); <em>cf. United States v. Benchimol, </em>471 U.S. 453, 456-57, 105 S.Ct. 2103, 2105, 85 L.Ed.2d 462 (1985) (per curiam) (whether prosecutor\u2019s breach of a promise to \u201centhusiastically\u201d recommend a sentence can be remedied under section 2255 or Rule 32(d), <em>quaere). See generally </em>Note, <em>Withdrawal of Guilty Pleas Under Rule 32(d), </em>64 Yale L. J. 590, (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">A consideration which is often dispositive is whether a defendant has voluntarily and intelligently entered into a guilty plea within the meaning of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. <em>See Mack v. United States, </em>635 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1980). \u201cSo important is strict compliance with Rule 11 procedures that pleas entered unconstitutionally or contrary to the rule should almost always be allowed to be withdrawn ...\u201d 8A R. Cipes, I. Hall &amp; M. Waxner, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 32-07[l] at 32-123 (2d ed. 1986); <em>but see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h) (variances from Rule 11 procedures that do <em>not </em>affect substantial rights shall be disregarded). Compliance with Rule 11 ensures that plea agreements become part of the record; that the court conducts an inquiry as to the voluntariness of the plea; that defendant is advised as to his rights and consequences of the plea; and finally, that the court determines that a factual basis exists for the plea and that a defendant understands these matters. <em>See </em>advisory committee\u2019s note, <em>ante; see generally </em>Project: <em>Criminal Procedure, </em>74 Geo. L.J. 696, 701-04 (1986). This court has repeatedly found no abuse of discretion in the denial of a Rule 32(d) motion when Rule 11 procedures have been assiduously observed. <em>Crosby, </em>714 F.2d at 190-92; <em>Keefe, </em>621 F.2d at 17; <em>N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cordero, </em>533 F.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">As one observer put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">The courts seem to indicate that since they are bending over backwards to make sure that a defendant is aware of what he is doing when he enters a guilty plea, they will not allow that defendant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>to make a mockery of the system by allowing him to withdraw his plea simply because he changes his mind and now wants a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Note, <em>Withdrawal of Guilty Pleas in the Federal Courts Prior to Sentencing, </em>27 Baylor L.Rev. 793, 799 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">A constitutional obstacle to the conviction warranting habeas corpus relief, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, is also a \u201cfair and just reason.\u201d <em>See </em>advisory committee\u2019s note, <em>ante. </em>Whether a defendant has pled intelligently and voluntarily, depends upon the competence of counsel\u2019s advice. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, -, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">As part of weighing the equities of a Rule 32(d) motion, a district court may account for any prejudice to the government from withdrawing the plea. <em>Kobrosky, </em>711 F.2d at 455. Only after a defendant has brought forward a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason, is the government <em>compelled </em>to demonstrate prejudice to its legitimate interests as part of its successful defense against a Rule 32(d) motion. <em>United States v. Soft, </em>558 F.2d 1073, 1083 (2d Cir.1977); <em>N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cordero, </em>533 F.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In the case before us, appellant has not adduced a \u201cfair and just reason.\u201d To begin with, appellant\u2019s purported claim of innocence lacks merit. Acevedo concedes that, unlike the defendant in <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), his assertion of innocence was not raised at the change of plea hearing. His asseveration came only at sentencing, after the Taillex conviction, and after the Rule 11 hearing in this case. Although appellant claims to possess exculpatory information to sustain his innocence, no insight has been provided into its substance. No defenses have been advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The fact that Acevedo denied his culpability when questioned by federal agents before changing his plea is immaterial. Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give weight to a self-serving, unsupported claim of innocence raised judicially for the first time after the Rule 11 hearing. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>325 F.2d 789, 791 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 178 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Appellant\u2019s next argument is that his guilty plea of June 4 was hastily entered. Acevedo, to demonstrate the alleged fragility of his plea, would have us focus on his abortive June 7 attempt to renegotiate the plea bargain. On that occasion, he had requested the Government to drop the murder-robbery RICO charges in return for honoring the plea agreement. This conduct is inconsistent with that of a defendant who is confused about his choice of pleading, particularly when Acevedo knew or should have known on June 4 that pleading guilty to the RICO charge was predicated on numerous murders and robberies. Moreover, the renegotiation efforts did not raise any doubts of his culpability to the offenses as to indicate a \u201cswift change of heart.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>514 F.2d at 222. Acevedo\u2019s \u201cchange of heart\u201d came on June 17 at the filing of the withdrawal motion\u2014 thirteen days after his guilty plea. As the two-week delay in <em>N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cordero, </em>533 F.2d at 726, failed to persuade us of a \u201cfair and just reason,\u201d we similarly conclude Acevedo does not persuade us, as it did not the district court, that his \u201cchange of heart\u201d was dictated by anything but to gain personal advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">We turn next to contentions of prosecutorial misconduct and plea agreement violations. In the May 1 letter, Acevedo divested Kunstler of any authority for negotiating a plea on his behalf. Thus, AUSA had no obligation to consult Kunstler, even when negotiating a waiver provision in the case in which Kunstler had been attorney of record. Accordingly, there was no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">Nor do we find that the prosecutor defaulted on the plea agreement. First, AUSA had no express obligation under the agreement to \u201centhusiastically\u201d recommend a particular sentence. <em>Benchimol, </em>471 U.S. at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. at 2104-05. Second, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>States v. Grandinetti, </em>564 F.2d 723 (5th Cir.1977) and <em>United States v. Brown, </em>500 F.2d 375 (4th Cir.1974), to demonstrate a tacit repudiation of the bargain, is misplaced. Those cases involved <em>negative </em>recommendations by the government, particularly in <em>Grandinetti </em>where the prosecutor questioned at sentencing the <em>legality </em>of the agreement. Nothing here approaches the want of consideration in plea bargaining present in those cases. The Assistant United States Attorney did comment on a negative presentence report which purportedly linked Acevedo to organized crime. However, AUSA favorably expressed at the Ta-illex sentencing that, Acevedo had \u201cgiven information of value,\u201d and had saved the government scarce resources in trying appellant. We conclude the government fulfilled its plea bargaining obligations. <em>See Keefe, </em>621 F.2d at 19 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">That the district court thoroughly complied with Rule 11 also weighs heavily against appellant. Acevedo\u2019s eleventh-hour claim is that, his emotionally-depressed state affected the voluntariness of his plea. The district court found Acevedo \u201cto be a well-oriented and intelligent individual.\u201d 619 F.Supp. at 578. At the hearing, Acevedo testified he felt well, was not taking medications, and had not been hospitalized for any emotional disorder. Acevedo's attorneys did not raise any concern as to his competence until the motion to withdraw was filed. The record presents no reason to doubt Acevedo\u2019s competence to plead. <em>Figueroa V\u00e1zquez v. United States, </em>718 F.2d 511, 512 (1st Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Press, </em>384 F.2d 955, 956 (2d Cir.1967) (per curiam) (motion denied where \u201cfit of depression\u201d was unconfirmed). Accordingly, the district court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue. <em>Figueroa V\u00e1zquez, </em>718 F.2d at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Appellant presses the attack on the voluntariness of his plea by reason of ineffective assistance of counsel. At the outset, we hold that, the <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) standard for evaluating such a claim applies to a Rule 32(d) presen-tence challenge to a guilty plea. <em>See Hill, </em>106 S.Ct. at 370. Appellant must demonstrate, first, \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65). Second, that he has been prejudiced, i.e., but for counsel\u2019s mistakes, \u201che would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Appellate counsel claim that Lamadrid and Morales were allegedly incompetent for 1) striking a \u201cdisastrous bargain\u201d where a guilty plea to a RICO charge meant a confession to local crimes, and 2) recommending a waiver of the Taillex appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The first ground is meritless. A guilty plea to the RICO charge would not constitute a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination in other crimes. <em>United States v. Albert, </em>773 F.2d 386, 389 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>488 F.2d 1206, 1209-10 (1st Cir.1973). Nor can Acevedo complain that counsel failed to explain the consequences of a RICO guilty plea. At the change of plea hearing, appellant knew of the consequences, <em>i.e., </em>the predicate acts of the RICO charge and that commonwealth authorities were not precluded from prosecuting him for local crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The waiver contention is similarly unpersuasive. In a sworn statement, attorney Kunstler makes a conclusory, factually unsupported assertion that counsel were negligent in their failure to study the merits of the Taillex case. <em>See Kobrosky, </em>711 F.2d at 457. This is insufficient for us to require an evidentiary hearing on the matter. <em>United States v. Fournier, </em>594 F.2d 276, 279 (1st Cir.1979) (hearings are unnecessary \u201cwhen the allegations attacking a guilty plea are vague and conclusory\u201d). In any event, the critical consideration is whether Acevedo waived the <em>right </em>to appeal voluntarily and understanding^. <em>See </em>J. Bond, <em>Plea Bargaining and Guilty Pleas </em>\u00a7 5.14 at 5-29 (2d ed. 1982). Acevedo waived such a right without coercion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In fact, he pleaded guilty against counsel\u2019s advice. There is no evidence to contradict that his voluntary waiver was an understanding one, or to support the allegation of ineffectiveness of counsel. Because Acevedo has advanced no \u201cfair and just reason\u201d to withdraw his plea, an analysis of prejudice is unnecessary.
