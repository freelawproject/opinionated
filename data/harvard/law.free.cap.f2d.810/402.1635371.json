The RCRA provision creating court of appeals jurisdiction authorizes review of permit decisions but is silent with respect to interim status terminations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(b) (Supp. II 1984). While we find that interim status is not a permit in RCRA\u2019s statutory scheme, we hold that \u00a7 6976(b), when read in conjunction with the statutory history and the case law favoring court of appeals jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tion over petitions for review of agency action, establishes the requisite statutory basis for this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">On the merits of the petition for review, we hold that the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute to require certification by November 8,1985 is reasonable and is compatible with both the statutory language and the intent of Congress, and therefore we defer to the EPA\u2019s construction. Given the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the factual determination that ViChem had failed to satisfy the certification requirements was supported by the record and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Vineland Chemical Company operates two surface impoundments which are classified as land disposal facilities for hazardous wastes. RCRA forbids operation of a hazardous waste disposal facility without a permit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(a) (Supp. II 1984). Prior to final administrative action on a permit application, however, qualified facilities are allowed to operate without a permit under a grandfather clause. Such permission to operate without a RCRA permit is termed \u201cinterim status.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(e) (Supp. II 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Since 1980, ViChem has operated its surface impoundments under interim status, having satisfied the statutory requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(e)(1). Interim status facilities must comply with operating requirements established by regulation. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 265 (1985). Among the interim status operating requirements are the financial responsibility requirements at issue in this case. These regulations require operators to acquire liability insurance and provide financial assurances that there will be sufficient resources available for closure and post-closure costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In 1984, Congress amended RCRA to provide for termination of interim status for land disposal facilities, a classification which includes surface impoundments such as ViChem\u2019s, 50 Fed.Reg. 38,946, 38,947 (Sept. 25, 1985), if certain conditions were not satisfied. The 1984 amendment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au3\">In the case of each land disposal facility which has been granted interim status under this subsection before November 8, 1984, interim status shall terminate on the date twelve months after November 8, 1984, unless the owner or operator of such facility\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">(A) applies for a determination regarding the issuance of a permit under subsection (c) of this section for such facility before the date twelve months after November 8, 1984; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">(B) certifies that such facility is in compliance with all applicable groundwater monitoring and financial responsibility requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">Pub.L. No. 98-616, \u00a7 213(a)(3), 98 Stat. 3221, 3241 (1984) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(e)(2) (Supp. II 1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">In accordance with \u00a7 6925(e)(2)(A), Vi-Chem has submitted a Part B permit application to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The EPA has delegated responsibility for administering the RCRA permit program to the DEP as authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6926. No final action has yet been taken on the ViChem permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">On November 8, 1985, ViChem submitted to the EPA a document certifying compliance with groundwater monitoring and liability insurance requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>cation did not make any reference to financial assurances to cover closure and post-closure costs. On December 2nd, the EPA notified ViChem by letter that its interim status was terminated as of November 8, 1985 for failure to comply with the certification requirement of \u00a7 6925(e)(2)(B). The letter notified ViChem that it could not continue to operate, that it was required to submit a closure plan, and that continued operation could subject ViChem to both civil and criminal penalties. In a letter to the EPA dated December 27, 1985, ViChem attempted to correct the omission by certifying that it had been in compliance with all of the financial responsibility requirements as of November 8. The EPA\u2019s reply, dated January 30, 1986, reaffirmed its position that interim status had terminated as of November 8, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On February 28, 1986, ViChem filed the instant petition in this court, seeking review of the EPA\u2019s decision that ViChem\u2019s interim status had terminated. Subsequently, the EPA brought an enforcement action in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The threshold question is whether this court has jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeal is limited to that conferred by statute. <em>Modine Manufacturing Corp. v. Kay, </em>791 F.2d 267, 270 (3d Cir.1986); <em>Hempstead County and Nevada County Project v. EPA, </em>700 F.2d 459, 461 (8th Cir.1983); <em>City of Baton Rouge v. EPA, </em>620 F.2d 478, 480 (5th Cir.1980); 15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3901 (1976). While a statutory basis for jurisdiction is required, the cases of <em>Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, </em>445 U.S. 193, 100 S.Ct. 1093, 63 L.Ed.2d 312 (1980) (per curiam), and <em>Modine Manufacturing Corp. v. Kay, </em>791 F.2d 267 (3d Cir.1986), caution this court not to construe appellate review provisions too narrowly. To avoid unintended and anomalous results, statutes authorizing review of specified agency actions should be construed to allow review of agency actions which are \u201cfunctionally similar\u201d or \u201ctantamount to\u201d those specified actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">In <em>Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, </em>445 U.S. 193,100 S.Ct. 1093, 63 L.Ed.2d 312 (1980) (per curiam), the Supreme Court interpreted a jurisdictional provision in the Clean Water Act which authorized the courts of appeals to review EPA actions \u201cin issuing or denying any permit\u201d under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water pollution permit program. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1)(F) (1982). In some states, the EPA had delegated the primary responsibility for implementation of this permit program to the state governments, and the EPA retained only the power to veto permits proposed by the states. In the remaining states, the EPA issued NPDES permits directly. The question faced by the Court was whether the Clean Water Act established court of appeals jurisdiction to review an EPA veto of an NPDES permit proposed by California. The court held that EPA denial of an NPDES permit and EPA veto of a state-proposed permit were \u201cfunctionally similar,\u201d and thus court of appeals jurisdiction was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 196. The Court reasoned that finding no appeals court jurisdiction would result in an illogically bifurcated system in which review of a veto of a state-proposed permit would take place in district court while review of an EPA permit denial would occur in a court of appeals. Moreover, the additional level of judicial review for state-issued permits would result in delay. The Court was unwilling to adopt a statutory interpretation with such counterintuitive results absent a clear expression of Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">In the case of <em>Modine Manufacturing Corp. v. Kay, </em>791 F.2d 267 (3d Cir.1986), this court held that a statutory provision providing court of appeals jurisdiction for review of the EPA\u2019s promulgation of effluent standards under the Clean Water Act also provided jurisdiction to review rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ings concerning the applicability of those standards to a particular discharger. This court reasoned that such rulings concerning applicability of standards were \u201ctantamount to\u201d the promulgation of the standards themselves. <em>Id. </em>at 269. \u201c[W]here, as here, a statute allows for some appellate review of agency action, the Supreme Court has applied a corollary of the <em>Abbott [Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)] rule, deciding that such jurisdictional provisions should be construed generously absent clear and convincing evidence of a contrary congressional intent.\u201d <em>Modine, </em>791 F.2d at 270. <em>See Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion, </em>470 U.S. 729, 745, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 1607, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985) (\u201cAbsent a firm indication that Congress intended to locate initial [Administrative Procedure Act] review of agency action in the district courts, we will not presume that Congress intended to depart from the sound policy of placing initial APA review in the courts of appeals.\u201d); <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 796-99, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 1636-38, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">ViChem relies on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(b) as the statutory basis for appellate court jurisdiction. Section 6976(b) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEK\">Review of the Administrator\u2019s action (1) in issuing, denying, modifying, or revoking any permit under section 6925 of this title (or in modifying or revoking any permit which is deemed to have been issued under section 6935(d)(1) of this title), or (2) in granting, denying, or withdrawing authorization or interim authorization under section 6926 of this title, may be had by any interested person in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States for the Federal judicial district in which such person resides or transacts such business upon application by such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(b) (Supp. II 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">ViChem first argues that interim status is itself a permit, and thus termination of interim status is a revocation of a \u201cpermit under section 6925\u201d reviewable by this court under \u00a7 6976(b). We reject this reading. The structure of \u00a7 6925 indicates that Congress was quite careful in distinguishing between permits and interim status. For example, the requirements for issuance of RCRA permits are prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 6925(a), (b), (c) and 6974(b), while the less stringent qualifications for interim status are contained in \u00a7 6925(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">ViChem relies on language in \u00a7 6925(e)(1) providing that any person who qualifies for interim status \u201cshall be treated as having been issued [a RCRA] permit until such time as final administrative disposition of such application is made.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(e)(1) (Supp. II 1984). However, there would be no need for Congress to state that an interim status holder should be treated as <em>if </em>it were permitted if indeed it <em>was </em>permitted. Thus, we conclude that the statute does not reflect any Congressional intent to include interim status within the meaning of \u201cpermit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">In <em>Hempstead County and Nevada County v. EPA, </em>700 F.2d 459 (8th Cir. 1983), involving review of an EPA determination that a hazardous waste disposal facility did not qualify for interim status, the Eighth Circuit held that interim status was not a permit within the meaning of \u00a7 6925 and thus that there was no appellate jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7 6976(b). The Seventh Circuit recently relied on <em>Hempstead </em>in reaching the same conclusion. <em>North-side Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Thomas, </em>804 F.2d 371, 384 (7th Cir.1986). We are in agreement with the Seventh and Eighth Circuits to the extent that we find interim status termination is not a permit revocation and thus does not fall within the literal language of \u00a7 6976(b). However, as instructed by <em>Crown Simpson </em>and <em>Modine, </em>we shall not limit our jurisdictional analysis to a literal reading of the \u00a7 6976(b) language. Instead, we pursue a common sense analysis of the intent of Congress with respect to judicial review of interim status terminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The first step is to determine what intent Congress had with respect to interim status terminations when it enacted \u00a7 6976(b) in 1980. At that time, \u00a7 6925(e) provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">(e) Interim status</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Any person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">(1) owns or operates a facility required to have a permit under this section which facility is in existence on November 19, 1980,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">(2) has complied with the requirements of section 6930(a) of this title, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">(3) has made an application for a permit under this section</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">shall be treated as having been issued such permit until such time as final administrative disposition of such application is made, unless the Administrator or other plaintiff proves that final administrative disposition of such application has not been made because of the failure of the applicant to furnish information reasonably required or requested in order to process the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(e) (1982) (subsequently amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">The purpose of this section is, of course, to authorize continued operation of facilities existing on November 19, 1980 until permit proceedings were completed. Prior to final administrative disposition, the authority conferred by \u00a7 6925(e) was \u201cfunctionally similar\u201d to the authority provided by a permit as indicated by the mandate that one having interim status must \u201cbe treated as having been issued such permit\u201d during that period. When proceedings on a permit application terminate, so does interim status and operating authority. Such a termination can occur in three ways: (1) by the issuance of a permit, (2) by the denial of a permit, or (3) by a determination that the applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to allow either issuance or denial of a permit. Each of these three decisions is made by the EPA by applying the statutory and regulatory criteria for a permit to a record compiled in a permit application proceeding. Under the regulations, proceedings to terminate interim status for failure to provide sufficient information involves a hearing directed specifically to the issue of the sufficiency of the available information and thus the record is as well developed on the relevant issue as in the other two situations. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 270.10(e)(5), 124.71-124.91 (1986). Finally, termination of interim status for failure to provide sufficient information is the functional equivalent of a denial of a permit application on the merits. Both result in the termination of the Agency\u2019s proceedings and require the facility to cease operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">It is clear that a termination of interim status by the denial of a permit was intended to be reviewable in the Court of Appeals under \u00a7 6976(b) since the denial of a permit is expressly made reviewable under that section. The same can be said for the termination of interim status by the issuance of a permit. While we agree with the EPA that \u00a7 6976(b) contains no express authorization for appellate court review of the third category of interim status terminations under \u00a7 6925(e) as it stood in 1980, we can think of no reason why Congress might have wished to relegate that category to the district court while providing appellate review for the other two categories. In each of these categories, the record is fully developed before the Agency and there is no need for a district court\u2019s fact-finding capabilities. The legislative history suggests no reason for distinguishing between these three forms of interim status termination and the EPA has suggested none. In this situation, we, like the Supreme Court in <em>Crown Simpson, </em>are reluctant to create an illogically bifurcated system of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">Because there is no indication of a Congressional intent to require district court review of terminations of interim status for failure to provide information, and because such terminations involve the same kind of judicial review as and are the functional equivalent of an interim status termination by the denial of a permit, we give effect to the <em>Modine </em>presumption and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>elude that all interim status terminations under the original \u00a7 6925(e) were rendered reviewable in the Courts of Appeal by the enactment of \u00a7 6976(b) in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The second question is whether Congress intended to distinguish, for purposes of appellate review, between the original forms of interim status termination discussed above, now codified as \u00a7 6925(e)(1), and the new form of interim status termination inserted in 1984 as subsection (e)(2). The RCRA amendments of 1984 added \u00a7 6925(e)(2), which, as we have earlier indicated, terminates interim status for land disposal facilities on November 8, 1985 unless those facilities submit Part B permit applications and certify compliance with the applicable groundwater monitoring and financial responsibility requirements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Admittedly, an Agency decision on the adequacy of a facility\u2019s certification under subsection (e)(2) involves considerably less agency discretion and requires much less record development than the decision under subsection (e)(1). Nevertheless, despite the procedural differences, we perceive no necessity for district court record making or fact-finding and we regard agency decisions on interim status termination under subsection (e)(2) to be functionally equivalent to termination for failure to provide information under subsection (e)(1). Since our search of the legislative history of the 1984 amendments has revealed no indicia of Congressional intent to distinguish between different kinds of interim status terminations, we again apply the <em>Modine </em>presumption and hold that agency decisions under \u00a7 6925(e)(2) are reviewable in the Courts of Appeal under \u00a7 6976(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">EPA argues that a finding of jurisdiction to hear this petition for review is inappropriate because \u00a7 6925(e)(2) is a \u201cself-implementing\u201d statutory provision and there may be cases of interim status termination in which there is no agency decision to be reviewed. As we have noted, Congress narrowed the EPA\u2019s discretion in making interim status termination decisions when it enacted the 1984 RCRA amendments. <em>See </em>Florio, <em>Congress as Reluctant Regulator: Hazardous Waste Policy in the 1980\u2019s, </em>3 Yale J. on Reg. 351, 367-68 (1986). Nonetheless, the Agency retains discretion to clarify any ambiguity in the statute and to make narrow factual determinations concerning the adequacy of certification submissions. When it exercises that discretion and takes a position on the adequacy of a certification, as it did here in its December 2, 1985 letter to Vi-Chem, we believe there is an agency decision reviewable under \u00a7 6976(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">EPA\u2019s contention that \u00a7 6925(e)(2) requires no agency decision may be convincing when applied to situations in which a facility made no submissions prior to November 8th. However, in situations such as ViChem\u2019s where the operator has attempted to comply but has, in the Agency\u2019s eyes, failed, we are not prepared to say the EPA has no obligation to take a position given the substantial criminal or civil penalties which would accumulate in the period preceding an enforcement action. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6928(d), (g) (1982 and Supp. II 1984). Nevertheless, we need not resolve that issue. We limit our holding that interim status terminations constitute agency actions reviewable in this court to situations in which an attempt at compliance has been made and the Agency has taken a definitive position that interim status has terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">ViChem asks this court to invalidate the EPA\u2019s termination of interim status for its two surface impoundments on the grounds that: 1) the EPA adopted an impermissible interpretation of \u00a7 6925(e)(2), and 2) the Agency\u2019s refusal to consider ViChem\u2019s sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>missions made after November 8 was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">ViChem argues that the EPA erred in interpreting \u00a7 6925(e)(2) to require <em>submission </em>of certification of compliance with the financial responsibility requirements by November 8, 1985. ViChem contends that the law should be construed to require facility operators to certify that they were in <em>compliance </em>by November 8, 1985, with no submission deadline specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The statute itself is most reasonably read to require that certification must be submitted by November 8. The statutory provision at issue states that \u201cinterim status shall terminate on the date twelve months after November 8, 1984, unless the owner or operator of such facility \u2014 (A) applies for ... a permit ... before the date twelve months after November 8, 1984; and (B) certifies that such facility is in compliance with all applicable groundwater monitoring and financial responsibility requirements.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6925(e)(2) (Supp. II 1984). Interim status thus terminates on November 8 unless the certification is made, strongly suggesting that Congress intended that certification be due by that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In addition to requiring a strained reading of the provision\u2019s language, ViChem\u2019s construction would leave the EPA in the woeful position of being unable to distinguish those facilities that no longer qualified for interim status from those which simply had not yet certified that they were in compliance as of November 8. Such a construction runs contrary to the clear Congressional intent to accelerate the EPA\u2019s enforcement activities. <em>See </em>H.R. Rep. No. 198, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess., Pt. I, at 44, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5576, 5603 (one purpose of 1984 amendments was \u201cto expedite the final permit review of major land disposal ... facilities and close those facilities that cannot or will not meet the final standards at the earliest possible date\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Admitting some ambiguity in the statute itself, marked by the inclusion of a submission deadline in subsection (e)(2)(A) and the absence of such a date in subsection (e)(2)(B), we must consider the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the statute. \u201cIt is by now commonplace that \u2018when faced with a problem of statutory construction, this Court shows great deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u2019 \u201d <em>EPA v.

The statute has consistently been interpreted by the Agency to require certification prior to November 8.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 50 Fed.Reg. 38,946 (Sept. 25, 1985); 50 Fed.Reg. 28,702, 28,723-24 (July 15, 1985). As we find this interpretation to be both reasonable and consonant with the intent of Congress, we are obliged to defer to the EPA\u2019s interpretation. Thus, we hold that the EPA did not err in requiring \u00a7 6925(e)(2)(B) certifications to be submitted by November 8, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Section 6976(b) states that judicial review under that provision \u201cshall be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>accordance with sections 701 through 706 of Title 5,\u201d the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6976(b) (Supp. II 1984). Section 706 provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful agency actions which are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982). ViChem argues that the EPA acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and abused its discretion by ignoring ViChem\u2019s attempts to amend its certification <em>nunc pro tunc </em>after the November 8 deadline. Given the EPA\u2019s valid interpretation of the statute to require submission of certification by November 8, 1985, ViChem\u2019s post-deadline submissions were irrelevant to the Agency\u2019s determination of whether a proper certification had been tendered. The EPA\u2019s refusal to consider these materials did not constitute an error of law. Thus, we find no error in the EPA\u2019s decision to terminate interim status in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We hold that this court has jurisdiction to entertain ViChem\u2019s petition for review. However, in accordance with the concept of judicial deference to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute it administers, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. The purpose of the financial responsibility regulations is to ensure that hazardous waste facility operators (1) are adequately indemnified against both sudden (e.g., an explosion) and non-sudden (e.g., leakage into a ground water aquifer) accidents that may occur during the period of operation, and (2) have sufficient resources to properly close the facility and to provide post-closure care, monitoring and security as required. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 265.140-265.-150 (interim status standards concerning financial responsibility) (1985). The regulations allow operators to establish financial assurance of closure and post-closure care by establishing a dedicated trust fund, obtaining a surety bond or a letter of credit, procuring insurance, self-insuring, or combining these measures. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 265.143, 265.145 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-17\">. The EPA suggests in its brief that the certification with respect to liability insurance may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>been inadequate. EPA Brief at 30. We need not, however, reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. Amendments were also made to the jurisdictional provision \u00a7 6976(b) in 1984, but these did not clarify the intent of Congress with respect to where the review of interim status terminations should take place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\">. ViChem suggests that the September 25th Federal Register supports its claim that the law required compliance, not actual certification, by November 8. ViChem is correct in asserting that the notice states actual compliance by November 8 is a condition of maintaining interim status. This is not inconsistent with the requirement that certification is due by November 8, because the notice explains that an operator cannot certify compliance if the facility is not actually in compliance. There is no ambiguity in the EPA's statutory construction. <em>See </em>50 Fed. Reg. 38,946-49 (Sept. 25, 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">. ViChem warns that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection might rely on the termination of ViChem\u2019s interim status as a reason for denying a RCRA permit. Such reliance may be unjustified. Neither the EPA nor this court has made any substantive evaluation of the adequacy of ViChem\u2019s financial responsibility measures in reaching our respective decisions. Our decision to uphold the termination of interim status is based solely on a failure to <em>certify </em>compliance with the financial responsibility requirements prior to the statutorily prescribed deadline. Any review of the DEP\u2019s permit decision must, of course, await final action by that agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
