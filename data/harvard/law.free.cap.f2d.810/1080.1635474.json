We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-22\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-23\">Zartic, a Georgia corporation, employs approximately 425 persons including a number of Mexican-Americans. In 1981, employees at Zartic began complaining to management about their work conditions, specifically citing the plant\u2019s wet floors, cold temperatures, falling boxes, safety switch problems on machines, and leaks of carbon dioxide and ammonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-24\">On Friday, July 17, 1981, two third-shift maintenance employees were severely burned while changing an electric fuse using metal pliers. The first-shift employees discussed this accident, work conditions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>and Zartic\u2019s failure to correct matters about which they complained. Employees discussed the possibility of striking, and rumors began to circulate that the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) would picket the plant on Monday, July 20, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">On July 18 and 19, James Wells, a Zartic employee and also an officer in the KKK, who was on leave of absence, solicited Zartic employees to sign a leaflet supporting the authorization of the American Workers Union (AWU) as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. The leaflet listed six changes in working conditions that the AWU would try to obtain: (1) dismissal of all illegal and green card aliens; (2) a wage increase of $2.50 per hour with guaranteed future increases; (3) improved insurance and retirement benefits; (4) new work rules and a review system to prevent unjustified firings; (5) increased vacation and sick leave; and (6) reasonable overtime and regular work hours with full pay for time on breaks. The first of these six changes, the dismissal of all illegal and green card aliens, is relevant in resolving the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">On Monday, July 20, Wells and approximately twenty-five men, dressed in KKK attire began to picket Zartic\u2019s plant carrying signs including some making reference to the dismissal of Mexican-Americans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A substantial number of employees refused to report to work, and copies of the AWU membership leaflet were distributed among the striking employees. Immediately, Zartic began to hire replacements for the strikers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">On the afternoon of July 20, Zartic applied to the district court for a temporary restraining order prohibiting the picketing. The district court issued an order prohibiting any picketing \u201cwhere the purpose was to force the company to terminate or otherwise refuse employment of persons on the basis of their Mexican origin or race.\u201d The district court order also stated that it was not prohibiting \u201cany legitimate labor dispute, picketing or any other labor activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">By Tuesday, July 21, the AWU leaflets and picket signs were altered to remove any statements referring to the discharge of illegal and green card aliens. Later that evening, three Zartic officials met with the company\u2019s attorneys about the strikers\u2019 employment status and decided not to apply a company rule which required discharge for three consecutive unreported absences. The officials decided to inform strikers that they had been permanently replaced, but listed on a preferential recall list.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">By Wednesday morning, July 22, the employees had abandoned the strike and unsuccessfully offered to return to work. When Zartic refused the employees\u2019 offers to return to work, picketing resumed. That afternoon, Zartic filed a contempt petition in the district court contending that the picketing and the presence of individuals wearing KKK attire constituted a violation of the temporary restraining order. The court denied Zartic\u2019s motion, but amended its temporary restraining order to \u201cenjoin any picketing by individuals who were attired in the traditional KKK robes and hoods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">The employees\u2019 picketing of Zartic ended on August 9. On behalf of all striking employees, the union mailed a letter to Zartic making an unconditional offer to return to work. Zartic refused to recognize the union. Zartic hired 102 new employees from the time the striking employees made their offer to return to work on July 22 until the end of December. During this period, Zartic did not recall any of the strikers who had unconditionally applied for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">On September 29,1983, an administrative law judge (AU) issued a recommended de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>cisi\u00f3n and order finding Zartic in violation of section 8(a)(1) of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The AU found that Zartic had unlawfully threatened its employees for engaging in union activities and had maintained and enforced a rule requiring the termination of employees who entered into Workers\u2019 Compensation settlements. The AU also found Zartic in violation of section 8(a)(1) and (3) because it discharged and subsequently refused to reinstate Lucy A. Maestas and the other striking employees upon their unconditional offer to return to work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">On January 10, 1986, the NLRB, in adopting the AU\u2019s recommendation with one exception, ruled that Zartic violated section 8(a)(1) by issuing threats towards \u2022its employees\u2019 union activities, and section 8(a)(1) and (3) by firing and refusing to reinstate employee Lucy A. Maestas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The NLRB\u2019s order required Zartic to cease and desist from all unfair labor practices and to offer reinstatement and backpay to the former striking employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">Under section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, a lawful striker retains the status of an employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even participation in an unlawful strike does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>automatically terminate the striker\u2019s employment relationship, although it does furnish the employer with grounds for termination. <em>Mackay Radio and Telegraph Co., </em>96 N.L.R.B. 740 (1951); <em>NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., </em>306 U.S. 240, 59 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed. 627 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">Zartic accurately states that the strike at its inception was illegal; however, the company chose not to exercise its option to terminate the strikers, but instead elected to place the strikers on a preferential recall list. Persons whose names appeared on the list were entitled to preference in receiving employment at a position for which they were qualified upon the occurrence of a vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The NLRB concluded that after July 20, 1981, \u201cthe unlawful objective [of the strike] was discontinued ... with the issuance of the TRO.\u201d In opposition, Zartic contends that the illegal objective of the strike was never terminated; the original and illegal objective was kept alive. In taking this position, Zartic argued that the NLRB was powerless to award reinstatement or back-pay to the strikers due to their continuous illegal conduct. Zartic cites <em>Fansteel, </em>306 U.S. 240, 59 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed. 627; <em>MacK-ay, </em>96 N.L.R.B. 740; <em>Southern Steamship Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>316 U.S. 31, 62 S.Ct. 886, 86 L.Ed. 1246 (1942); and <em>N.L.R.B. v. Marshall Car Wheel and Foundry Co., </em>218 F.2d 409 (5th Cir.1955), as possible supportive authority for the position that the Board was without power to order reinstatement or backpay. Unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>in all of the cases cited by Zartic, the striking employees never abandoned their unlawful objectives prior to termination by their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">The NLRB properly determined that after July 20 the unlawful objective of the strike had been abandoned. The strikers eliminated all materials referring to the dismissal of Mexican-Americans, illegal, and green card aliens. After abandoning the unlawful objective, the strikers were afforded full protection under the Act as economic strikers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">Specifically, the striking employees, upon application for reinstatement, were entitled to their former jobs or a substantially equivalent job if they had not been permanently replaced. <em>NLRB v. Fleet-wood Trailer Co., Inc., </em>389 U.S. 375, 88 S.Ct. 543, 19 L.Ed.2d 614 (1967). Zartic\u2019s failure to reinstate these unreplaced economic strikers constituted unfair labor practices. <em>Fleetwood. </em>The burden of proof that the strikers had been replaced was upon Zartic. <em>Fleetwood. </em>Zartic, however, failed to successfully carry that burden. Sufficient evidence established that numerous job openings were available when the strikers made their unconditional offer to return to work. Additionally, Zartic hired a number of non-strikers to fill the job openings, without reference to the preferential recall list.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-9\">Zartic has not appealed the NLRB\u2019s finding that it violated section 8(a)(1) and (3) by threatening its employees for unionization activity and by discharging and refusing to reinstate Lucy A. Maestas. Zartic\u2019s challenge to the NLRB\u2019s finding that it violated section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act by failing and refusing to reinstate the strikers is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">Accordingly, the NLRB\u2019s order awarding reinstatement with backpay to the former striking employees and requiring Zartic to cease and desist from unfair labor practices is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">.

The NLRB reversed the ALJ's finding that Zartic violated section 8(a)(1) by maintaining and enforcing a policy of terminating employees who enter into Workers\u2019 Compensation settlements. In <em>Central Georgia Electric Corp., 269 </em>N.L.R.B. 635 (1984), the NLRB held that an employee\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation does not constitute concerted activity within the meaning of section 7 of the Act. The NLRB, in dismissing the allegation, deleted the names of Lewis C. McClarity, Tretha Piccione, Susan C. and Thomas J. Ridgeway, and James W. Wells from the list of former striking employees entitled to reinstatement since no exceptions were filed to the ALJ\u2019s finding that they were terminated pursuant to this policy and were all on leave of absence at the time of the strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1171-16\">.
