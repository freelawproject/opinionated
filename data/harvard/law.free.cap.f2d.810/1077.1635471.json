The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal and denied his request for oral argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">Subsequent to the immigration judge\u2019s decision, Bonne-Annee\u2019s counsel withdrew from the case. On March 15, 1985, Bonne-Annee, proceeding pro se, filed a notice of appeal to the BIA using Form I-290A. The notice of appeal directed petitioner to \u201c[bjriefly, state reasons for this appeal,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and he stated that the judge \u201cwas incorrect in finding me deportable,\u201d \u201cwas incorrect in denying my political asylum application,\u201d and \u201cwas wrong in denying my motion for a continuance and my motion for Interrogatory [sic].\u201d Bonne-Annee requested oral argument and indicated that he would file a separate written brief or statement. However, Bonne-Annee never submitted additional documentation, and the only information before the BIA concerning the grounds for appeal was the general statement in the notice of appeal. On April 16, 1986, the BIA summarily dismissed Bonne-Annee\u2019s appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(l-a)(i) because he had failed to identify adequately the basis of his challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">The regulations permit the BIA to summarily dismiss appeals in four circumstances, including any case where \u201cthe party concerned fails to specify the reasons for his appeal on Form I-290A (Notice of Appeal).\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(l-a)(i). When a petitioner, proceeding through a representative or pro se, fails to apprise the Board of the specific grounds for his appeal, whether by specifying the reasons in the notice of appeal <em>or </em>by submitting an additional statement or brief, summary dismissal is appropriate. <em>See Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Reyes-Mendoza v. INS, </em>774 F.2d 1364 (9th Cir.1985); <em>In re Valencia, </em>Interim Dec. No. 3006 (B.I.A. 1986). Otherwise the BIA is left to speculate whether petitioner challenges erroneous findings of fact or law, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">Bonne-Annee failed to provide the BIA with sufficient information regarding the specific grounds of his appeal. Although Bonne-Anne had more than one year in which to submit additional documentation to supplement the extremely brief statement contained in his notice of appeal, he \u2022 failed to do so. Accordingly, summary dismissal is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1166-11\">. Instructions on the reverse side of Form I-290A state that the BIA \"may deny oral argument or summarily dismiss any appeal in any deportation proceeding in which (i) the party concerned fails to specify the reason for his appeal on the reverse side of this form____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
