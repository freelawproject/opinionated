ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Section 514 of the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940, Chapter 888, 54 Stat. 1178 (as amended), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 574 (1981) (\u201cSSCRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) prohibits a state from taxing the military pay of nonresident servicemen and women located in that state pursuant to orders. The sole issue in this case is whether certain Kansas income tax statutes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violate the SSCRA by taking the military pay of such nonresidents into account in determining the rate of income tax to be levied on their nonmilitary income earned in Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">Kansas has a graduated state income tax (2% to 9%). Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 79-32,110(a) (1984). It is undisputed, therefore, that higher tax rates and, consequently, higher taxes on nonmilitary Kansas source income can result from including military pay in the state\u2019s rate-setting formula.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is also undisputed that no direct tax is levied by Kansas on the military income of nonresident military personnel. The United States contends that taxing nonmilitary income at rates which are higher due to the inclusion of military income in the rate-setting calculation constitutes a \u201csophisticated scheme of indirect taxation,\u201d Brief for Appellant at 8, prohibited under the SSCRA. It filed a declaratory judgment action in the district court seeking to bar enforcement of the applicable Kansas income tax statutes on the ground that they are in conflict with the SSCRA and, therefore, invalid pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Subsequently it filed a motion for summary judgment which, in a reasoned opinion by the district court, was denied, and judgment entered for the State of Kansas. <em>United States v. Kansas, </em>580 F.Supp. 512 (D.Kan.1984). We are in general agreement with the opinion of the district court, and affirm its judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">A state law violates the Supremacy Clause and therefore must fall if it conflicts with a federal law or federal constitutional right. <em>Louisiana Pub.

Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 211, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824). Such a conflict exists if the state law \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 526, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1310, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977) (quoting <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)). Determining whether such a conflict exists \u201c \u2018is essentially a two-step process of first ascertaining the construction of the two statutes and then determining the constitutional question whether they are in conflict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Trans.

Both parties agree that the principal motive behind the provisions of the SSCRA granting a tax exemption to nonresident service personnel was to prevent the possibility of multiple state taxation of the income and property of such service personnel. <em>See California v. Buzar\u00e1, </em>382 U.S. at 393, 86 S.Ct. at 483; <em>Dameron v. Brodhead, </em>345 U.S. 322, 326, 73 S.Ct. 721, 723, 97 L.Ed. 1041 (1953); H.R.Rep. No. 2198, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. (1942); S.Rep. No. 1558, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Neither the legislative history nor the plain language of the SSCRA prohibits the use of the described military income in formulas which set rates of taxation on other income. The United States steadfastly maintains that the potentially higher rates on Kansas source income constitute \u201can indirect tax on the military compensation of nonresident military personnel.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 8, 13 <em>&amp; </em>14 n. 6. It cites no authority in direct support of that conclusion and we disagree with it. There is here a potentially higher tax on Kansas source income, nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The obvious further inquiry is whether that potentially higher tax on Kansas taxable income constitutes a denial of due process or equal protection. The United States did not pursue any equal protection argument and it concedes the due process question, stating in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-5\">We fully recognize that the Supreme Court long ago made clear that the inclusion in a state taxing scheme of property not subject to direct taxation by the state, for the purpose of determining the rate of taxation to be applied to property that is subject to the state\u2019s taxing powers, does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Maxwell v. Bugbee, </em>250 U.S. 525 [40 S.Ct. 2, 63 L.Ed. 1124] (1919); <em>Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosje-an, </em>301 U.S. 412 [57 S.Ct. 772, 81 L.Ed. 1193] (1937).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">Brief for Appellant at 14-15. <em>See also Wheeler v. State, </em>127 Yt. 361, 249 A.2d 887 (1969), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>396 U.S. 4, 90 S.Ct. 24, 24 L.Ed.2d 4 (1969). The reasoning of these cases is that property not itself taxable can be used as a measure of the tax imposed on property within the state and that to do so is \u201cin no just sense a tax on the foreign property.\u201d <em>Maxwell v. Bug-bee, </em>250 U.S. at 539, 40 S.Ct. at 6. The income in the taxing state is merely being taxed at an increased rate pursuant to a progressive system of taxation premised on the individual\u2019s ability to pay. <em>See Wheeler, </em>249 A.2d at 890. On this same reasoning, the mere inclusion of military compensation in a formula determining the rate of tax on income from Kansas sources does not constitute a tax on the military income of a nonresident individual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">The United States further contends, however, that the required liberal construction of the SSCRA transcends the reasoning of these authorities and must be broad enough to prohibit inclusion of military pay in calculating rates of tax on other income. Not only is there no direct support for that position, the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sullivan v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 169, 89 S.Ct. 1648, 23 L.Ed.2d 182 (1969), even though referring to sales and use taxes, makes clear that the Act cannot be interpreted beyond its plain language and express purpose. The Court stated: \u201cSection 514 does not relieve servicemen stationed away from home from all taxes of the host State. It was enacted with the much narrower design \u2018to prevent multiple State taxation of the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 89 S.Ct. at 1654. In terms of actual statutory language, <em>Sullivan </em>presented a much closer question than that presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">We should not seek out conflicts between state and federal regulations where none clearly exist. <em>Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, </em>437 U.S. 117, 130, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 2216, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978); <em>Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, </em>384 U.S. 35, 45, 86 S.Ct. 1254, 1260, 16 L.Ed.2d 336 (1966); <em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit, </em>362 U.S. 440, 446, 80 S.Ct. 813, 817, 4 L.Ed.2d 852 (1960). We will not read into the SSCRA the attenuated meanings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>urged by the United States. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">. Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 79-32,109(h), 79-32,110(a) and (b), 79-32,116, 79-32,117 (1984). For a discussion of precisely how the income of nonresident military personnel is taxed under these Kansas statutes, see the district court opinion, <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of Kansas, </em>580 F.Supp. 512 at 514 (D.Kan.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">. Not every nonresident military person who is stationed in Kansas is subject to the higher tax rate. The situation typically occurs because the spouse of a nonresident military person earns Kansas source income and the couple files a joint Kansas tax return. Although the United States admits that the higher tax rate on a spouse\u2019s Kansas source income could be avoided by filing separate tax returns, such separate returns may not be filed if the couple has filed a joint federal tax return. Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 79-32,115(d), (e) (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">. There is no question that Kansas has endeavored to explicitly comply with the SSCRA\u2019s mandate concerning tax residency of military personnel stationed in Kansas. Kan.Admin.Regs. \u00a7 92-12-6 provides that \"[f]or purposes of [the Kansas income tax act] a person will not be deemed to be a resident of Kansas, nor will he lose his status as a resident of the state in which he formerly resided solely because of a transfer into this state under military orders.\u201d Administrative regulations in Kansas have the same force as statutes.
