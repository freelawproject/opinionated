United States, </em>9 Cl.Ct. 546 (1986). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-26\">As the Claims Court determined\u2014and the parties do not controvert\u2014the material facts are not disputed. Appellants are electrolytic platemakers and engravers of the BEP \u201cwhose duties are to perform or to direct manual or machine operations requiring special skill or experience, or to perform or direct the counting, examining, sorting, or other verification of the product of manual or machine operations.\u201d 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 5102(c)(7). They are paid a wage \u201cfixed and adjusted from time to time as nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with prevailing rates and in accordance with such provisions of this subchapter, [\u201cPrevailing Rate Systems\u201d] ... as the pay-fixing authority of each such agency [specified in the section, including the Bureau of Engraving and Printing by name] may determine.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5349(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">After using for some time the pay scale of the Government Printing Office to set wages for comparable positions at BEP, Treasury (in 1982) established a new tandem relationship with the wages paid by the American Bank Note Company for comparable positions at BEP. Where responsibilities of comparable BEP positions were greater than those at the Company, a premium was paid to the BEP employees. Where there were no comparable Company positions, Treasury made independent wage calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">In 1982, the Continuing Appropriations Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 97-276, \u00a7 109, 96 Stat. 1186, 1191, became law. That legislation limited wage increases of federal \u201cwhite collar\u201d and certain prevailing rate employees to 4% (as a means for controlling inflation). Appellants were not covered by this statutory provision. However, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memorandum stating that it would be in the public interest to extend the 4% limitation of Pub.L. 97-276 \u201cto cover the greatest number of Federal employees\u201d where department and agency heads had discretion to set wage increases. Thereupon the relevant Treasury assistant secretary ordered the director of BEP to follow the OPM guideline for BEP employees in fiscal year 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Some of the appellants then brought this suit in the Claims Court. Others sued in a District Court which transferred their case to the Claims Court. Both actions were decided by the Claims Court in the same opinion and judgment\u2014now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">Though Judge Mayer rejected the Government\u2019s point that the Claims Court had no jurisdiction over this suit, the United States still presses it. We reach the same conclusion as did the Claims Court. The core of the Government\u2019s position is that the general legislation dealing with the pay of these BEP employees is so broad and endows Treasury with so much discretion that there is no specific wage or pay provision mandated by statute other than the rate and pay actually set by Treasury for these employees for 1983. The conclusive answer for this case is that a Supreme Court ruling and Court of Claims decisions (which are binding on us) mandate that the Claims Court has jurisdiction. <em>Amell v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 158, 86 S.Ct. 1384, 16 L.Ed.2d 445 (1966), expressly held that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over wage claims by prevailing-wage employees quite comparable to those now suing. The Government notes that <em>Amell </em>pre-dated <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976)\u2014on which the Government relies heavily\u2014but <em>Amell </em>remains a Supreme Court decision, which has not been modified, questioned by the Court, or overruled, and we are not at liberty to hold that it is no longer good law. <em>Cf. United States v. Mason, </em>412 U.S. 391, 93 S.Ct. 2202, 37 L.Ed.2d 22 (1973). Moreover, the Court of Claims, after <em>Testan, </em>specifically held (invoking <em>Amell) </em>that it possessed jurisdiction over wage claims by \u201cprevailing wage\u201d employees of BEP itself. <em>Baratt v. United States, </em>585 F.2d 1041, 1044-45 (Ct.Cl.1978). <em>See also National Maritime Union v. United States, </em>218 Ct.Cl. 242, 682 F.2d 944 (1982) and <em>Daigle v. United States, </em>217 Ct.Cl. 376 (1978), both involving \u201cprevailing wage\u201d federal employees. This course of decision calls upqn us to sustain the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">On the merits, we also agree with the Claims Court. \u201cPrevailing rates\u201d wage legislation like \u00a7 5349, <em>supra </em>\u2014with its express reference to adjustment \u201cfrom time to time as nearly as is consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>public interest\u201d\u2014bestows \u201ca broad congressional grant of administrative discretion.\u201d <em>Benevento v. United States, </em>198 Ct.Cl. 772, 461 F.2d 1316, 1320 (1972). The administrative determination can only be set aside for abuse of discretion, <em>(National Maritime Union v. United States, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 955) or because it is \u201cso arbitrary as to be clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Baratt v. United States, supra, </em>585 F.2d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">Here, Treasury and BEP did not abuse their discretion when they imposed on appellants the 4% \u201ccap\u201d that Congress had imposed on other federal employees, including some \u201cprevailing wage\u201d federal workers. In the parallel decision in <em>National Maritime Union, </em>the court first held that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d clause in the statute prescribes countervailing considerations to the \u201cprevailing rates\u201d clause, and then ruled precisely that it was not an abuse of discretion for an agency whose employees were not directly covered by the then statutory pay \u201ccap\u201d to utilize the same \u201ccap,\u201d which had generally been determined (as here) to be executive policy, for its own \u201cprevailing wage\u201d employees. 682 F.2d at 949, 954-55. The same is true in the current instance unless there are good reasons to hold <em>National Maritime Union </em>inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Appellants proffer, as a reason for reaching a different result than in <em>National Maritime Union, </em>that BEP did not actually weigh the needs of the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d as against the \u201cprevailing rates.\u201d But Treasury had the decisive role in determining wages,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the undisputed fact is that Treasury deliberately decided to apply the overall 4% limit to BEP. The assistant secretary\u2019s memorandum of January 25, 1983 makes it absolutely clear that she weighed the pros and cons, and expressly elected in \u201cdifficult economic times\u201d to follow the President\u2019s general policy, to ensure Departmental consistency, and to \u201cshare an equal burden\u201d with other federal employees as well as the country. This was a sufficient balancing of the two statutory elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">In the same connection, the BEP employees assert that the four paragraphs of \u00a7 5341 (establishing general policy for setting wages of \u201cprevailing rate\u201d employees) apply to the setting of their wages\u2014 but were not weighed by their employer. However, the Claims Court correctly determined that \u00a7 5341 does not apply to the wages of BEP employees. <em>See Adams v. United States, supra, </em>9 Cl.Ct. at 549-50. Section 5342(b)(2)(A) of Title 5 specifically excludes \u201cemployees and positions of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing\u201d from coverage by \u00a7 5341.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whatever may be true of the different employees and agency involved in <em>National Maritime Union, supra, </em>the employees here cannot avail themselves of the statutory policy embodied in \u00a7 5341. Treasury committed no error, therefore, when it failed to spell out its consideration of the four separate factors of \u00a7 5341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">Appellants then invoke a Treasury Personnel Management Manual, which incorporates the four factors of \u00a7 5341, as applying to them even though the statutory provision may not itself apply. The answer is twofold. First, the Manual itself (following the statute) excludes BEP employees from application of the four Manual factors taken from \u00a7 5341, as well as from the other provisions governing the setting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>wage schedules. Second, this particular contention was not raised below and need not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">There being no abuse of discretion by Treasury, the judgment of the Claims Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AsO\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">. In fact, the Director of BEP wished to eliminate the 4% \"cap,\u201d but was overruled by Treasury. This was appropriate because Treasury was the employing agency under \u00a7 5349. Even if BEP were the formal employer, Treasury could intervene as it did:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-7\">[W]hen purely executive functions of a discretionary nature are imposed on a subordinate official of the Government it is an implied condition that his actions (before they have become final) are subject to the review and supervision of his superiors\u2014if the superior is authorized to intervene in that particular field and does so in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\"><em>Congress Construction Corp. v. United States, </em>314 F.2d 527, 530 (Ct.Cl.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 817, 84 S.Ct. 53, 11 L.Ed.2d 52 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">. Moreover, \u00a7 5342(a)(l)(I) excludes the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from the whole sub-chapter [\"Prevailing Rate Systems\u201d] except for \u00a7 5349, <em>supra, </em>which expressly includes the Bureau.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
