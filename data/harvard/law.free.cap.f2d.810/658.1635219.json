In 1979 Shrock filed charges with the EEOC, followed later by a suit under Title VII, alleging that Altru was refusing to refer male nurses to female patients. The suit was dismissed on August 26, 1983, pursuant to a settlement between Shrock and Altru. Two and a half weeks later Shrock filed new charges with the EEOC, again followed by a suit, charging that beginning the day after the settlement of the previous suit Altru had again discriminated against him. How he knew this is unclear. The result of the settlement had been to put him back on the registry, but at the bottom, so unless Altru in two and a half weeks had a lot of inquiries from female patients, it might have made no referrals to him even with the best will in the world. In any event the new suit was dismissed on Altru\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Judge McMillen stating, \u201cThis is a <em>pro se </em>complaint which should never have been filed, and defendant is probably entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.\u201d Altru moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, but by then Judge McMillen had resigned from the bench, and the case was assigned to Judge Plunkett, who denied the motion without any statement of reasons. Shrock appeals from the dismissal of his suit and Altru cross-appeals from the denial of its motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Unless Altru in 1983 was an employer, an employment agency, or a labor union, it cannot be liable to Shrock under Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2, e-3. Of course it was not a labor union. And it was neither Shrock\u2019s employer \u2014 he, clearly, was an independent contractor \u2014 nor the employer of the other nurses registered with it, and with all these excluded Altru did not have enough employees to be an employer in the special sense in which Title VII uses this word. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). We therefore need not decide when, if ever, an employer covered by the statute can be held liable for conduct toward someone who is not its employee; but we note in passing that <em>Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir. 1973), and <em>Doe v. St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>788 F.2d 411, 421-25 (7th Cir.1986), cases which support liability for interference by hospitals on grounds of sex (or other grounds deemed discriminatory by Title VII) with their patients\u2019 retaining a nurse or doctor, are distinguishable. They involve an indirect employer-employee relationship between the hospital and the nurse (or doctor); there is no such relationship between a referral agency and the workers it refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">That leaves the question whether Altru was an employment agency. It was if it \u201cregularly [undertook] ... to procure employees <em>for an employer </em>or to procure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>for employees opportunities to work <em>for an employer.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(c) (emphasis added). The reference is to the statutory definition of employer. Since \u2014 according to affidavits that Shrock failed to rebut in the manner prescribed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 \u2014 Altru refers nurses only to individual patients and to persons (mainly doctors) acting on behalf of individual patients, and since neither patient nor doctor is a Title VII employer, the district court was unquestionably correct in granting Altru\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We turn to the cross-appeal. In light of Judge McMillen\u2019s statement that Altru was probably entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees (not under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, though, for that statute does not apply to Title VII, but under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k), a materially identical provision), Judge Plunkett\u2019s action in denying, without any statement of reasons, the modest award requested ($2,524.50) puzzles us. The fact that Shrock was a Title VII plaintiff would not automatically disentitle Altru to an award of attorney\u2019s fees; a defendant in a Title VII suit is entitled to such an award if the plaintiff\u2019s suit is \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Christians-burg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978); see <em>Bacon v. American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees Council, #13, </em>795 F.2d 33 (7th Cir.1986). Nor would the fact that Shrock was not represented by counsel disentitle Altru to an award of attorney\u2019s fees (see id.)\u2014 though as a matter of fact he was represented by counsel throughout most of the district court proceeding, and his reply to the request for attorney\u2019s fees was prepared by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">What is true, however, is that this suit is not frivolous in the traditional sense of making an utterly groundless claim. Maybe Altru did discriminate against Shrock; and <em>Sibley </em>and <em>Doe </em>gave him a shot at bringing Altru within the jurisdiction of the statute as an employer if Altru turned out to have enough employees, while if Altru referred nurses to hospitals or doctors seeking to hire them it would be within the statute as an employment agency. But there is another ground besides section 2000e-5(k) for awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Altru: Shrock\u2019s failure, before bringing suit, to make any effort to find out whether he had a factual basis for a suit. This failure of inquiry or investigation brings Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure into play. Shrock filed charges less than three weeks after he settled his previous suit against Altru and was put back on Altru\u2019s registry. Without inquiry \u2014 and he made none \u2014 Shrock could have no basis for believing that Altru had had enough inquiries from female patients since Shrock was put back on the registry to make any referrals of such patients to him. Nor did Shrock make any effort before bringing suit to find out how many employees Altru had and whether Altru referred nurses to hospitals and doctors as well as to patients. It is true that Shrock tried to submit to this court evidence that Altru did refer nurses to hospitals, but this evidence was not presented in the district court, and thus comes too late. It is late in another sense; it pertains to 1975 \u2014 eight years before this suit was filed. Shrock\u2019s reply to Altru\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 a reply prepared, as we have said, by Shrock\u2019s lawyer \u2014 did not claim that Shrock had made any investigation before filing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Rule 11, as recently amended, by its terms requires \u2014 it does not merely permit \u2014 the district court to impose sanctions on a plaintiff who files a complaint without some minimum of previous investigation, here missing. See <em>Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>802 F.2d 1080, 1089-91 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Westmoreland v. CBS, Inc., </em>770 F.2d 1168, 1173-75 (D.C.Cir.1985). The amended rule is applicable to this case; and by its express terms it is applicable to parties who are unrepresented, such as Shrock. The fact that Shrock filed the complaint without the assistance of counsel thus did not excuse him from having to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>invest\u00edgate the factual basis of his suit. He could not rely entirely on his personal knowledge, for all he knew was that in two and a half weeks he hadn\u2019t received a referral. (This is the period between the settlement of the first suit and the filing of his charge with the EEOC, not the filing of the second suit, but there is no indication that he did any investigating after filing the charge.) Anyway his personal knowledge did not embrace the matter of referrals by Altru to hospitals. Or if his personal knowledge did somehow embrace these things he was obliged to point that out (through counsel) when he filed his reply to the motion for attorney\u2019s fees, and he failed to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We are given pause, however, by the fact that Altru\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees did not mention Rule 11; it relied solely on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (that was wrong too, as we said). This would not matter if section 1988 (and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k)) incorporated the standard of Rule 11, but Altru doesn\u2019t argue that. Now it is true that a request for sanctions under Rule 11 is not a prerequisite to their imposition; the rule is explicit that the judge may act on his own initiative. Therefore we do not treat Altru\u2019s failure to mention Rule 11 in the district court (it mentioned it for the first time in its brief in this court) as a waiver of Rule 11 sanctions. But in failing to mention the rule Altru may have lulled Shrock into thinking that he could meet the motion simply by making clear that the complaint was not utterly groundless, rather than by showing in addition that he had made an adequate investigation of the facts before filing the complaint. We think Shrock should have a chance to persuade the district judge that the standard of Rule 11 has not been met. Therefore, while affirming the dismissal of the complaint, we vacate the order denying attorney\u2019s fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Affirmed in Part, Vacated in Part, and Remanded With Directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
