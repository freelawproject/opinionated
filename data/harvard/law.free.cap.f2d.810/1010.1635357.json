Among other things, we must determine whether Madruga is correct in maintaining that his pretrial detention hearing, which was held four days after he first appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>before a federal magistrate, was untimely under 18 U.S.C.A. sec. 3142(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that the continuance in question did not violate section 3142(f). Madruga\u2019s other arguments also are meritless; we therefore deny his motion for bail and affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of unconditional pretrial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Madruga, who was arrested on November 19, 1986, initially appeared before a federal magistrate on November 20, 1986, a Thursday. At that appearance, when asked what it proposed regarding pretrial detention, the government requested a three-day continuance. Although Madru-ga\u2019s counsel announced he was ready to go forward at once, the magistrate nevertheless set the hearing for the next Monday, November 24 \u2014 four days later. The magistrate held the hearing on November 24 and eventually allowed Madruga to remain free on bond, a decision the government appealed to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">On appeal to the district court, Madruga contended that court did not have jurisdiction over the question of pretrial detention because the pretrial detention hearing before the magistrate had been held four, not three, days after Madruga\u2019s initial appearance and thus was untimely. The district court, however, rejected Madruga\u2019s argument, stating that: (1) \u201cdefense counsel objected to the Government\u2019s request for a three-day extension and asked that the hearing be held immediately or the next day\u201d; (2) the objection nevertheless was of \u201cno moment\u201d because the government was \u201centitled to a three-day extension pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. sec. 3142(f)\u201d; (3) the objection \u201ccontested] any continuance whatsoever\u201d, not the Monday date rather than the correct hearing date of Sunday; (4) Madru-ga had therefore failed to enter a proper objection and thus his argument was precluded by <em>United States v. Malekzadeh, </em>789 F.2d 850 (11th Cir.1986); and (5) moreover, \u201cthe one day violation of sec. 3142 in order to avoid holding court on Sunday is not a material deviation. Only material violations of sec. 3142 require denial of pre-trial detention.\u201d Having asserted jurisdiction, the court then declared the magistrate\u2019s conclusions regarding the propriety of bond clearly erroneous and ordered Ma-druga held unconditionally pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">A. <em>Objection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">The linchpin of Madruga\u2019s argument to us is his claim that defense counsel objected to the postponement of the detention hearing. As a threshold matter, Madruga characterizes the district court\u2019s conclusion that Madruga objected to the idea of \u201cany continuance whatsoever\u201d as a finding of fact that is subject to reversal only for clear error. <em>See Duncan v. Poythress, </em>657 F.2d 691, 708 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B), <em>cert. granted, </em>455 U.S. 937, 102 S.Ct. 1426, 71 L.Ed.2d 647, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>459 U.S. 1012, 103 S.Ct. 368, 74 L.Ed.2d 504 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although we note that a district court\u2019s conclusion regarding whether a party\u2019s actions before a federal magistrate were sufficient to preserve the party\u2019s legal rights on appeal to the district court is probably a question of law \u2014 or at least a mixed question of fact and law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 we need not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>that issue. Even if we assume that the district court\u2019s determination was a finding of fact, we nevertheless reject that determination as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">The statements that Madruga asserts as objections occurred in the preliminary portion of the initial appearances of several defendants. The magistrate was attempting to determine what type of pretrial detention the government sought for each defendant and whether each defendant was prepared to proceed regarding each requested detention. The following statements represent all communications between Madruga\u2019s counsel and the magistrate that can possibly be cited as \u201cobjections.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-5\">THE COURT: All right. Let me take \u2014 Let me ask some questions. Mr. Tabares \u2014 there you are. On Madruga and \u2014 What is the government\u2019s recommendation on Madruga?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-6\">MS. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, the government is asking for a three day waiting period to request pretrial detention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-7\">MR. TABARES: I\u2019m ready to go now, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-8\">THE COURT: OK. You\u2019re requesting the three days until Monday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-9\">MS. WILLIAMS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">Transcript of Initial Appearance, November 20, 1986, at 2. After pursuing a similar line of questioning with all defendants, the magistrate returned to Madruga\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-11\">THE COURT: OK. Let me take Mr. Madruga for the moment. Mr. Madruga. All right, again, what is the government\u2019s request as to Mr. Madruga and the basis for its request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-12\">MS. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, at this time the government is requesting a three day extension to consider pre-trial detention of Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-14\">THE COURT: Do we need the interpreter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-15\">THE DEFENDANT: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-16\">THE COURT: OK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-17\">MS. WILLIAMS: \u2014 of Mr. Madru-ga____ Therefore, we request the three days for a hearing to be held Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-19\">MR. TABARES: Your Honor, first of all I\u2019m ready to go on a bond hearing today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-20\">Your Honor, Mr. Madruga has been married for twelve years. His wife is here in the court today. He has two children. All of his personal documents the government already seized this morning at 2:30 in the morning. There\u2019s no way that he can fly and there\u2019s no way that he can travel without those documents. He doesn\u2019t even have his driver\u2019s license with him. So, I see no danger in fleeing the jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-21\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m going to give the government their opportunity to present it at a full hearing. I\u2019m going to set pre-trial detention hearing for Monday, November\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-22\">MR. TABARES: Could it be Friday, your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-23\">THE COURT: No, we\u2019re going to set it for Monday, November 24. The government\u2019s requested three days. They\u2019re entitled to it under the statute. November 24th with a preliminary hearing for December 1st____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-24\"><em>Id. </em>at 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-25\">Viewed separately or in their entirety, these comments are not objections. The first statement by defense counsel (Mr. Ta-bares) is a mere acknowledgment of readiness to proceed should the court so choose. The second statement, while marginally more argumentative, at best indicates a preference of convenience; i.e., to proceed on Friday rather than Monday. It cannot be correctly read as an objection to proceeding on a date that exceeds the statutory limits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>We ought not, and do not, expect some sort of ritualistic incantation from trial lawyers to make an effective objection; but we can and do expect plain talk sufficient to direct the presiding officer\u2019s attention to the existence of an objection and to the specific ground that underlies the objection. <em>See Wilson v. Attaway, </em>757 F.2d 1227, 1242 (11th Cir.1985) (to preserve objections to admissibility of evidence, objection must state specific grounds; otherwise, review is only for plain error); <em>Trustees of Sabine Area Carpenters\u2019 Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Don Lightfoot Home, </em>704 F.2d 822, 828 (5th Cir.1983) (failure to object waives right to raise issue on appeal); <em>Rab\u00f3n v. Automatic Fasteners, Inc., </em>672 F.2d 1231, 1238 n. 15 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B); <em>United States v. Chaney, </em>662 F.2d 1148, 1151 n. 4 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B) (failure to object waives issue on appeal but for plain error; purpose of rule is to allow trial court opportunity to avoid or correct any error); <em>United States v. Adamson, </em>665 F.2d 649, 660 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B) (\u201cObjections and the grounds therefor should be made with particularity.\u201d), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>700 F.2d 953 (5th Cir.) (Unit B) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 833,104 5. Ct. 116, 78 L.Ed.2d 116 (1983); <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>524 F.2d 1001, 1004 (5th Cir.1975) (specific objection necessary to preserve issue on appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 953, 96 S.Ct. 1729, 48 L.Ed.2d 197, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Barnett v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 946, 96 S.Ct. 1417, 47 L.Ed.2d 353 (1986).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">We decline to add the duty to interpret imaginatively what lawyers say to the long list of responsibilities of magistrates and other trial judges. In this case, what was actually said to the magistrate was too vague. In light of what was presented to him, it would have been extraordinary had the magistrate realized that there was a serious <em>legal </em>problem facing him concerning the timing of the rescheduled detention hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that, whether viewed de novo or under the clearly erroneous standard, no effective objection was made dealing with the timing of the detention hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">In <em>United States v. Malekzadeh, </em>789 F.2d 850, 851 (11th Cir.1986), we held that the defendant\u2019s failure to object \u201cis deemed to be a request that the hearing be continued ... \u201d; and, since the defendant may obtain up to a five-day extension under section 3142(f), the hearing was timely. <em>Id. </em>The facts in this case require the same analysis, and the same result, as in <em>Ma-lekzadeh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">Unless a defendant objects to the proposed hearing date on the stated ground that the assigned date exceeds the three-day maximum, he is deemed to acquiesce in up to a five-day continuance. Put differently, if no specific objection is entered and if the hearing date is within five days from the initial appearance, the hearing is timely. <em>Malekzadeh, </em>789 F.2d at 851. Madruga made no effective objection; consequently, he implicitly requested that the hearing be continued until Monday in order to avoid a Sunday hearing. The hearing was held within five days of the initial appearance and therefore was timely. <em>Cf United States v. Hurtado, </em>779 F.2d 1467 (11th Cir.1985) (eight day delay violated 3142(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">B. <em>Materiality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">Because Judges Fay and Anderson believe part A of this opinion is adequate to support affirmance, they do not join me in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>part B; but I think that an alternative holding is permissible and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The district court\u2019s order also specifically raised the issue whether certain extensions that exceed section 3142(f)\u2019s time limits may be excused as immaterial variances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court concluded that \u201conly material violations of section 1342 require denial of pre-trial detention.\u201d Therefore, as an alternative basis for denying Madruga\u2019s motion, the district court specifically decided that the 24-hour delay was an immaterial variance and thus insufficient to divest the court of its power to order pretrial detention. I think this is right. <em>Cf United States v. Heilig, </em>633 F.Supp. 329, 332 (M.D.Pa.1986) (one day delay was de minimus); <em>United States v. Wimberly, </em>648 F.Supp. 1572, 1574-75 (D.Nev.1986) (one day delay was immaterial).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Whether some minimal extension beyond the statute\u2019s three-day and five-day parameters may be excused as immaterial is a question of first impression in this circuit. I would leave open most materiality questions; but when the three-day or five-day extension for the detention hearing falls on a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday and the judicial officer sets the hearing for the first day immediately thereafter which is not one of those days, I would hold that the delay is immaterial for the purposes of determining compliance with section 3142(f). I base my conclusion in large part on Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">Rule 45(a), which concerns computation of time periods in criminal procedures generally, has two distinct substantive parts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first portion specifies that in computing \u201cany period of time,\u201d the last day of the period being computed \u201cshall be included,\u201d unless it falls on a \u201cSaturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday ..., in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days.\u201d The issue addressed, obviously, is whether the final day of a period includes weekends and holidays; the effect is to lengthen the period only if the last day falls on one of the specified types of days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>The second part of Rule 45(a) concerns a different question. It states that when the period being computed is less than 11 days, \u201cintermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation.\u201d In effect, this provision lengthens the time period by the number of intervening weekend days and holidays that occur while the period is running.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">What I submit as an alternative holding in this case is not in conflict with <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>779 F.2d 1467 (11th Cir.1985). In <em>Hurtado, </em>defendant made his initial appearance on August 28, 1985 \u2014 a Wednesday. The pretrial detention hearing was held on the following Thursday, September 5, 1985.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a footnote, the <em>Hurtado </em>court indicated its view that Rule 45(a) was inapposite: the intervening weekend and holiday should be included in determining whether section 3142(f)\u2019s time requirements were met. <em>Id. </em>at 1474 n. 8. <em>But see United States v. Melendez-Carrion, </em>790 F.2d 984, 991 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Wim-berly, supra, </em>at 1573-74. Thus, <em>Hurtado </em>only addresses the applicability of the <em>second </em>part of Rule 45(a) that concerns intervening weekends and holidays. It does not answer whether the <em>first </em>part of Rule 45(a) \u2014the \u201clast day\u201d formula of the rule\u2014 should apply to section 3142(f) computations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">The Bail Reform Act recognizes that pretrial detention is a serious matter. Holding a person in jail before that person has been determined to be guilty raises obvious and significant concerns. By the same token, however, a common sense application and interpretation of the Bail Reform Act is necessary to ensure that its goals \u2014 especially its aim to protect society from accused parties who might flee the jurisdiction or commit additional serious wrongs\u2014 are met. The district court had jurisdiction to consider, in all respects, the pretrial detention of Madruga. Its imposition of unconditional pretrial detention is AFFIRMED, and Madruga\u2019s motion for bail is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-22\">. We construe appellant\u2019s request for review as a motion for bail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">. Section 3142(f) provides that \"the judicial officer\u201d shall hold a hearing regarding the appropriateness of pretrial detention in certain cases. It also stipulates that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-7\">The hearing shall be held immediately upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer unless that person, or the attorney for the Government, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the person may not exceed five days, and a continuance on motion for the attorney for the Government may not exceed three days.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">. In <em>Stein v.

The traditional reasons that form the basis for the restricted review we give district court factual findings are not presented here. Both we and the district court sit in this case as courts of appeal, seeking to determine the sufficiency of words that appear only on a cold transcript. Thus, neither we nor the district court are able to discern the nuances of language, tone, inflection and demeanor that warrant according <em>in-person </em>findings of fact limited review. <em>See generally Martin v.

In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Al-Azzaway, </em>768 F.2d 1141 (9th Cir.1985), an accused was held for almost one month before he was granted a pretrial detention hearing. The Ninth Circuit stated that \u201cif the time constraints [of section 3142(f) ] are violated <em>in any material way, </em>the district court should not order unconditional pretrial detention of the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1145 (emphasis added). The <em>Al-Azzaway </em>court did not explain the reach of its statement regarding materiality, although the implication is that immaterial variances would not be sufficient to preclude unconditional pretrial detention of an accused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-9\">(a) <em>Computation. </em>In computing any period of time the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.

When a period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. As used in these rules, \"legal holiday\" includes New Year\u2019s Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington\u2019s Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and any other day appointed as a holiday by the President or the Congress of the United States, or by the state in which the district court is held.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-13\">As a matter of law, I conclude that, in light of Rule 45(a)\u2019s second sentence, no violation \u2014 immaterial or otherwise \u2014 occurred in this case. But even if Rule 45(a) does not, as a matter of law, directly impact on section 3142(f), I still believe that the sort of delays Rule 45(a)\u2019s second sentence would authorize are immaterial violations of section 3142(f). For discussions recognizing the existence of a connection between Rule 45(a) and section 3142(f), see <em>United States v. Melendez-Carrion, </em>790 F.2d 984, 991 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Wimberly, </em>at 1573-74. For a discussion rejecting such connection for some purposes, see <em>United States v.

The first and second sentences of Rule 45(a) are the first substantive part of the Rule \u2014 the last day formula. The third sentence sets forth the second substantive portion of Rule 45(a)\u2014 the intermediate day formula. The Rule\u2019s final sentence is definitional, not substantive, and obviously applies to both substantive sections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">. Thus, the hearing was held 8 days after defendant\u2019s initial appearance. If the three arguably excludable days that fell in the interim had been excluded, the hearing would have been timely as within the 5-day parameter. <em>See Ma-lekzadeh, </em>789 F.2d at 851.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">. I realize <em>Hurtado\u2019s </em>holdings are binding authority in the circuit and cannot be overturned by me or even by a unanimous panel but only by the court en banc. It is hard to tell from <em>Hurtado\u2019s </em>footnote 8 whether Rule 45(a)\u2019s applicability was squarely argued to the court; thus, the text of footnote 8 may be no holding, but only dictum. Nevertheless, as I see it, <em>Hurtado </em>is mistaken to the extent it indicates that Rule 45(a)\u2019s \"intermediate day\u201d formula is inapplicable to section 3142(f) time computations. <em>See Hurtado, </em>779 F.2d 1474 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Specifically, the <em>Hurtado </em>court based its analysis on a comparison of subsections (d) and (f) of section 3142. Subsection (d), which provides for a ten-day temporary detention period for certain defendants, specifically excludes weekends and holidays in computing the ten days. Since subsection (f) does not contain this exclusion, the <em>Hurtado </em>court concluded that although Rule 45(a) \"ordinarily\u201d applies to statutes, \"Congress obviously assumed that Rule 45(a) would not otherwise apply.\u201d <em>Hurtado, </em>779 F.2d at 1474 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-13\">I cannot agree with this analysis. If Rule 45(a) \"ordinarily\u201d applies to statutes, it should apply to section 3142(f) unless Congress expressed a contrary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-14\">Section 3142(d) is no expression of contrary intent. When the Bail Reform Act was enacted in 1984, Rule 45(a)\u2019s \"intermediate days\" formula applied only to periods of less than 7 days. All section 3142(d) did was extend the normal 45(a) method of computing short periods of time to a 10-day period. Since Rule 45(a) already applied, as then codified, to a 5-day period, there was no need for Congress to create a specific, and redundant, exclusion in subsection (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-16\">Notwithstanding my disagreement with <em>Hur-tado, </em>I do not regard my view as to how the Rule 45(a) \"last day\u201d formula applies to the circumstances of this case as conflicting with <em>Hurtado </em>since the circumstance in the two cases are significantly different. That is, the hearing in <em>Hurtado </em>was not held the first day following a weekend or legal holiday. The <em>Hurtado </em>court therefore could not decide whether Rule 45(a)\u2019s \"last day\u201d formula applied because the court was not presented with that separate, discrete issue. That issue remains open.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
