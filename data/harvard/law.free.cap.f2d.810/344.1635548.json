Morello complained that New York state prison officials violated his constitutional right of access to the courts by intentionally and selectively taking the <em>pro se </em>legal materials that he had prepared for his state court appeal of his criminal convictions. The district court decided that, even if the facts alleged by Morello were sufficient to support a claim of substantive due process violation, the opinion in <em>Love v. Coughlin, </em>714 F.2d 207 (2d Cir.1983) (per curiam), required dismissal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">We adopt the district court\u2019s succinct statement of the facts, which accepts as true Morello\u2019s account of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-18\">In the early morning of November 6, 1983, while Morello was incarcerated at the Collins Correctional Facility, he completed work on a brief for an appeal he had pending before the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, Fourth Department. Later that day, before his appellate brief could be notarized, Morello was segregated from the general population and placed in confinement. All of his property was \u201cpacked up,\u201d and placed in another room by Corrections Officer Nowakawski.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-19\">The following day, Morello was transferred to the Attica Correctional Facility. He did not receive any of his personal belongings until six days later, on November 13, 1983. When Morello\u2019s property was finally turned over to him, two of his eleven legal folders were missing. At some point during his transfer from Collins to Attica, Morello alleges that as yet unidentified correctional officers searched his bags, and arbitrarily stole various items of his personal property, including his appellate briefs and records of a phone call made by his attorney to the Niagara Falls police. Also taken were all of his notes, research materials, and rough draft worksheets. Morello alleges that the loss caused him irreparable harm in perfecting his appeal, since he had received legal assistance in the preparation of his appellate brief that could not be replaced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-20\">Morello\u2019s complaint, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, seeks punitive and compensatory damages, as well as other appropriate relief, for the \u201ctheft and removal\u201d of his appellate <em>pro se </em>brief and research.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Morello v. James, </em>627 F.Supp. 1571 (W.D.N.Y.1986) (consolidating Morello\u2019s substantially identical claims against officials at Collins Correctional Facility and Attica Correctional Facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Although Morello has since obtained legal assistance, he brought his section 1983 complaint <em>pro se </em>before the district court and received a liberal construction of his pleadings as required by <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 9, 101 S.Ct. 173, 175, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (per curiam); <em>Salahuddin v. Coughlin, </em>781 F.2d 24, 28-29 (2d Cir.1986). The district court read Morello\u2019s section 1983 complaint as alleging that state prison officials acted intentionally and in violation of his substantive constitutional right of access to the courts, but did not decide whether the facts alleged were sufficient on their face to support such a claim. Instead, the court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) because it found Morello\u2019s case to be factually and legally indistinguishable from <em>Love, </em>which in turn rested on an interpretation of <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In <em>Parratt, </em>prison officials negligently lost a prisoner\u2019s hobby materials worth $23.50. The Supreme Court reviewed the prisoner\u2019s section 1983 claim that he was deprived of personal property without due process of law and held that, although there had been a negligent deprivation, \" \u2018the existence of an adequate state remedy ... avoids the conclusion that there has been any constitutional deprivation of property without due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d 451 U.S. at 542, 101 S.Ct. at 1916 (quoting <em>Bonner v. Coughlin, </em>517 F.2d 1311, 1319 (7th Cir.1975), <em>modified in banc, </em>545 F.2d 565 (7th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 932, 98 S.Ct. 1507, 55 L.Ed.2d 529 (1978)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In <em>Love, </em>we affirmed the rejection of a section 1983 claim based on an allegation that state officials had lost some of the prisoner\u2019s personal property, including certain legal materials. 714 F.2d at 208-09. In a two paragraph opinion, we affirmed the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Love\u2019s section 1983 complaint. It is significant that <em>Love </em>was originally decided by unpublished summary order and published later at the suggestion of the district court. 714 F.2d at 207 n. *. Unpublished orders of the Court are frequently conclusory in nature, with discussion limited to the parties\u2019 strongest claims. The <em>Love </em>opinion noted that the allegation of interference with Love\u2019s access to the courts appeared in his objection to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation for dismissal rather than in Love\u2019s complaint. We did not treat the allegation as an amendment to the complaint. Love\u2019s interference with access to the courts claim was not discussed further and we did not rule on the sufficiency of a complaint based on such a claim. Therefore, <em>Love </em>does not control the outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">We have no doubt that Morello\u2019s complaint, as interpreted by the district court, describes an unconstitutional denial of Morello\u2019s right of access to the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821-23, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1494-95, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977); <em>Washington v. James, </em>782 F.2d 1134, 1138 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Procup v. Strickland, </em>760 F.2d 1107, 1110 n. 4 (11th Cir.1985) (sources of right of access include the First Amendment, the Due Process Clauses of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, section 2). The right of access to the courts is substantive rather than procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>al. Its exercise can be shaped and guided by the state, <em>Bounds, </em>430 U.S. at 825, 97 S.Ct. at 1496, but cannot be obstructed, regardless of the procedural means applied. <em>Johnson v. Avery, </em>393 U.S. 483, 485, 89 S.Ct. 747, 748, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969) (\u201c[I]t is fundamental that access of prisoners to the courts for the purpose of presenting their complaints may not be denied or obstructed.\u201d); <em>see Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, -, 106 S.Ct. 662, 677, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment) (\u201c[I]f the Federal Constitution prohibits a State from taking certain action \u2018regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them,\u2019 the constitutional violation is complete as soon as the prohibited action is taken____\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Where a prisoner chooses to proceed <em>pro se </em>with his appeal, the state is required to provide affirmative assistance in the form of adequate law libraries or trained legal assistance, <em>Bounds, </em>430 U.S. at 828, 97 S.Ct. at 1498, as well as adequate drafting materials and reasonable postage. <em>Chandler v. Coughlin, </em>763 F.2d 110, 114-15 (2d Cir.1985); <em>see </em>Project, <em>Fifteenth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure, </em>74 Geo.LJ. 499, 973-76 (1986). Surely the state cannot satisfy this obligation by providing a prisoner access to the legal resources necessary to prepare his case and then depriving him of his <em>pro se </em>work product. Whether the deprivation of Morello\u2019s work product ultimately violated his right of access to the courts under the circumstances of this case is a factual question yet to be resolved. We merely hold that plaintiff has pleaded the violation of a substantive constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Having so concluded, we turn to the protections available to Morello. The issue is whether the rule of <em>Parratt </em>and the existence of an adequate state remedy foreclose section 1983 claims that are based on substantive rather than procedural violations of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">At the outset, we note that the basic rule of <em>Parratt </em>was not disturbed by the subsequent holding in <em>Daniels </em>that negligence cannot form the predicate for a section 1983 claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the case before us, Morello claims that the theft of his legal materials was deliberate, not negligent. <em>Daniels, </em>therefore, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\"><em>Parratt </em>reaffirms the Supreme Court\u2019s concern that section 1983 not be made a vehicle for transforming mere civil tort claims into constitutional injuries. 451 U.S. at 542, 101 S.Ct. at 1916. The <em>Daniels </em>Court wrote: \u201cOur Constitution deals with the large concerns of the governors and the governed, but it does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society.\u201d 474 U.S. at-, 106 S.Ct. at 664. There is, however, a fundamental difference between <em>Parratt </em>and the present case. The loss of a hobby kit in <em>Parratt </em>could not rise to constitutional magnitude unless there was an accompanying failure of procedural redress. <em>Cf. Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 545, 101 S.Ct. at 1917 (Stewart, J., concurring) (\u201cBut even if Nebraska has deprived the respondent of his property in the constitutional sense, it has not deprived him of it without due process of law. By making available to the respondent a reparations remedy, Nebraska has done all that the Fourteenth Amendment requires in this context.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">On the other hand, intentional obstruction of a prisoner\u2019s access to the courts is precisely the sort of oppression that the Fourteenth Amendment and section 1983 are intended to remedy. <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 545, 101 S.Ct. at 1917 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\u201c[Tjhere are certain governmental actions that, even if undertaken with a full panoply of procedural protection, are in and of themselves, antithetical to fundamental notions of due process. <em>See, e.g., Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371 [91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113] (1971); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Roe v. </em>Wade, 410 U.S. 113 [93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147] (1973).\u201d); <em>Bounds, </em>430 U.S. at 825, 97 S.Ct. at 1496; <em>Johnson, </em>393 U.S. at 485, 89 S.Ct. at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Intentional, substantive violations of constitutional rights are not subject to the rule of <em>Parratt. See McClary v. O\u2019Hare, </em>786 F.2d 83, 86-89 &amp; n. 6 (2d Cir.1986) (discussing substantive due process claims in light of <em>Parratt; </em>no substantive due process violation in reckless injury to employee as long as challenged state conduct is not uniquely governmental in character); <em>Conway v.

Cerbone v. Conway, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 390, 93 L.Ed.2d 325 (1986). Other circuits have considered the question and reached the same conclusion. <em>See Creative Environments, Inc. v. Estabrook, </em>680 F.2d 822, 832 n. 9 (1st Cir.) (dictum), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 989, 103 S.Ct. 345, 74 L.Ed.2d 385 (1982); <em>Riley v. Jeffes, 777 </em>F.2d 143, 147-48 (3d Cir.1985) (pervasive risk of harm in violation of prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights is actionable under section 1983; similar risk of property loss without due process in violation of Fourteenth Amendment is not); <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>720 F.2d 792, 796 (4th Cir.1983) <em>(Parratt </em>analysis applies to deprivations of non-property interests which do not violate substantive constitutional rights), <em>aff'd on rehearing, </em>748 F.2d 229 (4th Cir.1984) (in banc), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>O\u2019Quinn v.
