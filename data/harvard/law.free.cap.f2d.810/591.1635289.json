On March 16, 1982, Dr. Kenneth Magee (Magee), a 55-year-old neurologist, fell down the stairs of his home and sustained a laceration on his forehead. Dr. John Rowe (Dr. Rowe) was contacted by Ma-gee\u2019s wife and Magee was transported to the hospital where his wound was sutured. Magee\u2019s laceration proceeded to heal normally for the first few days after admission, but thereafter he began to manifest signs of internal hemorrhaging, such as discoloration and swelling in his neck, chest, and arms, and his condition deteriorated. Magee\u2019s symptoms were diagnosed as disseminated or diffuse intravas-cular coagulopathy (DIC), a blood disorder that prevents the blood from coagulating, which precipitates internal hemorrhaging. Magee died at the hospital on March 24, approximately eight days after his admission. An autopsy disclosed the cause of death as advanced nutritional cirrhosis of the liver, -caused by Magee\u2019s alcohol consumption. Two physicians who testified at trial on behalf of Magee\u2019s personal representative confirmed that his cirrhosis of the liver had contributed to his DIC and but for the cirrhosis Magee\u2019s fall and resulting injury would not have caused DIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Magee\u2019s life was insured in the event of accidental death by three policies. Defendant Equitable Life Assurance Society (Equitable) had issued an insurance policy to Magee which provided for an additional indemnity of $15,000 in the event of accidental death upon proof that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\">(1) the death of th\u00e9 Insured resulted from bodily injuries caused directly and independently of all other causes by external, violent and purely accidental means,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-13\">* &gt;k * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-14\">(3) disease or illness of any kind, physical or mental infirmity, or medical or surgical treatment therefor, did not directly or indirectly cause or contribute to such death____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Defendant Provident Life and Accident Insurance Co. (Provident) had issued a policy which provided Magee $100,000 in coverage for bodily injuries including death \u201cdue to external, violent and accidental means\u201d with the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-16\">The benefits provided above will not be payable for any loss caused directly or indirectly, wholly or partly by (a) bodily or mental infirmity ... [or] any other kind of disease____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">Finally, defendant Canada Life Assurance Co. (Canada Life) had issued a health and accident insurance policy which provided Magee with $50,000 in accidental death benefits with the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-18\">No payment will be made under this provision for any loss which is contributed to by, or is caused directly or indirectly by, any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-19\">$ * <em>* </em>jji % *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-20\">(e) Illness or disease of any kind____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-21\">The plaintiff Ann Arbor Trust Co. (the plaintiff), personal representative and trustee of Magee\u2019s estate and beneficiary under his three policies of insurance, initiated this action against the three insurance companies after each disclaimed coverage. A jury determined that the plaintiff was entitled to recover on each of the respective policies. A review of the record disclosed that the district judge denied the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ants\u2019 pretrial motion for summary judgment, the defendants\u2019 subsequent motion for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case renewed at the close of all evidence, and the defendants\u2019 post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">On appeal to this court, defendant insurance companies argued that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law upon the contractual language of the exclusionary clauses incorporated into each of the three policies and that accordingly their successive motions for summary judgment, directed verdict, and judgment notwithstanding the verdict were erroneously denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The pertinent case law generally recognizes, as it must, the significance of the contractual language incorporated into the particular insurance policy under examination, although the exclusionary language and form may vary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a policy insuring against accidental death contains exclusionary language substantially to the effect that benefits are precluded where death directly or indirectly results from or is contributed to by disease, the inquiry is properly limited to determining if the accident alone was sufficient to cause death directly and independently of disease; an exclusionary clause therefore precludes recovery where death results from a pre-existing disease or from a combination of accident and pre-existing disease. Such policies are to be distinguished from those which do not express such specific exclusionary language, in which latter case the plaintiff\u2019s burden, in order to recover, is to prove that the decedent\u2019s accident was the direct and proximate cause of death. The existence of pre-existing disease will therefore not bar recovery under such a policy if bodily injury and/or death results from a combination of accident and pre-existing disease, so long as the accident activated the condition which ultimately caused the injury and/or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">All three of the instant policies contained exclusionary language barring recovery under circumstances where the death of the insured was directly or indirectly caused or contributed to by disease or illness of any kind. Despite the specific and explicit exclusionary language, the district court concluded that the proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s demise was a material issue of fact to be resolved by the jury. In light of the testimony presented at trial as juxtaposed with the exclusionary language in each of the three insurance policies, however, the district court\u2019s error in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence and in submitting the matter to the jury for disposition is apparent. The plaintiff\u2019s two expert witnesses, Dr. Rowe, who treated Magee during his hospital confinement, and Dr. Keith Henley, an internist, both testified that but for the decedent\u2019s cirrhosis of the liver he would not have developed DIC and the fall and resulting laceration alone would not have precipitated DIC or caused his demise under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>circumstances of this case. The testimony of the plaintiffs own witnesses at trial rendered ineluctable the conclusion that no person could reasonably have concluded that Magee\u2019s cirrhosis did not contribute to his death at least indirectly or in part. It is equally manifest that the parties to the respective insurance policies, by incorporation of the instant exclusionary provisions, expressly limited the extent of the accidental insurance coverage and intended to exclude losses occasioned under the instant and similar circumstances. Accordingly, the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law in light of the testimony presented at trial and the terms of the respective policies and the district court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence and in denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Based upon the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for entry of judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\">. Although the district court did not resolve a purported choice of law issue involving the laws of Michigan, New York, Tennessee, and Ontario, an examination of the leading case law of the four jurisdictions in question disclosed that the underlying substantive legal principles are essentially identical as those legal principles relate to the issues joined in the instant litigation. <em>See Berger v.
