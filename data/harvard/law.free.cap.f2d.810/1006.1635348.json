No appeal is available. 10 Wright, Miller and Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 2715 (1983); <em>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Mestre, </em>701 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.1983); <em>In re Smith, </em>735 F.2d 459, 461 (11th Cir.1984). Nor does this case fall within any of the narrow exceptions to the rule of nonappealability such as the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Smith, </em>735 F.2d at 461. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\"><em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511,530,105 S.Ct. 2806, 2817, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) held that \u201ca district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d In the present case the district court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment did not turn on an issue of law; the court denied defendants\u2019 claim of qualified immunity because the case required substantial factual development before it could be determined with finality whether Riley had been subjected to constitutional deprivation and, if so, whether some or all of the defendants were entitled to the benefit of qualified immunity. The district court\u2019s order is therefore not a final appealable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">In addition, the Supreme Court in <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth </em>specifically noted that it was expressing no opinion regarding the appeal-ability of a denial of qualified immunity when the plaintiff\u2019s action involves claims for injunctive relief that will have to be adjudicated regardless of the resolution of any damage claims. <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 2812 n. 5. Because Riley requested injunctive relief as well as damages, this case is not clearly controlled by <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">Wainwright\u2019s petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
