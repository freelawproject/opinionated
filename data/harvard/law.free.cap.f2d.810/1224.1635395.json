This duty is limited by the Act\u2019s exclusion therefrom of certain reserved management rights, including the right \u201cto assign work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7106(a)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although federal agencies are not required to bargain over the substance of these reserved rights, \u201can agency must bargain over the procedures by which these management rights are exercised.\u201d <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>464 U.S. 89, 92, 104 S.Ct. 439, 441, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(b)(2) (1982). A proposal involving the procedures to be employed by a federal agency is also non-negotiable, however, \u201cif its implementation would \u2018directly interfere with the agency\u2019s basic right ... [as reserved] under section 7106(a)____\u2019\u201d <em>Department of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1159 (D.C. Cir.1981) (quoting <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>2 F.L.R.A. 604, 613 (1980)), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 945, 102 S.Ct. 1443, 71 L.Ed.2d 658 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-17\">The proposals at issue arose out of a decision by the IRS to conduct some audits of employee benefits plans in IRS district offices (\u201coffice audits\u201d) rather than at the taxpayer\u2019s place of business (\u201cfield audits\u201d). The work performed during the office audits would be identical to that performed during the field audits and would \u201ccome[] within the position description of the employees at issue.\u201d Statement of Agency Position at 6 n. 4, Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 30. The only difference between the two types of audits is the place where the work is to be performed. The change in practice affected employees who perform audits throughout the state of Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-18\">During collective bargaining negotiations, NTEU, the exclusive bargaining representative of IRS employees, submitted two proposals regarding the selection of employees to perform office audits. Proposal 1 provides that office audit assignments will be made first from among qualified volunteers in accordance with certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>competitive procedures. If volunteers are unavailable, qualified employees will be selected primarily on the basis of inverse seniority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proposal 2 provides that, \u201cabsent just cause,\u201d certain union officials will be given first preference to perform the office audits before volunteers are solicited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the IRS refused to negotiate over these proposals, the NTEU filed a negotiability appeal with the FLRA. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 7117 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">The FLRA found both proposals to be nonnegotiable because they would interfere with the employer\u2019s right to assign work and thus concluded that the proposals are not within the IRS\u2019 duty to bargain. <em>National Treasury Employees Union, </em>17 F.L.R.A. 379 (1985). With respect to Proposal 1, the FLRA noted that \u201c \u2018the right to assign work includes discretion to determine when the work which has been assigned will be performed,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 380 (quoting <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, </em>8 F.L.R.A. 347, 377 (1982), <em>rev\u2019d as to other matters sub nom. Department of Justice v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>709 F.2d 724 (D.C.Cir. 1983)), and concluded that the proposal would violate this right because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgP\">by prescribing the selection of employees to perform office audits without taking into consideration those employees\u2019 availability to perform such work, Union Proposal 1 would force management into one of two choices where the employees identified by application of the proposed procedures are engaged in ongoing or priority field audits. The Agency would either have to relieve the identified employees of their continuing assignments or delay the start of the office audits pending completion of the field assignments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">17 F.L.R.A. at 380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-13\">The FLRA concluded that Proposal 2 did not interfere with the IRS\u2019 ability to determine when work would be performed because it included a \u201cjust cause\u201d exception, but found that it was nonnegotiable because it would interfere with the agency\u2019s right \u201c \u2018to assign work to <em>all </em>employees, regardless of whether they are Union officials and regardless of whether they consent.\u2019 \u201d 17 F.L.R.A. at 381 (quoting <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2272, </em>9 F.L.R.A. 1004 (1982)). This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">The Act provides that decisions of the FLRA must be made in accordance with section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123 (1982). Thus, the FLRA\u2019s decisions will be upheld if they are not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the FLRA is construing its enabling legislation, its determinations are to be accorded \u201cconsiderable deference,\u201d <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>464 U.S. at 97, 104 S.Ct. at 444, and a negotiability decision will be upheld if the FLRA\u2019s construction of the Act is \u201creasonably defensible.\u201d <em>Department of Defense, </em>659 F.2d at 1162 n. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">We find that the FLRA\u2019s conclusion that Proposal 1 will directly interfere with the IRS\u2019 right to assign work is more than reasonably defensible. As this court has previously recognized, \u201cthe right to determine what work will be done, and by whom and when it is to be done, is at the very core of successful management of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Federal Labor Relations Autk., </em>691 F.2d 553, 563 (D.C.Cir. 1982). Because Proposal 1 does not include a provision requiring that the employee selected by application of the proposal be available to perform the work, the IRS\u2019 right to determine when work will be done is lost when the chosen employee is involved in an ongoing field assignment. As the FLRA concluded, when such an employee is unavailable, the IRS will be forced either to delay an office audit or to discontinue the field audit being performed by the chosen employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">We see no argument supporting the conclusion that this result would not directly interfere with the right to determine when assigned work will be performed. In fact, the NTEU has essentially conceded this point by its inclusion of a \u201cjust cause\u201d provision in Proposal 2, the stated purpose of which is to cover situations where union officials \u201cdue to their present work assignments, cannot be called back to the office without causing a severe interruption of the IRS\u2019s workload.\u201d NTEU Petition to Review Assertion of Nonnegotiability at 2, J.A. at 6. It is inconsistent for the NTEU to argue that the unavailability of some employees will interfere with the IRS\u2019 ability to determine when work will be done, while the unavailability of other employees will not, when the employees involved in both situations are engaged in the same type of work. As such, the NTEU has not attempted to argue that its positions are consistent. Instead it has raised other contentions which we think to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\">The NTEU\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that Proposal 1 is merely a procedure for selection among qualified employees and, based upon NLRA precedent, is therefore negotiable. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioner at 11-18 (citing <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>5 F.L.R.A. 83 (1981); <em>Laborers Int\u2019l Union, </em>9 F.L.R.A. 703 (1982); <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>15 F.L.R.A. 545 (1984)). We agree with the NTEU that had the FLRA concluded that Proposal 1 was nonnegotiable because it interfered with the IRS\u2019 right to determine <em>who </em>will perform the work, this conclusion would have been inconsistent with the cited precedent. However, the FLRA specifically rejected the IRS\u2019 contention to this effect as \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d 17 F.L.R.A. at 380. The NTEU\u2019s argument and the cases it cites are, therefore, irrelevant to the issue of whether Proposal 1 will directly interfere with the IRS\u2019 right to determine <em>when </em>assigned work will be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-9\">We think the NTEU\u2019s corollary argument \u2014 that the FLRA\u2019s decision in this case is inconsistent with the cited precedent because those decisions could have discussed the employer\u2019s right to determine when work will be done but did not \u2014 has even less merit. First, this court properly does not require an agency to raise and reject every conceivable basis for its decision so that it will not be inconsistent with some future decision that may involve similar challenges. Second, it was not necessary to address the issue in two of the cited decisions because the proposals under review included provisions which would protect the employer\u2019s right to determine when assigned work would be performed. <em>See American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>5 F.L.R.A. at 83 (\u201cTDY will be offered to qualified <em>and available </em>employees with requisite skills on the basis of seniority\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Laborers Int\u2019l Union, </em>9 F.L.R.A. at 703 (\u201cThe Employer agrees that, <em>to the extent consistent with work requirements, </em>every possible effort will be made to detail employee[s] to higher level duties in the following manrier[ ]\u201d) (emphasis added). Finally, because the employer\u2019s right to determine when assigned work will be done was not addressed in the third cited decision, and presumably was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>raised by the agency, we cannot determine whether the issue should have been discussed. We certainly are not required to reverse an agency decision because the basis for that decision was not raised in an earlier case in which it may not have been necessary to raise it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">The NTEU argues next that the FLRA\u2019s decision must be reversed because the IRS did not submit evidence to support its claim that Proposal 1 would interfere with its right to determine when work would be done. The NTEU claims that the IRS could have submitted evidence regarding \u201cthe number of employees involved in office and field audits, the duration of such audits, how many employees would be affected by the decision to perform more office audits and the number of priority audits.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 18. Putting aside the fact that on its face the proposal supports the FLRA\u2019s decision, we conclude that the NTEU did not raise this contention below and, therefore, that we do not have jurisdiction to entertain it here. <em>EEOC v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1678, 1680, 90 L.Ed.2d 19 (1986); <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>803 F.2d 737, 742 (D.C.Cir. 1986); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c) (1982) (\u201cNo objection that has not been urged before the Authority ... shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d). We also find the NTEU\u2019s argument to the contrary to be rather specious. The NTEU\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d that it raised this contention proceeds as follows: (1) the IRS argued that Proposal 1 \u201c \u2018would not take into account the availability of the employee who may otherwise be involved in a long-term and complex field audit and the varying travel costs of bringing employees in from different field locations.\u2019 \u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner at 9 n. 6, <em>quoting </em>Statement of Agency Position at 9, J.A. at 33; (2) the NTEU argued below that the IRS had not substantiated its claims regarding the costs of the proposal and the effect of the proposal in emergency situations. <em>See </em>NTEU Response to Agency Statement at 4-5, J.A. at 60-61; (3) therefore, because the IRS\u2019 argument that the proposal would interfere with its right to determine when work would be done \u201cwas always linked to travel costs\u201d and the NTEU addressed the lack of evidence regarding travel costs, it has thereby also addressed the timing argument. Reply Brief for Petitioner at 9. The proposition does not survive its statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">In any event, the record is clear that the IRS\u2019 objections were not \u201clinked.\u201d In the first part of its Statement of Agency Position, the IRS argued that Proposal 1 would place a financial and administrative burden on the agency. The NTEU challenged this argument as unsupported. In the second part of its Statement, the IRS argued independently that Proposal 1 would \u201cclearly prohibit management from considering other relevant and significant factors in assigning work including the availability of employees based on current workload priorities and assignments.\u201d Statement of Agency Position at 11, J.A. at 35; <em>see id. </em>at 13, J.A. at 37 (proposal \u201cwould prevent management from requiring that the normal duties assigned to employees be performed when performance of those duties would conflict with such employees performing office audits\u201d). The NTEU simply chose not to argue before the FLRA that this position was unsupported by substantial evidence and it thus lost its right to do so here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We deny the petition to review the decision of the FLRA that Proposal 1 is not within the IRS\u2019 duty to bargain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\">We cannot, however, see a rational basis for the FLRA\u2019s conclusion that Proposal 2 (which provides that \u201cabsent just cause,\u201d certain union officials shall have a first preference for office audits) deprives the IRS of the right to assign work to all employees. We find it indistinguishable from other proposals regarding procedures by which qualified employees are to be selected for certain work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">The FLRA argues that Proposal 2 creates an \u201cexception to management\u2019s right to assign\u201d work and, therefore, pursuant to its decision in <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2272 (\u201cUS. Marshals Service \u201d), </em>9 F.L.R.A. 1004 (1982), is nonnegotiable. In that case, the union submitted a proposal which provided that \u201c[t]here should not be any union official going on details, special assignments, PC [Prison Central] trips, or any other out of the District activities that would take union officials out of touch with management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1014. The FLRA held that this proposal interfered with the employer\u2019s right to assign work to all employees because it created an \u201cexception\u201d to the employer\u2019s right to assign certain work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">The <em>U.S. Marshals Service </em>case is clearly distinguishable from the one before us. In that case, management could never assign certain work to union officials. In this case, the IRS can assign any work to the named union officials that it had previously assigned to them. The proposal merely provides that these union officials will have first preference for office audits. If the union officials do not prefer office audits, or if none are available, or if there is just cause for denying their first preference, the union officials may be assigned to field audits. The proposal in no way excepts these officials from a certain type of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-10\">All procedures for selecting qualified employees for certain work \u201cexcepts\u201d them from doing other work at the same time. Proposal 2 has the same effect as one that requires that certain assignments \u201cbe offered to qualified and available employees with requisite skills on the basis of seniority,\u201d <em>American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>5 F.L.R.A. 83 (1981), or one that requires management to assign work to an employee with the \u201cgreatest Federal employment service\u201d when two or more employees are \u201cequally well qualified and capable of performing the detail work.\u201d <em>Laborers Int\u2019l Union of North Am., AFL-CIO, Local 1276, </em>9 F.L.R.A. 703, 704 (1982). Because these proposals have been found by the FLRA to be negotiable, a finding that Proposal 2 is nonnegotiable cannot be upheld on this ground absent some explanation for the inconsistency. <em>See Department of the Treasury v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., </em>707 F.2d 574, 581 n. 24 (D.C.Cir. 1983). The FLRA has not proffered such an explanation. Nor has it provided any other evidence that these union officials will be excepted from performing any type of work. Therefore, we grant the petition for review of the FLRA\u2019s decision that Proposal 2 is nonnegotiable because it directly interferes with the IRS\u2019 right to assign work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the FLRA considered only the IRS\u2019 claim that the proposal violated section 7106(a)(2)(B), we remand for consideration of the IRS\u2019 claims that Proposal 2 was nonnegotiable because it directly interfered with its right to direct employees, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106(a)(2)(A) (1982), and to determine the number and type of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>or work project, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7106(b)(1). <em>See </em>Statement of Agency Position at 2, J.A. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7106 (1982) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-13\">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1313-14\">(2) in accordance with applicable laws\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">(B) to assign work, to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\">(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aco-dedup-1\">(2) procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section; ...</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">.
