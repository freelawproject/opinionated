Bucci were entitled to a new trial because of improprieties in the government\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments. After a close and careful scrutiny of the record, we conclude that the district court, although understandably concerned about \u201c[t]he fundamental rights at issue,\u201d nevertheless erred when it granted the new trial. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-18\">The indictment in this case charged defendants with extorting $77,350 from James Notarantonio through a kickback scheme involving Notarantonio\u2019s lease of garbage trucks to the City of Providence, Rhode Island. At the time of the alleged extortion, defendant Glantz was the City Solicitor of Providence and defendant Bucci was an attorney in private practice. Buc-ci\u2019s brother-in-law, Clement Cesaro, was then director of the Providence Department of Public Works, a position he obtained with Bucci\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-19\">The government\u2019s evidence at trial was presented primarily through Notaranto-nio\u2019s testimony. Notarantonio testified that Glantz solicited from him the lease used in the kickback scheme, and that Buc-ci was able to arrange for an inflated contract between Notarantonio and the city because of the position held by Bucci\u2019s brother-in-law Cesaro at the Department of Public Works. The government\u2019s evidence also showed that Cesaro departed from normal city procedures when he requested unlimited discretion to negotiate the gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>bage truck lease with Notarantonio. The lease itself also reflected a deviation from the norm, lacking a signature line for the mayor and instead containing Cesaro\u2019s signature. The government also presented charts to the jury showing the correlations by date and amount of seventeen payments from the City to Notarantonio and eight supposedly related payments from Notar-antonio to Bucci.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">During cross-examination of Notaranto-nio, Bucci\u2019s attorney sought to establish that Bucci had performed legal and consulting services for Notarantonio for which he earned the $77,350. The defense also presented the testimony of a number of other witnesses, some of whom discussed work Bucci supposedly did for Notaranto-nio. The government sought to discredit the legal fees theory, particularly emphasizing that Bucci had no records of such work. The government read into evidence sworn testimony given by Bucci before the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1983, in which Bucci responded to a subpoena duces tecum for the production of records of work done for Notarantonio or Notarantonio\u2019s company by turning over documents showing only unreimbursed expenses of less than a thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Defendants were convicted after a three-week trial of conspiracy to extort kickback payments from Notarantonio and of the substantive crime of extorting those payments. Defendant Bucci also was convicted of conspiracy to conceal the kickback scheme from the Internal Revenue Service and of preparing two false documents for presentation to the IRS. Defendants moved for a new trial on four grounds: insufficient evidence, inadequate jury instructions, grand jury abuse, and closing and rebuttal arguments by the government that impermissibly shifted the burden of proof and commented on the defendants\u2019 failure to take the stand. The district court rejected the first three of these grounds, but granted a new trial in the belief that the prosecutor\u2019s arguments improperly influenced the jury. On appeal, the government claims that there was nothing improper in its argument and, even if there was some impropriety, any error was either cured through instruction or harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">We preface our discussion with a description of the allegedly offending prosecutorial statements. Shortly after the prosecutor began his argument, immediately after he detailed the charges listed in the indictment, he made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akg-dedup-0\">You must decide, ladies and gentlemen, that money $77,350, it\u2019s either legal fees or kickbacks. There\u2019s no other alternative. It\u2019s one or the other. Legal fees or kickbacks. And you have to make that decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">This theme \u2014 \u201clegal fees or kickbacks\u201d\u2014 was raised repeatedly during the closing statement, and much of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was directed toward attacking the notion that the money could be legal fees. In evaluating the evidence presented by the defense that the payments were legal fees, the prosecutor posed the questions, \u201cWho else did you hear from? Who else did the defense call on this issue of legal fees?\u201d The prosecutor specifically honed in on the defendants\u2019 failure to produce documents showing that the money was legal fees. At one point, for example, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">They [defendants] bring in a six year old phone bill, ladies and gentlemen. But in 1983 they can\u2019t produce any records for the S.E.C. about the work that he did. Not a one. If such a file existed she [Bucci\u2019s secretary] would have guarded it with her life. As would any lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR9\">After an objection by defendants\u2019 lawyers based on shifting the burden of proof, and a brief curative instruction by the court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">Ladies and gentlemen, isn\u2019t it obviously true, lawyers don\u2019t throw out their research, they don\u2019t throw out their final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>work product. It doesn\u2019t make sense. She [the secretary] told you later he did other work involving exporting or importing for another client. If you throw it out after you do it once you\u2019ve got to start from scratch again. Nobody does that, ladies and gentlemen. You saw this man during the course of this trial, why he\u2019s doing it right now, even as we speak. Notes, every day during the course of this trial he took notes. Paper, paper, paper, that\u2019s what lawyers are all about, ladies and gentlemen. But he doesn\u2019t have a document. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. You know, ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019re talking about $77,350 worth of allegedly legal fees. Now, we don\u2019t know what Mr. Bucci charged per hour then. We don\u2019t know. If it were $100 an hour, you\u2019re looking at 773 hours. It\u2019s almost 20 weeks, that\u2019s five months of legal work. No files, no research, it\u2019s just unbelievable ladies and gentlemen, but that\u2019s what this case is all about. Legal fees or kickbacks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The prosecutor then made a few more remarks denigrating the legal fees defense before concluding his argument. After a short recess, defendants\u2019 counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor had impermissibly \u201cshifted the burden throughout the argument.\u201d The district court denied the motion, but gave the following cautionary instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">You know, Members of the Jury, I told you in the beginning and I tell you again, that you are the judges of the facts in this case and you alone decide what the facts are. If counsel in argument refer to facts and you have no recollection of them, or there may be a challenge as to whether such facts were said. Well, if they\u2019re not in the record and you don\u2019t remember them, they just can\u2019t be. You have to recall the facts, you have to find the facts, independent of what counsel has told you. And so it is on the burden of proof. I told you from the beginning that the burden is on the government to prove the case in all its respects. And these principles you have to keep in mind when you\u2019re in your jury room, as you listen to these arguments. All right, let us proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The emphasis on defendants\u2019 failure to produce records was repeated, and objected to twice more during the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument. In attempting to rehabilitate the credibility of Notarantonio, the prosecutor suggested that it would be implausible for Notarantonio to have fabricated the kickback story if the money were actually legal fees because legal fees would be easy to prove.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_8p\">You know, there\u2019s one other thing that I find very interesting, the notion that Mr. Notarantonio made up a lie that these were in fact legal fees, these checks, but that he decided he was going to lie about that. What a crazy thing to lie about. Now, Ladies and Gentlemen I don\u2019t know if any of you have ever been to lawyers, but you\u2019ve certainly been to other professionals, you\u2019ve certainly been to doctors, you\u2019ve certainly been to dentists. Doctors, and lawyers, and Dentists, they don\u2019t have trouble showing what work they did and when they did it. Why they were able to bring in records from six years ago for Doctor Murray\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Defendants\u2019 lawyers then objected, referring to \u201cthe same objection,\u201d the improper shifting of the burden of proof. The court gave another brief cautionary instruction, reminding the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt and noting that the \u201c[d]efense doesn\u2019t have to prove anything or disprove anything.\u201d The prosecutor then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Thank you, your Honor. We accept that 100%, the government has the full burden here. My point is a simple one. If Mr. Notarantonio is telling a lie, if those were in fact legal fees, he was taking a big risk because he had to assume that if those were legal fees, which is the contention, that if those were legal fees, boy he could be blown right out of the water, it would be very simple to show that those were legal fees, and to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that he was lying. It doesn\u2019t make sense that he\u2019d lie about such a thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Defense counsel again objected and, at a bench conference, argued for the first time that the prosecutor\u2019s argument improperly touched upon the defendants\u2019 failure to take the stand as well as improperly shifted the burden. The court again denied a mistrial, but gave the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">Again, Members of the Jury, the burden of proving a case rests upon the United States Government. The defendants don\u2019t have to prove anything, they don\u2019t have to disprove anything, they don\u2019t have to produce anything. For you to be \u2014 for you to resolve this case as to guilt or innocence, you look to the evidence. However, you look at this evidence in its entirety. And I will instruct you more completely on that. And just as I told you about the presumption of innocence, I told you now about the burden of proof, and so I will tell you also, during the instructions that a defendant does not have to testify in a case, and no inference is to be drawn from that kind of testimony, it\u2019s the concept and the philosophy of our criminal jurisprudence that underlines all of these cases that you have to keep in mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We have recently, and repeatedly, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">In deciding whether a new trial is required \u2014 either because prosecutorial misconduct likely affected a trial\u2019s outcome or to deter such misconduct in the future \u2014 we consider the severity of the misconduct, whether it was deliberate or accidental, the context in which it occurred, the likely curative effect of the judge\u2019s admonitions and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6R\"><em>United States v. Ingraldi, </em>793 F.2d 408, 416 (1st Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Cox, </em>752 F.2d 741, 745 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d 582, 586 (1st Cir.1982). In applying this test, the district court found \u201cmisconduct\u201d that bordered on \u201ca fairly severe violation of the constitutional prohibition against comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify or produce documents ... and against shifting of the burden of proof.\u201d The court held that the cumulative effect of repeated prosecutorial comments could not be rebutted by cautionary instructions, and that, given the context and frequency of the statements at issue, \u201cthe jury almost certainly was improperly swayed or influenced in its deliberations by misconceptions as to the burden of proof and privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">We disagree with this assessment of the prosecutor\u2019s arguments and their likely effect on the jury to such an extent that we feel compelled to conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial represents an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not say that the district court\u2019s conclusions were totally unfounded; rather, we think the court unduly emphasized the problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that existed and, therefore, unnecessarily intervened in a process that \u2014 although imperfect \u2014 adequately protected defendants\u2019 rights. This is not an \u201c \u2018exceptional case[ ],\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Leach, </em>427 F.2d 1107, 1111 (1st Cir.1970), in which a new trial is needed to avoid \u201c \u2018a miscarriage of justice,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Indelicato, </em>611 F.2d 376, 387 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We do not reach this conclusion lightly. To be sure, the government\u2019s rhetorical approach had its problems. In the abstract, the \u201ckickbacks or legal fees\u201d theme could be understood to suggest that the jury needed to decide whether the government had proven the money was kickbacks or whether the defendants had proven the money was legal fees. The jury\u2019s actual task, of course, was to decide not which theory was more convincing but only whether the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the money was illegal payoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Interestingly, the district court found no problem with the \u201ckickbacks or legal fees\u201d theory per se, and defendants never objected to the prosecutor\u2019s use of this particular language. Undoubtedly, this was because the theory, although potentially misleading with regard to the burden of proof, accurately described the evidence in the case. Because the defendants had specifically tried to rebut the government\u2019s evidence of kickbacks by showing that the money actually had been paid to Bucci as legal fees, the jury, in fact, had been presented with a case of \u201ckickbacks or legal fees.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOnM\">What instead bothered the court and the defendants were the prosecutors\u2019 statements stressing the defendants\u2019 failure to produce documents to prove the truth of their theory that the payments were legal fees. Although the district court apparently felt that it was a close call as to whether each troublesome aspect of the arguments individually violated defendants\u2019 rights, it was convinced that the cumulative impact of the challenged statements added up to a serious violation of defendants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">We have several problems with this conclusion. First, with regard to shifting the burden of proof, we think the district court gave short shrift to the government\u2019s right to comment on the plausibility of the defense theory. In <em>United States v. Sa-varese, </em>649 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1981), we recognized that the government is entitled, to some extent, to comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to produce evidence supporting the defense theory of the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4g\">[Defendant chose to call witnesses and put forth an alibi. Having done so, he had no right to expect the government to refrain from commenting on the quality of his alibi witnesses <em>or from attacking the weak evidentiary foundation on which the alibi rested.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In this case, the government\u2019s rebuttal was to suggest that the legal fees theory was implausible because if the money had been legal fees, certainly there would have been records indicating the work that had been done. Each of the prosecutor\u2019s challenged comments about records is logically interpreted in this manner: the contrast between the absence of legal fee records and the existence of a six-year-old phone bill; the reminder that \u201c[djoctors, lawyers, and dentists ... don\u2019t have trouble showing what work they did and when they did it\u201d; the implicit assertion during the rebuttal argument that it would be very easy to show that Notarantonio was lying because if the money were legal fees there would be records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>The district court stated that \u201c[t]he prosecution commentary was aimed not only at the <em>weaknesses </em>in the defense evidence, but also at the absence of defense records.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) But the <em>absence </em>of records <em>was </em>the primary weakness in the defense theory. Moreover, the government had presented affirmative evidence, in the form of Bucci\u2019s own earlier testimony before the SEC, that the records did not exist, and it was logical for the government to highlight this evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that these comments \u201ccould only have been understood by the jury as directed to the failure of the defense to produce documents____\u201d Instead, we think the most logical impact of these comments was to urge the jury to reject legal fees as a plausible alternative to the evidence of kickbacks presented by the government.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Second, we also think it far from inevitable that the jury would construe the prosecutor\u2019s comments as references to the defendants\u2019 failure to take the stand. Although this circuit proscribes even indirect prosecutorial comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify, <em>United States v. Lavoie, </em>721 F.2d 407, 408 (1st Cir.1983), the standard nevertheless is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\u201cwhether, in the circumstances of the particular case, \u2018the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqt-dedup-0\"><em>United States v. Monaghan, </em>741 F.2d 1434, 1437 (D.C.Cir.1984) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>521 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C. Cir.1975). <em>See also United States v. Babbitt, </em>683 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1982) (\u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s comments were not such that the jury would \u2018naturally and necessarily\u2019 construe them to refer to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sa-varese, </em>649 F.2d at 87 (\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s statements here could not reasonably be construed by the jury as \u2018intentionally aimed at commenting upon defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand,\u2019 <em>United States v. Kubitsky, </em>469 F.2d 1253, 1255 (1st Cir. 1972)....\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">We are convinced that the inference of a comment on the defendants\u2019 failure to testify is far too attentuated in this case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>warrant a new trial. The prosecutor\u2019s statements focused specifically on the apparent non-existence of certain documents arguably crucial to the defense theory rather than generally on the defendant\u2019s failure to rebut the government\u2019s case. Thus, the emphasis in this case was not on the defendant\u2019s silence but on the weakness of his chosen defense. <em>Compare United States v. Flannery, </em>451 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir.1971) (prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cuncon-tradicted\u201d government testimony impermissible, when \u201ccontradiction\u201d would have required defendant to take the stand) <em>with United States v. Lavoie, </em>721 F.2d at 408 (no reversible error found in comment, \u201c... you might ask yourself what has Mr. La-voie put between himself and the truth?) <em>and United States v. Babbitt, </em>683 F.2d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir.1982) (no error in comment, \u201cWhile you search out the truth you may wish to ask yourself, \u2018Who has appeared before me in the form of a witness?\u201d\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Defendants argue that the statements questioning the lack of records must have been understood by the jury as a reference to Bucci\u2019s failure to testify because Bucci was the only witness who could have produced the legal documents concerning Buc-ci\u2019s work for Notarantonio. Even if Bucci were the only one who could authenticate the documents, this fact does not transform an attenuated inference into one that \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d would be taken as a comment on his silence. Moreover, even if technically defendants were correct that Bucci was the sole competent witness on the documents \u2014 and our reading of the record does not tell us either way \u2014 we think the existence of other \u201crecordkeep-ing\u201d witnesses makes it unlikely that the jury would have viewed the challenged comments as pointing to defendants\u2019 silence at trial rather than to the lack of evidentiary support for the defense theory. Olga Hoenkel, Bucci\u2019s former legal secretary, testified that she had typed documents for Notarantonio and she, or a possible successor, therefore would have been likely candidates to testify on the supposed legal records. In addition, Bucci\u2019s wife testified about a telephone record introduced at trial, and the jury could have considered her as another possible source for the legal records. Finally, there also was evidence that Bucci practiced law with his daughter, and the jury could have focused on her as a possible records custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Although the prosecutor\u2019s language obviously was susceptible to more problematic interpretations, we find the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Donnelly v. DeChris-toforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974) to be particularly appropriate here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">[A] court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Moreover, even if some damage was done by the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the district court lived up to its own high standard of giving timely and punctilious curative instructions. We believe it underestimated the efficacy of its own performance. Three times upon defense objection the court instructed the jury that the burden was on the government to prove the case, and the court also told the jury that the defense need not prove or disprove anything and had no obligation to produce anything. In addition, the court\u2019s preliminary instructions before trial, and five paragraphs of its instructions at the close of trial before deliberations, blanketed the specific occasions with clear before and after references to the burden of proof and the defendant\u2019s right not to testify or to produce any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">In addition to the court\u2019s instructions, it is worth noting that the defense lawyers also specifically responded to the \u201ckickbacks or legal fees\u201d theme of the prosecution. Near the beginning of his closing argument, Bucci\u2019s lawyer made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">[The prosecutor] says that the question is are these legal fees or are they payoffs? That\u2019s not the question. That is not, not, not the que[s]tion. The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tion is are these payoffs and are they payoffs beyond reasonable doubt? The defendants in this case have no burden to prove that these are legal fees. My only reason for standing here is to persuade you that the Government has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that these are payoffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">He returned to that theme toward the end of his argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">So you ask yourself, well, can we honestly believe that these are legal fees? And once again I remind you, it\u2019s not my burden to show you they\u2019re legal fees. The question is has the Government prove[n] that they\u2019re payoffs beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Glantz\u2019 attorney similarly referred to the burden of proof, and near the end of his argument observed that \u201cthe key in this defense\u201d is the government\u2019s burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the jury in this case was reminded repeatedly of the government\u2019s burden and of the defendants\u2019 right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Although our previous discussion disposes of the case, for the sake of completeness, we note that the final prong of the standard for a new trial set out in our cases \u2014 the strength of the evidence against the defendants \u2014 also militates against a new trial here. The district court ably discussed the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, and we see no reason to differ from its conclusion that \u201cthe government certainly had a strong case against the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Thus, we are convinced that no significant error attended defendants\u2019 convictions. While we reiterate our strong conviction that prosecutors should exercise \u201ca heightened sensitivity,\u201d <em>United States v. Lavoie, 721 F.2d </em>at <em>409, so </em>as to avoid improper comments potentially harmful to defendants, this is not a case in which injustice occurred. The substantially appropriate nature of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the repeated correction of any possible deficiencies, and the strong government case all lead to the conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in taking the rare step of ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">We find no merit in the defendants\u2019 arguments that other grounds support the grant of a new trial. We agree with the district court\u2019s treatment of defendants\u2019 challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the adequacy of the jury instructions. Defendants\u2019 claim of error arising from the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding Bucci\u2019s in-court behavior was not made to the district court, and therefore must be evaluated under the \u201cplain error\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15-16, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1046-47, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); <em>United States v. Collatos, </em>798 F.2d 18, 20 n. 5 (1st Cir.1986). Although we do not condone such argument, <em>see Borodine v. Douzanis, </em>592 F.2d 1202, 1210-11 (1st Cir.1979), we have no doubt that, viewed in context, the comment did not \u201cundermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Young, </em>470 U.S. at 16, 105 S.Ct. at 1047. The reference to Bucci\u2019s note-taking was simply one variation of the theme stated repeatedly by the prosecutor that the legal fees defense was implausible because Bucci, a lawyer, would have made records showing the legal work performed for such fees. Any arguable prejudice flowing from the prosecutor\u2019s comment could have been remedied by a curative instruction given upon timely objection. <em>See Borodine, </em>592 F.2d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">\n<em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded with directions to reinstate the jury verdict and for other proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">. The court told the jury: \u201cI\u2019ve instructed you as to how you regard the arguments by counsel and you just apply those instructions when you evaluate it. All right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\">. Although the government is correct that a <em>de novo </em>standard of review would apply to the legal question of whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted misconduct, we conclude that the decision to grant a new trial because of any misconduct is subject to review only for abuse of discretion. The trial judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APY7\">has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors. In short, he is far more \"conversant with the factors relevant to the determination\u201d than any reviewing court can possibly be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\"><em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 514, 98 S.Ct. 824, 834, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978). <em>Cf. United States v. Indelicato, </em>611 F.2d 376, 387 (1st Cir. 1979) (involving motion for new trial on weight of the evidence grounds) (\"[mjotions for a new trial are directed to the broad discretion of the trial judge, who may weigh the evidence and evaluate the credibility of witnesses in considering such a motion.\") <em>See United States v. Shaffer, </em>789 F.2d 682, 687 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>763 F.2d 1297, 1312 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Draper, </em>762 F.2d 81, 82-83 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"AJj\">We see no need to dissect this case, however, by determining first, whether there was constitutional error and, second, whether that error warranted a new trial. Rather, even if some aspects of the government\u2019s argument crossed over the line of propriety, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion to grant the new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. Defendants also did not object to the posing of questions such as \"Who else did you hear from? Who else did the defense call on this issue of legal fees?\u201d They later argued, however, that these questions directed the jury\u2019s attention to Bucci\u2019s failure to testify. We agree with the district court that these questions would not have been understood by the jury as referring to Bucci\u2019s failure to testify. Certainly, there is no \"miscarriage of justice\u201d warranting a finding of plain error. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 16, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-12\">. The government argues that its references to the absence of records were linked to Bucci's failure to produce documents in 1983 before the SEC, and would not have been understood as a comment on his failure to produce documents at trial. We have no doubt that a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>portion of the government\u2019s comments would have been understood by the jury as pointing to the failure to come up with evidence supporting their legal fees theory at trial, as well as before the SEC and grand jury. This conclusion does not, however, determine the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. Defendants argue that the SEC investigation was limited in scope to Bucci\u2019s efforts on behalf of Notarantonio's business, the Inge Company, and that the failure to produce documents before the SEC does not indicate that no records existed of other legal work Bucci did for Notar-antonio. Whatever the primary scope of the SEC probe, however, the fact remains that the subpoena sought \u201cany and all records of any services rendered to and/or for Inge Company, Incorporated of Providence, Rhode Island <em>and/or James </em>Notarantonio____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">. The government at one point in its closing argument spelled out the interrelationship between the government\u2019s burden of proof and the plausibility of the defense theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">You know, as you were told in the very beginning and several times during the course of the trial, the defendants never, never have to prove anything. It\u2019s the government\u2019s burden, a burden we welcome. But you know, when the defendants put on a defense you've got to consider their evidence too. Look at their evidence, let\u2019s weigh its credibility, decide does it persuade you or not. Well, defendant Bucci claimed that these were legal fees and he went to great lengths to prove this. He cross-examined Mr. Notarantonio for some three days. They brought in Miles Turkat, they put Michael Bucci on the stand, put Mrs. Bucci on the stand, and you heard from Olga Henkel. All done to show that this was extensive legal work. They also called Mr. Shana-han yesterday. Let\u2019s examine this evidence. Let\u2019s look at it and decide if it supports the claim that these are legal fees. Or if it\u2019s not so weak that it shows that these are really kickbacks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">Although a prosecutor\u2019s prefatory statement acknowledging the burden of proof may suggest recognition of \"relevant danger lurking in the [remarks] that followed,\" <em>United States v. Cox, </em>752 F.2d at 745, it would be wrong to presume impropriety simply because the prosecutor has explicitly acknowledged the government\u2019s burden. We do not believe the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case were an intentional prelude to misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
