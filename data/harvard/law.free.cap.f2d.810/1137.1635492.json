We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-19\">Cer\u00e1mica and Industrias contend that the methodology used by the ITA to calculate the countervailing duty rates was improper as a matter of law and was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-20\">Appellants urge that the Mexican government figures on certain benefits paid to exporters under the Mexican government\u2019s Certificado de Devoluci\u00f3n de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>Impuesto (CEDI) program were \u201cverified,\u201d and, as a matter of law, had to be used to calculate the duty. The ITA checked the two largest exporters, namely, appellants, found that their benefits were grossly understated, and that they had received the maximum CEDI benefits (15 per cent). This led the ITA to adopt for exporters receiving any CEDI benefits a methodology based on the maximum CEDI benefits because all exporters were entitled to receive that amount. Appellants, when pressed by the court at oral argument, could point to no evidence to support their \u201cverification\u201d argument. Appellants submitted no evidence with respect to the monetary benefits actually received by the other Mexican exporters who took advantage of the subsidy. Under these circumstances ITA was not required to use the figures supplied by the Mexican government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Appellants argue that the trial court affirmed the agency\u2019s determination on grounds not expressly articulated by the agency. It is correct that a \u201creviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery, </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). That proposition, however, does not compel reversal of the judgment in this case. The ITA gave a full and rational explanation of the basis for its two-tier system, and the use of the maximum CEDI rate. The trial court found that \u201cthe ITA determined that the statistics submitted by the Mexican government with respect to CEDI benefits did not provide an adequate basis accurately to assess benefits under this program.\u201d 636 F.Supp. at 967. The ITA, not the court, rejected those statistics. The lack of an explicit statement in the agency\u2019s published notices to the effect that the ITA, therefore, utilized \u201cthe best information available\u201d has prevented neither the trial court nor this court from discerning the path of the agency in its decision-making process. A court may \u201cuphold [an agency\u2019s] decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <em>Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>324 U.S. 581, 595, 65 S.Ct. 829, 836, 89 L.Ed. 1206 (1945). No new ground was interjected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the thorough opinion of the Court of International Trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">AFFIKMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
