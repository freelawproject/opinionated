FERC, </em>747 F.2d 763 (D.C.Cir. 1984), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 22, 87 L.Ed.2d 700 (1985). In <em>Middle South Energy, </em>a divided panel held that the Commission\u2019s authority under section 205(e) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(e) (1982), to suspend rates, and to require refunds where filed rates are subsequently found to be unlawful, extends only to \u201cchanged rates,\u201d not to \u201cinitial rates.\u201d In the instant case, petitioner Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) challenges the Commission\u2019s novel classification of a transmission service agreement SWEPCO filed with FERC. Relying on prior Commission precedent, SWEPCO contended that its filing constituted an initial rate. The Commission rejected that contention; maintaining that SWEPCO\u2019s filing is properly characterized as a change in rate, FERC held that the rate filing in question legitimately falls within the Commission\u2019s suspension and refund order authority. Accordingly, FERC accepted SWEPCO\u2019s submission for filing, subject to a day\u2019s suspension and the possibility of an eventual refund determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Commission admits that it has departed from prior practice in classifying SWEPCO\u2019s filing as a changed rate, and that an explanation is in order. We conclude that the explanation FERC offered is insufficiently clear and coherent to warrant our approbation. Unequestionably, the Commission may take a \u201cbroad view of what constitutes a changed rate.\u201d <em>Middle South Energy, </em>747 F.2d at 771. When FERC redraws the line between initial and changed rates, however, the Commission is bound to reason why, so as to show that its new path marks out a permissible construction of the Act. FERC has not supplied, in ruling on SWEPCO\u2019s filing, an adequate justification for abandoning its own precedent, nor can we discern the contours of the line the Commission now intends to retain between initial and changed rates. We therefore vacate the orders petitioner challenges, and remand this case to the Commission for reconsideration of SWEP-CO\u2019s filing and a fuller exposition of the Commission\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">SWEPCO and the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA), early in 1985, entered into a Transmission Service Agreement (TSA). The arrangement involved SWEPCO\u2019s conveyance to OMPA of undivided shares in two generating units (Pir-key and Dolet Hills); the TSA specified the rates, terms and conditions for transmission of OMPA\u2019s power entitlements from the two units.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">The Commission, when it accepted SWEPCO\u2019s submission, found, contrary to SWEPCO\u2019s contention, that the filing was a \u201cchanged rate\u201d subject to FERC\u2019s suspension and refund powers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This was a novel ruling. OMPA was indisputably a new SWEPCO customer; that fact alone would have supported a finding, under Commission precedent then in effect, that the OMPA TSA was an \u201cinitial rate.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Southern Company Services, Inc., </em>22 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,045 at 61,082 (1983); <em>Southern Company Services, Inc., </em>23 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 63,018 at 65,034 (1983). The Commission\u2019s principal order cited a passage extracted from <em>Otter Tail Power Co. v. FERC, </em>583 F.2d 399, 406 (8th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 950, 99 S.Ct. 1431, 59 L.Ed.2d 639 (1979), as authority for defining an initial rate as a <em>\u201cnew service </em>rendered to new customers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> SWEPCO already had on file, \u201cbased on the same eost-of-service formula,\u201d rates charged existing customers for transmission from the two generating units covered by the OMPA TSA; the Commission, on that basis, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>eluded that the SWEPCO-OMPA agreement did not involve a \u201cnew service,\u201d and thus did not qualify as an initial rate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">SWEPCO filed a request for rehearing. The Commission adhered to its ruling. FERC acknowledged that it was \u201credrawing the line between changed and initial rates.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without much further comment, however, the Commission reiterated its position that SWEPCO already provided \u201cthe <em>same </em>transmission service, <em>viz., </em>transmission of power from the Pirkey and Do-let Hills units, over the same transmission lines, to other customers,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so that SWEP-CO\u2019s filing ranked as a changed rate. SWEPCO then filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">While section 205 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d (1982), does not define either \u201cinitial\u201d or \u201cchanged\u201d rates, the Commission is not at liberty to blend the two. We so indicated in <em>Middle South Energy, </em>where we vacated FERC\u2019s orders and held that the statute empowers the Commission to exercise suspension and refund authority only over filings legitimately characterized as changed rates; as to initial rates, the Commission\u2019s ratemaking powers are purely prospective. <em>See Middle South Energy, </em>747 F.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Having thus failed to gain this court\u2019s approval for administrative elimination of the distinction between initial and changed rates, the Commission now proposes to broaden substantially its definition of changed rates. We are mindful that \u201can agency is free to alter its past rulings and practices even in an adjudicatory setting.\u201d <em>Hatch v. FERC, </em>654 F.2d 825, 834 (D.C.Cir. 1981). The agency must, however, \u201cprovide a reasoned explanation for any failure to adhere to its own precedents.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. Wichita Board of Trade, </em>412 U.S. 800, 808, 93 S.Ct. 2367, 2375, 37 L.Ed.2d 350 (1973) (\u201cWhatever the ground for the departure from prior norms, however, it must be clearly set forth so that the reviewing court may understand the basis of the agency\u2019s action and so may judge the consistency of that action with the agency\u2019s mandate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">The Commission recognizes that its classification of the SWEPCO filing as a rate change reflects an alteration in Commission policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> FERC announced the alteration with scant elaboration beyond the observation that \u201c[a]t least one court has ventured that an initial rate is a \u2018new service rendered to new customers.\u2019 <em>Otter Tail Power Co. v. FERC, </em>583 F.2d 399, 406 (8th Cir.1978).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statement in <em>Otter Tail </em>was made in passing; it determined no issue in that case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> What the court \u201cven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tured\u201d in <em>Otter Tail </em>is therefore an insecure foundation for the Commission\u2019s revised categorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The policy considerations advanced by the Commission in support of its new position are also of questionable cogency. The Commission asserts that because \u201cthe addition of a new transmission customer <em>[i.e., </em>OMPA] may affect the current or future allocation or amount of costs to [SWEP-CO\u2019s] <em>other </em>transmission customers,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the OMPA TSA may \u201cdirectly or indirectly creat[e] a very real change in the rate <em>already on file.\u201d </em><footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If this change came to pass, it would then be \u201cincongruous indeed, if ... the rates paid by some customers for transmission service [from] the Pirkey and Dolet Hills units were reduced retroactively, while the rate to OMPA for the same transmission service could only be changed prospectively.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AMr\">The incongruity FERC features might be troublesome if SWEPCO\u2019s rate to <em>OMPA </em>were already on file, and if that rate, along with the rates charged SWEPCO\u2019s other customers, were altered by a schedule filed by some third-party; were that the case, OMPA and the other customers would be similarly situated for the relevant purpose, and a construction of the statute so as to accord them equal treatment might well be in order. But that is not this case; the rate to OMPA can hardly be said to have been changed by this filing, so OMPA is not in a situation similar to that of SWEPCO\u2019s other customers. It does not appear incongruous to us that existing customers whose rates turn out to be altered by this filing, who thus have bargained for one rate structure and find another applied to them, may eventually receive a refund denied OMPA, a new customer receiving precisely what it bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We reiterated in <em>Middle South Energy </em>that placement of the line between initial and changed rates \u201cis precisely the type of question we must leave to the technical expertise of the Commission,\u201d but we simultaneously observed that the Commission\u2019s judgment must be a reasonable one, \u201crationally reconciled with the terms of the [Federal Power] Act.\u201d <em>Middle South Energy, </em>747 F.2d at 771, quoting <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. FERC, </em>617 F.2d 809, 815 (D.C.Cir.1980). The Act, as we construed it in <em>Middle South Energy, </em>differentiates between initial and changed rates; we cannot permit the Commission to void that distinction by defining the initial rate category in so restrictive a fashion that it virtually disappears. We have no assurance in the orders on review that the Commission has not taken the distinction to the vanishing point through dual features of its current ruling: its extension of the change in rate category to rates for new customers, and its less than crystalline delineation of what constitutes the same or sufficiently similar service.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The Commission found that OMPA, a new SWEPCO customer, would be receiving the <em>\u201csame </em>transmission service\u201d as that provided other SWEPCO customers, as opposed to \u201cnew service.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This distinction, except in the rare case where the proposed service is identical in all particulars to existing service, will be one of degree. FERC emphasizes that OMPA will receive power from units (Pirkey and Dolet Hills) and over transmission lines already serving other customers. The Commission does not claim, however, that this same<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ness suffices to place the rate to OMPA in the \u201cchange in rate,\u201d rather than the \u201cinitial rate\u201d category. What else does FERC weigh in the balance? On that decisive matter, the Commission\u2019s orders before us are \u201c[injtolerably terse.\u201d <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C.Cir.1970) (\u201c[I]f an agency glosses over or swerves from prior precedents without discussion it may cross the line from the tolerably terse to the intolerably mute.\u201d) (Leventhal J.) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The Act provides some assistance in the classification endeavor at issue. It empowers the Commission to exercise suspension and refund authority only where the utility proposes \u201cchanges ... in the [rate] schedule or schedules <em>then in </em>force.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Conforming to that statutory language, proposed service can be deemed the \u201csame\u201d as existing service only if it would be reasonable to apply the rates covering that existing service to the proposed service.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Here, the Commission found that \u201cSWEPCO had filed similar, but slightly different, rates to different customers for ostensibly the same transmission service. Thus, there <em>was </em>a rate schedule in force for the service offered, as called for by section 205 of the Federal Power Act[.]\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> SWEP-CO, however, vigorously asserts that, while there are similarities, there are also substantial differences between the service provided, and rates charged, to OMPA and to other Pirkey and Dolet Hills transmission customers. Specifically, SWEPCO alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">(a) Three other customers receive power from the Dolet Hills and Pirkey generating stations under \u201crequirements contracts\u201d whereby SWEPCO is obligated to meet all of their power demands; no similar obligation exists under the OMPA TSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">(b) A fourth customer, Northwest Texas Electric Cooperative Inc. (NTEC), like OMPA, owns an undivided share in the Pirkey unit; however, while SWEPCO is obligated to provide backup energy to NTEC from other sources if Pirkey is out of service, it has no such obligation to OMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">(c) The formula rate provisions of the OMPA TSA includes 50% of SWEPCO\u2019s non-pollution control construction work-in-progress (CWIP) in rate base; CWIP is not included in rate base under the contracts with SWEPCO\u2019s other customers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">From these allegations, it appears that SWEPCO has raised a colorable claim that the service to be provided to OMPA cannot reasonably be equated with the service provided to other customers. Nothing in the record suggests that FERC fairly considered these alleged service and rate differences. All that appears about them in FERC\u2019s exposition is the <em>ipse dixit </em>that \u201c[i]n the Commission view, these alleged distinctions are more form than substance.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This quick brush off will not do to assure a court of review that the Commission engaged in \u201creasoned decisionmak-ing\u201d based on \u201ca consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, </em>655 F.2d 318, 328 (D.C.Cir.1981), quoting <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">In the absence of a clearer exposition of the criteria FERC uses to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>whether service is the \u201csame\u201d or \u201cnew,\u201d we are unable to say that the Commission has not, as SWEPCO charges, \u201ceffectively denie[d] the possibility of a utility\u2019s ever filing an initial rate.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We therefore return this case to FERC with instructions to clarify its position. If rates to new customers can qualify as \u201cchanged,\u201d rather than \u201cinitial,\u201d the rationale must derive from a source other than a line of unelaborated dictum in <em>Otter Tail. </em>Furthermore, the Commission must explain why apparent differences in the terms and conditions of SWEPCO\u2019s service to various customers are \u201cmore form than substance,\u201d if that is indeed the case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">For the reasons stated, the orders challenged in SWEPCO\u2019s petition for review are vacated, and the case is remanded to the Commission for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\">.

The <em>Otter Tail </em>decision, considered in its entirety, provides virtually no support for the Commission\u2019s current classification endeavor. Otter Tail Power Company was charging one mill per kilowatt hour for \"wheeling\" power\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>transmitting power generated elsewhere \u2014 to 17 municipalities. <em>Otter Tail Power Co. v. FERC, </em>583 F.2d 399, 401 (8th Cir.1978). Another customer, the Village of Elbow Lake, contracted for identical wheeled service, and Otter Tail sought a rate of five mills per kilowatt hour. <em>Id. </em>Elbow Lake was at that time an Otter Tail customer receiving \"wholesale\u201d ser<em>vice </em>\u2014 i.e., power generated and transmitted by Otter Tail. <em>Id. </em>at 407. Otter Tail then sought permission to raise the rates charged the other 17 customers to five mills. <em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"aql-dedup-0\">The Commission first ruled \"that the [wheeled] service to Elbow Lake was an initial rate for a 'new type of service,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 401, a ruling that was not appealed. The filing for the 17 municipalities was classified as a rate change subject to suspension, <em>id. </em>at 403, and Otter Tail appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"atq-dedup-0\">The court upheld the Commission, since \"[t]here is no question that the schedule filed by Otter Tail ... was intended to \u2018supersede, supplement, cancel, or otherwise change\u2019 \u201d the rates <em>then in effect </em>for the 17 municipalities. <em>Id. </em>at 406, quoting 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.1(c). This was not inconsistent with the classification of the Elbow Lake schedule as an initial rate, since the Elbow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Lake filing involved a \u201cchange[ ] [in] the nature of the service rendered <em>an existing customer,\" id. </em>(emphasis added) \u2014 wholesale service changed to wheeled service \u2014 while the challenged filing did not. <em>Id. </em>at 406-08. Thus, the force of the court\u2019s observation that initial rates \"would appear to be rates that are set ... to cover new services rendered <em>to new customers,\" id. </em>at 406 (emphasis added), is diminished, for in the very case, FERC had accepted as an initial rate a filing for new service rendered an existing customer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">. <em>Southwestern, </em>31 F.E.R.C. at 61,874, J.A. at 77 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b380-11\">. <em>Southwestern, </em>34 F.E.R.C. at 61,272, J.A. at 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b380-13\">. <em>Southwestern, </em>31 F.E.R.C. at 61,875, J.A. at 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b380-14\">. <em>Southwestern, </em>34 F.E.R.C. at 61,271, J.A. at 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(d) (1982) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">. <em>See also </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(e) (authorizing the Commission to \"defer the use of such [changed] rate\u201d for up to five months). \u201cDeferring\u201d the changed rates implies that the utility can continue to charge the \"old\u201d rates during the suspension period; in a case such as OMPA\u2019s, since there are no \"old\" rates, the Commission presumably envisions that the new customer, during any suspension period, will be charged according to the rate schedules then in force for existing customers receiving the \u201csame\u201d service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\">. <em>Southwestern, </em>34 F.E.R.C. at 61,271, J.A. at 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b381-20\">.

But the Commission has clearly stated its criterion for determining what constitutes a \u201cchanged\u201d rate filing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">[Wjhere transmission service is provided over the same lines for the same basic purpose, <em>viz., </em>to transmit energy from shares of a unit commonly owned, the addition of new transmission customers shall be considered as changes to the previously filed transmission rates for such services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-13\"><em>Southwestern Electric Power Co., </em>34 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,160 at 61,272 (1986), J.A. at 112; <em>see also id. </em>(explaining that a filing would present \u201cinitial\u201d rates, i.e. would be \u201cincontrovertibly new,\u201d in FERC\u2019s view if it \u201cinvolved a rate for genuinely new sellers of energy to sell at wholesale to genuinely new customers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">The majority further contends that FERC failed to address SWEPCO\u2019s allegations that the service it provided under the filing \u201ccannot reasonably be equated with the service provided to other customers,\u201d and that its filing therefore constitutes an initial rate (even under the criterion articulated by the Commission). Maj. Op. at 293. The Commission, however, based its finding that \u201cthe same formula (with some minor variations) is being applied in each case to similar transmission service\u201d on SWEPCO\u2019s own representations in its filing. <em>Southwestern Electric Power Co., </em>31 F.E.R.C. (CCH) \u00b6 61,389 at 61,874-75 (1985), J.A. at 77; <em>see </em>SWEPCO Filing, J.A. at 5'(\u201cSWEPCO currently provides wholesale electric service to four customers un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>der a similar formula.\u201d). Moreover, as the Commission explained, the \u201cfact that the terms vary somewhat, and the fact that the charges vary somewhat, are not determinative of whether it is a changed rate____\u201d34 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,160 at 61,272, J.A. at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">With its orders, the Commission has not sought to extend its suspension and refund powers to \u201cuncontrovertibly new\u201d rate schedules in contravention of <em>Middle South Energy, Inc. v. FERC, </em>747 F.2d 763, 771 (D.C.Cir.1984). Rather, it seeks to exercise its \u201cbroad ... power to characterize rates that are arguably initial as changed,\u201d <em>id. </em>Although the characterization effected here broadens the definition of changed rates and diminishes the effect of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Middle South Energy, </em>the Commission\u2019s action is permissible. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
