We hold that the district court committed reversible error in Roe-nigk\u2019s perjury trial, in admitting prejudicial evidence and argument of the prior cocaine transactions, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">I. BACKGROUND.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">On February 25, 1985, Roenigk testified as a witness for the defense in the drug conspiracy trial of Edward E. Garrett. The alleged conspiracy was to distribute cocaine \u201con or about April 1983,\u201d in Bella Vista, Arkansas. The charges against Garrett were based on a meeting with co-conspirators Don Church and Wes Cooper, which allegedly took place on April 21 or 22, 1983, in Bella Vista. Roenigk testified on direct examination that he was with Garrett and they were not in Arkansas during the last three weeks of April 1983, and the first few days of May 1983. Garrett was convicted on February 26, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-24\">Thereafter, on September 26, 1985, Roe-nigk was indicted for committing peijury in the Garrett trial. The indictment charged that Roenigk had peijured himself by testifying he and Garrett were not in Arkansas during the critical dates of the Bella Vista meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-25\">On the 25th day of February, 1985, * * WAYNE ROENIGK, while under oath as a witness in a criminal case then being tried before the United States District Court * * * entitled, <em>United States v. Edward E. Garrett, * * * </em>did make a false material declaration that is to say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apf-dedup-0\">1. At the time and place aforesaid, the court and jury were engaged in the trial of the aforementioned case wherein Edward E. Garrett * * * was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine * * on or about April of 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>2. It was a matter material to said trial to determine whether or not Edward E. Garrett met with Don Louis Church and John Wesley Cooper, Jr. in Bella Vista, Arkansas during the last two weeks of April, 1983 to discuss the distribution of cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-4\">3. At the time and place aforesaid WAYNE ROENIGK, while under oath did knowingly declare [on direct examination] before said court and jury with respect to the aforesaid material matter, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">Q. Now Wayne [Roenigk], I believe I asked you if you had an occasion to be with Ed [Garrett] back in April of 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">A. April or May?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">Q. April of 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-8\">A. Yes I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">Q. Okay. Now in April of \u201983, will you tell the court exactly what it is that you and Ed did and, if you can, give us an idea of the dates that you were together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-10\">A. ... Well, first we went down into Texas, to Vernon Texas to look at a machine and then a couple of other places ... and we were gone \u2014 I can\u2019t say exactly but at least three weeks or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">Q. And this was in the month of April?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcN\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-12\">Q. Okay. And Ed was with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-13\">A. Yeah, he was with me the whole time. I was with him, I guess. Anyway it was my vehicle we had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-14\">Q. So would you say that you were out of the State of Arkansas around the 10th or 12th of April?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-15\">A. Yeah, definitely, I would say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-16\">Q. Would you say that you were out of the State of Arkansas with Ed throughout that \u2014 the rest of the period of April?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-17\">A. The biggest part of the month, I would say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-18\">Q. So even going into May, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-19\">A. It could have been a few days into May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-20\">* # # * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-21\">The above mentioned testimony of WAYNE ROENIGK, as he then and there well knew and believed was not true in that WAYNE ROENIGK was not outside the State of Arkansas with Eddie Garrett the last three weeks of April and the first part of May, 1983, as he so testified on February 26, 1985, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-22\">On the morning of the first day of the perjury trial, February 27, 1986, Roenigk\u2019s attorney filed an oral pretrial motion in limine to prevent the government from introducing evidence relating to the merits of the Garrett cocaine trial which might unduly prejudice the jury. The district court ruled that it was not retrying the cocaine case, and instructed the government to limit the testimony to the allegations of the perjury indictment. The court, referring to paragraph 2 of the indictment, stated \u201cthat the matter material to the trial is whether Edward E. Garrett met with Don Lewis [sic] Church during the last two weeks of April, 1983 * * (Tr. 3.) The court recognized that the government would need to introduce the events at the time of the April 1983 meeting, but ruled that \u201crepeated evidence of how much of the drugs and all that kind of stuff has nothing to do with whether [Roenigk] told the truth.\u201d (Tr. 3.) The court also ruled that testimony by Don Church regarding his conviction in the cocaine conspiracy would be relevant only for purposes of attacking his credibility. (Tr. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">Despite the district court\u2019s ruling, the government argued in its opening statement at trial that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-24\">[T]he facts in this case will show that in April, more particularly <em>April 13, 1983, </em>three years ago, Don Church entered the United States and proceeded up to Bella Vista, Arkansas, where he met Wes Cooper. <em>West [sic] Cooper and Don Church had gotten together in Bella Vista for the purpose of selling approximately forty-four pounds of cocaine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>that they had acquired from a source in Tampa, Florida. </em>On April 21, 1983, which was eight days after Don Church entered the United States Don Church and Wes Cooper met with Eddie Garrett at Wes Cooper\u2019s townhouse at 8 Briton Circle in Bella Vista, Arkansas, and during this meeting, which occurred on the 21st of April, Eddie Garrett agreed to buy <em>4-4 pounds of cocaine at a price of $100,000.00. </em>Don Church will tell you that <em>the 4-4 pounds of cocaine was delivered to Eddie Garrett </em>in Bella Vista, Arkansas, the same day the sale was made, which I stated was around the 21st of April, 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">(Tr. 48.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The government\u2019s first witness in the perjury trial was Don Church. Church testified that he had pled guilty to charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in connection with Garrett\u2019s conviction and to other unrelated felonies, and was currently serving a sentence in federal prison. (Tr. 72-73). Church also testified that he had picked up cocaine in Tampa, Florida on April 16,1983, and driven to Bella Vista, where he met with Garrett and Cooper on April 21 or 22, 1983. (Tr. 77-80.) Roe-nigk\u2019s objection was overruled, and Church testified that at the meeting, he, Cooper and Garrett arranged for the sale and distribution of 4.4 pounds of cocaine, which he later delivered to Garrett. (Tr. 80.) In addition, the government introduced into evidence, over Roenigk\u2019s objection, Church\u2019s address book with Garrett\u2019s name in it. (Tr. 80-81).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The government\u2019s second witness was FBI agent Bill Hardin. Hardin testified on direct that Garrett had been arrested for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and perjury on November 15, 1984. Roenigk\u2019s objection on relevancy was overruled. (Tr. 126.) Hardin then identified an address book found in Garrett\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest, and testified that ten of the telephone numbers in the address book matched telephone numbers called from Garrett\u2019s home telephone in Arkansas during April and May 1983, based on a copy of Garrett\u2019s telephone bill. (Tr. 128-34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The government then called Allen Hale, a friend and business associate of Garrett. Hale testified on direct that he had engaged in drug dealings with Garrett, and that Garrett had telephoned him two or three times each month during the period 1978 to 1984. After examining Garrett\u2019s telephone bill for April and May 1983, Hale testified that Garrett had called him from Arkansas on April 14, 16, 21 and 27, 1983. (Tr. 148-49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">During closing argument, the government argued to the jury that the key issue in the case was whether Roenigk had lied in his testimony in the Garrett trial, concerning Garrett\u2019s whereabouts in April 1983. The government went on, however, to narrate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\">Ladies and gentlemen, the facts in this case have shown that on <em>April 8th, 1983, </em>Don Church was in Amsterdam, Holland, where he obtained a Mexican Travel Visa. Five days later on <em>April 13th, 1983, </em>Don Church flew to Mexico where he entered the United States. After entering the United States Don Church travelled to Bella Vista, Arkansas, where he met with Wes Cooper the next day, <em>April 14th, 1983. </em>The purpose of that meeting between Don Church and Wes Cooper was to arrange for the distribution of <em>forty-four pounds </em>of cocaine. Don Church spent the night at Wes Cooper\u2019s house and flew to Tampa, Florida, around the 16th of April to pick that <em>forty-four pounds </em>of cocaine up. Don Church told you he spent one day in Tampa, Florida, and he returned to Bella Vista with the cocaine on the 19th of April, 1983. Two days later, which would have been the 21st of April, 1983, Eddie Garrett was contacted and a meeting was set up at Wes Cooper\u2019s townhouse in Bella Vista, Arkansas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-10\">During the meeting between Wes Cooper, Don Church and Eddie Garrett there was an agreement reached and that agreement was that Eddie Garrett agreed to purchase <em>4-4 pounds </em>of the cocaine that Don Church had brought up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>from Tampa, Florida, and that was on April 21st, 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">(Tr. 319-20.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The government then emphasized to the jury, <em>\u201cwe are not just talking about a small quantity [of cocaine], we are talk-, ing about pounds.\u201d </em>(Tr. 320.) (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty. Thereafter, the district court denied Roe-nigk\u2019s motion for new trial and sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed, in which Roenigk asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and the district court\u2019s admission of irrelevant evidence relating to Garrett\u2019s cocaine transactions was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">A. Insufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Roenigk first claims that the district court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict. He argues that the government did not produce sufficient evidence that he knowingly made a false material statement while testifying at Garrett\u2019s trial. He contends that the government never showed that his testimony was untruthful, because he did not testify that he and Garrett were outside of Arkansas <em>continuously </em>for three weeks in April 1983. He argues further that any false statements in his testimony were made without knowledge of their falsity. He reasons that, given the large volume of his travel during March, April and May 1983, and the fact that he did not have a chance to refer to records before testifying, he could not have been certain of the precise dates and locations of his travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The government must prove five elements to establish a case under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 for perjury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-12\">(i) the declarant must be under oath, (ii) the testimony must be given in a proceeding before a court of the United States, (iii) the witness must knowingly make, (iv) a false statement, and (v) the testimony must be material to the proof of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjO7\"><em>United States v. Boberg, </em>565 F.2d 1059, 1061 (8th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">In evaluating the sufficiency of evidence supporting a jury verdict, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and give the government the benefit of all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence. We will not reverse a jury verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>717 F.2d 1211, 1213 (8th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Boberg, </em>565 F.2d at 1062. A conviction may be based on circumstantial evidence as well as direct evidence, because both require that the jury weigh the chances that the evidence correctly points to guilt against the possibility of inaccuracy and ambiguous interference. <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>348 U.S. 932, 75 S.Ct. 334, 99 L.Ed. 731 (1955); <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>717 F.2d at 1213. In particular, intent and guilty knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence, and frequently cannot be proven in any other way. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">The district court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict in Roenigk\u2019s favor. The testimony of Don Church and the telephone toll records of Garrett supported the government\u2019s charge that Roenigk testified falsely as to Garrett\u2019s location during the last three weeks in April 1983. Garrett\u2019s address book served as additional evidence that he made telephone calls from his home in Arkansas on a number of dates during April 1983. Although Roenigk did not specifically testify at the cocaine trial that he and Garrett were away from Arkansas continuously during the dates in question, we hold there was substantial evidence that Roenigk\u2019s statement that he and Garrett were away for \u201cthree weeks or more\u201d in April 1983 was false. We hold further that the government presented sufficient and substantial evidence to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>that Roenigk knowingly made false statements during the Garrett trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">B. Prejudicial Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Roenigk next asserts that the government disregarded the district court\u2019s ruling on his pretrial motion in limine. He argues that the district court committed reversible error in admitting irrelevant and overly-prejudicial evidence of Garrett\u2019s activities as a cocaine distributor. Roenigk contends that the testimony prejudiced the jury, by causing it to base its verdict on his association with Garrett, a convicted drug dealer, rather than on the merits of the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">In its pretrial ruling on Roenigk\u2019s motion in limine, the district court recognized that some evidence of Garrett\u2019s illegal activities would be necessary for the government to prove its case. The court ordered the government to limit its testimony to the allegations in the indictment, however. The indictment charged that (1) Roenigk had testified under oath as a witness in Garrett\u2019s cocaine conspiracy trial in federal court; (2) that the issue of whether Garrett was involved in an April 1983 meeting in Bella Vista, Arkansas, to discuss the distribution of cocaine was material to the government\u2019s case against Garrett; and (3) that Roenigk\u2019s testimony included false statements regarding Garrett\u2019s location in April 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also specified in its ruling in limine that repeated references to the quantities of cocaine involved and other similar evidence were not relevant to the issue of whether Roenigk committed perjury-</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">During trial, the district court admitted evidence of the cocaine transactions underlying Garrett\u2019s conviction on at least five occasions. In its opening statement and during closing argument, the government specified the amounts of cocaine involved in Garrett\u2019s drug conspiracy, as well as where the cocaine came from and other details of the distribution network, from Florida to Holland to Mexico. Roenigk made no specific objection to these statements, other than his pretrial motion in limine. Nor did Roenigk\u2019s attorney object to the testimony of Allen Hale that Garrett was a drug dealer. However, the district court overruled Roenigk\u2019s objections to Don Church\u2019s testimony regarding Garrett\u2019s purchase of 4.4 pounds of cocaine, and to Bill Hardin\u2019s testimony regarding Garrett\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. Rule 402 generally provides that all relevant evidence is admissible, and evidence which is not relevant is not admissible. Fed.R.Evid. 402. Rule 403 authorizes the district court to exclude relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. The Advisory Committee defined \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d under Fed.R.Evid. 403 as \u201can undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403 advisory committee\u2019s note.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The government may use evidence of a prior conviction to impeach a witness. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609(a). But whether the witness is the defendant or a third party, the scope of such examination is strictly limited in order to avoid the confusion resulting from the trial of collateral issues, and also to avoid unfairness to the witness. <em>United States v. Harding, </em>525 F.2d 84, 88 (7th Cir.1975); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609(a). Excessive exploration by the government, of the circumstances and details of prior criminal conduct, may be so prejudicial as to amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. Harding, </em>525 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>F.2d at 88-9; <em>United States v. Dow, </em>457 F.2d 246, 250 (7th Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>427 F.2d 644, 647 (3d Cir.1970); <em>United States v. Pennix, </em>313 F.2d 524, 531 (4th Cir.1963). The problem with excessive references to the details of prior criminal conduct is that the jury is likely to infer that the defendant is more likely to have committed the offense for which he is being tried than if he had previously led a blameless life. <em>United States v. Harding, </em>525 F.2d at 89; <em>see also </em>1A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 57 at 1185 (Tillers rev. 1983) (\u201cThe deep tendency of human nature to punish not because our victim is guilty this time but because he is a bad man and may as well be condemned now that he is caught is a tendency that cannot fail to operate with any jury, in or out of court.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\"><em>United States v. Brumley </em>is the only perjury case cited by Roenigk in which a court of appeals found undue prejudice under Fed.R.Evid. 403. <em>United States v. Brumley, </em>560 F.2d 1268 (5th Cir.1977). The court of appeals held that the district court erred in permitting the government to introduce evidence of tax chiseling and pollution by a third party. The court of appeals recognized that the evidence was relevant in proving the defendants\u2019 motive, but held that \u201cit undoubtedly was expanded far beyond the necessary limits of relevancy and undoubtedly to the prejudice of the defendants who were not on trial for polluting or tax chiseling but for suborning perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">A party must make a timely objection or motion to strike allegedly prejudicial evidence, in order to preserve the issue of admissibility for review. Fed.R. Evid. 103(a)(1). This court will not disturb the district court\u2019s admission of evidence over objections absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>Rothgeb v. United States, </em>789 F.2d 647, 650 (8th Cir.1986). In contrast, if a party fails to object to the admission of evidence at the trial court level, only \u201cplain error\u201d is preserved for appeal. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>785 F.2d 610, 618 (8th Cir.1986); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(d); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">A party may file a motion in limine to exclude evidence before it is offered. <em>See generally Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 40 n. 2, 105 S.Ct. 460, 463 n. 2, 83 L.Ed.2d 443, 447 n. 2 (1984). However, \u201c[a] motion in limine does not preserve error for review. A party whose motion in limine has been overruled must object when the error the party sought to prevent is about to occur at trial.\u201d <em>Hale v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>756 F.2d 1322,1333 (8th Cir.1985) (citations omitted). <em>But cf. Sprynczynatyk v. General Motors Corp., </em>771 F.2d 1112, 1118-19 (8th Cir. 1985) (objection at trial after denial of motion in limine not necessary to preserve error for appellate review because specific evidentiary matter was fully briefed and argued and district court implicitly denied request for preliminary hearing on the issue). \u201cSimilarly, [an] objection is required to preserve error when an opponent, or the court itself, violates a motion in limine that was granted.\u201d <em>See Collins v. Wayne Corp., </em>621 F.2d 777, 785 (5th Cir.1980). The policy behind this rule is to discourage counsel from refraining from making an objection at trial in order to reserve the opportunity to assert reversible error on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 785-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Accordingly, we will review the allegedly prejudicial testimony of Church and Hardin under the abuse of discretion standard, because Roenigk made timely objections at trial. We will review the government\u2019s opening statement and closing argument and Hale\u2019s testimony for plain error, because of Roenigk\u2019s failure to object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">We agree with the district court\u2019s order in limine that evidence of Garrett\u2019s location and some evidence of his activities during April 1983 were necessary to prove the allegations in the peijury indictment, but that excessive reference to Garrett\u2019s crimes could confuse the jury into trying Roenigk as a drug dealer, rather than for perjury. <em>See generally United States v. Brumley, </em>560 F.2d at 1280; <em>United States v. Harding, </em>525 F.2d at 89; 1A J. Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 57 at 1185 (Tillers rev. 1983). To prove its case for perjury under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the indictment, the government was required to show that (1) Roenigk testified as an alibi witness in Garrett\u2019s cocaine trial; (2) it was material to the government\u2019s case against Garrett that Garrett was in Bella Vista discussing cocaine transactions during the last two weeks in April 1983; and (3) Roenigk testified untruthfully as to Garrett's location in April 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Some of the evidence in question, particularly the government\u2019s use of Garrett\u2019s telephone toll records and address book, the government\u2019s offer of Church\u2019s prior felony convictions, the government\u2019s use of Church\u2019s address book, and Church\u2019s testimony concerning the transportation of cocaine from Florida to Arkansas, was not overly prejudicial and related properly to the allegations in the perjury indictment. The government used this evidence to establish Church\u2019s credibility as a witness by indicating his frame of reference for the April 21 or 22 meeting in Bella Vista and to blunt the impact of any future attacks on his credibility, as well as to corroborate his testimony as to the Bella Vista meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">However, despite its ruling in limine, the district court permitted the government to introduce overly prejudicial and irrelevant evidence of Garrett\u2019s crimes. The government went beyond the allegations in the indictment by introducing Church\u2019s testimony specifying the facts of Garrett\u2019s involvement in the sale and distribution of 4.4 pounds of cocaine, and Hardin\u2019s testimony as to Garrett\u2019s arrest in November 1984 for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and perjury. Moreover, the district court permitted the government, during its opening statement and closing argument to give the jury a detailed account of Garrett\u2019s drug transactions. These details, which spanned two continents and covered activities long before the meeting in Bella Vista on April 21 or 22, 1983, and the government\u2019s emphasis on the quantities of cocaine involved, were of no relevance to the allegations under Roenigk\u2019s indictment for perjury. Nor was this evidence offered for purposes of impeachment under Fed.R. Evid. 609(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">We recognize the limitations on our power to review the district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions. However, the record indicates that the government presented its case in such a manner as to tend to cause the jury to reach its decision on an improper basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence was calculated to show that Roenigk, because of his association with a convicted drug dealer, was more likely to be guilty of perjury. <em>Compare United States v. Brumley, </em>560 F.2d at 1280. We thus hold that the district court committed reversible error in overruling Roenigk\u2019s objections during the direct examination of Church and Hardin, and in allowing the government to present the details and circumstances of Garrett\u2019s conviction during its opening statement and closing argument, in violation of the ruling in limine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>Compare United. States v. Harding, </em>525 F.2d at 88-9 (finding <em>plain error </em>in the admission of details of prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">III. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, and this case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\">. We note that the allegations in the indictment mirrored the elements of perjury as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Boberg, </em>565 F.2d 1059, 1061 (8th Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">. We note that a cautionary instruction, explaining to the jury that the defendant was not on trial for any conduct not alleged in the indictment, might have diminished the prejudicial impact of evidence of crimes by third parties in the present case. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>618 F.2d 1281, 1289 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 844, 101 S.Ct. 126, 66 L.Ed.2d 52 (1980) (probative value of evidence of similar activities by persons other than the defendant outweighed any prejudicial impact where court clearly instructed jury that defendant was not on trial for any conduct not alleged in indictment charging misapplication of bank funds and mail fraud); <em>United States v. King, </em>572 F.2d 1274, 1275 (8th Cir.1978) (per curiam) (testimony of prior similar crimes by defendant not unduly prejudicial in light of limiting instruction to jury). Such an instruction was <em>not </em>given in the present case, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b904-11\">. Because we find reversible error in the district court\u2019s allowance of prejudicial statements in the testimony of Church and Hardin, and the government\u2019s opening statement and closing argument, we will not address the question of whether admission of Hale\u2019s testimony, which did not include the same level of detail concerning Garrett\u2019s drug conviction, was also reversible error. <em>See Hutchinson Utilities Comm\u2019n v. Curtiss-Wrigkt Corp., </em>775 F.2d 231, 238 (8th Cir. 1985) (court of appeals may decline to review questions not necessary to its decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">We note further that our holding is based on our careful review of the record as a whole, and not any single incident of allegedly prejudicial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
