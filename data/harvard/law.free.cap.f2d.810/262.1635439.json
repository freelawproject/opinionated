Based on a prior Maryland conviction for possession with intent to distribute PCP, the District Court enhanced his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (Supp. Ill 1985). Jordan appeals both the conviction and the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">The aiding-and-abetting conviction relates to a transaction that occurred on March 27, 1985. The police testimony at trial was uncontroverted. On March 26, Metropolitan Police Sergeant Miller instructed Gregory Washington, an informant, to meet \u201cGarry\u201d at Fun Factory Records and arrange to purchase drugs. Washington returned bearing a small bottle, apparently containing a PCP sample, which he attributed to Garry, and informed Miller that he had arranged a $3000 purchase from Garry for the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">On March 27, Miller, under cover, and Washington waited for Garry in a taxicab at the prearranged time and street corner. Detective Norris and another officer were also in the vicinity to observe the transaction. Appellant arrived on foot 50 minutes later, entered the rear seat of the taxicab, and asked if the money was ready. He declined to view the money because, he said, \u201cmy people aren\u2019t here yet\u201d; then he departed. A minute or two later a man in a grey jogging suit passed the taxicab carrying a brown paper bag behind his back. Appellant then returned to the taxicab to notify Miller and Washington that the man in the grey jogging suit would deliver the PCP. He directed Miller to give the. money to Washington, who would transfer it to appellant later. The man in the jogging suit \u2014 to whom Norris saw ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>pellant signal after leaving the taxicab for the second time \u2014 gave the bag containing a bottle of liquid PCP to Miller and left. After Miller and Washington departed, Norris saw appellant drive away with the figure in the jogging suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The distribution conviction arose out of a transaction a week later. On April 4, Washington placed six telephone calls to appellant, which Norris and Miller recorded, to arrange a second PCP purchase. Miller testified that appellant, who was waiting at the designated location when Miller and Washington arrived, handed him a brown paper bag containing a bottle of PCP. He told Miller that this batch was a little stronger than the last one, and that \u201ca couple more times and I\u2019ll be putting out some real high-test shit.\u201d Norris observed the transaction from afar and corroborated Miller\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The government\u2019s inability to produce Washington at trial \u2014 after considerable efforts, <em>see </em>Transcript at 180-81 (visited last known residence six to eight times; left messages with relatives), 184, 196-97 (questioned relatives); <em>see also id. </em>at 202-OS \u2014 gives rise to appellant\u2019s two hearsay and confrontation-clause challenges. First, appellant challenges the District Court\u2019s admission, over objection, of the tape recordings of the telephone calls in which he and Washington plotted the April 4 transaction. Specifically, appellant directs our attention to one telephone call in which Washington and appellant arranged a meeting for 6:00 that evening, Memorandum on Admissibility of Tapes, Exhibit (\u201cExh.\u201d) A, at 7-8 (filed Nov. 19,1985), and another in which Washington asked whether \u201cit [is] stronger than it was last week,\u201d and appellant responded, \u201cA little bit you know.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Exh. A, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Appellant\u2019s own incriminating statements were, of course, party admissions, and therefore not hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) (1986). He objects, instead, to the introduction of Washington\u2019s side of the conversations. Those statements, however, were not hearsay; they were admitted not for their truth, <em>see id. </em>801(c), but \u201cto make [appellant\u2019s] responses intelligible to the jury and recognizable as admissions,\u201d <em>United States v. Lemonakis, </em>485 F.2d 941, 948 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 989, 94 S.Ct. 1586, 39 L.Ed.2d 885 (1974). The trial court so instructed the jury, both when the tapes were played and again in the final instructions. Nor was there any danger that the jury would misuse Washington\u2019s statements for their truth. It was utterly irrelevant whether Washington <em>actually </em>intended to' meet appellant that night when he arranged the meeting, or whether he cared if \u201cit\u201d (whatever \u201cit\u201d may have been) was \u201cstronger than it was last week.\u201d There having been no reason to test Washington\u2019s credibility, the introduction of his side of the conversations violated neither the hearsay rule nor appellant\u2019s sixth amendment right of confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 949-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The second set of hearsay objections, which appellant raises for the first time on appeal, relate only to the aiding-and-abetting conviction. Sgt. Miller testified that Washington, after ostensibly meeting with Garry, returned with a vial of PCP, \u201cwhich was a sample that [appellant] had obtained of the product that I was to purchase the next day.\u201d He later testified that before the transaction he \u201cwas aware [from Washington] that [appellant would] ha[ve] one other individual with him.\u201d Norris testified that he learned of the details of the planned deal \u201cfrom Gregory Washington who had negotiated the transaction,\u201d and that he knew only from Washington that the money was subsequently transferred to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The government does not dispute that testimony derived solely from Washington was hearsay, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), whose admission without any special \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d could implicate appellant\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him, <em>see Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). However, the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Has</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>ting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 510-11, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1981-82, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Even without any evidence of appellant\u2019s advance planning or ultimate receipt of the proceeds \u2014 the only facts to which the hearsay related \u2014 there was overwhelming, uncontroverted police testimony that appellant aided in and abetted the illegal transaction. Appellant made the initial contact in the taxicab, asked if the money was ready, and referred to the PCP suppliers as \u201cmy people.\u201d He then informed Miller of the messenger\u2019s identity, arranged for delivery of the money to himself, signaled to the messenger to make the delivery, and drove off with him. The admissible evidence clearly established that appellant had \u201csufficient knowledge and participation to indicate that he knowingly and wilfully participated in the offense in a manner that indicated he intended to make it succeed.\u201d <em>United States v. Raper, </em>676 F.2d 841, 849 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>see United States v. LaGuardia, </em>774 F.2d 317, 319-20 (8th Cir.1985). Further, appellant\u2019s counsel was able to attenuate the hearsay\u2019s impact by suggesting Washington\u2019s potential bias as a paid informant whose criminal charges Miller had dismissed. Accordingly, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that even without the inadmissible statements the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty. <em>See United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. at 510-11, 103 S.Ct. at 1981-82; <em>United States v. Jarrad, </em>754 F.2d 1451, 1456-57 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 96, 88 L.Ed.2d 78 (1985); <em>United States v. Coachman, </em>727 F.2d 1293, 1297-98 (D.C.Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Appellant also complains of two instances of alleged prosecutorial impropriety. First, he objects that a phrase in the prosecutor\u2019s 215-line opening statement was not borne out by the evidence. The prosecutor predicted Miller would testify that in the course of the March 27 transaction he asked appellant, \u201cDo you want the money now? Is the juice here?,\u201d to which appellant replied, \u201cNo, the juice isn\u2019t here, it\u2019s on its way.\u201d That preview of Miller\u2019s testimony was accurate, except for his omission of the word \u201cjuice\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">[Appellant] asked me was my money ready, and I said \u201cYes, my money is ready. Would you like to see it?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. My people aren\u2019t here yet ... and you\u2019re going to have to wait a short while.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">The inaccuracy does not call for reversal. Since \u201c[a] criminal trial does not unfold like a play with actors following a script,\u201d <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 86, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 1334, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976), we cannot expect the actual testimony to mimic the opening statement verbatim. Departures from the prosecutor\u2019s preview of evidence \u2014 even ones more egregious than the deviation at issue here, <em>see Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 736, 89 S.Ct. 1420,1423, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969) \u2014 are tolerated, so long as the prosecutor does not tout them and no other circumstance suggests that the statement could have prevented the jury from properly appraising the evidence. <em>See id.; compare Jones v. United States, </em>338 F.2d 553, 554 (D.C. Cir.1964). The discrepancy here was so modest that, especially in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, its correction could have made no difference. <em>See Webster v. Rees, </em>729 F.2d 1078, 1080-81 (6th Cir.1984) (\u201cinexcusable\u201d closing argument does not require granting of new trial on habeas corpus when evidence of guilt overwhelming).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">The second instance of alleged prosecuto-rial impropriety, also raised for the first time on appeal, is based upon a sentence of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal. In response to appellant\u2019s sole defense \u2014 that Washington\u2019s absence deprived him of a fair trial \u2014 the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">But do you think, Ladies and Gentlemen, that these witnesses would come in and tell you something about the existence of a person Greg Washington, who they know \u2014 that Washington would come in and say, \u201cNope, it didn\u2019t happen that way. Jordan is not the one who did it\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Do you think we would be here if that was not the case? </em>He got money, he got consideration. No question. But he\u2019s not on trial. What you think of him is immaterial. <em>What he would add </em>\u2014 well <em>you can think of that, but that is speculation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">(Emphasis added). From the underscored language, appellant infers a statement that the government (1) would not have prosecuted him were he not guilty and (2) had access to incriminating information that was not before the jury. Of course, bald statements to that effect could easily be reversible error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bess, </em>593 F.2d 749, 754-57 (6th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Lamerson, </em>457 F.2d 371, 372 (5th Cir.1972) (per curiam). But this is not a case, such as those cited by appellant (each of which involved a statement objected to at trial), in which the prosecutor unequivocally attested to the defendant\u2019s guilt, <em>see Bess, </em>593 F.2d at 753, vouched for the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses, <em>see Mathis v. United States, </em>513 A.2d 1344, 1347, 1348 (D.C.1986), or implied that the government only prosecutes those who are guilty, <em>see Bess, </em>593 F.2d at 753 (\u201cIf the United States did not believe the defendant was guilty ... this case, of course, would have never been presented to you in the first place.\u201d); <em>Lamerson, </em>457 F.2d at 372 (\u201chad [defendant] not committed a crime, we would not be\u201d prosecuting him); <em>Hall v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 582, 587 (5th Cir.1969) (\u201cwe try to prosecute only the guilty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Here, the jury most probably perceived the comments as an effort to refocus its attention on the evidence before it, and away from speculation over what was not. <em>Cf United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 11-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1044-45, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). At any rate, given such strong evidence of guilt in this case, the statement at issue could not have so \u201cundermine[d] the fundamental fairness of the trial\u201d as to amount to plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 105 S.Ct. at 1047; <em>see Harris v. United States, </em>402 F.2d 656, 656-57 (D.C.Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Nonetheless, we admonish prosecutors not to try to infiltrate forbidden comments into summation by couching them in ambiguity. In a close case, such behavior would only deny the appellate court the necessary assurance of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Appellant also raises several challenges to his sentence. He argues that the sentence was improperly enhanced, to a prison term of 10 to 30 years and a fine of $250,-000 on each count, because his prior Maryland PCP conviction was not related to a \u201cdepressant or stimulant substance\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (Supp. III 1985). He also asserts that the prosecutor and District Court failed to follow the requisite enhancement procedures under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) (1982) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) (1982), respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The penalty for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) varies with the nature and amount of controlled substance involved. Every controlled substance is categorized into one of five \u201cschedules,\u201d depending primarily upon its potential for abuse and the severity of the dependence that it induces. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b) (1982). Congress initially placed PCP in schedule III, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 812(c) (schedule III)(b)(7), applicable to substances having \u201cpotential for abuse less than the drugs or other substances in schedules I and II,\u201d which abuse \u201cmay lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 812(b)(3)(A), (C). In 1978, the Attorney General<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> transferred PCP from schedule III to the more stringently regulated schedule II. 43 Fed.Reg. 3359 (1978); <em>see </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(e)(3) (1986); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a) (1982) (authority to transfer between schedules). Schedule II includes substances having \u201ca high potential for abuse [which] ... may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(2)(A), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Most violations of \u00a7 841(a) involving schedule II drugs, including those \u2014 like appellant\u2019s \u2014 that involve less than 500 grams of PCP, are generally punishable by a prison term of up to 15 years, a fine of up to $125,000, or both. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (Supp. Ill 1985). However, the district court may enhance the prison term to 30 years, the fine to $250,000, or both, if the defendant has a prior conviction under a \u201claw of a State ... relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances____\u201d <em>Id. </em>The definition of \u201cdepressant or stimulant substance,\u201d on which the government relies to bring PCP within the enhancement provision, includes in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqT\">any drug which contains any quantity of a substance which the Attorney General, after investigation, has found to have, and by regulation designated as having, a potential for abuse because of its depressant or stimulant effect on the central nervous system or its hallucinogenic effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(9)(D) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">The Attorney General did indeed designate PCP and its derivatives as \u201csubstances having a depressant effect on the central nervous system\u201d and a \u201chigh potential for abuse.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 3359 (1978); 42 Fed.Reg. 63,647, 63,648 (1977); <em>see </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(e)(3) (1986). However, he made those findings only in the context of transferring PCP from schedule III to schedule II. There is no doubt that the Attorney General could have incorporated PCP into the \u00a7 802(9)(D) definition by expressly invoking that provision. <em>See Hoff-mann-La Roche, Inc. v. Kleindienst, </em>478 F.2d 1, 3-5 &amp; n. 2 (3d Cir.1973). The crux of the dispute is whether the findings accompanying that schedule transfer, without express recognition that they also satisfied the definition of a \u201cstimulant or depressant substance\u201d under \u00a7 802(9)(D), sufficed to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">In support of his position that the findings did not suffice, appellant invokes only the unexceptionable maxim that \u201c[i]f the meaning or intent of the statute is ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ous, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Reply Brief for Appellant at 12 n. 3. But here the statutory language is unambiguous. The ambiguity, if any, is in the Attorney General\u2019s intent. And nothing in the definitional provision suggests that to activate \u00a7 802(9)(D) the Attorney General must expressly invoke it or even recognize its existence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">To be sure, Congress could have simplified the statute by providing that enhancement is permissible whenever the defendant has a prior conviction involving a substance that is on one of several designated schedules. That Congress could have expressed its meaning in clearer or simpler language, however, does not deprive of meaning the language that Congress chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We might not be so quick to read that language literally if it either imputed to Congress an implausible intent or led to implausible results. Neither is the case. It is perfectly plausible that Congress was aware that findings relating to a schedule change under \u00a7 811 might collaterally affect the \u00a7 802(9)(D) definition of \u201cdepressant or stimulant substance.\u201d When Congress passed the Act, the term \u201cdepressant or stimulant substance,\u201d with two exceptions, appeared only in sections (or subsections) that also referred to one or more of the schedules. <em>See </em>Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-513, tit. II, \u00a7 202(d), 84 Stat. 1236, 1252 (repealed 1984) (exemption for certain mixtures containing \u201cany depressant or stimulant substance in paragraph (a) or (b) of schedule III or in schedule IV or V\u201d); <em>id., </em>tit. II, \u00a7 401(b), 84 Stat. 1261 (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (Supp. Ill 1985)) (each of four penalty-enhancement provisions applied to violations involving substances on one or more of the schedules or of any \u201cother law ... relating to ... depressant or stimulant substances\u201d); <em>id., </em>tit. II, \u00a7 402(c)(2)(B), 84 Stat. 1263 (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(c)(2)(B) (1982)); <em>id., </em>tit. II, \u00a7 403(c), 84 Stat. 1263-64 (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(c) (1982)); <em>id., </em>tit. Ill, \u00a7 1006(b), 84 Stat. 1288 (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 956(b) (1982)) (exemption nearly identical to \u00a7 202(d)). Thus, the inference that the drafters expected the Attorney General\u2019s decision locating a drug on any of the schedules to have penalty-enhancement consequences, far from being implausible, is virtually unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Further, the clear language makes perfect sense. A prior conviction under \u00a7 841(a) involving PCP enhances the defendant\u2019s maximum sentence upon conviction of practically any other \u00a7 841(a) violation. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)-(4) (Supp. III 1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It would be anomalous to halve another defendant\u2019s maximum penalty merely because an identical prior PCP conviction was under state rather than federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">We next address appellant\u2019s assertion that his sentence is invalid because neither the prosecutor nor the District Court followed the requisite procedures for enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">A district court may not enhance a \u00a7 841(b) sentence on the basis of prior convictions \u201cunless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty,\u201d the prosecutor has filed an information identifying the prior convictions. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (1982). Appellant asserts that the prosecutor's filing of the information \u2014 after the judge heard evidence on and denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, but before voir dire and empaneling of the jury \u2014 was untimely. It is true that when a trial \u201cbegins\u201d may depend upon the purpose of the inquiry. However, appellant identifies no context, and we know of none, in which a trial is deemed to begin before empaneling of the jury. <em>See, e.g., Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 1062, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>L.Ed.2d 265 (1975) (jeopardy does not attach until jury is sworn); <em>Hopt v.

Chesimard, </em>555 F.2d 63, 65 n. 1 (3d Cir.1977) (filing of removal petition \u201cbefore trial\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c), means \u201cbefore proceedings for empanelling a jury\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Greenwood v. Stevenson, </em>88 F.R.D. 225, 229 (D.R.I.1980) (10 days \u201cprior to trial\u201d for purposes of offer of judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 68 counted from day trial judge calls proceedings to order and commences hearing case, even if jury selected and sworn earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellant asserts that adoption of the universal understanding, that a \u201ctrial\u201d never begins any earlier than the beginning of voir dire, would defeat the twofold purpose of \u00a7 851(a): \u201cto give notice to the defendant so that he may reasonably assess whether to plead guilty or proceed to trial, and ... to avoid the \u2018unfairness\u2019 of increasing the potential punishment after the trial has begun,\u201d <em>Arnold v. United States, </em>443 A.2d 1318, 1326 (D.C.1982). He asserts (although he did not at trial) that the suppression hearing \u2014 complete with witness testimony, cross-examination, and oral argument \u2014 so embroiled him and his attorney in the heat of litigation that they had no time \u201cto step back and calmly discuss whether they [were] going to go to trial or not \u2014 they [were] in trial.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 15. The short answer is that if Congress had intended \u201cbefore trial\u201d to mean \u201cenough time before trial to allow the defendant \u2018to step back and calmly discuss ... whether to go to trial,\u2019 \u201d it would have so provided. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 849(a) (1982) (repealed effective Nov. 1, 1987) (one section away from \u00a7 851 Congress requires filing of information that would enhance sentence within \u201creasonable time before trial\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575 (1982) (same). Further, that \u00a7 851(a) merely requires that the information be filed \u201cbefore entry of a plea of guilty\u201d belies any inference that it guarantees a calm meditation period; and if the information takes a defendant by surprise nothing precludes him from requesting the trial judge for a short recess to regroup. Since we see no reason to believe that Congress intended to use \u201ctrial\u201d to refer to some earlier moment (and without addressing exactly when \u201ctrial\u201d begins under \u00a7 851(a)), we hold that the information was timely filed. <em>See United States v. Gill, </em>623 F.2d 540, 542-43 (8th Cir.) (under \u00a7 851(a), nonjury trial begins when court accepts defendant\u2019s waiver of jury and begins to hear evidence), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 873, 101 S.Ct. 214, 66 L.Ed.2d 94 (1980); <em>Arnold v. United States, </em>443 A.2d at 1323-28 (under similar D.C. Code provision \u201cprior to trial\u201d means before voir dire begins).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The government concedes, however, that the District Court\u2019s failure to ask appellant personally whether he affirms or denies the previous conviction and to advise appellant that his failure to challenge his prior conviction then would constitute a waiver of the right for all future purposes, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) (1982), requires us to remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Ramsey, </em>655 F.2d 398, 400 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1981). Of course, if on remand appellant does not successfully challenge the Maryland conviction, the District Court is free to reimpose the same sentence. <em>See United States v. Cevallos, </em>538 F.2d 1122, 1128 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction in all respects and remand for resentencing in compliance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\">. We reject summarily appellant\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s clarification \u2014 10 minutes after adjourning the initial sentencing hearing\u2014 that the two sentences were to be served consecutively. It has never been doubted that a district court retains the power to recall the defendant and increase the severity of the sentence at any time before he begins to serve the sentence, and <em>a fortiori </em>before he leaves the courthouse. <em>See United States v. Basic, </em>639 F.2d 940, 948 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 918, 101 S.Ct. 3055, 69 L.Ed.2d 422 (1981); <em>Batum v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 433, 440-41 &amp; n. 36 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 916, 89 S.Ct. 1765, 23 L.Ed.2d 230 (1969); <em>Walton v. United States, </em>202 F.2d 18, 19-20 (D.C.Cir.1953); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 (1982) (repealed effective Nov. 1, 1987) (sentence runs from date defendant committed to detention). Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), far from casting doubt on that authority, expressly reaffirms it. <em>See id. </em>at 134, 139, 101 S.Ct. at 435-36, 438. The Court left open only the question whether the double jeopardy clause prohibits a district court from recalling the defendant even <em>after </em>service begins. While other courts of appeals have since split on the issue, <em>compare United States v. Lundien, </em>769 F.2d 981, 984-87 (4th Cir.1985) (rejecting double jeopardy challenge but suggesting due process may limit court\u2019s authority to recall), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 815, 88 L.Ed.2d 789 (1986), <em>and United States v. Jefferson, </em>714 F.2d 689, 706-07 (7th Cir.1983), <em>and United States v. Basic, </em>639 F.2d at 948, <em>with United States </em>v. <em>Naas, </em>755 F.2d 1133, 1136-38 (5th Cir.1985), we need not address it at this juncture. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>only that enhancement of the sentence before appellant could possibly have left the courthouse did not violate the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"><em>. </em>The Attorney General delegated his authority to make such findings to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0.100(b) (1986); <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a) (1982) (Attorney General may delegate functions).

In placing PCP initially in schedule III, Congress expressly described PCP as a \u201csubstance[ ] having a depressant effect on the central nervous system,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c)(schedule III) (b) (1982), and implicitly characterized PCP as having a \u201cpotential for abuse,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 812(b)(3)(A). The Attorney General could conceivably have disagreed with those congressional findings, yet nevertheless have declined to remove PCP from the list. In light of our conclusion that the Attorney General\u2019s findings upon transferring PCP between schedules constituted findings under \u00a7 802(9)(D) as well, we need not address whether his maintenance of PCP in schedule III would have.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">.
