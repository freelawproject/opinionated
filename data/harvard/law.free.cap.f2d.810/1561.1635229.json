Having considered the record, appealed judgment, district court\u2019s findings and application of law, arguments in this court and the Supreme Court, and invited briefs of the parties and <em>amicus </em>American Intellectual Property Law Association, we respond to the remand and again affirm the judgment on the 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g) defense and reverse the judgment on the 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-8\">\n<em>The Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-9\">In remanding, <em>Dennison Manufacturing Co. v. Panduit Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1578, 89 L.Ed.2d 817, 229 USPQ 478 (1986), <em>vacating, </em>774 F.2d 1082, 227 USPQ 337 (Fed.Cir.1985), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYtS\">Petitioner contends that the Federal Circuit ignored Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) in substituting its view of factual issues for that of the District Court. In particular, petitioner complains of the rejection of the District Court\u2019s determination of what the prior art revealed and its findings that the differences identified between respondent\u2019s patents and the prior art were obvious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-12\">Petitioner\u2019s claims are not insubstantial. As this Court observed in <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 17-18 [86 S.Ct. 684, 693-94, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, 556-57], 148 USPQ 459, 467 (1966):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjhR\">\u201cWhile the ultimate question of patent validity is one of law, ... the \u00a7 103 condition [that is, nonobviousness] ... lends itself to several basic factual inquiries. Under \u00a7 103, the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved. Against this background, the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined. Such secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unresolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. As indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness, these inquiries may have relevancy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-15\">This description of the obviousness inquiry makes it clear that whether or not the ultimate question of obviousness is a question of fact subject to Rule 52(a), the subsidiary determinations of the District Court, at the least, ought to be subject to the Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-16\">The Federal Circuit, however, did not mention Rule 52(a), did not explicitly apply the clearly-erroneous standard to any of the District Court\u2019s findings on obviousness and did not explain why, if it was of that view, Rule 52(a) had no applicability to this issue. We therefore lack an adequate explanation of the basis for the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment: most importantly, we lack the benefit of the Federal Circuit\u2019s informed opinion on the complex issue of the degree to which the obviousness determination is one of fact. In the absence of an opinion clearly setting forth the views of the Court of Appeals on these matters, we are not prepared to give plenary consideration to petitioner\u2019s claim that the decision below cannot be squared with Rule 52(a). Instead, we grant the petition for certiora-ri, vacate the judgment and remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of Rule 52(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1653-5\">106 S.Ct. at 1579, 89 L.Ed.2d at 821, 229 USPQ at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-6\">\n<em>Opinion on Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2N8\">Reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment on the \u00a7 103 defense was and is compelled because of legal error, because a first set of clearly correct and unchallenged findings requires that the conclusion of nonob-viousness, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> must remain untrammeled and because a second set of findings, some nonprobative, some clearly erroneous, is unable to support, intrinsically and in light of the first set, the district court\u2019s conclusion of obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-7\">The Background section of our earlier opinion noted error in the second set of findings but did not label it clearly erroneous, Rule 52(a), and did not expressly indicate that the noted error was not the basis for reversal set forth in the Opinion section, thus raising a question respecting the basis for our judgment. That circumstance, regrettable because it has delayed a just end to this litigation, is here rectified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-8\">On review of a judgment based on a conclusion of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, this court must consider not only whether there is legal error, but also whether the underlying findings are either nonprobative, or clearly erroneous, or both. If, unlike the present case, a district court had not made findings necessary to resolution of the \u00a7 103 question, and legal error were present, an appellate court would vacate in view of that legal error and remand for the district court to make the missing findings. <em>Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd., </em>781 F.2d 861, 872-75, 228 USPQ 90, 97-99 (Fed.Cir.1985). If unassailable findings were made but could not support the appealed judgment under a proper application of law, an appellate court may vacate or reverse, but not make its own findings. <em>Icicle Seafoods, Inc. v. Worthington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 106 S.Ct. 1527, 1530, 89 L.Ed.2d 739, 743 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-16\">If findings necessary to support a legal conclusion are clearly erroneous, the conclusion cannot stand. If those facts were such as to permit only one of two possibilities, or if the burden of proving those necessary facts had been on appellee, reversal would not mean the appellate court found facts in defiance of Rule 52(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If, unlike the present case, appellee did not bear the burden below, a remand-requiring fact-finding function might remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-17\">To obtain reversal without remand, an appellant-patentee must convince this court that the patent challenger failed at trial to carry its statutory burden, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, of proving by clear and convincing evidence sufficient facts to support the obviousness conclusion. One way to do that is to show that a proper application of the law to unassailable findings compels reversal. Another is to show that the findings on which the obviousness conclusion rested are clearly erroneous and that nothing of record warrants a further exercise of the fact-finding function or indicates any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>possibility that the appealed judgment might be sustained by such exercise. Because the record here establishes that appellant has made both showings, reversal is required and there is no basis for remanding the case for new findings by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-4\">In this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-5\">Part I supplies our opinion on the remand inquiry (\u201cthe degree to which the obviousness determination is one of fact\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-6\">Part II treats Rule 52(a)\u2019s applicability to \u00a7 103.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-7\">Part III examines the statutory burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-8\">Part IV describes inventor Caveney\u2019s inventions and the effect of his claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-9\">Part V discusses our earlier opinion and the district court\u2019s approach to resolution of the \u00a7 103 issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-10\">Part VI identifies the patent claims on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-11\">Part VII sets forth the district court\u2019s erroneous claim interpretations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-12\">Part VIII discusses the findings in general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-13\">Part IX reviews correct findings that compel a conclusion of nonobviousness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-14\">Part X reviews nonprobative and clearly erroneous findings that underlay the appealed judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-15\">The Appendix comments on parts of the Petition for Certiorari and Reply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1654-16\">\n<em>Part I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-17\">\n<em>The Obvious-Nonobvious Question is One of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-18\">\n<em>(a) Nature</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-19\">A \u00a7 103 determination involves fact and law. There may be these facts: what a prior art patent as a whole discloses; what it in fact disclosed to workers in the art; what differences exist between the entire prior art, or a whole prior art structure, and the whole claimed invention; what the differences enabled the claimed subject matter as a whole to achieve; that others for years sought and failed to arrive at the claimed invention; that one of those others copied it; that the invention met on its merits with outstanding commercial success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-23\">With the involved facts determined, the decisionmaker confronts a ghost, i.e., \u201ca person having ordinary skill in the art,\u201d not unlike the \u201creasonable man\u201d and other ghosts in the law. To reach a proper conclusion under \u00a7 103, the decisionmaker must step backward in time and into the shoes worn by that \u201cperson\u201d when the invention was unknown and just before it was made. In light of <em>all </em>the evidence, the decisionmaker must then determine whether the patent challenger has convincingly established, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious at <em>that </em>time to <em>that </em>person. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The answer to that question partakes more of the nature of law than of fact, for it is an ultimate conclusion based on a foundation formed of all the probative facts. If itself a fact, it would be part of its own foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-24\">When findings on the foundational facts were not clearly erroneous this court must then determine whether the \u00a7 103 answer of the district court is supportable by those findings. As with other statutes, that determination engages this court in an exercise legal in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-25\">\n<em>(b) Precedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-26\">The Supreme Court, the regional Circuit Courts of Appeals, and this court have consistently treated the question as one of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number><em>Graham\u2019s </em>statement, \u201cthe ultimate question of patent validity is one of law\u201d, has been widely interpreted as meaning that one answering the \u00a7 103 question is drawing a legal conclusion. And rightly so, because the validity issue in <em>Graham </em>turned on that answer and because of what the Court did in <em>Graham. </em>It disagreed with conclusions reached below, did not remand, described no finding as \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and did not mention Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-5\">The Court in <em>Graham </em>determined that the facts were (in No. 11) and were not (in Nos. 37 and 43) sufficient to support the lower courts\u2019 conclusions on the \u00a7 103 question. Similarly, unassailed and unassailable findings here compel our legal conclusion on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-6\">\n<em>(c) Scholars</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-7\">A survey of writings on \u201cthe vexing nature of the distinction between questions of fact and questions of law,\u201d <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 288, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1790, 72 L.Ed.2d 66, 79 (1982), would unduly lengthen this opinion. Scholars who have dealt with the obviousness question unanimously view it as one of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1655-8\">\n<em>(d) Effect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-9\">Like all legal conclusions, that under \u00a7 103 rests on a factual evidentiary foundation. As said in <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 693, 15 L.Ed.2d at 556, 148 USPQ at 467, the question is determined \u201cagainst\u201d the \u201cbackground\u201d of answers to factual inquiries, \u2014 a description of how legal questions are normally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-13\">One effect of considering the \u00a7 103 question one of law in this court is to facilitate a consistent application of that statute in the courts and in the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-14\">To contribute to consistency in construing \u00a7 103, this court has affirmed judgments while noting noncontrolling misstatements of law and cautioning counsel that judgments are appealed, not opinion language.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Controlling misstatements of the legal criteria applicable to \u00a7 103 determinations, present in the district court\u2019s opinion language in this case, confirm the certain presence of reversible legal error. <em>See </em>774 F.2d at 1091-1100, 227 USPQ at 342-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-15\">\n<em>(e) Decisional Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-16\">The decisional process en route to a \u00a7 103 conclusion involves more than answers to the fact inquiries in <em>Graham. </em>It also involves: (1) legal determinations; and (2) legal standards for fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-17\">\n<em>(1) Legal Determinations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-18\">Analysis begins with a key legal <em>question </em>\u2014 what is the invention claimed? Courts are required to view the claimed invention <em>as a whole. </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Claim interpretation, in light of the specification, claim language, other claims, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>prosecution history, is a matter of law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and will normally control the remainder of the decisional process. The district court\u2019s claim interpretation in this case constituted compound legal error not subject to Rule 52(a). <em>See </em>Part VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-4\">Another key preliminary legal inquiry is \u2014 what is the prior art? Before answering <em>Graham\u2019s </em>\u201ccontent\u201d inquiry, it must be known whether a patent or publication is in the prior art under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102, \u2014 a legal question.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, for example, the '869 tie was not prior art and the district court\u2019s primary reliance on it was legal error not subject to Rule 52(a). <em>See </em>Part X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-5\">\n<em>(2) Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-6\">Clarity in the law requires universal application of the same legal standards to fact-finding functions performed en route to final \u00a7 103 conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-7\">Among legal standards for determining <em>scope </em>and content of the prior art, for example, are: a prior patent must be considered in its entirety, i.e., as a <em>whole, </em>including portions that would lead away from the invention in suit, <em>W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 1540, 1550, 220 USPQ 303, 311 (Fed.Cir. 1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 851, 105 S.Ct. 172, 83 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984); elements of separate prior patents cannot be combined when there is no suggestion of such combination anywhere in those patents, <em>ACS Hospital Systems, Inc. v. Montefiore Hospital, </em>732 F.2d 1572, 1577, 221 USPQ 929, 933 (Fed.Cir.1984); and a court should avoid hindsight, <em>W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>721 F.2d at 1553, 220 USPQ at 313. Failure here to employ established legal standards led to the second set of findings nonprobative and clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a). <em>See </em>Part X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-12\">\n<em>Conclusion on Part I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-13\">A determination that an invention would have been obvious when it was made to one of ordinary skill in the art under \u00a7 103 is thus a conclusion of law based on fact. The \u201cdegree to which\u201d it is one of fact is solely that degree required to erect a foundation of facts capable of supporting the conclusion, those facts having been found by applying correct legal standards and expressed in findings free from clear error and based on clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-14\">A determination that an invention would not have been obvious when it was made to one of ordinary skill in the art is also a conclusion of law. At trial\u2019s outset, that conclusion is in place. <em>See </em>\u00a7 282 and Part III. The factual questions are those raised by the patent challenger in an effort to replace the existing with a contrary conclusion, and those, if any, raised by the patentee in rebuttal of the challenger\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-15\">\n<em>Part II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-16\">\n<em>Applicability of Rule 52(a) to the \u00a7 103 Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-17\"><em>Graham, Anderson,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rule 52(a), and the clearly erroneous standard have, before the remand, been consistently applied by this court in affirming judgments that upheld a patent and judgments that struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>down a patent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the case at bar, our earlier opinion having noted that reversal was required by legal error and the district court\u2019s correct and controlling findings on objective evidence of nonobviousness, explicit reference to Rule 52(a) was not made.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1657-5\">Rule 52(a) is applicable to all findings on the four inquiries listed in <em>Graham: </em>scope and content of prior art; differences between prior art and claimed invention; level of skill; and objective evidence (secondary considerations). The last may include: commercial success due to the invention; failure of others; long felt need; movement of the skilled in a different direction; skepticism of experts <em>(see United States v. Adams, </em>383 U.S. 39, 52, 86 S.Ct. 708, 714, 15 L.Ed.2d 572, 580, 148 USPQ 479, 484 (1966)); copying the invention in preference to the prior art <em>(see Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Rubber Tire Co., </em>220 U.S. 428, 441, 31 S.Ct. 444, 450, 55 L.Ed. 527, 534 (1911)); and other events proved to have actually happened in the real world (hence the description \u201cobjective\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1657-11\">Rule 52(a) is thus fully applicable to all findings on which the \u00a7 103 issue is decided, but findings must be made on, and the \u00a7 103 issue must be decided in light of, all the probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-12\">\n<em>Part III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-13\">\n<em>The Statutory Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-14\">It is neither necessary nor appropriate for a court to declare a patent valid.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A trial court is required by Congress, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, <em>supra </em>note 1, to say only whether the patent challenger carried its burden of establishing invalidity in the particular case before the court. 774 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>1096, 227 USPQ at 346. When the burden has not been carried, a court need only so state. When that burden has been carried, the court should declare the patent invalid. The <em>statute </em>makes a patent presumptively valid when issued and imposes the burden of establishing invalidity on the challenger.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is the judiciary\u2019s duty to follow statutes that requires a trial court lacking a conviction of obviousness to hold that the challenger\u2019s burden was not carried.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thereupon, the patent simply remains valid until another challenger carries the \u00a7 282 burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-4\">The presumption mandated by \u00a7 282 is applicable to all of the many bases for challenging a patent\u2019s validity. When, as here, the sole challenge is an allegation of obviousness, the presumption is that the invention would not have been obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-5\">A determination of anticipation under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 may be reached by comparing only the claims and a prior art disclosure submitted by the patent challenger. A determination that a patent challenger has not carried its \u00a7 282 burden under \u00a7 103 may be reached on consideration of only the evidence submitted by the patent challenger. A determination that a patent challenger has carried its burden of establishing obviousness under \u00a7 103, however, requires full consideration of any objective evidence of nonobviousness presented in rebuttal. That \u00a7 103 issue cannot fairly be decided on only one party\u2019s part of the evidence (e.g., patent challenger\u2019s prior art), while disregarding the compelling impact of the other party\u2019s part (e.g., patentee\u2019s objective evidence). Nor is there warrant for singling out \u00a7 103 as an area in which courts may disregard the probative force of any part of the evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1658-9\">As noted at 774 F.2d at 1099 n. 24, 227 USPQ at 349 n. 24, patent challenger Dennison told the trial court it should disregard the objective evidence of nonobviousness unless it were \u201cundecided\u201d after viewing only the prior art. Dennison mischaracterized this court\u2019s opinion in <em>W.L. Gore &amp; Associates v. Garlock, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 1540, 220 USPQ 303 (Fed.Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 851, 105 S.Ct. 172, 83 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984), as support for that misstatement of law. The district court accepted and applied that erroneous legal analysis. Thus the court decided on only part of the evidence, disregarded the controlling impact of its own unchallenged findings on the objective rebuttal evidence of nonobviousness (evidence that may be, as here, the <em>most </em>probative), and shifted the statutory burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-10\">One sued for patent infringement has over twenty possible defenses. Respecting the \u201cwould have been obvious\u201d defense, misperceptions in pre-1982 court opinions<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> have led this court to say the judicial process requires that a court withhold a conclusion of obviousness until it has fully assessed the impact of any objective evidence of nonobviousness. Only then can a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>court base its judgment, as it must, on <em>all </em>probative evidence of record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1659-4\">Consideration of all the evidence may or may not require a conclusion that what may appear obvious <em>to the </em>court<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> would not have been obvious (because for years it was not) to those of ordinary skill when the invention was made. When a district court has admitted evidence and made findings establishing nonobviousness, disregard of their legal impact is a jurisprudentially improper approach gravely damaging the concepts of fair trial and principled decision-making under the statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 103, 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-5\">This court\u2019s many judgments of patent invalidity show that \u00a7 282 and a requirement to consider all evidence do not unduly burden patent challengers. Nonobviousness evidence must be weighed along with closeness of the prior art and other eviden-tiary factors such as nexus with the claimed invention; see for example the discussion in cases in which this court has affirmed a district court\u2019s assignment of little weight to objective evidence that was insufficient for varying reasons.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1659-6\">The district court here recognized that the prior art was not close, expressly faulting Panduit for relying on that fact. <em>See supra </em>note 15 and 774 F.2d at 1089-90, 227 USPQ at 341. Evaluated under established legal standards, the prior art here was so remote as not to have suggested anything like the claimed inventions to those working for years and at great expense to design a successful cable tie. As discussed in our earlier opinion, the district court erred in holding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-11\">The strong evidence of nonobviousness, and its inescapable refutation of the view that the claimed inventions would have been obvious from the prior art, are what distinguish this case from some others. As the district court said, \u201cThis is a case which presents that issue [effect of nonobviousness evidence] as clearly as any I\u2019ve seen.\u201d That evidence, coupled with the remoteness of the prior art, also resolves in this case the \u201cdifficulties\u201d seen in <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S. at 18, 86 S.Ct. at 694, 15 L.Ed.2d at 556, 148 USPQ at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-12\">According to the uncontroverted evidence, with the prior art before its researchers for years, Dennison conducted a long, expensive research project and produced its \u201cladder\u201d tie, a tie entirely different from those of the claims in suit. Then, as the court found, Dennison copied Caveney\u2019s inventions. When sued, it resurrected that same art for litigation purposes, saying what it copied from Caveney had been obvious to Dennison all along. Even then, knowing from Caveney\u2019s patents where it wanted to go at trial, Dennison could only misconstrue the claims and reconstruct the prior art to make it look like what it copied. Dennison\u2019s obviousness defense is clearly refuted in this case by the unrefuted record of its own long and frustrating experience and that of others.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>Dennison clearly did not carry its \u00a7 282 burden of proving that Caveney\u2019s claimed inventions would have been obvious under \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-4\">\n<em>Part IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-5\"><em>Caveney\u2019s Inventions </em>\u2014 Effect <em>of His Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1660-6\">The drawings may be deceptive in seeming to show merely a simple, small, plastic tie.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The contrary, however, is established by the undisputed record, including the testimony of Dennison\u2019s own engineer witnesses quoted at 774 F.2d 1096, 227 USPQ 346, e.g., \u201ca good tie is a damn difficult thing to design, extremely difficult\u201d. Caveney\u2019s particular claimed cable ties constitute important contributions achieved not easily but only after years of effort and investment of a million research dollars,\u2014 and never achieved in years of research by Dennison, whose tie designs did not remotely resemble the claimed ties until it copied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-7\">It was undisputed that the ties of Cave-ney\u2019s \u2019538 patent, for example, are applied to groups of parallel cables by an installing machine, reliably and safely holding together the many cables in critical environments such as jet airliners. Caveney\u2019s contribution to the safety of the airline riding public is a social benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-8\">Though technology has burgeoned, the patent system is not limited to sophisticated technologies and powerful corporations. Nowhere in the statute or the Constitution is the patent system opened only to those who make complex inventions difficult for judges to understand and foreclosed to those who make less mysterious inventions a judge can understand after hearing, as here, the inventor\u2019s explanation of his invention and the engineering principles he employed. The constitutional purpose is to encourage disclosure of patentable contributions to \u201cprogress in the useful arts\u201d, <em>all </em>the useful arts, not just the esoteric. The statute requires utility, novelty, and nonobviousness, not complexity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-11\">That cable ties look alike to a casual observer who sees only straps, heads, and locking elements is not determinative. What is determinative and unchallenged on this record is that those elements were available to workers in the art for years before Caveney made his inventions (and remain available today). In viewing the prior art, the district court improperly treated all cable ties as virtually interchangeable (after hearing all about Cave-ney\u2019s inventions and then viewing the ease with which creative defense counsel reconstructed the prior art at his easel). The fact is clear and unchallenged on the record, however, that the crucial structural distinctions set forth in the claim limitations gave the claimed inventions the distinction that led the industry and Dennison to prefer Caveney\u2019s structure over anything in the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-12\">Dennison submitted no tests and no testimony challenging the superiority of the claimed ties found by the district court. Nor did it submit evidence that any prior cable tie suggested Caveney\u2019s crucial claimed structural limitations that accounted for the success of his inventions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1660-13\">The claims are not mere semantic exercises and the present inventions are not insignificant variations or innovations of a commonplace sort. <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S. at 16, 86 S.Ct. at 693, 15 L.Ed.2d at 555, 148 USPQ at 466. The district court found that Caveney achieved and disclosed a \u201cpreeminent commercial product\u201d long sought without success by others. Thus Caveney trod well the long and failure-strewn path not only to the Patent Office, <em>id. </em>at 19, 86 S.Ct. at 694, 15 L.Ed.2d at 557, 148 USPQ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>at 467, but to a successful and useful product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-5\">The sole effect of the grant to Caveney of the property right, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 261, to exclude others for a limited time from unauthorized use of his inventions is to require that others avoid the claimed structure newly disclosed to the public in the patent documents. Thus Caveney\u2019s claims do not remove existing knowledge from the public domain, for there was no such knowledge until Caveney disclosed it in his patents. Nor do those claims restrict access to materials earlier available, for those materials remain available. Contrary to the misstatement by Dennison to the trial court and to the Supreme Court, <em>see </em>Appendix, the patent law is and has always been clear, certain, and immutable that, during the short life of the patents in suit, Denni-son and all workers in the art remain perfectly free to employ and combine straps, heads, and pawls as those elements were before the Caveney inventions. They need only avoid Caveney\u2019s own novel combination and structure as claimed. <em>Connell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>722 F.2d 1542,1548, 220 USPQ 193, 198 (Fed.Cir.1983).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1661-6\">Under our economic and patent systems, valuation of the <em>worth </em>of an inventor\u2019s contribution is left to the public, <em>not </em>to the judiciary in determining patentability. A judge is nowhere authorized to declare a patent invalid on his or her personal evaluation. <em>Graham\u2019s </em>statement, \u201cemphasis on nonobviousness is one of inquiry, not quality,\u201d 383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 693,15 L.Ed.2d at 556,148 USPQ at 467, can be seen as a recognition that judges are not to decide whether <em>they </em>think a particular invention \u201cought\u201d to be patented. And that is well. Were it otherwise, a letter to the court would do, and trials, Title 35, and the PTO would be unnecessary.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1661-10\">Though not all inventions achieve public acceptance, many millions in annual sales ($50 million for Panduit alone), with accompanying taxes and jobs, resulted from Caveney\u2019s inventions in the hands of as-signee Panduit and admitted copier Denni-son. It is undisputed that Caveney\u2019s patented ties are novel and useful. The district court found that Caveney\u2019s \u2019538 tie leads the industry, and the unchallenged record shows the industry centering on Caveney\u2019s inventions, which made owner Panduit No. 1 and copier Dennison No. 2 or 3 in the industry. Caveney\u2019s inventions meet the constitutional purpose, for they are classic examples of what the Framers intended when they referred to \u201cProgress of ... useful Arts.\u201d U.S.Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-11\">\n<em>Part V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-12\"><em>This Court\u2019s Earlier Opinion </em>\u2014 District <em>Court\u2019s Approach</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1661-13\">In its earlier Opinion section, this court focused on the law governing obviousness and burden of proof, \u00a7\u00a7 103, 282, and on the impact of the district court\u2019s uncontest-ably<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> correct findings compelling a conclusion of nonobviousness. We expand, somewhat, that focus here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-14\">The law must be the same for all patents and types of inventions. A level playing ground for the marketplace of ideas is as necessary for technological innovation as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>is for politics and social policy. If the district court\u2019s decisional approach in this case were deemed permissible, it would defeat those goals, for it would destroy every patent, frustrate Congress\u2019 effort to effectuate its constitutionally granted power and the Framer\u2019s intent to promote progress in the useful arts, and disserve the nation\u2019s need to encourage research investment. It would also rend asunder the entire body of \u00a7 103 law established in this court\u2019s precedents since its creation on October 1, 1982.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1662-4\">No effective, uniform, reliable patent system could long survive if the law permitted a decisional approach to \u00a7 103 determinations like that here employed by the district court and suggested in Dennison\u2019s Petition for Certiorari: (1) interpreting claims by redrafting them to one word; (2) implying that that word describes the \u201cdifferences\u201d; (3) picking from a prior patent an item describable by that word (in effect finding <em>no </em>differences); (4) focusing on isolated minutiae in a prior art patent while disregarding its scope, i.e., its entire disclosure, and how its disclosed structure works; (5) making no finding of a suggestion (because there was no evidence thereof) that items found separately in prior patents could or should be shaped positioned, related, and combined as in the claim; (6) considering as prior art what was not; (7) considering not the problem solved by the invention (here a successful cable tie), but speculating on a \u201cproblem\u201d of how prior devices might be reconstructed to match the claimed structure, with the benefit of hindsight aided by the inventor\u2019s engineering testimony about the inventions in suit;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (8) determining, years later, that an invention had been obvious all along from the prior art to one of ordinary skill, in the face of a conclusive finding that it had not, and thus would not have, been obvious from that same art to others, including the many highly skilled engineer-cable designers of Panduit and Dennison who had diligently tried and failed for years, at great expense, to design a successful cable tie; (9) disregarding the impact on the \u00a7 103 conclusion of the unchallenged finding that others aware of the prior art, including the infringer\u2019s cable tie designers, did not find the claimed inventions obvious but were proceeding in directions entirely different from that of the inventor; (10) disregarding the impact on the obviousness conclusion of the unchallenged conclusive evidence that the infringer, with the prior art before it, after years of research (during which, as its own witness said, it was \u201ctantalizingly close,\u201d 774 F.2d at 1096, 227 USPQ at 346), and after patenting many of its entirely different \u201cladder\u201d type ties, did not find the inventions obvious but deemed it necessary to study Caveney\u2019s patents and, as the court unequivocally found, \u201cfinally came up with\u201d its copy of the inventions; and (11) holding an invention obvious on the basis of \u201cengineering principles\u201d taught the court by the inventor and a subjective view of \u201ccommon experience\u201d in the face of its own unchallenged finding that the same \u201cprinciples/experience\u201d did not make that invention obvious to others who, with the prior art before them, went for years in other directions, which others included the highly skilled engineers at Panduit and Dennison who were fully aware of those same principles and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>had even more relevant experience in the art.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-4\">Virtually all inventions are necessarily combinations of old elements.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The notion, therefore, that combination claims can be declared invalid merely upon finding similar elements in separate prior patents would necessarily destroy virtually all patents and cannot be the law under the statute, \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-5\">As explained in our earlier opinion and more fully here, <em>see </em>Parts III, IX, the district court\u2019s finding that Dennison's effort to carry its \u00a7 282 burden with clear and convincing evidence left \u201croom for some difference of opinion,\u201d <em>see </em>Part IX, should have ended the obviousness inquiry, and, infringement having been conceded, should have resulted in judgment for Panduit. In holding otherwise, the court gave but lip service to \u00a7 282 and effectively transferred the burden of proof fixed by the statute.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAD\">\n<em>Part VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aa7-dedup-0\">\n<em>The Claims Identified</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-12\">The parties stipulated that decision on validity of four \u201crepresentative\u201d claims would be determinative for all. Trial was conducted on only those four claims. Only three of those claims were considered by this court on appeal.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-13\">The district court, in \u201cSupplemental Findings and Conclusions\u201d prepared by Denni-son, listed 30 claims as \u201ctried to the court.\u201d (See the Appendix for Dennison\u2019s presentation to the Supreme Court of claim 26, which was listed but was <em>not </em>among the four \u201crepresentative\u201d claims tried to the court and was <em>not presented to this court.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1664-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>\n<em>Part VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-4\">\n<em>Erroneous Claim Interpretations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-5\">In interpreting the claims, the district court committed fundamental legal error when it analyzed each by a single word description of one part of the claimed tie. In patent law, a word (\u201cteeth\u201d; \u201chinge\u201d; \u201cledge\u201d) means nothing outside the claim and the description in the specification. A disregard of claim limitations, as here, would render claim examination in the PTO meaningless. If, without basis in the record, courts may so rewrite claims, the entire statutory-regulatory structure that governs the drafting, submission, examination, allowance, and enforceability of claims would crumble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-6\">The court\u2019s interpretations were doubly contrary to Congress\u2019 statutory scheme. First, the claim must particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. Second, the \u201csubject matter\u201d that must have been obvious to deny patentability under \u00a7 103 is the entirety of the claimed invention, a concept Congress nailed down with the next statutory phrase \u201cas a whole\u201d.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1664-7\">When the prior art is compared with erroneously interpreted claims, findings of differences between the prior art and the claims will necessarily be clearly erroneous. When the sole error lies in claim interpretation, a remand for comparison of the prior art with properly interpreted claims is required. Here, however, the error occurred also in: disregard of clear findings of such legal significance as to have left undisturbed the presumption of nonobviousness that attached when the patents issued; the application under \u00a7 103 of erroneous criteria, <em>see </em>Parts V, IX; and reliance on prior art so remote from the properly interpreted claims at issue as to preclude a conclusion of obviousness from that art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-11\">The district court erroneously interpreted claim 24 of the \u2019146 patent as drawn only to multiple \u201cteeth\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1664-12\">I conclude that this [claim limitations] is a description of one element, not three.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amf-dedup-0\">The district court erroneously interpreted claim 1 of the \u2019538 patent<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> as drawn only to a \u201chinge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1664-13\">And that is the essence of '538 patent, the discrete hinge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1664-14\">The district court erroneously interpreted Claim 10 of the \u2019869 patent as drawn only to a \u201cledge\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1664-15\">It seems to me, and I so find, that to increase the compressive strength of the cable tie, and specifically the pawl and hinge of the cable tie, you would set the pawl on a ledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1664-16\">The district court improperly dismissed the novel structural claim limitations that defined the disposition, positioning, relationship, and operation of the elements in the claims. The ignored claim limitations, however, define crucial structural elements of the invention as a whole, and clearly distinguish (and bind the inventor to the distinction) the whole claimed device from those in prior patents. The prosecution history and the 15 prior patents cited in the PTO establish that no claim was allowed on the mere presence of multiple \u201cteeth\u201d,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>of a \u201chinge\u201d, or of a \u201cledge\u201d. The claims, with their present detailed content, resulted from extensive interaction with the Patent Examiner. The district court pointed to nothing in the prior art that suggested any of the <em>claimed </em>constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-5\">Interpreted in the light of the specification, claim language, prosecution history, and the other claims, the claims at bar are drawn to entire combinations as set forth at 774 F.2d 1102-04, 227 USPQ 531-52. Each of the numerous limitations of each claim was fully considered in the PTO. If Dennison had avoided in its ties the presence of any <em>one </em>limitation in a claim, it would have avoided infringement of that claim. It was a clear error of law for the district court to have ignored the limitations clearly set forth in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-6\">\n<em>Part VIII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-7\">\n<em>The Findings In General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"akk-dedup-0\">As above indicated, the district court\u2019s opinion indicates that it made two sets of findings. It referred to its reality-based first set (clear, fully supported findings on undisputed concrete objective real-world evidence of nonobviousness) not in terms of its operative legal significance, but only in terms of the uncertainty that set created. <em>See </em>Part IX. It decided the issue on its speculation-based second set (nonprobative and clearly erroneous findings on prior art modified by Dennison and disputed by Pan-duit at trial). <em>See </em>Part X.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-8\">We cannot see why the district court\u2019s first set of findings did not require a conclusion that Caveney\u2019s inventions, which had for years escaped others who sought them, \u201cwould not have been obvious\u201d under \u00a7 103; nor why Panduit and Dennison wasted research resources for years if Caveney\u2019s inventions were obvious to all throughout those years; nor how the prior art made Caveney\u2019s eminently successful inventions obvious to the court in 1984 when it had not made them obvious to skilled engineers (each more skilled than the \u201cordinary mechanic\u201d referred to in <em>Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, </em>52 U.S. (11 How.) 261, 13 L.Ed. 683 (1851)) who had been designing unsuccessful or far less successful cable ties for years when Caveney\u2019s inventions were made in the 1960\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-12\">The district court did deal with the six most relevant patents (all but one were cited by the Patent Examiner). Not one of those patents, however, disclosed a tie remotely approaching the structure or success of the claimed ties. Not one disclosed or suggested all the claimed structural limitations. Not one disclosed or suggested Caveney\u2019s claimed combinations. Not one disclosed teeth, a hinge, or a ledge <em>as claimed. </em>Nor was there evidence or finding that the patents together suggested the claimed combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-13\">Though the district court said it \u201cfound\u201d the combination obvious, the sole support for that \u201cfinding\u201d (sic, conclusion) was the presence in separate prior patents of individual elements differing greatly in shape, position, relation, combination, and function. In relying thereon, the court made a fundamental mistake. A holding of invalidity on that basis, as above indicated, is contrary to statute and would defeat the congressional purpose in enacting Title 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-14\">Indeed, that the elements noted by the court lay about in the prior art available for years to all skilled workers, without, as the court found, suggesting anything like the claimed inventions, is itself evidence of nonobviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1665-15\">The district court did not follow established legal standards (Part I) in finding the content of the prior art. 774 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>1087-89, 227 USPQ at 339-41. It treated no claim, nor the entire prior art, nor any prior patent \u201cas a whole,\u201d but selected bits and pieces from prior patents that might be modified to fit its legally incorrect interpretation of each claim as consisting of one word.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1666-4\">Instead of making express findings on the structural differences as <em>claimed, </em>the district court took the <em>legal </em>steps of erroneously interpreting: the \u2019146 claim as a one-word (teeth) \u201csolution\u201d to a \u201cproblem\u201d (looseness) not disclosed in the Emery patent; the \u2019869 claim as a one-word (ledge) \u201csolution\u201d to a \u201cproblem\u201d (compression) not disclosed in any prior patent; and the \u2019538 claim as a one-word (hinge) \u201csolution\u201d to a \u201cproblem\u201d (rigidity) it saw in the <em>nonprior-art </em>tie of the \u2019869 patent, a tie that <em>did not exist </em>when the invention defined in the \u2019538 claim was made.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1666-5\">The court specifically found, <em>see </em>Part IX, that Caveney\u2019s patents disclosed the best ties in the art. It then spoke of \u201canalogous\u201d items, \u201cexpected results\u201d from \u201cordinary steps,\u201d \u201cengineering principles,\u201d and \u201ccommon experience.\u201d It nowhere reconciled those evaluations with its contrary findings that no one skilled in the art had for years been led to those evaluations by the prior art. The court\u2019s treatment emasculated the crucial, critically important <em>structural limitations </em>that distinguish the claimed inventions from the prior art and that were the key to success of Caveney\u2019s inventions.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1666-9\">\n<em>Part IX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-10\">\n<em>Findings On the Evidence of Nono bviousness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-11\">As recognized by this court and by the Supreme Court in the remand, the district court did articulate much of the correct approach. The court also said \u201cI have done everything I am supposed to do.\u201d The court\u2019s characterization of its action, and its statement that it knew of the presumption of validity, are not findings and not subject to Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-12\">As noted in our earlier opinion, in any event, the court totally <em>abandoned </em>the approach it had articulated. With admirable candor, the court expressed the uncertainty created by the conflict between its conclusion and its clear findings on the evidence of nonobviousness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1666-13\">Now I want to return to where I started and say that I think Mr. Caveney and Mr. Moody and Panduit have designed and perfected an excellent and, indeed, preeminent commercial product, and the fact that they have done so contributed greatly to the difficulty of this case. <em>It is not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number><em>easy to find something obvious </em>in the face of those facts. And <em>I do so with great reluctance and great resistance. </em>And in fact <em>I have been going back and forth </em>on this thing in my mind throughout the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-4\">It gives me <em>great comfort to know that I am just the first stop </em>on this trip. Everything I have said here <em>can be analyzed just as well by the Court of Appeals </em>for the Federal Circuit.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> All the documents are here, the testimony is there for them to read, and if they come to a different conclusion than I, so be it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-5\">This is a case in which the credibility of the witnesses has really played a very small part. It is primarily, it seems to me, a matter of applying your experience to the undisputed facts. It\u2019s a matter of <em>interpretation. </em>What do these things teach? <em>What would they teach </em>a person of ordinary skill in the art? <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-7\">I think there is <em>room for some difference of opinion </em>here based largely upon those secondary considerations that have <em>given me such trouble in this case: </em>failure by others, copying by Dennison, and unquestioned commercial success of the plaintiff.

Nor did the court succeed in the difficult task of cast<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>ing its mind back into that of a person of ordinary skill in the art who had <em>no prek-nowledge </em>of the crucial structural differences that vitalize Caveney\u2019s inventions. That person would not have ignored how the devices disclosed in the prior patents worked, or the rigidity of the pawl in Fein, or the releaseability of the pawls in Litwin and the Japanese patents, or the absence of wedging or an abutment wall or anything but air opposing the teeth in Fein and Litwin, or the absence of anything in Emery to suggest a design the court found so much better than what Emery disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-4\">Because the district court\u2019s opinion is an admixture of claim mis-interpretation and fact finding without express reference to \u201cdifferences\u201d, it is necessary to glean those portions that may be treated as implied findings on the differences.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As above indicated, erroneous claim interpretations led the district court to implied findings that the difference re claim 24 was only multiple teeth in any arrangement, re claim 6 was only a hinge of any type or sort, and re claim 10 was anything that could be called a ledge, but whether a prior patent showed some sort of teeth, or hinge, or ledge, is alone legally insignificant and non-probative in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-5\">Beyond the nonprobative findings, there were these additional \u201cfindings\u201d, that were clearly erroneous:<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1668-6\">\n<em>The \u2019146 Patent</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1668-7\">\u201cThe problem presented by Emery was the so called release problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1668-8\">No problem at all is presented in the Emery patent. Like all inventors, Emery presented his invention as flawless. Problems with the Emery tie itself were not seen until years after the patent issued, and, as indicated below, those directly concerned (the distributor and manufacturer of the Emery tie) saw the problem and its solution as entirely distinct from that envisioned by the court and entirely distinct from Caveney's invention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1668-12\">\u201c[T]he text of Emery makes abundantly clear that Emery\u2019s intention was to achieve wedging against the abutment wall ... inside the head____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1668-13\">That the Emery patent <em>as a whole </em>disclosed to those skilled in the art a pawl that extends outside the head in use is necessarily confirmed by the unchallengeable documentary evidence of the Orban patent, the Bourne patent, and the latter\u2019s prosecution history, which together refute defense counsel\u2019s argument that Figure 2 was a \u201cdraftsman\u2019s error.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1668-14\">Two years after the Emery patent issued, the <em>distributor </em>of the Emery patent tie filed application for the Orban patent. That application and patent described the problem with the Emery tie as <em>the cutting off of the chisel edge </em>(one tooth) when, as was common practice, the protruding strap was cut off. That could happen only if the one tooth were outside the head in use as shown in Figure 2. The distributor\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d, as Dennison\u2019s expert testified, was to raise the end wall of the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-15\">Four years after the Emery patent issued, the <em>manufacturer </em>of the Emery tie further confirmed that the patent as a whole disclosed the pawl outside the head in use. In prosecuting the application filed for the Bourne patent, the manufacturer\u2019s attorney told the PTO that the problem with the Emery tie (at even that late date) was \u201cbending of the pawl and tongue [strap] in opposite directions.\u201d That could happen only if Emery\u2019s pawl was outside the head in use as shown in Figure 2. The manufacturer\u2019s \u201csolution\u201d was to keep the pawl inside the head at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>Dennison has not mentioned to us the purpose or function of the serrations (teeth) on the curved surface of Emery\u2019s pawl. It was able to get its expert witness to say only that one might <em>force </em>the Emery pawl <em>back </em>into the head if one applied enough load to bend the end wall, but then it might fall through the head.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A80\">\u201cAnd in order to achieve the parallel kind of relationship between the pawl and the abutment wall that will be necessary for effective wedging, it follows that the teeth of the pawl must be in a straight line and equidistant from the surface of the abutment wall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1669-5\">The district court learned that effective wedging required a parallel-straightline-equidistant relationship only from Cave-ney\u2019s engineering testimony, and from the hindsight reconstruction of the prior art by Dennison\u2019s witness, not from the Emery patent or from any other prior art patent. Dennison, and others the court found were going in different directions, did not learn this from anything in the prior art and the court cited no prior art basis for its statement. As a finding on the prior art, the statement is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-6\">\n<em>The \u2019538 Patent</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1669-7\">\u201cNow the \u2019869 patent had its own problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1669-9\">\u201cNow, there are numerous examples in the prior art of hinges and discrete hinges of the kind claimed in the \u2019538 patent. The web in Emery is one example. Lit-win has a hinge. Fein, if hinging is a matter of degree, has a hinge, and I refer to Column 2, Line 37 of Fein.\u201d \u201cA contemporaneous development that is pertinent is the Bourne patent that had a discrete hinge\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1669-10\">I find nothing in the \u2019538 patent, or at least claim 1 thereof, other than a discrete hinge, that is new over the \u2019869 patent.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1669-11\">This and the court\u2019s extended ensuing discussion of the \u2019538 invention in light of \u2019869 \u201cproblems\u201d are simply irrelevant. Neither the \u2019869 patent nor the \u2019869 invention <em>existed </em>when the \u2019538 invention was made. The \u2019869 invention was the <em>last </em>made of all inventions before the court. It is prior art to nothing in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-12\">It is clear on the face of Emery, Litwin, Fein, Bourne, and the \u2019146 patent that no hinge remotely \u201cof the kind claimed in the \u2019538 patent\u201d is shown or suggested in the drawings or specifications of any of those patents. On appeal, Dennison made no effort to support this finding. At trial, it abandoned Bourne in view of the PX 77 showing that Bourne disclosed no hinge. Uncontroverted exhibits PX 68, 14D established that Fein disclosed no hinge, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>its incomprehensible reference to \u201cflexibility pivotable ratchet buckle.\u201d It is undisputed that the Emery and \u2019146 hinges were horizontal and in shear. The finding that the prior art disclosed a hinge of the kind claimed is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-4\">\n<em>The \u2019869 Patent</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1670-5\">\u201cThe problem addressed by that [\u2019869] patent was insufficient strength in compression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1670-6\">\u201cThe Japanese patent and the Litwin patent, which are prior art to the \u2019869 patent, also showed structures analogous to the \u2019869 ledge in that they absorbed compressive force, force exerted by the strap as it was tightened about the bundle.\u201d \u201cBut I, nonetheless, find the \u2019869 patent to be obvious both on general principles of physics and in light of the Japanese patent and the Litwin patent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1670-7\">There is not a word in the \u2019869 patent about compression, or about any \u201cproblem\u201d of \u201cinsufficient strength,\u201d in compression or otherwise. Nor is there a word about absorbing compressive force. The court was here repeating back to Caveney his engineering testimony on the advantages achieved by the structural distinctions in the claim. The court then turned to its legally improper and impossible \u201cgeneral principles\u201d standard of patentability. <em>See </em>774 F.2d at 1097-98, 227 USPQ at 347-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-8\">The Japanese and Litwin patents disclosed structures entirely distinct from and nonsuggestive of the ledge and pawl structure set forth in claim 10. Both disclosed releasable pawls. Neither disclosed a ledge and pawl inside a frame. Whether those patents showed structures \u201canalogous\u201d because something in them \u201cabsorbed compressive force\u201d is irrelevant, claim 10 being drawn to an entirely different <em>structure, </em>not to \u201cabsorbing compressive force.\u201d If the court\u2019s discussion be considered an implied finding that the content of the Japanese and Litwin patents constitute disclosures capable of rendering obvious the invention set forth in claim 10, such a finding would be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-10\">The portion of the district court\u2019s judgment rejecting Dennison\u2019s defense under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g) is <em>affirmed. </em>The portion of the district court\u2019s judgment upholding Dennison\u2019s defense under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 is <em>reversed. </em>The case is <em>remanded </em>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-12\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-13\">Dennison\u2019s Petition for Certiorari and Reply ignored our earlier opinion\u2019s explication of legal error and need to consider all evidence, presented material for the first time, and repeated misstatements of law Dennison employed in the trial court but avoided before this court.

The numerous nonrepresentative claims were never presented to or discussed by the trial court or this court. Our judgment is necessarily limited to the three claims considered on appeal and included in the appendix at 774 F.2d 1102-04, 227 USPQ 351-52. (Claim 1 of the \u2019538 patent was added because claim 6 includes all limitations of claim 1.)

It would become meaningful only if claim 1 were invalid and the added limitation were relied on for patentability. That one limitation in claim 6 is shown in a prior patent does not render the entire claim invalid.

Unlike <em>Graham, </em>all prior art patents dealt with here by the court had been cited against one or more of Caveney\u2019s patents by the Examiner in the PTO (except the even more remote Japanese patent). The district court said that if it were right and the Examiner wrong, that may be because the Examiner was confused by the eight applications filed by Panduit over two years as listed in DX 60. In 1985, the large examining corps disposed of 128,721 applications, an average of less than two applications per Examiner per week. Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, 1985 Annual Report 21, 44. The conjecture on Examiner confusion is unwarranted and unsupported. As indicated at 774 F.2d 1094, 227 USPQ 345, the difference between the court and the Examiner in this case lies in adherence by the latter to the statute and legal standards for evaluating prior patents and claimed inventions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1666-7\">. The '869 invention was made after the '538 invention. The applications for those patents were filed within a five-day period, but the '869 patent issued first. That and presentation at trial of the '869 patent before the \u2019538 patent appear the basis for the district court\u2019s mistake. Though legally improper under \u00a7 102, the district court's treatment is of interest on a different plane. When the '869 patent issued, Denni-son copied it. PX 12. When the '538 patent issued, over <em>four years later, </em>Dennison copied that. PX 13. What the district court saw as obvious in the '538 patent was thus clearly shown not to have been obvious to Dennison\u2019s engineers over those four years. It simply makes no sense, under the law or the evidence, to say the \u2019538 invention would have been obvious in light of the '869 patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1666-15\">. In resting its conclusion on speculation about how the skilled <em>would </em>employ \u201cengineering principles\" and \u201ccommon experience,\u201d in the face of irrefragable proof that they did not for years so employ them, the court approached the area foreclosed by the last sentence of \u00a7 103, \"Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1667-21\">. Despite the district court\u2019s invitation to analyze and come to a different conclusion, we do not here merely accept its first set of findings and reject its second set as clearly erroneous. Findings in the second set that this patent disclosed teeth and that disclosed a hinge need not be set aside and may be accepted without effect on the present result, for those findings were legally nonprobative in this case. We hold that the first set so firmly establish nonobviousness in this case as to have precluded the conclusion and judgment based on the second, legally insignificant set. In sum, we hold the district court in its findings \"was right the first time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b1667-22\">. Determination of what a patent teaches is fact finding, not interpretation. <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S. at 17, 86 S.Ct. at 693, 15 L.Ed.2d at 556, 148 USPQ at 467. A patent either discloses something or it does not. Moreover, speculation on what prior patents \"would\u201d teach is unnecessary in this case, where the trial court unequivocally and correctly <em>found </em>that they <em>had not </em>for many years taught or suggested anything like the claimed inventions to others who were going in other directions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1668-9\">. There are no \"findings\u201d on content of the prior art or on \"differences\" in the Supplemental Findings and Conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1668-10\">. It would unduly lengthen this opinion to list every clearly erroneous finding. Because findings of the district court were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d within the meaning of Rule 52, we \u201cset them aside\u201d. <em>Icicle Seafoods, Inc. v. Worthing-ton, </em>\u2014 U:S.-,-, 106 S.Ct. 1527, 1530, 89 L.Ed.2d 739, 743 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b1668-18\">. The Orban and Bourne patents are not prior art to Caveney's T46 patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b1669-8\">. In its Petition for Certiorari, Dennison made much of this court\u2019s reference, in footnote 5 of our earlier opinion, to the district court\u2019s evaluation of the Emery patent disclosure. Had that footnote controlled our earlier decision, we should have said what is said here, pointing out that the district court\u2019s evaluation was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the unchallenged documentary and testimonial evidence, that, though there was evidence to support its evaluation, we were left on the entire evidence with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been committed, <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746, 765 (1948), and that the evaluation [finding] was therefore \"clearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a). Dennison\u2019s Petition also quoted a colloquy in which Panduit\u2019s counsel said it is possible to read Emery as suggesting wedging against the abutment wall, but that a more <em>reasonable </em>and <em>fair </em>interpretation was one consistent with the drawing. The colloquy is not evidence, and cannot overcome the documentary evidence that those most familiar with the Emery patent tie (and not at the time engaged in this litigation) filed for patents on their own solutions to Emery\u2019s \"outside the head\u201d pawl long after the Emery patent issued. There are not, therefore, \"two permissible views of the evidence\u201d to which this court would apply the injunction of <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518, 528 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b1669-14\">. The '869 invention was not prior art to the invention claimed in the '538 patent, and the '538 invention was not prior art to the invention claimed in the '869 patent. Both inventions were made by the same inventive entity and the applications were copending, having been filed within five days of each other. <em>In re Land, </em>368 F.2d 866, 880, 54 CCPA 806, 825, 151 USPQ 621, 634 (1966). <em>See generally </em>1 D.
