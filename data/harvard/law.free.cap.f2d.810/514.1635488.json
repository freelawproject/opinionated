We affirm the district court's dismissal of the city of San Antonio but remand for consideration of Palmer\u2019s claim against defendant Williamson in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">A dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted cannot be upheld \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). In reviewing such a dismissal, we must examine only the pleadings, accept the factual averments as true, and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Rankin v. City of Wichita Falls, Texas, </em>762 F.2d 444, 446 (5th Cir. 1985). We set out the facts of the case using these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">On July 17, 1983, Palmer was driving an automobile with a passenger in Converse, Texas, when officers Michael Williamson (Williamson) and Harold Bellamy (Bellamy) of the San Antonio police department attempted to stop Palmer\u2019s automobile for allegedly disrupting and endangering the neighborhood by squealing tire noise and speeding. Williamson and Bellamy were both off duty at the time in question. Williamson, dressed in a bathing suit and carrying a pistol, jumped into the street in front of Palmer\u2019s automobile. Ballamy remained off the street. When Palmer tried to get away, Williamson tried to grab him through the window of the automobile while pointing his pistol at him. As Palmer left the scene in his automobile, Williamson fired his pistol at Palmer and hit the left side of Palmer\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Palmer stopped his automobile about a mile later in order to inspect it. As he started to return to the scene to find out who had shot at him, a truck suddenly blocked his automobile. Apparently, Williamson had commandeered a truck to follow Palmer\u2019s automobile. With his gun drawn, Williamson then pulled Palmer from the automobile. Palmer was arrested by the city of Converse police and charged with public intoxication and assault with a motor vehicle. As Palmer was 16 years old he was tried in Juvenile Court. He was convicted of engaging in delinquent conduct, but that judgment was reversed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Subsequently, Palmer filed a complaint in federal court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the city of San Antonio and police officers Williamson and Bellamy alleging a violation of his constitutional rights. The district court dismissed the complaint on the basis that Palmer had only sued the police officers in their official capacity and that Palmer had not alleged any policy or custom of the city of San Antonio that had caused him to be deprived of a federal or constitutional right. Palmer subsequently filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">In his amended complaint, Palmer alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">The Defendant police officers of the Defendant CITY OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, engaged in the following practices, so common and well settled, of using unnecessary physical force when arresting persons, and of unauthorized and improper discharge of firearms; that the Defendant CITY OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, knew or should have known of the conduct of their police officers, yet with deliberate indifference and gross negligence failed to provide proper training to its officers, and/or take disciplinary measures; and that the Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ant CITY OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, impliedly or tacitly authorized, approved or encouraged such conduct of its police officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In <em>Webster v. City of Houston, </em>735 F.2d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc), we established a standard to govern the imposition of municipal liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">A municipality is liable under \u00a7 1983 for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution or federal laws that is inflicted pursuant to official policy. Official policy is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">1. A policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision that is officially adopted and promulgated by the municipality\u2019s lawmaking officers or by an official to whom the lawmakers have delegated policy-making authority; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">2. A persistent widespread practice of city officials or employees, which, although not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy. Actual or constructive knowledge of such custom must be attributable to the governing body of the municipality or to an official to whom that body had delegated policy-making authority. Actions of officers or employees of a municipality do not render the municipality liable under \u00a7 1983 unless they execute official policy as above defined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">More specifically, Palmer must identify \u201c(1) a policy (2) of the city\u2019s policymaker (3) that caused (4) the plaintiff to be subjected to a deprivation of constitutional right.\u201d <em>Grandstaff v. City of Borger, Texas, </em>767 F.2d 161, 169 (5th Cir.1985). Similarly, an isolated incident is not sufficient to show that a custom exists. As we stated in <em>Bennett v. City of Slidell, </em>728 F.2d 762, 768 n. 3 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>472 U.S. 1016, 105 S.Ct. 3476, 87 L.Ed.2d 612 (1985): \u201cIsolated violations are not the persistent, often repeated, constant violations that constitute custom and policy.\u201d The Supreme Court has elaborated on the causal requirement by holding that the connection must be more than de facto; the policy or custom must be \u201cthe moving force of the constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Monell v. New York City Dept, of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). <em>See also City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. 808, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 2433-34, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Palmer alleges that the actions of Williamson and Bellamy reflect a policy of inadequate training on the part of the city of San Antonio, that the city policy caused the police officers to violate his rights, and thus that the city is liable under section 1983. In <em>Grandstaff, </em>however, we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">[a]n \u201cinadequate\u201d training program alone is not ordinarily the moving force behind an injured plaintiff\u2019s harm, because the police officer who injures the plaintiff does not rely upon inadequate training as tacit approval of his conduct. It is not enough that the city could, but does not, reduce the risk of harm to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">767 F.2d at 169. If, however, the police officers know at the time they act that the use of excessive force when arresting persons will meet with the approval of city policymakers, then the causation requirement has been met. <em>Grandstaff, </em>767 F.2d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">We have also consistently required a section 1983 plaintiff to state specific facts and not merely conclusory allegations. <em>Elliot v. Perez, </em>751 F.2d 1472, 1479 &amp; n. 20 (5th Cir.1985) (citing cases). While it might be possible that a basis for municipal liability exists in this case, Palmer states no facts in his complaint to support his assertion that San Antonio authorized and approved the practice of its police officers using excessive force when making arrests or that such a well settled practice of doing so existed. Although Palmer has already amended his complaint once, the complaint still fails to meet the requirements of <em>Elliot. </em>As we have made clear, the assertion of a single incident is not sufficient to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>that a policy or custom exists on the part of a municipality. <em>Slidell, 728 F.2d </em>at 768 n. 3. Palmer failed to allege that there are prior incidents which, if taken as true, would reveal the existence of an unconstitutional custom on the part of San Antonio. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of dismissal with respect to the city of San Antonio.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">After finding that Palmer failed to specify a policy or custom of San Antonio which would make the city liable under section 1983, the district court dismissed the complaint. Although admittedly Palmer\u2019s complaint was not as artfully drafted as it should have been, we believe that the district court erred in not also evaluating Palmer\u2019s complaint as a section 1983 action against Williamson and Bellamy individually-</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Paragraph VII of Palmer\u2019s amended complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">Each and all of the acts of the Defendants alleged herein were done by the Defendants, and each of them, not as individuals, but under the color and pretense of the statutes, ordinances, regulations, custom and usage of the State of Texas, the City of San Antonio, and the County of Bexar, and under the authority of their office as policemen of such city.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The district court interpreted this paragraph as alleging acts by the defendant officers in their official capacities as employees of the city of San Antonio only, thus requiring a specific allegation of a constitutionally deficient policy or custom of the city. It apparently reached this conclusion because paragraph VII of the complaint states that the acts were done \"... not as individuals ... \u201d. The difficulty with the district court\u2019s interpretation is that an examination of Palmer\u2019s complaint as a whole and other papers filed with the district court and this court indicate that Palmer\u2019s complaint could be read to allege an action against the officers individually in addition to alleging an action against the officers in their official capacities. <em>See also </em>note 2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">In his memorandum in support of his motion to set aside the district court\u2019s dismissal order, Palmer appears to separately raise the question of the police officers\u2019 individual liability under section 1983 from the question of the city\u2019s liability. The case Palmer cites, <em>Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980), involved an individual\u2019s liability under section 1983 and not the question of a municipality\u2019s liability. Moreover, in his brief to this court, Palmer notes that he \u201calleges that [appellees deprived him of a federal right by firing a pistol at [appellant; pointing a pistol at [appellant\u2019s head; and using unnecessary excessive force at the arrest of [appellant.\u201d Palmer appears to be asserting that the individual police officers as well as the city of San Antonio are liable under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(f) mandates that we construe complaints liberally \u201cas to do substantial justice.\u201d <em>See generally </em>5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1215-16 (1969). In light of this standard, we believe that the district court should have construed Palmer\u2019s complaint as asserting that both the individual officers and the city of San Antonio were liable under section 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, if the requirements of <em>Elliot </em>are met, we must remand the case so that the district court can consider Palmer\u2019s complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>against the officers in their individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">With regard to defendant Williamson, Palmer has set forth specific facts which satisfy the requirements of <em>Elliot. </em>Paragraph VIII of his complaint sets out in detail the actions of Williamson which allegedly violated Palmer\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court on remand must consider Palmer\u2019s action against Williamson in his individual capacity. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The only mention of defendant Bellamy\u2019s actions, however, also occurs in Paragraph VIII of Palmer\u2019s complaint. Palmer merely asserts that Bellamy \u201cattempted to stop plaintiff\u2019s automobile.\u201d The rest of the facts he sets out refer only to defendant Williamson. We do not feel this satisfies Palmer\u2019s burden to state specific facts under <em>Elliot. </em>Palmer states no facts in his complaint which indicate how Bellamy violated any of his rights. <em>Cf. Hanson v. Town of Flower Mound, </em>679 F.2d 497, 504 (5th Cir.1982) (no allegation contained in complaint that car was stopped without probable cause; court properly dismissed section 1988 claim based on legality of search since \u201cpleader must allege facts, not legal conclusions.\u201d) Consequently, the district court on remand can dismiss Palmer\u2019s section 1983 action against Bellamy in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order of dismissal with respect to the city of San Antonio; we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order of dismissal with respect to officers Williamson and Bellamy; and we REMAND the case to the district court so the court can consider Palmer\u2019s complaint against Williamson and Bellamy in their individual capacities consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. Section 1983 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">Every person who under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. For the purposes of this action any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Section 1983 is not itself a jurisdictional statute but instead merely creates a cause of action. <em>Hanson v. Town of Flower Mound, </em>679 F.2d 497, 504 n. 12 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\">. As further support for our view that the district court should have construed Palmer\u2019s complaint as asserting a cause of action against the officers in their individual capacity, we note that paragraph VII is subject to another interpretation. Palmer\u2019s allegations in paragraph VII can also be read as asserting that the defendant officers' acts were performed as individuals acting under color of state law (making them actionable under section 1983) as distinguished from being performed as individuals not acting under color of state law (which would make them nonactionable under section 1983). So viewed, the complaint adequately alleges a cause of action against the officers in their individual capacity while acting under col- or of state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. Paragraph VIII of Palmer\u2019s amended complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">On July 17, 1983, at approximately 5:30 p.m., the Plaintiff was driving his automobile in the City of Converse, County of Bexar, State of Texas, when suddenly the Defendants HAROLD R. BELLAMY and MICHAEL E. WILLIAMSON attempted to stop Plaintiffs automobile. Defendant WILLIAMSON discharged a firearm at Plaintiff, with the bullet hitting the left side of Plaintiffs automobile. Defendant WILLIAMSON followed the Plaintiff and subsequently stopped the Plaintiffs automobile. While pointing his firearm at Plaintiff, Defendant WILLIAMSON pulled the Plaintiff from his automobile. The Defendant WILLIAMSON used unnecessary physical force on the Plaintiff; such force which far exceeded that which was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, and which resulted in the deprivation of Plaintiffs liberty without due process of law. The Plaintiff was arrested by the Converse City Police and subsequently charged with assault with a motor vehicle and public intoxication.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-22\">.
