Plaintiff does not contest this finding. Rather, she appeals from the district court\u2019s refusal to vacate an AU\u2019s finding that she was \u201cnot without fault\u201d in not currently reporting her husband\u2019s overtime earnings, as a consequence of which the obligation to refund the over-payments was not waived. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(b)(1); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.552. Plaintiff, so far, has lost, (1) the original determination; (2) a request for reconsideration; (3) a request for waiver of repayment; (4) a request for reconsideration; (5) a decision by the AU; (6) a request to the Appeals Council, and, finally, (7) a decision by the district court. This should be enough, unless there was substantial error. There was none, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>On this appeal plaintiff still complains that \u201cshe was not provided with necessary and critical information by Social Security.\u201d This, it turns out, refers primarily to the agency formula, which, as has been pointed out, was irrelevant to her concern. It is indisputable that she knew her concern, which was simply to report her financial circumstances, including her husband\u2019s overtime earnings, which, to her knowledge, changed frequently, and that she was to report changes \u201cin between\u201d the annual evaluations. Besides her oral testimony, she checked \u201cYes\u201d on the annual statements indicating that she \u201cagree[d] to notify the [agency] immediately\u201d if there were any changes. It is no answer that she believed there were other sources of information available to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">To allege on appeal that plaintiff lacked understanding because she had only been through tenth grade is as frivolous as the claim that she did not know how the agency calculated the benefits. Rather, faced with the burden of showing there was no substantial evidence, <em>Deblois v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>686 F.2d 76, 79 (1st Cir.1982), counsel should have concerned himself with the fact that for the immediately preceding period plaintiff had also failed to report timely her husband\u2019s earnings, and had been charged back therefor. It would be difficult to think of a better notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Equally without merit is the contention that the AU did not \u201cadequately resolve\u201d plaintiff\u2019s credibility: \u201cThere were not any explicit findings on this issue [viz., the claim that she did frequently report the overtime], and what findings there were strongly suggest that plaintiff, Mrs. Knapp, was to be believed.\u201d This is simply not so. First, in his opinion, the AU recited that the records of Social Security revealed no such visits or reports. Any doubt as to what he meant by this may be resolved by reference to his remarks during the hearing as to the inference he would draw from the absence of records, and the fact that no changes were made. As to \u201cbelieving\u201d plaintiff, we note the following.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">Q. Now, why didn\u2019t you \u2014 every time your husband got a different overtime, why didn\u2019t you go down to Social Security and inform them that your husband got a different overtime check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">A. I would have to go down every single week ... not every week but every two weeks I would have to be running down. And I would save the check stubs and I would bring them down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoS\">Again, \u201cI piled them up and gave them to them.\u201d Piling them up for the annual evaluation was the very cause of the over-payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">It is true that it would have been better if the AU had not said that a recipient of benefits should exercise \u201ca high degree of care,\u201d but this does not constitute appeal-able error per se. We read the opinion as a whole, and the AU\u2019s references to plaintiff, as showing that he considered her as a particular individual, and did not impose a burden unsuitable to her specific circumstances. That he did not find her \u201cdishonest\u201d did not mean that she was \u201cwithout fault.\u201d This was not a case like <em>Jefferson v. Bowen, </em>794 F.2d 631 (11th Cir.1986). We are compelled to observe that counsel\u2019s persistence in bringing this appeal shows regrettable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
