Lauderdale. Since appellant Taylor successfully obtained a preliminary injunction on the merits of the central substantive issue in the \u00a7 1983 case underlying this appeal, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees to plaintiffs and remand the case for a hearing on reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-17\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. At the hearing on Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the parties stipulated to the truth of the Declaration of Plaintiff William Taylor filed in conjunction with the Motion. The Declaration sets forth these facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1640-18\">1. I am a member of the Unification Church and have been since 1974.

Lauderdale were not required to obtain solicitation permits when they sought donations inside a church or on church property, Taylor and other Unification Church members filed suit. On June 21, 1982, plaintiffs filed a two-count civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for declaratory relief and a preliminary and permanent injunction: plaintiffs sought to declare unconstitutional and to enjoin enforcement of the Ft. Lauderdale City Code Chapter \u00a7 38-1 <em>et. seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the Florida Transportation Code, Section 339.301,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>unconstitutional as construed and applied against the plaintiffs because such state action deprives plaintiffs of their constitutional rights of freedom of religion and speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">The district court heard the Motion for Preliminary Injunction on July 12, 1982. The only witness to appear was Mr. James Turner, the Chief License Inspector for the City of Ft. Lauderdale since 1981. Turner testified that while all solicitations inside the City required a permit, he \u201ctook the law the way it had been applied for the previous years\u201d before he was appointed Chief License Inspector. Fort Lauder-dale\u2019s enforcement scheme, as described by Turner, was two-fold: a) All religious or charitable organizations soliciting out-of-doors must have a permit (\u201c[Ajnyone that solicits religious funds or gifts from the taxpayers of Fort Lauderdale upon the streets of Fort Lauderdale requires a permit, irregardless of what the organization is\u201d); and b) if the solicitation is indoors but not on property owned or controlled by the solicitor, a solicitation permit was also required. This meant that \u201cCatholic, Baptist, Protestant, [or] Jewish\u201d congregations which \u201cpassed the plate\u201d inside a traditional house of worship, to church members and visitors alike, would not need a City permit. The Unification Church, even if it had a \u201cmembers only\u201d meeting at the Holiday Inn and took a collection, would need a permit or be in violation of the City ordinance. The district court termed this \u201cedifice discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-5\">On November 1, 1982, the district court entered an Order granting plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Preliminary Injunction on Count 1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the solicitation permit requirement of Section 38-9 of the Ft. Lauderdale City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-6\">The district judge specifically found \u201cthat <em>in practice </em>the City has exempted established religious organizations from both the registration and reporting requirements [of the ordinance] whether they solicit indoors or out-of-doors.\u201d (emphasis by the court). Mr. Turner also stated that \u201cunless the Plaintiffs secured a solicitation permit, Unification Church members who attempt to solicit donations from members of the general public would be subject to arrest.\u201d Following well-established First Amendment doctrine, the lower court recognized that religious solicitation is protected activity, <em>Murdock v. Pennsylvania, </em>319 U.S. 105, 111, 63 S.Ct. 870, 874, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943), and the threat of criminal prosecution effectively chills the exercise of free expression, <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). Thus, without a compelling government interest to justify the City\u2019s enforcement scheme which was narrowly tailored to achieve its desired ends, <em>Larson v. Va-lente, </em>456 U.S. 228, 246-47, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 1684-85, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982), the application of City Code \u00a7 38-9 was presumptively invalid. The district court entered the preliminary injunction because the plaintiffs \u201chave suffered, and continue to suffer\u201d irreparable injury. \u201cThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\u201d <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2689, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <em>Deerfield Medical Center v. City of Deerfield Beach, </em>661 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). The injunction provided the City may not require the plaintiffs to register under Section 38-9 \u201cunless and until all religious organizations which solicit donations within the City of Ft. Lauderdale, whether indoors or out-of-doors, are also required to register for such solicitation permits.\u201d (Order, Case No. 82-6408, Nov. 1, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-11\">After a brief exchange of limited interrogatories, plaintiffs moved in March of 1983 for summary judgment on Count I of the complaint. The district court heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>oral argument on the Motion, and on April 8,1984, the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment in part. 583 F.Supp 514 (S.D.Fla.1984). The district court found that there had been no discrimination by the City in its permit requirement for outdoor solicitations. There had been \u201cno showing in the record that any of the described \u2018traditional\u2019 churches ever solicited out-of-doors without a permit\u201d or that the City ever waived the permit requirement for another group that solicited outdoors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 517. The district court did find \u201cedifice discrimination\u201d in the City\u2019s policy of requiring evangelical churches that had no permanent structure to have a solicitations permit to meet and collect donations indoors while other church groups established in a house of worship on a specific site were exempted from the permit requirement. Therefore, plaintiffs received a partial summary judgment on Count I \u201conly insofar as it alleges unconstitutional application of the Fort Lauderdale Solicitation Ordinance to plaintiff\u2019s indoor solicitation.\u201d 583 F.Supp. at 519. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not explicitly allege any indoor solicitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1643-5\">Beginning in the fall of 1984, the Ft. Lauderdale City Commission took under consideration the repeal of Section 38-9, along with other provisions of Chapter 38. Chapter 38, including Section 38-9, was repealed and replaced by a new City Ordinance which became effective on January 3, 1985. The new ordinance made an accommodation for indoor solicitation and exempted it from the permit requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, outdoor solicitation is still regulated by the City under the new scheme. At this point, both parties agreed that plaintiffs\u2019 suit became moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-11\">Plaintiffs thereupon moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 on the ground that they were \u201cprevailing parties\u201d in this case. The City responded that plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because, <em>inter alia, </em>the injunction entered applied to only a single section of the entire ordinance, Section 38-9, and <em>final </em>relief did not yield a victory for plaintiffs on the merits. In its final judgment dated September 9,1985, the district court denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-13\">This Circuit follows the \u201ccentral issue\u201d test for determining and awarding attorney\u2019s fees. In order to qualify as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the plaintiff must be successful on the central issue in the case, exhibited by the fact that the plaintiff acquired the primary re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>lief sought. <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. City of Hallandale, </em>742 F.2d 590 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Coen v. Harrison City School Board, </em>638 F.2d 24, 26 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Iranian Students Assn. v. Sawyer, </em>639 F.2d 1160 (5th Cir.1981). The decision on whether to award attorney\u2019s fees is made by the district court and reviewable only for abuse of discretion. <em>Wilson v. Attaway, </em>767 F.2d 1227, 1248 (11th Cir. 1985). <em>Fields v. City of Tarpon Springs, </em>721 F.2d 318, 321 (11th Cir.1983). However, the Supreme Court has held that under \u00a7 1988 prevailing parties should ordinarily recover attorney\u2019s fees \u201cunless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). <em>Es-pino v. Besteiro, </em>708 F.2d 1002, 1006 (5th Cir.1983) (fees awarded prevailing party \u201cas a matter of course\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-4\">In <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980), the Supreme Court set forth the guiding principle that a plaintiff prevails for \u00a7 1988 purposes if he \u201chas established his entitlement to <em>some </em>relief on the <em>merits </em>of his claims, either in the trial court or on appeal.\u201d 446 U.S. at 757, 100 S.Ct. at 1987 (emphasis added). The Court went on to explain that fees would be appropriate \u201cwhere a party has prevailed on an important matter in the course of the litigation, even when he ultimately does not prevail on <em>all </em>issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting S.Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976)) (emphasis in original). Later, in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), the Supreme Court focused primarily on the standards to be used in assessing the <em>amount </em>of the prevailing party\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. The award of fees, however, comes after a determination that a party has \u201cprevailed,\u201d either on \u201cany significant issue\u201d or the \u201ccentral issue\u201d in the litigation, depending on the Circuit. 461 U.S. at 433, n. 8, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-7\">The application of these two Supreme Court decisions in the appellate courts has been anything but uniform. Of course, a party that obtains a favorable final judgment squarely on the merits is awarded attorney\u2019s fees. Conversely, a plaintiff that is denied all substantive relief at every stage of litigation does not become a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 1988. The issue before us today is whether a plaintiff who initially obtained a preliminary injunction on the merits and the primary relief sought in the suit but eventually dismissed the suit when it became moot is a prevailing party for reimbursement purposes under \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-8\">A. Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"A0F\">As this court noted in <em>Doe v. Bus-bee, </em>684 F.2d 1375 (11th Cir.1982), \u201ca plaintiff may not claim status as a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 by virtue of <em>any </em>success during the course of a civil rights case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1380 (emphasis added). Fees are awarded only when the prevailing party obtains the \u201cprimary relief sought.\u201d 684 F.2d at 1379; <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>640 F.2d 663, 669 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-9\">The central issue presented by plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was that the solicitation permit requirements imposed upon the Unification Church in its outdoor solicitations were unconstitutional because of the permit application process itself and the requirement that religious groups soliciting out-of-doors submit a financial report.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>alleged religious discrimination between \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cestablished\u201d religions and the Unification Church. The primary relief sought was to suspend the application of the City\u2019s permit requirement altogether for outdoor solicitations by the Unification Church. That is exactly what the district court granted in its preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-4\">The cases are split as to whether the granting of a preliminary injunction merits an award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court\u2019s decision in <em>Martin v. Heckler, </em>773 F.2d 1145 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(en banc) </em>held that plaintiffs who alleged an improper change of benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) were successful in having the previous policy retroactively reinstated; thus, the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as prevailing parties under \u00a7 1988. <em>Martin </em>concerned the question whether plaintiffs were prevailing parties when their claims became moot due to government actions subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit. Stating the prevailing party test as whether one \u201chas received substantially the relief requested or has been successful on the central issue,\u201d <em>Martin, </em>773 F.2d at 1149 (citing <em>Watkins v. Mobile Housing Board, </em>632 F.2d 565, 567 (5th Cir. Unit B 1980)), the <em>en banc </em>Court found that the government\u2019s actions afforded plaintiffs success on the merits which vindicated the civil rights claims presented. The plaintiffs in <em>Martin </em>received the primary relief they sought without the formal entry of an injunction. The present litigation is much more clear-cut: plaintiffs did receive a preliminary injunction on the merits which remained in force approximately 26 months, from November 1, 1982, the day the preliminary injunction was entered, through January 3, 1985, when an amended solicitation ordinance was enacted by the City. During this 26 month period the plaintiffs were able to solicit donations in Fort Lauderdale without a permit and without being treated differently than other religious groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-9\">In a similar case, <em>Bishop v. Committee on Professional Ethics, </em>686 F.2d 1278 (8th Cir.1982), the Eighth Circuit held that preliminary or temporary relief entered by the district court on the <em>merits </em>of Bishop\u2019s claims entitled him to attorney\u2019s fees. Since the trial court had entered declaratory and injunctive relief, the period of time from the district court\u2019s judgment until the decision was vacated by mootness was time in which Bishop obtained \u201csome of the benefit of bringing suit\u201d and \u201cessentially succeeded in obtaining sought-after relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. A binding Fifth Circuit case, <em>Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118 (5th Cir. 1980), also found preliminary relief on the merits afforded prevailing party status and attorney\u2019s fees to the successful litigant, even though the case was ultimately mooted when the plaintiff graduated from high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-10\">In another case dealing with the application of a discriminatory city policy, <em>Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845 (9th Cir. 1980), the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to prohibit the police from a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d campaign against black males after a number of brutal murders. After the district court entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>preliminary injunction against the practice, the city apprehended the wanted suspects and the case became moot. In finding that plaintiffs were prevailing parties in a \u00a7 1983 suit the Court reasoned, \u201cthe preliminary injunction prevented appellants from continued enforcement of their original guidelines [city policy], which is precisely the relief appellees sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 847. The preliminary injunction entered in the instant case accomplished exactly the same result: Fort Lauderdale was enjoined from enforcing its unconstitutionally discriminatory solicitation permitting scheme, the goal plaintiffs sought to achieve when bringing suit. This \u201csuccess\u201d existed for 26 months until the case was mooted when the City repealed its governing ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-4\">The rule gleaned from these disparate cases is that a preliminary injunction on the merits, as opposed to a merely temporary order which decides no substantive issues but merely maintains the status quo, entitles one to prevailing party status and an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Smith v. Thomas, </em>687 F.2d 113, 115 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Chu Drua Cha v. Levine, </em>701 F.2d 750, 751 (8th Cir.1983) (plaintiff is prevailing party since preliminary injunction, though it may be modified or vacated, \u201crepresents substantial measure of success\u201d on merits); <em>Deerfield Medical Center v. City of Deer-field Beach, </em>661 F.2d 328, 329 (5th Cir. 1981) (fee awarded when preliminary injunction granted to overcome city control over application process for opening abortion clinic).</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-5\">Other cases have come to a contrary conclusion, but we find them distinguished from the case at bar. For example, in <em>Smith v. University of North Carolina, </em>632 F.2d 316 (4th Cir.1980), the court concluded that the injunctive relief obtained was insufficient to establish that the plaintiff had prevailed, because the plaintiff was ultimately unsuccessful on the merits of each and every claim against the university. However, this denial of prevailing parly status came after a full trial on the merits, not after subsequent government actions mooted the case. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375 (11th Cir.1982), held that where the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction but ultimately did not succeed on the merits they could not be considered prevailing parties. <em>Busbee </em>concerned a party that originally obtained injunctive and declaratory relief in the district court, but Supreme Court decisions handed down while the case was on appeal undercut the legal foundation of the district court\u2019s decision. Finding that plaintiffs did not ultimately prevail on any legal issue, the <em>Busbee </em>court denied attorney\u2019s fees. However, the panel in <em>Busbee </em>found that the district court had granted the preliminary injunction through \u201ca mistake in law\u201d since Georgia had never actually violated the law, as evidenced by the two intervening Supreme Court decisions. 684 F.2d at 1381. Thus, the plaintiffs in <em>Busbee </em>were never actually prevailing parties at all. It is beyond cavil that the injunction entered here properly ended a discriminatory permitting practice by the City. The preliminary injunction entered below was granted on the merits and plaintiffs received the primary relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-7\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-8\">The summary judgment which plaintiffs received was limited to a determination that the City ordinance was unconstitutional only as applied to <em>indoor </em>solicitation. However, Taylor concedes that plaintiffs did not specifically allege indoor solicitation; therefore, this summary judgment gave them no real relief. Moreover, the district court plainly stated that \u201creview of the record shows no discrimination by the City in requiring permits for outdoor solicitation.\u201d 583 F.Supp. 514, 517. We are urged to deny plaintiffs prevailing party status on the basis of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-9\">The City contends that the partial summary judgment on indoor solicitation is not a favorable judgment on the central issue in the case. With this we agree. Further, the City argues that the district court\u2019s statement on outdoor solicitation is an adverse judgment on the application of the solicitation permit scheme and termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>nates the effect of the preliminary injunction and any prevailing party status derived therefrom. With this we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-5\">Our cases do stand for the proposition that success on a minor or peripheral issue in a civil rights case will not support an award of attorney\u2019s fees. For example, in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. City of Hallandale, </em>742 F.2d 590 (11th Cir.1984), the newspaper challenged a comprehensive licensing tax ordinance. The central issue in that case dealt with the Miami Herald\u2019s claim that it was unconstitutional to tax its publication under the first amendment. The district court ultimately ruled in the Miami Herald\u2019s favor only on a single non-tax-related provision. Having suffered an adverse judgment on the central issue in the case, this Court concluded that the Miami Herald was not a prevailing party and, therefore, not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-6\">In <em>Wilson v. Attaway, </em>757 F.2d 1227 (11th Cir.1985), although the plaintiffs were successful in challenging the constitutionality of the city charter, the constitutionality of that charter did not bear upon the constitutionality of an arrest by a county sheriff. Because the \u201ccentral issue\u201d of the litigation was a challenge to the arrest made by the sheriff, the <em>Wilson </em>court found that plaintiffs were not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d by reason of their singular success against one unrelated city charter provision. <em>Id. </em>at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-7\">The partial summary judgment entered below concerned indoor solicitation; it did not vindicate plaintiffs\u2019 position on the central issue in the case or provide plaintiffs with the desired relief. A \u201ctechnical\u201d ruling in one\u2019s favor does not make one a prevailing party if it does not grant significant substantive relief. \u201cIn the context of \u00a7 1988 there is no such thing as a 'technically prevailing plaintiff\u2019; the issue of who has prevailed is a realistic judgment, not a technical one.\u201d <em>Coen v. Harrison County School Board, </em>638 F.2d 24, 26 (5th Cir. 1981). <em>See Carbalan v. Vaughn, </em>760 F.2d 662, 666 (5th Cir.1985) (plaintiff who prevails on judgment but obtains no relief whatsoever is not a prevailing party under the central issue test); <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 466 (5th Cir. 1981) (plaintiffs cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees for judicial claims upon which they obtained no relief). Since the summary judgment concerned only indoor solicitation, this decision by the district court did not, by its own terms, yield relief to plaintiffs worthy of prevailing party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-11\">However, the entry of partial summary judgment only on indoor solicitation did not divest plaintiffs of the prevailing party status secured by the preliminary injunction entered against the application of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s solicitation permit ordinance to <em>both </em>indoor and outdoor solicitations. While the district court did make a statement that \u201cthe record shows no discrimination by the City in requiring permits for outdoor solicitation,\u201d 583 F.Supp at 517, no formal judgment was entered to that effect. A final judgment was entered only as to the unconstitutional application of the ordinance to indoor solicitation, the previously described \u201cedifice complex\u201d in the City\u2019s permit scheme. Since the plaintiffs had filed for declaratory as well as injunctive relief, we must read the district court\u2019s entry of a <em>partial </em>summary judgment as a decision that the application of the City\u2019s ordinance to outdoor solicitation was still an open question of law deserving further inquiry and scrutiny. The case became moot <em>not </em>when the district court entered its partial summary judgment but only after the City amended its ordinance. The partial summary judgment did not vitiate plaintiffs\u2019 earlier success in obtaining prevailing party status on the basis of the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>C. The \u201cCatalyst\u201d Test</p>\n<p id=\"A0tV\">We note that a party may also be awarded attorney\u2019s fees as a prevailing party even if there is not a formal adjudication in the party\u2019s favor. <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122,100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). This Circuit permits the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d if the litigation \u201csuccessfully terminates by a consent decree, an out-of-court settlement, a voluntary cessation of the unlawful practice by defendant, or other mooting of the case where the plaintiff has vindicated his right.\u201d <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d at 1379. Analysis hinges upon whether \u201cthe lawsuit is a substantial factor or a significant catalyst in motivating defendants to end their unconstitutional behavior.\u201d <em>Busbee, </em>684 F.2d at 1380. <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 466 (5th Cir.1981). <em>Fields v. City of Tarpon Springs, </em>supra, 721 F.2d at 321-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-4\">We need not consider whether Taylor\u2019s suit was a \u201ccatalyst\u201d which motivated the City to repeal the solicitations permit ordinance. Plaintiffs attained prevailing party status on the basis of expressly awarded judicial relief. The \u201ccatalyst\u201d test is utilized primarily in the <em>absence </em>of formal judicial relief to determine if plaintiffs were successful. <em>Martin v. Heckler, </em>773 F.2d 1145 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(en banc). See also Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d at 1379. Of course, \u201cmootness\u201d does not retroactively divest plaintiffs of prevailing party status. <em>Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir.1980). Plaintiffs do not require application of the \u201ccatalyst\u201d test to achieve prevailing party status in the case before us today.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1648-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-10\">The preliminary injunction entered below was granted squarely on the merits. The plaintiffs were able to solicit donations in Fort Lauderdale without a permit and free from the threat of arrest. This Court is mindful of the congressional policy favoring the award of attorney\u2019s fees to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>tiffs who vindicate substantive rights in court. \u201cThere is no suggestion in the congressional history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, nor in the cases that have applied it, that it ought to be read in a niggardly way.\u201d <em>Smith v. Thomas, </em>687 F.2d 113, 116 (5th Cir.1982). We do not do so today. The injunction granted below properly safeguarded important First Amendment rights. Finding that this injunction was granted on the central substantive issue and yielded the practical relief sought by plaintiffs, we hold that plaintiffs were prevailing parties entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We remand this cause to the district court for a hearing and award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees or an explanation of special circumstances rendering the award of such fees unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1641-15\">. Count 1 of the complaint alleges that Chapter 38-1 <em>et seq. </em>of the Ft. Lauderdale Code was unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs. The gravamen of Plaintiffs complaint specifically attacks \u00a7 38-9 of the City Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av4\">It shall be unlawful for any person or organization to solicit gifts or donations for charitable or religious purposes within the city, without first having obtained a permit therefor from the chief license inspector.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1641-16\">Plaintiffs were also required, under \u00a7 38-10, to make detailed financial disclosures about the church or submit a copy of their most recent IRS tax form showing tax exempt status in order to obtain a solicitation permit. This provision was challenged as an infringement on the religious group\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1641-21\">. Fla.Stat. (1981) provides, in pertinent part: 339.301 Unlawful commercial use of state-maintained road right-of-way; penalties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1641-22\">(1) Except when otherwise authorized by law or by the rules and regulations of the department, it is unlawful to make any commercial use of the right-of-way of any state-maintained road____ Such prohibited uses include, but are not limited to ... the <em>solicitation </em>for the sale of goods, property, or services or for <em>charitable </em>purposes____ (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1642-7\">. The primary focus throughout the litigation was the licensing and financial disclosure requirements of Ft. Lauderdale\u2019s solicitation permit ordinance challenged in Count I. Count II, which concerned the Florida Transportation Statute, was never seriously litigated. The Court reserved ruling on Count II pursuant to an agreement of the parties, and plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Count II on April 12, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1643-6\">. Though the district court found no evidence in the record of any groups soliciting without a permit, the testimony of Mr. Turner reflects that the City\u2019s interpretation of its solicitation ordinance did not require the Democratic or Republican parties to obtain a permit to solicit in public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1643-7\">. The language of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint dealt with door-to-door and public place solicitations. Counsel for plaintiffs had used a permit application completed by the \"U.C.S.S. Spiritual Centre of Cassadaga\" when examining Mr. Turner at the hearing on the preliminary injunction; this application was for a permit to meet and solicit donations indoors at the Holiday Inn. The U.C. S.S. Spiritual Centre of Cassadaga is not a party to this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1643-8\">. The new ordinance, in \u00a7 38-17, lists \"Exceptions\" to the substantially similar reporting requirements re-enacted as \u00a7 38-10 through \u00a7 38-15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1643-9\">Sec. 38-17.

We realize that this statement of the central issue differs from that of the district court. The district court restated the broad constitutional claims of Plaintiffs\u2019 case, to wit, that Count I alleged constitutional infirmity in Section 38-1 <em>et. seq. </em>of the Ft. Lauderdale City Ordinance and Count II raised a constitutional attack on Florida Transportation Statutes 339.301. However, we restate the \"central issue\" more precisely consistent with our belief that the central issue test is one of practicality, not legal formalism. <em>See Hennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Board, </em>749 F.2d 1148, 1152 (5th Cir.1985) (\"initial need to identify the goal\" plaintiff sought to achieve by bringing suit); <em>Bly v. McLeod, </em>605 F.2d 134, 139 (4th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 928, 100 S.Ct. 1315, 63 L.Ed.2d 761 (1980) (\"the court should consider the precise factual/legal condition the fee claimant has sought to change\u201d and use that as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d to evaluate success); <em>Institutionalized Juveniles v.

(Wiley, 1986) (\"debatable\u201d whether plaintiff becomes prevailing party on basis of preliminary injunction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1647-8\">. The dissent finds <em>Doe v. Busbee </em>dispositive on the question before us today. However, this view fails to credit the key distinction between <em>Busbee </em>and the case at bar. <em>Busbee </em>expressly stated that plaintiffs were denied prevailing party status \u2018\u2018[b]ecause at no time were the civil rights of the plaintiffs being violated,\" 684 F.2d at 1383. The lower court had \u201cerroneously entered injunctions\" on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf. <em>Id. </em>This \"mistake of law\u201d by the district court meant \u201cthe State of Georgia had never been in violation of the law,\u201d so plaintiffs \"had no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>to the relief sought and obtained.\u201d 684 F.2d 1381-82. Thus, prevailing party status was denied. In contrast, the injunction awarded the plaintiffs here was clearly consistent with, indeed compelled by, controlling first amendment jurisprudence. The City of Fort Lauderdale's solicitations ordinance was being unconstitutionally applied to members of the Unification Church. The partial summary judgment did not vitiate plaintiffs\u2019 success as considered in <em>Busbee </em>\u2014there was no \"mistake of law\" here.</p>\n<p id=\"als-dedup-0\">The dissent does not believe that plaintiffs\u2019 success on the preliminary injunction \"survived\u201d the summary judgment. While the district court\u2019s decision on April 5, 1984, found no evidence <em>in the record </em>supporting the entry of summary judgment on outdoor solicitation, our record on appeal shows that the parties engaged in settlement discussions on Count I during the next few months. In fact, on August 8, 1984, counsel for plaintiff commenced further discovery to flush out evidence on the City's solicitations permit process. Since plaintiffs had already received summary judgment on <em>indoor </em>solicitation, this discovery obviously was intended to augment the record on discrimination in <em>outdoor </em>solicitation, a matter not foreclosed by the district court\u2019s ruling. At this point, the preliminary injunction against enforcement of the City\u2019s solicitations permit scheme was still in force.</p>\n<p id=\"AOHY\">Moreover, on September 1, 1984, a full five months after the summary judgment ostensibly ended the case, the City attorney informed counsel for plaintiff that the City Council was considering repeal of the ordinance in question. After discussing the matter with the City attorney, plaintiffs agreed via letter to wait for the City Council to act before they \"either resume negotiations directed toward a settlement of this controversy or proceed with the litigation.\u201d On December 14, 1984, the City attorney forwarded a copy of the revised ordinance to plaintiffs <em>prior to </em>City Council consideration to see if plaintiff had \u201cany questions regarding the proposed revisions.\" More than the language of the district court\u2019s order itself, the actions of the parties demonstrate that the partial summary judgment did not \u201cvacate\" plaintiffs' earlier success enjoining the City ordinance. Though the City\u2019s revision of its solicitations ordinance mooted plaintiffs\u2019 claim, it is clear that plaintiffs had a right to \u201cthe relief sought and obtained\" and are prevailing parties as a consequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1648-12\">. In any event, the express \"exceptions\" in the City\u2019s new ordinance, <em>see supra, </em>note 6, make it clear that there will be no disparate treatment of religious groups that seek to solicit donations in the City. The record supports at least an inference that this lawsuit was a substantial factor in motivating the City to amend its ordinance. However, we do not address this issue because we find that the preliminary injunction granted the plaintiffs express substantive relief worthy of prevailing party status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1649-6\">ANDERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"auj-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-7\">I agree with the majority opinion that the \u201ccentral issue presented by plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was that the solicitation permit requirements imposed upon the Unification Church in its outdoor solicitations were unconstitutional.\u201d I also agree that the preliminary injunction afforded relief to plaintiffs on this central issue. I also agree that the summary judgment later entered by the court, granting plaintiffs relief only as to <em>indoor </em>solicitation, did not constitute \u201ca favorable judgment on the central issue in the case.\u201d At this point, my agreement with the majority opinion ends. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the relief on the central issue of outdoor solicitation obtained by plaintiffs in the preliminary injunction somehow survives the entry of the later summary judgment. The majority reaches this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that the summary judgment opinion clearly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 claim for relief with respect to outdoor solicitation, holding that \u201cthe record shows no discrimination by the City in requiring permits for outdoor solicitation.\u201d 538 F.Supp. 514, 517 (S.D.Fla.1984). Whether or not a formal judgment was entered to this effect, as a practical matter, it is clear that the relief obtained by plaintiffs in the preliminary injunction on the crucial issue in the case was vitiated upon entry of the later summary judgment. <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375 (11th Cir.1982), squarely holds that a plaintiff is not a prevailing party when it obtains initial relief in the district court which is later vacated. In this case, just as in <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>the initial relief obtained by plaintiffs on the crucial issue was vitiated by later court action. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>because I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the initial relief obtained by plaintiffs in the preliminary judgment somehow survived the later summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-13\">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1649-8\">. Plaintiffs apparently conceded below that the amendment to the ordinance mooted the case. However, even if the instant suit were a catalyst motivating the amendment, the amended ordinance provided no relief with respect to the central issue of outdoor solicitation. The plaintiffs\u2019 concession may have been more in the nature of an abandonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
