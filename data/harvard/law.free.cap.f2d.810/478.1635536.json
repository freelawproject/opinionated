We remand and instruct the district court to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-27\">One afternoon, Ray Douglas Thomas tried to sell a shotgun to a gun shop owner. The shop owner, knowing Thomas to be a convicted felon, told him to return later with the gun, then notified federal authorities. A federal agent arrested Thomas upon his return. Thomas told the agent that he had received the gun the previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>night<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a convenience store parking lot; that he had taken it to another\u2019s house where he spent the night; and that it was always under his control. Thomas had three previous felony convictions and the gun was manufactured in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The government charged Thomas with violating both 18 U.S.C. App. II, \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (possession) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) (receipt), statutes that prohibit the possession and receipt of firearms by a convicted felon. Thomas validly waived his right to a jury trial and the district court tried the case on the above stipulated facts. The trial judge convicted Thomas on both charges and sentenced him to concurrent terms of 15 years for possession and five years for receipt. The appellant asserts two errors: first, that under these facts he cannot be convicted and sentenced for both possession and receipt of a firearm, and, second, that his conviction under \u00a7 1202(a)(1) cannot be sustained because his possession of the gun was not contemporaneous with the gun\u2019s movement in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985) controls the first issue. The Supreme Court only sketches the facts in <em>Ball: </em>A pistol was reported stolen; \u201csubsequently,\u201d Ball threatened another with that pistol; and later that same day, Ball was arrested with the pistol. Ball was convicted under the same statutes involved in our case. <em>Ball </em>holds that although the government may <em>prosecute </em>under both \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 1202(a), it may only <em>convict </em>and <em>sentence </em>under one of the two statutes. \u201cIndeed, \u2018[a]ll guides to legislative intent,\u2019 <em>United States v. Woodward, </em>469 U.S. 105,109 [105 S.Ct. 611, 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 518] (1985), show that Congress intended a felon in Ball\u2019s position to be convicted and punished for only one of the two offenses if the possession of the firearm is incidental to receiving it.\u201d <em>Ball, </em>470 U.S. at 861, 105 S.Ct. at 1671-72, 84 L.Ed.2d at 745-46. The Supreme Court emphasized that the two statutes form a patchwork and reach different groups of people. <em>Id. </em>at 863 n. 13, 105 S.Ct. at 1673 n. 13, 84 L.Ed.2d at 747 n. 13. The Court concluded \u201cthat Congress had no intention of creating duplicative punishment for one limited class of persons falling within the overlap of the two Titles\u2014 convicted felons who receive firearms and who, by definition, possess them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864, 105 S.Ct. at 1673, 84 L.Ed.2d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The government attempts to distinguish <em>Ball </em>by asserting that in <em>Ball </em>there was no independent proof of receipt. Here, Thomas admitted that he received the shotgun in a separate transaction; in other words, the proof of receipt was not inferred from his possession of the gun. This distinction follows from ambiguous language in <em>Ball </em>apparently limiting its application to situations in which \u201ca single act establishes the receipt and possession. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865, 105 S.Ct. at 1674, 84 L.Ed.2d at 748. We are unable, however, to draw that distinction either logically or administratively. The Supreme Court delineated the duty of a district court when faced with evidence showing both receipt and possession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">If, upon the trial, the District Judge is satisfied that there is sufficient proof to go to the jury on both counts, he should instruct the jury as to the elements of each offense. Should the jury return guilty verdicts for each count, however, the District Judge should enter judgment on only one of the statutory offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgW\"><em>Id. </em>The only level of proof that concerns us here is enough evidence to sustain a guilty verdict of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Ball, </em>there was sufficient evidence to sustain Ball\u2019s conviction on either count. Likewise, here there is sufficient evidence to sustain Thomas\u2019s conviction on either count. A higher quantum of evidence showing receipt does not in any way strengthen an already valid conviction and therefore enable it to withstand the Supreme Court\u2019s directive to convict and sentence under only one of these statutes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>We must therefore remand this case and instruct the district court to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Thomas next contends that the government failed to establish the proper nexus between his possession of the gun and interstate commerce to fulfill the requirements of 18 U.S.C. App. II, \u00a7 1202(a)(1). <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977) controls this issue. <em>Scarborough </em>holds that to establish a nexus with interstate commerce for the purposes of \u00a7 1202(a)(1), the government need prove only that the firearm possessed by the convicted felon traveled at some time in interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 97 S.Ct. 1969, 52 L.Ed.2d at 591. The government\u2019s proof that the shotgun was manufactured in Massachusetts satisfies this nexus requirement. Thomas asserts that the government\u2019s failure to specify <em>when </em>the firearm moved interstate moves this case out of <em>Scarborough\u2019s </em>shadow. One of the firearms that brought Scarborough\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1202(a)(1), however, \u2018\"'was manufactured in France in the 19th century and was somehow later brought into Virginia____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565 n. 2, 97 S.Ct. at 1964 n. 2, 52 L.Ed.2d at 585 n. 2. That evidence, as the evidence here, was sufficient to uphold the conviction. Thomas\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Scarborough </em>therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Accordingly, we REMAND and instruct the district court to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">.
