The charges arose from allegations that the defendant had aided and abetted his nephew, Orang Fabriz, in interfering with the custodial rights of Fabriz\u2019 wife, Lila Mirjavadi, with respect to their child, Saba Fabriz (Saba). The state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant was deprived of his due process right to fair notice as a result of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>251 Conn. 656, 742 A.2d 767 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>(1999), to overrule <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Marshak, </em>226 Conn. 652, 628 A.2d 964 (1993), upon which the defendant had relied in <em>Vakilzaden. </em>We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Our opinion in <em>Vakilzaden </em>sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cMirjavadi and Fabriz, both Iranian citizens, were married in their homeland in 1990. They have one daughter, Saba. In September, 1995, when Saba was one and one-half years old, the family traveled together to the United States on a temporary visa. Mirjavadi and Fabriz separated approximately one month after their arrival in the United States. Mirjavadi retained physical custody of their daughter and moved into her brother\u2019s home in Stamford. Fabriz moved in with his uncle, the defendant, who, at the time in question, was a resident of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\u201cMirjavadi applied for political asylum and, in January, 1996, brought an action for the dissolution of her marriage to Fabriz in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Stamford. On February 5,1996, a hearing was held on [Fabriz\u2019] motion seeking visitation rights with Saba. Fabriz notified the court that he was not seeking any form of custody, but, rather, an order of visitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After making it clear that (1) physical custody of Saba would remain with Mirjavadi<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) visitation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Fabriz would be supervised based on his risk of flight with Saba and his past abusive behavior, the trial court, <em>Harrigan, J., </em>ordered the parties to consult with the family relations division of the Superior Court and to report back to the court if and when the details of a visitation agreement between the parties had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\u201cThat same day, Fabriz and Mirjavadi informed the trial court that they had come to an agreement as to the terms of supervised visitation. The court entered the order for visitation pursuant to their agreement, which allowed Fabriz three hours of supervised visitation per week in the presence of appointed monitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\u201cOn September 30, 1996, Fabriz, while accompanied by the defendant, purchased two one-way tickets to Istanbul, Turkey, for a flight departing from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on October 5, 1996.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The names listed on the tickets were Orang and Saba Fabriz.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">\u201cOn October 5, 1996, at 2 p.m., Mirjavadi drove Saba to the Stamford Mall to turn Saba over to Fabriz for a regularly scheduled visit supervised by attorney Maria Varone, the appointed monitor. The defendant also was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">\u201cVarone indicated to police that during the visit, Fabriz went into one of the mall stores with Saba while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>she remained outside the store talking with the defendant. Varone further stated that although she was not sure about the time as she was not wearing a watch, she estimated that between 4:15 and 4:30 p.m., she became concerned as to Fabriz\u2019 whereabouts. Fabriz never emerged from the store. Varone and the defendant searched for Fabriz and Saba to no avail. Mirjavadi returned to the mall at the scheduled time of 5 p.m. to retrieve Saba, at which time Varone informed Mirjavadi that Fabriz had disappeared with Saba. Mirjavadi has had no contact with Saba since October 5, 1996.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 660-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The state subsequently charged the defendant with one count of custodial interference in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-97 and one count of conspiracy to commit custodial interference in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-97 (a) (2), for his role in the incident. The defendant moved to dismiss the information on the basis of Fabriz\u2019 relationship to Saba as her joint legal custodian and this court\u2019s holding in <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Marshak, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 667-68, that \u201c[t]he absence of a specific finding by the trial court that the defendant had conspired with or aided the children\u2019s father at a time after the father had been stripped of any legal entitlement to custody of the children is fatal to the [mother\u2019s] claim.\u201d The trial court thereafter concluded that the state had failed to prove that Mirjavadi had sole custody of Saba, and granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Marshak.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The state then appealed from the judgment of dismissal to this court. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 660, we reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case, concluding \u201cthat [the] court order permitting only limited, supervised visitation between a father and a child satisfie[d] the sole custody requirement of <em>Marshak.'\u201d </em>We also, however, overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Marshak, concluding that it had been based on a faulty premise. Id., 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Upon remand to the trial court, the defendant again moved to dismiss the charges against him, claiming that the reinstatement of his prosecution would violate the ex post facto clause of the constitution of the United States, article one, \u00a7 10,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as well as his right to fair notice as guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the due process clause of the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that retroactive application of <em>Vakilzaden </em>would violate the defendant\u2019s right to fair notice under the federal and state due process clauses. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard of review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is well established that when a \u201cdefendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>claims involve a question of law, we review them de novo.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 31 n.6, 770 A.2d 908 (2001). The issue of whether the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to fair notice were violated in the present case is a question of law; accordingly, our review is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The state claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because he had fair notice that his conduct was prohibited at the time that he engaged in it. Specifically, the state contends that the trial court improperly concluded that:</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">(1) <em>Vakilzaden </em>announced a new construction of the custodial interference statutes by overruling Marshak;</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">(2) this court\u2019s decision in <em>Vakilzaden </em>to overrule <em>Marshak </em>was unexpected and indefensible in light of existing law; and (3) the defendant could not have known his conduct to be unlawful. Because we conclude that the present case is readily distinguishable from <em>Marshak, </em>and the custodial interference statutes, standing alone, gave the defendant fair notice of the illegality of his conduct, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">All of the state\u2019s claims distill to a single, dispositive issue in this appeal, namely, whether the defendant had fair notice that his alleged acts of custodial interference were prohibited by law. \u201cThe underlying principle [of fair notice] is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S. Ct. 1697,12 L. Ed. 2d 894 (1964). \u201c[T]he touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as construed, made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant\u2019s conduct was criminal.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 267, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">WHETHER GENERAL STATUTES \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 AND 53a-98, STANDING ALONE, GAVE THE DEFENDANT FAIR NOTICE THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS PROHIBITED</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We begin by examining the text of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98, standing alone, to determine whether they \u201cmade it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant\u2019s conduct was criminal.\u2019\u2019 Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 53a-98 (a)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">(1) provides that a person is guilty of custodial interference in the second degree when \u201c[b]eing a relative of a child who is less than sixteen years old and intending to hold such child permanently or for a protracted period and knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices such child from his lawful custodian . . . .\u201d Section 53a-97 (a) (2) makes such conduct a first degree class D felony when it is committed \u201cby taking, enticing or detaining the child or person out of this state.\u201d The language of these statutes clearly encompasses Fabriz\u2019 conduct because he: (1) was the father of a one and one-half year old child; (2) intended to hold her for a protracted period of time; (3) knew that he had no right to do so under the court\u2019s order of supervised visitation;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (4) took her out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>United States to another country. Because this conduct falls within the ambit of activities proscribed by the statutes, and the defendant allegedly conspired with and aided Fabriz in accomplishing these acts of custodial interference, the statutes, standing alone, made it reasonably clear that the defendant\u2019s conduct was criminal at the time that he acted. Accordingly, the text of the statutes themselves provided the defendant with fair notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Moreover, the <em>Lanier </em>test for fair notice is expressed in the disjunctive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 230-31, 796 A.2d 502 (2002) (relying on first prong of <em>Lanier </em>test for conclusion that defendant had fair warning). For example, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Collins Entertainment Co., </em>349 S.C. 613, 625-26, 564 S.E.2d 653 (2002), the defendants claimed that they were deprived of fair warning regarding the illegality of operating video poker machines that offered jackpots in excess of $125 because the relevant statute concerning limitations on advertising such machines; S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-21-2804 (B) (West 2000); was unclear, and the only case construing the statute to include similar conduct was published after they had pursued their criminal actions. The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, held that a previous decision \u201cdid not announce a novel interpretation of [S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-21-2804 (B)] since the <em>language of the statute </em>gave sufficient notice to defendants that their conduct . . . could be considered a \u2018special inducement.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Collins Entertainment Co., </em>supra, 626. Therefore, the fact that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98, standing alone, provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>defendant with fair notice of the illegality of his conduct is sufficient to reverse the judgment of the trial court. The only question that remains is whether <em>Marshak\u2019s </em>treatment of the statutes undermines that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">WHETHER <em>MARSHAKS </em>TREATMENT OF \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 AND 53a-98 LIKEWISE MADE IT REASONABLY CLEAR THAT THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONDUCT WAS ILLEGAL</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The state claims that: (1) this court did not construe the custodial interference statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98, in <em>Marshak; </em>(2) even if it had, <em>Marshak </em>is not controlling in the present case because it is factually distinct; and (3) even if <em>Marshak </em>were controlling, the defendant should have known, on the basis of the statutes themselves and the interpretations of similar statutes by the courts of other states, that this court would overrule it. The defendant claims in response that: (1) <em>Marshak did </em>construe the custodial interference statutes; (2) <em>Marshak is </em>controlling because its holding explicitly prohibited custodial interference liability for legal custodians, and in the present case, Fabriz had legal, if not physical, custody of his daughter at the time of the incident; and (3) it is unreasonable to expect individuals to anticipate that case law will be overturned. Because we conclude that <em>Marshak </em>is factually distinct from the present case and therefore not controlling, we need not address the state\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">In <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Marshak, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 661-63, this court was asked to recognize a tort of child abduction or custodial interference. The defendant in that case had helped the husband of a married, American couple to abduct his children and take them overseas to Israel, Brazil and elsewhere. Id., 655-59. At the time of the incident, the couple was married, no dissolution action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>had been initiated, and both parents enjoyed joint legal and physical custody of their four children. Id., 654-55; see General Statutes \u00a7 45a-606. In light of these facts, we declined to recognize a tort of custodial interference because the fact that the father had not \u201cbeen stripped of <em>any legal entitlement </em>to custody of the children [at the time of the incident was] fatal to the [mother\u2019s] claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Marshak, </em>supra, 667-68. Our decision was predicated on the notion that unlawful custody is a necessary factual predicate to child abduction, and because there was joint as opposed to sole custody, there could be no unlawful custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Subsequently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 660, we concluded that <em>\u201cMarshak </em>may be distinguishable from the present case on the ground that a court order permitting only limited, supervised visitation between a father and a child satisfies the sole custody requirement of <em>Marshak.,,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Additionally, we took the opportunity to reexamine our holding in <em>Marshak </em>and concluded that the legal premise in <em>Marshak, </em>which immunized legal custodians from the possibility of liability for such a tort, was faulty. Id., 662-63. Accordingly, we determined that <em>Marshak </em>must be overruled, thereby opening the door for future liability for joint custodians, as well as those who conspire with them. Id., 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Unlike in <em>Marshak, </em>in the present case Mirjavadi already had initiated dissolution proceedings and had obtained a visitation order respecting Saba prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the incident of child abduction. That visitation order, granting Fabriz three hours of supervised visitation with his daughter per week,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in effect, stripped Fabriz of physical custody of Saba,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which previously had been one of his legal entitlements as a husband and father. Therefore, the present case is materially distinct from <em>Marshak </em>because Fabriz was not a joint custodian as envisioned by this court in Marshak;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the facts of the present case simply fall outside of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Moreover, because we did not construe those statutes in light of the holding of that case, this court\u2019s references to \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 in <em>Marshak </em>were dicta. They were included for the purpose of explaining the trial court\u2019s holding, recognizing a civil tort of child abduction, which we proceeded to reverse. Specifically, we stated in <em>Marshak </em>that we could not hold the nonparent defendant civilly liable for child abduction because \u201calthough a duty to a custodial parent may be inferred from \u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 of the penal code, the breach of such a duty would take place only if the alleged abductor in fact knows that he has no \u2018legal right\u2019 to the child\u2019s custody.\u201d <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Marshak, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 666. The father in <em>Marshak </em>had unabridged joint legal and physical custody of his children as a result of his ongoing marital relationship, in which the court had not yet been asked to intervene. Id., 667. By contrast, in the present case, the court-ordered visitation made it clear that Fabriz did not have a legal right to physical custody of Saba beyond the weekly supervised visitation. See footnote 14 of this opinion. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Marshak </em>in support of his claim that his constitutional right to fair notice was violated is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-12\"> The trial court granted the state permission to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96, which provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in the same manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d The state then appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-97 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of custodial interference in the first degree when he commits custodial interference in the second degree as provided in section 53a-98: (1) Under circumstances which expose the child or person taken or enticed from lawful custody or the child held after a request by the lawful custodian for his return to a risk that his safety will be endangered or his health materially impaired; or (2) by taking, enticing or detaining the child or person out of this state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201c(b) Custodial interference in the first degree is a class D felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-98 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of custodial interference in the second degree when: (1) Being a relative of a child who is less than sixteen years old and intending to hold such child permanently or for a protracted period and knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices such child from his lawful custodian; (2) knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices from lawful custody any incompetent person or any person entrusted by authority of law to the custody of another person or institution; or (3) knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he holds, keeps or otherwise refuses to return a child who is less than sixteen years old to such child\u2019s lawful custodian after a request by such custodian for the return of such child.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\"> The following are excerpts from the February 5, 1996 hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right.

We therefore regard the defendant\u2019s claim as arising under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \u00a7 1 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinvil, </em>270 Conn. 516, 518 n.1, 853 A.2d 105 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b790-11\"> \u201cIt is well settled that when reviewing a motion to dismiss a criminal information, we are required to assess the facts in the light most favorable to the state.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 660.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\"> We note that the defendant does not argue that he was misled by the statutes standing alone. In fact, he concedes that, in light of <em>Vakilzaden, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 53a-97 and 53a-98 permit joint custodians of a child to be guilty of custodial interference. His primary argument on appeal is that the statutes, as construed by <em>Marshak, </em>deprived him of fair notice at the time of his alleged criminal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\"> The defendant correctly points out that: (1) engaging in <em>wrongful </em>conduct is not necessarily tantamount to engaging in <em>unlawful </em>conduct; and</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">(2) knowingly violating a court order of visitation is not the same thing as knowingly violating custodial interference statutes. In the present case, however, all the defendant needed to know for liability to attach under \u00a7 53a-97 was that Fabriz had no legal right to take Saba for a protracted period of time. The trial court\u2019s limited supervised visitation order made the extent of Fabriz\u2019 entitlement to Saba, and therefore the illegality of his actions, quite clear. Accordingly, any contention that the defendant did not know that he was acting contrary to the language of the statute is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b793-6\"> See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>264 Conn. 286, 300, 823 A.2d 1184 (2003) (inteipreting use of \u201cor\u201d in statute to be disjunctive, making clauses separated by it independent and equal in weight); <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Universal Machine Co., </em>238 Conn. 637,645,679 A.2d 929 (1996) (interpreting \u201c \u2018the use of the disjunctive corqunction \u201cor\u201d [in an insurance contract as] unambiguously requiring] that either of the exclusions separated by the conjunction, if applicable, excludes coverage\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> The defendant argues that this court\u2019s use of \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cis\u201d in its statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vakilzaden, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 660, that the present case \u201cmay\u201d be distinguishable from <em>Marshak </em>implies equally that it may not be distinguishable. The defendant ignores, however, this court\u2019s statement in the very next paragraph, that we <em>could </em>have reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment on this ground alone; we simply decided not to stop there. Id. Read in the context of the complete decision, it is clear that the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d served to highlight two, mutually exclusive grounds for reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b796-5\"> The signed agreement in the file suggests that Fabriz and Mirjavadi initially agreed to five hours of supervised visitation per week at 49 Willard Terrace in Stamford, in the presence of Zak Mirjavadi, Agam Mirjavadi and the defendant. It appears that this agreement was modified in practice, allowing for longer periods of visitation. The actual amount of time allowed, however, is irrelevant, because it does not change the very limited, supervised nature of Fabriz\u2019 visitation order, which is of utmost significance to the issue of whether he had physical custody of Saba.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\"> The defendant correctly points out that there is no Connecticut case law explicitly construing a limited visitation order as being equivalent to an order of sole custody. This is due, in large part, to the unusual circumstances of the present case. Typically, visitation orders are not obtained independently of orders of temporary custody; see A. Kutldn, K. Hogan &amp; S. Oldham, 8 Connecticut Practice Series: Family Law and Practice (2d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 41.1, pp. 455-56; and they only remain in effect until a final custody order is entered, which often happens along with a dissolution order. See id., \u00a7 42.15, pp. 490-91. In the present case, however, Fabriz never asked for physical custody of Saba; instead, he sought visitation because, as he admitted, he \u201cha[d] not seen the child, been permitted to see the child, in four months,\u201d as she was residing with Mhjavadi. The fact that the trial court ultimately awarded Fabriz very limited, supervised visitation necessarily implies that Mirjavadi had received de facto sole physical custody. See footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\"> The defendant claims that \u201c[i]t beggars common sense to suggest that [he] should be held to have understood, prior to <em>Vakilzaden, </em>that the \u2018joint custodian\u2019 whom the <em>Marshak </em>court held immune from charges of custodian interference actually referred only to the subset of joint custodians whose custody was unqualified by an order providing for or limiting visitation.\u201d The holding of <em>Marshak, </em>however, clearly attributes the defendant\u2019s immunity from liability to the father\u2019s status as a joint custodian, which it defines as \u201c[t]he absence of a specific finding by the trial court that . . . the father had been stripped of any legal entitlement to custody of the children . . . .\u201d <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Marshak, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 667-68. Viewing the facts, as we must, in a light favorable to the state, the defendant in the present case was fully aware that the court-ordered supervised visitation arrangement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>between Fabriz and Mirjavadi stripped Fabriz of his legal entitlement to joint physical custody of Saba. As we conclude that the holding in <em>Marshak </em>was clear, the defendant cannot now rely on its ambiguity as a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
