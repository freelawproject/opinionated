The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of thirty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to this court pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the state violated his federal constitutional right to remain silent following his receipt of Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warnings by making references to his invocation of that right during testimony at trial, as well as during closing arguments, in violation of <em>Doyle </em>v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976). The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury regarding consciousness of guilt and burden of proof; (2) failed to conduct a substantive inquiry into an allegation of juror misconduct; and (3) violated General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h when it replaced an excused juror with the next alternate juror selected. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On December 8,1999, the defendant was standing in the hallway of his apartment complex on the comer of Sherman Avenue and Elm Street in New Haven when Bobby Bloodworth, a fellow high school student, stopped by to visit Sohanna Early, a friend who lived in the complex. When Bloodworth emerged from Early\u2019s apartment, he saw the defendant in the courtyard and talked to him briefly before leaving. As Bloodworth walked away from the courtyard, he saw two men approach on foot and a red car pull up to the curb. Anthony Tolliver, the victim, exited the car and jumped onto the short brick wall bordering the courtyard. The victim previously had purchased drugs from various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>dealers in the building, including the defendant. After hearing the victim jump down off the wall and footsteps coming up behind him, Bloodworth turned around and saw the defendant fire two shots, one of which struck the victim in the chest. Bloodworth immediately fled the scene. The victim, meanwhile, died on the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The next day, Detective John Velleca of the New Haven police department was called to Hillhouse High School because students were discussing the shooting. On the basis of his investigation there, Velleca attempted to find the defendant and Bloodworth for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Velleca first located the defendant, who was in custody on unrelated charges. After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant signed a waiver of rights form and agreed to talk to the police. The defendant proceeded to give statements to the police that, at trial, he subsequently admitted were lies. The defendant told the police that he was not in the vicinity of the shooting on the night in question, but instead he was with a friend named Iona. He denied being involved in any drug dealing, and he claimed that he had never seen the victim before. He also described his clothing on the night of the shooting as consisting of a grey sweatsuit and black boots. All of these statements conflicted with the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial testimony. At no point during the interview did the defendant implicate Blood-worth as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The police department investigated the defendant\u2019s alibi and found that it could not be corroborated. The police then confronted the defendant with this information. At that point, according to Velleca\u2019s testimony, the defendant terminated the interview.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Velleca subsequently located Bloodworth and brought him to the police station for questioning. Blood-worth was frightened and crying, and immediately asked to be enrolled in a witness protection program. He thereafter gave a tape-recorded statement about the shooting and identified the defendant as the shooter from a photoboard. Several days later, on December 13,1999, the defendant was arrested in connection with the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">At trial, Bloodworth, an admitted drug dealer, testified against the defendant. He indicated that, shortly after the shooting, the defendant paged him and asked him whether he had told anyone about the incident. Early similarly testified at trial about the events surrounding the shooting. Although she did not implicate the defendant as the shooter, since she had not witnessed the homicide, she testified that the defendant\u2019s reaction to what had transpired was, \u201cShit happens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Additionally, several other acquaintances of the defendant testified that they had seen him with a weapon in the days leading up to the shooting. Tyrone Figgs testified that he had seen the defendant with a .38 special revolver three days before the shooting. This was supported by the testimony of another witness, Angel Rich, who saw the defendant carrying a gun one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>week before the shooting. Although Rich was not sufficiently familiar with guns to describe the specific caliber of the weapon, her physical description of the gun was consistent with Flggs\u2019 testimony. Their testimony also was consistent with the state\u2019s firearms expert who testified that the bullet that struck and killed the victim likely was fired by either a .357 magnum revolver or a .38 special revolver, both of which have a similar silver appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The defendant thereafter testified that the story he had given to police when he was first taken into custody on December 9, 1999, was entirely false. His testimony at trial implicated Bloodworth as the shooter. Specifically, the defendant testified that Bloodworth was in the business of selling drugs along with an acquaintance by the name of Drew, and that, on the day of the shooting, he was playing the role of armed lookout when the victim approached and jumped onto the wall. The defendant admitted that he did not see Bloodworth actually shoot the victim, but he saw Bloodworth pull out a gun and raise it immediately before the defendant heard shots fired. The defendant further testified that he was merely an innocent bystander trying to leave the scene in order to get dinner when the homicide occurred. Thereafter, the jury convicted the defendant of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm and carrying a pistol without a permit, and the trial court sentenced him to thirty-five years imprisonment on the first count and a concurrent three year term of imprisonment for the second, for a total effective sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary in the context of the defendant\u2019s specific claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">WHETHER THE STATE\u2019S REFERENCES TO THE DEFENDANT\u2019S <em>POST-MIRANDA </em>SILENCE VIOLATED <em>DOYLE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that the state violated his federal constitutional right to remain silent following his receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings by making repeated references to his invocation of that right during testimony at trial as well as during closing argument. The defendant argues that these violations were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant contends that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 618-19, that <em>post-Miranda </em>silence cannot be used to impeach a defendant or as affirmative proof of guilt, was violated when: (1) the trial court admitted testimony suggesting that the defendant invoked his right to silence in direct response to the police confronting him about the discrepancies in his statements about his alibi; (2) the state impeached the defendant with questions about his <em>post-Miranda </em>failure to implicate Bloodworth; and (3) the state, during closing argument, emphasized the defendant\u2019s failure to relay to the police the version of events he testified to at trial. The state claims, in response, that: (1) this claim is unreviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), because the record is inadequate with respect to whether the defendant asserted his right to silence; (2) there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation because the defendant waived his right to remain silent; and (3) any possible <em>Doyle </em>violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with the state insofar as we conclude that there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation. We will address each of the defendant\u2019s specific claims of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Preliminarily, we note that the defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial. Accordingly, he now seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Although there is conflicting evidence on the issue of whether the defendant asserted his right to remain silent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that the alleged improprieties are not <em>Doyle </em>violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 619, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violate [s] the [d]ue [p]rocess [c]lause of the [fourteenth Amendment.\u201d \u201cThe point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.\u201d <em>Wainwrightv. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 292, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986). \u201cAs such, silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings is insolubly ambiguous because it may constitute a reliance upon those rights rather than a tacit admission that the accused has an insufficient defense or explanation for his conduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>v. <em>Berube, </em>256 Conn. 742, 752-53, 775 A.2d 966 (2001), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985). \u201cReferences to one\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent [are] not always constitutionally impermissible, however.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174,183, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986). We have allowed them \u201cin certain limited and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 716-17 n.30, 759 A.2d 995 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court violated <em>Doyle </em>by improperly permitting the state to present evidence that he had terminated an interview with police in response to information that his alibi was false. Specifically, the defendant claims that the following exchange during direct examination between the state and its witness, Detective Velleca, was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Did you confront [the defendant] with that information [that his alibi\u2019s story conflicted with his story]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\u201c[Velleca]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: What, if anything, did he do at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201c[Velleca]: He terminated the interview.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">The defendant did not object to this line of questioning at trial. The defendant now claims, however, that the introduction of such evidence improperly imposed a penalty upon him for invoking his right to silence in contravention of <em>Doyle. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">These facts are similar to the facts in <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 182-83, in which the defendant initially voluntarily spoke to the police regarding his participation in a homicide, and thereafter abruptly terminated the interview. In <em>Casey, </em>as in the present case, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>elicited testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent from a detective at trial in the course of questioning regarding his investigation of the crime. Id., 182. This court held that the testimony had been offered for the permissible purpose of relaying \u201cthe sequence of events as they unfolded . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 183. Similarly, we conclude that the exchange in the present case was proper because it merely described the investigative efforts of police. Accordingly, there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The defendant next claims that the state violated <em>Doyle </em>when it referred to the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence during its cross-examination of the defendant at trial. Specifically, the defendant objects to the following colloquy concerning the December 9,1999 interrogation of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And at no time, and you\u2019re certain of that, at no time did you ever tell police officers that night or any other night that you had seen Bobby Bloodworth raise up a gun out of his pants and then hear shots shortly thereafter, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: You never told police that night or any night thereafter about having met Bobby Blood-worth on the street in the cars later that night, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: You never told police that night or any other night about your claim that supposedly Bobby Bloodworth contacted you and told you supposedly that to keep your mouth shut, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Never told police nothing about that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>We note, once again, that the defendant did not object to these questions at trial, but now claims that the impeachment was improper because it referenced his failure to mention Bloodworth, the person he testified was the real shooter, to police, both during his initial interview and after the defendant had terminated the interview. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">We conclude that the challenged references fall within the exception to <em>Doyle </em>articulated in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S. Ct. 2180, 65 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1980). In <em>Anderson, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that <em>\u201cDoyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements. Such questioning makes no unfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been induced to remain silent. As to the subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not remained silent at all.\u201d Id. The court in <em>Anderson </em>held impeachment on a prior inconsistent statement<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to be proper because \u201c[t]he quoted colloquy, taken as a whole, [did] not refe[r] to the [defendant\u2019s] exercise of his right to remain silent; rather [it asked] the [defendant] why, if [his trial testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>mony] were true, he didn\u2019t tell the officer that he stole the decedent\u2019s car from the tire store parking lot instead of telling him that he took it from the street.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 408-409. Essentially, the court concluded that the impeachment questions were proper because they were not intended to attach meaning to silence, \u201cbut to elicit an explanation for a prior inconsistent statement.\u201d Id., 409. \u201cWhere [a] defendant elects to speak to the police and gives statements that he later contradicts at trial, a prosecutor\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s failure to give the exculpatory account before trial does not draw a negative inference from the defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent but rather from his prior inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donnat, </em>311 F.3d 99, 104-105 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Likewise, the challenged colloquy in the present case refers to a prior inconsistent statement voluntarily made by the defendant to the police. During his December 9, 1999 interview with police, the defendant stated that he could not confirm or deny reports of a shooting in his neighborhood because he was not in the area; essentially, he knew nothing about the shooting. At trial, however, the defendant changed his testimony on this subject and implicated Bloodworth in the shooting death of the victim. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Anderson, </em>the state properly could question the defendant on this point for the limited purpose of eliciting an explanation for his prior inconsistent statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no <em>Doyle </em>violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim under <em>Doyle </em>is that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s references during closing argument to the defendant\u2019s failure to mention Bloodworth before trial were improper. Specifically, the defendant challenges the following comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: . . . And don\u2019t you think, ladies and gentlemen, that if the defendant really was telling you the truth, that back in December 9th, 1999, when confronted with an accusation that, hey, we\u2019re investigating the murder of somebody, where were you? And you give a phony alibi, and you come back and say, hey, that\u2019s not the truth. But you\u2019re going to take the weight for somebody. Why isn\u2019t he\u2014why didn\u2019t he tell the police at that point in time Bobby Bloodworth was the guy who did the shooting, not me? Why didn\u2019t he tell when he was arrested on December 13th, 1999, Bobby Bloodworth did the shooting? Don\u2019t lay it on me. Doesn\u2019t it offend your common sense to suggest that he has waited all this time\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m going to object to that, Your Honor. That is absolutely improper about when he made disclosures to other people that are not a part of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u201cThe Court: Sustained. Disregard that argument. It has no weight or application in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: [The defendant] told you that after December 9th and December 13th, he never told any police officers in connection with this case that Bobby Bloodworth was involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The defendant contends that these comments deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">As we previously stated, <em>\u201cDoyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements . . . [because] [s]uch questioning makes no unfair use of silence . . . .\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 447 U.S. 408. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 185, this court held that prosecutorial comment during closing argument is analogous to prosecutorial comment during cross-examination for the purpose of the application of this rule. As all of the objectionable references during closing argument concerned the defendant\u2019s prior inconsistent statement, namely, that he knew nothing about the shooting, they did not constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Moreover, we note that the trial court sustained an objection to the comments and immediately instructed the jury to disregard them. \u201cIn the absence of any indication to the contrary, we presume that the jury followed the court\u2019s instruction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 141, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). Accordingly, even if a violation had occurred, it likely would have been mitigated by this jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S JURY INSTRUCTIONS DILUTED THE STATE\u2019S BURDEN OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The defendant next claims that certain of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly diluted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, in the case of the first instruction, burdened the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety . . . and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>269 Conn. 481,488,849 A.2d 760 (2004). \u201cThe pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... [It should] not [be] critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 360-61, 857 A.2d 808 (2004). \u201cIn this inquiry we focus on the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said not only in light of the entire charge, but also within the context of the entire trial. . . . Moreover, as to unpreserved claims of constitutional error in jury instructions, we have stated that under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>[a] defendant may prevail . . . only if ... it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 488. Under the second prong, \u201c[u]npreserved nonconstitutional claims ... do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear' a constitutional label.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 289-90, 623 A.2d 42 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that \u201cin addition to considering the defendant\u2019s false statements as \u2018circumstantial evidence of [his] consciousness of guilt,\u2019 it could actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>\u2018use them as independent evidence of his guilt of the crime charged.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Specifically, the defendant contends that the instruction was improper because: (1) instructions permitting a jury to use its disbelief of a defendant\u2019s testimony as direct evidence of guilt are improper; and (2) this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state contends, in response, that the trial court\u2019s instruction was proper because it concerned a permissive inference, which does not rise to the level of a constitutional claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We note that the defendant failed to preserve this claim, but nonetheless seeks appellate review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Although the record is adequate for review, we conclude that the claim is not reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because it is not of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">This court previously has recognized that unpreserved challenges to jury instructions that <em>mandate </em>inferences \u201cadverse to a defendant may sufficiently implicate constitutional rights to satisfy the second condition\u201d of <em>Golding. State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>219 Conn. 160, 165, 592 A.2d 382 (1991). By contrast, instructions addressing <em>permissive </em>inferences are not of constitutional magnitude. Id., 165-66. The trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury in the present case stated that \u201cyou are permitted, but you are not required to conclude that such statements are circumstantial evidence of consciousness of guilt. And if you chose, you may use them as independent evidence of his guilt of the crime charged.\u201d This was a permissive instruction. In it, the trial court merely outlined the inferential steps that a jury was permitted to make with respect to consciousness of guilt, namely: \u201c(1) from behavior to [false testimony]; (2) from [false testimony] to consciousness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>270 Conn. 92, 105, 851 A.2d 291 (2004). Accordingly, this claim is not reviewable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the actual outcome of the case was secondary to its obligation to give both parties a fair trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the preliminary instruction reduced the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by \u201cshifting the jury\u2019s focus away from its sole . . . function, i.e., to act as a critical \u2018check\u2019 against the arbitrary and oppressive exercise of governmental power . . . .\u201d In response, the state contends that this unpreserved claim fails to raise a constitutional violation because the trial court\u2019s final jury instructions regarding the state\u2019s burden of proof were thorough and proper. The defendant again seeks review of this unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>Golding. </em>Although the claim is reviewable, we agree with the state that it is not a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 614, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991), this court held that the significant factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>determining whether prehminary instructions warrant reversal is whether the jury in a particular case \u201cwas fully and properly instructed at the critical time, after all the evidence and after the arguments of counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Even in cases wherein the preliminary instructions were held to be incomplete and improvidently timed, we have not found reversible error where the final jury instructions were complete and appropriate. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 458, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 184-85, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 537, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s preliminary instruction to the jury in the present case reduced the state\u2019s burden of proof. To the contrary, it likely focused the potential jurors on critically, but impartially, analyzing the evidence presented by both parties, which is crucial to determining whether the state met its burden of proof, instead of taking a result-oriented approach that easily could have been improperly influenced by preconceived opinions. Moreover, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the instructions initially had misled the jury in some way, this was cured by the trial court\u2019s lengthy and accurate final instructions on the state\u2019s burden of proof. There was no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The defendant\u2019s final constitutional claim regarding jury instructions is that the trial court improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof by making two comments, only one of which was preserved for review on appeal, suggesting that it was the jury\u2019s task to decide the guilt or innocence of the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the defendant objects to this suggestion because, he contends, it improperly focused the jury\u2019s attention on whether it thought he was guilty instead of whether the state had met its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim merits little review. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 87, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 26 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1970), the United States Supreme Court explicitly stated that the history of trial by jury reveals \u201ca long tradition ... of relying on a body of one\u2019s peers to determine guilt or innocence as a safeguard against arbitrary law enforcement.\u201d Moreover, taken in the context of the entire jury instruction, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s reference to the jury deciding \u201cguilt or innocence\u201d reasonably could not have misled the juiy, as the trial court subsequently emphasized the fact that the state has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant violated the law with respect to each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO CONDUCT A SUBSTANTIVE INQUIRY INTO ALLEGATIONS OF JUROR MISCONDUCT VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court violated his constitutional right to a fair trial by improperly failing to conduct a substantive inquiry into allegations of potential juror misconduct. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s preliminary inquiry into the relationship between a juror and an individual in the courtroom who she claimed to recognize was insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ficient. The defendant did not preserve this issue for appeal and therefore seeks review of his constitutional claim pursuant to <em>Golding. </em>Although this claim is reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding, </em>we conclude that there was no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. On the morning of June 26, 2002, before the state called one of its witnesses, the trial court indicated on the record that one of the jurors had informed the clerk that she recognized someone in the audience on the state\u2019s side of the courtroom. After conferring with counsel for both parties in chambers, the trial court asked counsel whether they wanted it to conduct further inquiry. Defense counsel asked that the name and relationship, of the individual in the audience be placed on the record. After initially objecting, the state\u2019s attorney stated for the record that it was his belief that the individual was the sister of the victim. This satisfied everyone, and defense counsel specifically requested that the court make no further inquiry, stating \u201cwe\u2019ll waive any inquiry by the court into the specifics of that relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u201cJury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution .... [T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Centeno, </em>259 Conn. 75, 81, 787 A.2d 537 (2002). \u201cIt is well established, however, that not every incident of juror misconduct requires a new trial. . . . [D]ue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one. . . . The question is whether or not the misconduct has prejudiced the defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial. . . . The defendant has been prejudiced if the misbehavior is such to make it probable that the juror\u2019s mind was influenced by it so as to render him or her an unfair and prejudicial juror.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>248 Conn. 39, 47, 726 A.2d 513 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 526, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995), we held that any allegation of juror misconduct necessitates, at a minimum, some form of preliminary inquiry on the record. The form and scope of such inquiry is left to the discretion of the trial court based on a consideration of multiple factors, including: (1) the private interest of the defendant; (2) a risk and value assessment of additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the government\u2019s interest. See id., 529-30. In outlining these factors, we also acknowledged, however, that \u201c[i]n the proper circumstances, the trial court may discharge its obligation simply by notifying the defendant and the state of the allegations, providing them with an adequate opportunity to respond and stating on the record its reasons for the limited form and scope of the proceedings held.\u201d Id., 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The trial court\u2019s actions in the present case clearly satisfied the preliminary inquiry required by <em>Brown. </em>After learning about the alleged misconduct, the trial court, on the record, alerted both parties to it, allowed them to respond and to request a more extensive inquiry, and resolved the issue to their mutual satisfaction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This approach was sufficient because: (1) the defendant explicitly stated that he did not want the trial court to conduct any further inquiry; (2) there was little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>net value in conducting a hearing with the juror in question because the likelihood of prejudice to the defendant from a juror\u2019s recognition of a member of the audience, as opposed to one of the parties or witnesses, was minimal; and (3) additional inquiry would have delayed the trial unnecessarily. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by conducting a limited inquiry into the allegation of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Moreover, \u201c[w]here . . . the trial court was in no way responsible for the juror misconduct . . . we have repeatedly held that a defendant who offers proof of juror misconduct bears the burden of proving that actual prejudice resulted from that misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 47. The defendant has not made any such showing of prejudice in his brief or at oral argument before this court, and we decline to exercise our inherent supervisory powers, as requested by the defendant, to extend this requirement of a preliminary inquiry any further at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING AN EXCUSED JUROR VIOLATED \u00a7 54-82h AND CONSTITUTED PLAIN ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that during jury selection, the trial court improperly substituted an excused juror with the next juror selected instead of temporarily leaving the spot open and subsequently filling it with an alternate chosen by lot, as required by \u00a7 54-82h.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Specifically, the defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the procedures set forth in \u00a7 54-82h are mandatory, and the trial court committed plain error by not following them. The state, in response, claims that: (1) \u00a7 54-82h only applies once a jury already has been completely selected, which it had not been in the present case; and (2) if the trial court\u2019s actions were improper, the defendant cannot prevail because (a) he induced the error, and (b) he failed to show prejudice. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. On the morning of June 14, 2002, before resuming voir dire to select the twelfth juror, the trial court notified counsel that the eleventh juror had requested to be excused from the case because of domestic problems. Counsel for both parties agreed to excuse him, and the trial court notified counsel that both parties had at least one half of their challenges left. As the excused juror had been the last one chosen, the trial court suggested that counsel could elect either (1) to go in sequence, strike the excused juror, and fill his spot with the next selected juror, or (2) to skip over the eleventh juror, choose the twelfth, and subsequently fill the position by lot from a group of alternates. The decision was left to defense counsel, who indicated that the defendant \u201cwould prefer to go forward and just continue selecting the main jurors and then select the alternates and not draw the\u2014draw a main juror by lot.\u201d Accordingly, the next juror selected became the eleventh juror on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201cThe plain error doctrine has been codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, which provides in relevant part that [t]he court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines . . . that the decision is . . . erroneous in law. . . . The plain error doctrine is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>LaBrec, </em>270 Conn. 548, 559, 854 A.2d 1 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In the present case, the defendant has failed to make such a showing. Without deciding the issue of whether the trial court properly applied the statute, we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to a new trial because he induced the trial court to take the very actions he now criticizes as erroneous, and he has failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting therefrom. Ordinarily, actions that are induced by a party cannot be grounds for appealable error; therefore, they do not merit review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 67, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). A defendant may not present unpreserved claims of relief from induced error because review of induced error is not permissible under <em>Golding. State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 106, 848 A.2d 445 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>270 Conn. 55, 67, 850 A.2d 1040 (2004) (\u201c[t]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal [after] . . . his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). This court previously has held that the process for selecting and dismissing alternate jurors, including \u00a7 54-82h (c), does not implicate constitutional rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>LaBrec, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 558-59. Indeed, the defendant, in his brief, does not suggest that his constitutional rights were implicated by the alleged violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c). Accordingly, as the defendant has failed to demonstrate manifest injustice, he cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...

Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\"> The defendant\u2019s testimony at trial conflicted with Velleca\u2019s recollection of the interview on this crucial point. According to the defendant, he never was confronted with information about his alibi and he never terminated the interview, as Velleca had suggested. To the contrary, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>claims that the police simply did not ask him any further questions. The following is an excerpt from the slate\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant with respect to this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And, in fact, Mr. Alston, when police officers went to check on your alibi or your claims as to where you had been, and at one time you had been there, they came back and told you that that was not accurate, didn't they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Well, actually no, they didn\u2019t tell me that. They, when they came back they just brought me downstairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: They never indicated to you that they checked out your story and that it proved false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, they ain\u2019t never tell me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-13\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Never said that to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-14\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, they didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> During trial, there was conflicting testimony regarding whether the defendant asserted his right to remain silent. Detective Velleca testified that the defendant had terminated his interview with police after having been confronted with unfavorable information about his alibi. This constitutes a recognized assertion of the right to silence. The defendant, however, thereafter denied that he had terminated the interview, and testified that the police simply did not ask him any further questions; see footnote 3 of this opinion; which suggests that the defendant never asserted the right. This conflicting testimony is the only evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to silence in the record, and there was no accompanying fact finding. On appeal, the defendant now claims that after initially having waived his right to silence, he reasserted it during his interview with police, making the state\u2019s reference to it at trial a <em>Doyle </em>violation. This is an Important issue because if the defendant had never asserted his right to silence, the state\u2019s reference to it was not improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 360 n.24, 696 A.2d 944 (1997) (\u201cit is well established that the principle of <em>Doyle </em>... is not violated in situations . . . where the defendant has chosen not to remain silent\u201d [citation omitted]).
