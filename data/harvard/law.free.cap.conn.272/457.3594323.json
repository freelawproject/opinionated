A referee employed by the commission found in Mather\u2019s favor after concluding that Mather had established a prima facie case of discrimination and that the department\u2019s two nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision not to promote Mather, namely, that he had performed poorly during his interview for the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>engineer position and that he lacked a professional engineer license, were pretextual. The department appealed from the referee\u2019s decision to the trial court, which concluded that the referee properly had determined, first, that Mather had established a prima facie case of discrimination and, second, that the department\u2019s purported reliance on Mather\u2019s substandard interview performance was a pretext for discrimination. The trial court also concluded, however, that Mather\u2019s failure to obtain a professional engineer license was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the department\u2019s decision not to promote him to principal engineer. The trial court then remanded the case to the referee for reconsideration of Mather\u2019s claim in light of that court\u2019s decision to sustain one of the referee\u2019s findings of pretext but not the other. The department filed this appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law in view of the court\u2019s determination that Mather\u2019s failure to obtain a professional engineer license was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the department\u2019s decision not to promote him. We agree with the department and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of this appeal. In 1997, Mather, a native of Sri Lanka, was employed by the department as a supervising engineer in the soils and foundations unit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The soils and foundations unit is responsible for ensuring that the ground upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>highways, bridges and buildings are constructed is capable of supporting those structures. Thus, the engineering work performed by the soils and foundations unit is highly technical in nature and extremely important to the safety of people traversing the state\u2019s highways and bridges and people occupying state buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In the summer of 1997, Theodore Batko, the principal engineer in the soils and foundations unit, announced that he was planning to retire. After Batko\u2019s announcement, Joseph Obara, the manager of the department\u2019s design services division, notified Mather, as well as two other supervising engineers, Leo Fontaine and George Gonzalez, that Batko\u2019s replacement would be appointed on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">For several years prior to 1997, persons holding the position of principal engineer in the soils and foundations unit were required to hold a professional engineer license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although internal discussions ensued among department officials as to whether to continue that requirement after Batko\u2019s retirement, the decision was made to do so, and Mather was notified of that decision in August, 1997. Upon learning of the decision to continue the license requirement, Mather, who previously had failed to achieve a passing score on the professional engineer license examination, indicated that he intended to retake the test. Mather subsequently took and failed the examination in October, 1997, October, 1998, and April, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In late August, 1997, Obara promoted Fontaine to principal engineer in the soils and foundations unit on a provisional basis. Obara explained that, of the three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>applicants, Fontaine was the only one who held a professional engineer license, and because such a license was required for the position, Fontaine was the only candidate eligible for the provisional appointment. In November, 1997, the department issued a job posting for the position of principal engineer in the soils and foundations unit. The posting expressly stated that the successful applicant for the position would be required to hold a professional engineer license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">After the job announcement was posted, Obara advised Mather and Gonzalez that, although they could apply and interview for the permanent principal engineer position, the successful applicant would be required to hold a professional engineer license at the time of his or her appointment. Applicants were to be evaluated, however, without regard to whether they held a license at the time that they applied for the position. Only three of the six applicants for the position held a professional engineer license.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In December, 1997, interviews were conducted in accordance with the job posting. Although the interviews were conducted by a panel, Obara was the only panel member to ask questions of the applicants. During Mather\u2019s interview, Obara asked Mather about his foreign education and his work experience in England and Sri Lanka. Each panel member independently evaluated and ranked each applicant. The panel ranked Fontaine first and Mather a distant second. The panel found that Mather was deficient in technical, supervisory and oral communication skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Following the interviews, and after a review of the selection process by the department\u2019s affirmative action and personnel divisions, Obara announced, in January, 1998, that the panel had selected Fontaine to fill the permanent principal engineer position. Mather thereafter filed a complaint with the commission alleging, inter alia, that he had not been promoted on account of his race, that is, Asian, and national origin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 46a-60 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (a) (1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>After a hearing on Mather\u2019s complaint, the referee concluded that Mather had met his burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination based on race and national origin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The referee also concluded that the department had met its burden of producing nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision not to promote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Mather, namely, that he had interviewed poorly and that he did not possess a professional engineer license. The referee determined, however, that both of these reasons \u201cwere pretextual and masked discriminatory intent [not to promote Mather] based on his race and national origin.\u201d Accordingly, the referee rendered a decision in Mather\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The department appealed to the trial court from the decision of the referee in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 46a-94a (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court first concluded that the referee properly had determined that Mather was qualified for the position of principal engineer in the soils and foundations unit, and, accordingly, that Mather had met his burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination based on race and national origin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court further concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the referee reasonably had determined that the department\u2019s reliance on Mather\u2019s purportedly substandard interview performance as a reason not to promote Mather was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The trial court, however, rejected the referee\u2019s finding of pretext with respect to the department\u2019s other proffered reason for its decision not to promote Mather, namely, that he did not possess a professional engineer license. In concluding that the finding of pretext was not reasonably supported by the referee\u2019s factual findings, the trial court noted, in particular, that the referee\u2019s \u201cfindings indicate that the department\u2019s requirement of a . . . license for the [position of principal engineer in the soils and foundations unit] has never changed\u2014it has always been a prerequisite for the position.\u201d The trial court also noted that the findings of the referee \u201cindicate that prior to the establishment of the [principal engineer] position, persons holding equivalent positions to [that of principal engineer] had a [professional engineer] license in the soils and foundations unit.\u201d Although the trial court acknowledged that the evidence adduced at the hearing before the referee also indicated that, on occasion, department officials had considered eliminating the license requirement for that position, the requirement consistently had been maintained. The trial court stated: \u201cUnder these circumstances, the court cannot concur in the referee\u2019s conclusion that the [professional engineer] license requirement for the soils and foundations unit was applied in an inconsistent or discriminatory manner or was given by the department as a false reason for the decision not to appoint Mather.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Notwithstanding this determination, the trial court stated that it \u201cmust question whether the prima facie case of discrimination combined with the [one] legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>mate finding of pretext ... is enough to sustain the referee\u2019s finding of intentional discrimination.\u2019\u2019 The trial court therefore remanded the case for a determination by the referee as to \u201cwhether Mather\u2019s prima facie case, taken with the finding of pretext that the court has approved, is sufficient to find intentional discrimination by the department.\u201d The trial court also directed the referee, on remand, to \u201cconsider whether the requirement of a professional engineer license, the legitimate reason advanced by the department, was independent [of] or intertwined with the pretextual reason . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On appeal, the department claims, inter alia, that the trial court improperly remanded the case to the referee in light of that court\u2019s determination that Mather\u2019s failure to obtain a professional engineer license was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the department\u2019s decision not to promote him to the position of principal engineer. Although neither Mather nor the commission challenges the trial court\u2019s rejection of the referee\u2019s finding of pretext with respect to the professional engineer license requirement and Mather\u2019s failure to obtain a license, they both agree with the trial court that a remand is necessary to allow the referee to determine whether the prima facie case established by Mather, in combination with the finding of pretext that was sustained by the trial court, supports a finding that the department intentionally discriminated against Mather on the basis of his race and national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We agree with the department that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in light of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Mather\u2019s faitee to obtain a professional engineer license constituted a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to deny Mather the promotion to the principal engineer position.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S. Ct. 209, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000), the United States Supreme Court explained that, \u201c[i]n appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation [offered by the employer for the adverse employment action] that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. . . . Moreover, once the employer\u2019s justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 147. The court noted, however, that \u201c[t]his is not to say that such a showing by the [complainant] will always be adequate to sustain a jury\u2019s finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the [complainant] has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the [employer\u2019s] explanation, no rational fact-finder could conclude that the action was discriminatory. <em>For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As we have indicated, neither Mather nor the commission has contested the trial court\u2019s determination that, contrary to the finding of the referee, Mather\u2019s failure to obtain a professional engineer license was a legitimate, nondiscriminatoiy reason for the department\u2019s decision to deny him the promotion to the principal engineer position. Thus, because it is uncontested that Mather\u2019s attainment of the professional engineer license was an absolute prerequisite to his promotion, and because Mather did not obtain that license, he simply was not eligible for the promotion. In other words, because the record conclusively reveals a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the department\u2019s decision, Mather cannot prevail on his claim that he was the victim of unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>In remanding the case for further proceedings before the referee, the trial court relied on <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Acme-Evans Co., </em>51 F.3d 64 (7th Cir. 1995), in which the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals explained, in dictum, that, \u201c[t]here may be cases in which the multiple grounds offered by the [employer] for the adverse action of which the [complainant] complains are so intertwined, or the pretextua! character of one of them so fishy and suspicious, that the [complainant] could [prevail].\u201d Id., 70. <em>Russell </em>is inapposite because, as we have explained, the fact that Mather did not obtain a professional engineer license was an absolute bar to his promotion and, therefore, served as an independent, nonpretextuai reason for the department\u2019s decision not to promote him. In such circumstances, there is no likelihood of any interrelationship between any pretextual<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and nonpretextuai reasons for the department\u2019s adverse employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\"> The department appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> The soils and foundations unit is one of five units in the design services division of the office of engineering within the department\u2019s bureau of engineering and highway operations.
