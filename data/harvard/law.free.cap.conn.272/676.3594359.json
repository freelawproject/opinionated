Id., 667, 673. Accordingly, we dismissed the motions to stay as moot. <em>In re Application II, </em>supra, 675. In our opinion dismissing the motions to stay as moot, we indicated that this opinion explaining in greater detail the reasons for the dismissal of the motions would follow. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The underlying facts and procedural history of this case are set forth in our decisions in <em>In re Application I, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 653, and <em>State v. Ross, </em>272 Conn. 577, 863 A.2d 654 (2005). In summary, these cases involve attempts by the plaintiffs in error to obtain next friend status in the underlying criminal proceeding against Michael Ross in order to pursue postconviction relief on his behalf, including participation in the ongoing consolidated habeas litigation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on behalf of several defendants who have been sentenced to death. We have concluded that they have no standing to do so. See <em>In re Application I, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 667; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 611. The plaintiffs in error have argued in their briefs in these proceedings that Michael Ross cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>waive his right to pursue further postconviction remedies and, therefore, his execution must be stayed. We disagree. As we have noted, we have concluded, and the dissenting justices agree, that the plaintiffs in error have no standing to bring habeas proceedings on behalf of Michael Ross and, therefore, the habeas petitions properly were dismissed. <em>See In re Application I, </em>supra, 663, 667. The motions for stay were filed in conjunction with the writs of error that have been dismissed. Accordingly, the motions to stay must be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The dissenting justices conclude, however, that: (1) General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> creates a nonwaivable right to reap the benefit of litigation raised by others claiming that their sentences of death were the result of \u201cpassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) this court has an independent institutional duty to exercise its supervisory powers to prevent the execution of a death sentence that may be the product of an arbitrary factor. We disagree. It simply is unprecedented for this court to conclude that, although it has no jurisdiction over the case before it, it may act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>in that case to enter a stay in a separate proceeding. Moreover, the dissenting justices misconstrue \u00a7 53a-46b as providing for mandatory review of postconviction proceedings in death penalty cases. That statute provides only for mandatory sentence review, which already has taken place in the criminal proceeding against Michael Ross and has resulted in the affirmance of his death sentences. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 849 A.2d 648 (2004). In addition, the dissenting justices\u2019 conclusions are inconsistent with our cases indicating that participation in the consolidated litigation is voluntary; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 377-79, 864 A.2d 666 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 226-34, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>264 Conn. 327, 405, 824 A.2d 778, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1055,124 S. Ct. 819, 157 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 499, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000) <em>(Cobb II); State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>234 Conn. 735, 761-63, 663 A.2d 948 (1995) <em>(Cobb I); </em>and with the well established principle that, even in death penalty cases, constitutional claims and claims raising the specter that the death sentence was the result of an arbitrary factor are waivable. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 154 n.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Whether \u00a7 53a-46b (b) creates a nonwaivable right to reap the benefit of litigation brought by others claiming that their sentences of death were the result of \u201cpassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">To provide context for our discussion of the statute, we begin our analysis with a history of the consolidated habeas litigation. The issue of racial disparity in the administration of the death penalty statute in Connecticut was first raised in <em>Cobb I, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 735. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The defendant in that case, Sedrick Cobb, \u201chad moved for enlargement of the class of similar cases that [this court would] consider in determining whether his death sentence [was] justified in light of the prohibition against disproportionality provided by ... \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3).\u201d Id., 737. Specifically, Cobb requested that we consider \u201call cases prosecuted in Connecticut after October 1, 1973, in which a capital felony <em>could have been charged </em>pursuant to ... \u00a7 53a-46b and which resulted in a homicide conviction, following a plea or trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 738. Cobb argued that this expanded universe of cases was \u201cnecessary to enable this court to evaluate his claim that race has an impermissible effect on capital sentencing decisions in Connecticut . . . .\u201d Id. We rejected Cobb\u2019s claim, concluding that \u201cthe legislature did not intend proportionality review to encompass a comparison [of] all homicide cases prosecuted since 1973 in which a capital felony could have been charged.\u201d Id., 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We also concluded, however, that Cobb could have raised his racial disparity claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1). Id., 761. Under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), however, \u201cit would have been necessary for [Cobb] to have made his statistical record in the trial court, and to have subjected it to a full evidentiary hearing, as in <em>[.McCleskey </em>v. <em>Zant, </em>580 F. Sup. 338 (N.D. Ga. 1984), aff'd sub nom. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987)], before presenting it on appeal. To hold that [Cobb] could raise this claim on appeal under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), without having first created an adequate factual basis in the trial court, would be incorrect for many of the same reasons that we reject [Cobb\u2019s] claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3), because it would assume, without any clear indication, that the legislature intended this court to engage in the same extraordinary process of data gathering and fact-finding. Thus, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>subdivision (1) and subdivision (3) of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) ordinarily contemplate not data gathering and fact-finding by or under the aegis of this court from disputed evidence, which [Cobb\u2019s] claim would require, but evaluation by this court of the trial court record of the case on appeal, and with respect to subdivision (3), of the trial court records of similar cases.\u201d <em>Cobb I, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We also concluded in <em>Cobb I </em>that, \u201ceven though [Cobb] has not created a trial record . . . that would permit him to present, in his direct appeal, his statistical claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1) . . . he should be permitted to do so by way of a postappeal habeas corpus petition .... Although ordinarily habeas corpus cannot serve as a surrogate for a claim that could have been presented on direct appeal ... we conclude that, with respect to the claim that [Cobb] seeks to present by this motion, he should not be bound by that principle because the scope and meaning of \u00a7 53a-46b (b) have remained uncertain and, until [1995], have been the subject of only one published decision of this court .... Furthermore, the nature of [Cobb\u2019s] claim of systemic racial bias, and the seriousness and finality of the death penalty, counsel against raising any undue procedural barriers to review of such a claim.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 762-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201cIn <em>Cobb II </em>[supra, 251 Conn. 285], we reaffirmed our holding in <em>Cobb I </em>that a racial disparity claim \u2018was cognizable under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1), but must [be] based on a full evidentiary hearing made at trial in the trial court.\u2019 [Id.], 499. Because [Cobb] had not made such a record [in] the trial court, he was required to proceed by way of a habeas petition. Id. In support of this conclusion, we noted \u2018two further aspects of [his] claim. First . . . this claim was brought in <em>Cobb I </em>by motion of [Cobb\u2019s] separate proportionality counsel <em>\u201cbecause [Cobb\u2019s] other appellate counsel [did] not intend to</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number><em>raise such a claim under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1).\u201d . . . Cobb I, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 740. Needless to say, that \u201cother appellate counsel\u201d is the same counsel who now brings this claim, nearly four years later. Second, this appeal was filed in October, 1991. [Cobb\u2019s] brief was not filed in this court until February, 1997, more than six years later. Under these circumstances, it ill behooves [Cobb\u2019s] counsel to request a remand for an evidentiary hearing (1) on a claim that he represented nearly four years earlier he did not intend to bring, and (2) in an appeal the disposition of which has been delayed for nearly eight years largely because of his delay in filing his brief. We see no valid reason to delay the disposition of this appeal further. The state, the victim\u2019s family and [Cobb] are entitled to a disposition of this appeal now.\u2019 . . . <em>Cobb II, </em>supra, 499-500 n.105.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 400-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 1, we considered whether the defendant, Richard Reynolds, was entitled to a hearing before the trial court on his claim that the death penalty is imposed in a racially discriminatory and arbitrary manner in this state. See id., 226. After the jury returned its verdict imposing the death penalty, Reynolds requested such a hearing and indicated that \u201che was not prepared to proceed immediately with the requested hearing and that he needed \u2018several months\u2019 to do \u2018detailed research into court records and other similar preparation\u2019 before the hearing. . . . [He] also requested that his sentencing be postponed until after a hearing and decision on his motion for the imposition of a life sentence.\u201d Id., 229. We agreed that Reynolds \u201cwas entitled to an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of presenting facts in support of his claim that ... he should be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release because of the allegedly flawed manner in which this state\u2019s death penalty statute is implemented.\u201d Id., 230. We concluded, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that Reynolds \u201cwas not entitled to an indefinite period of time within which to attempt to develop facts in support of his claim.\u201d Id., 231. Accordingly, we concluded \u201cthat the proper course [was] not to remand [Reynolds\u2019] claim to the trial court but, rather, to afford [Reynolds] an opportunity to renew his claim by way of a habeas corpus petition.\u201d Id., 232. We recognized that, since our decisions in <em>Cobb I </em>and <em>Cobb II, </em>a habeas proceeding had been instituted in the <em>Cobb </em>matter and that Chief Justice William J. Sullivan had appointed former Chief Justice Robert Callahan to serve as a special master to oversee the proceeding. Id., 233. We concluded that, in the interest of judicial economy and fairness to the parties, capital defendants should no longer raise claims of racial bias before the trial court; instead, all such claims should be presented in the consolidated habeas proceeding. Id., 234. We noted that, under ordinary circumstances, a capital defendant\u2019s failure to raise the claim in a timely manner might constitute a procedural bar to habeas proceedings, but cited our statement in <em>Cobb I, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 763, that the circumstances of the case counseled against raising such a bar. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 232 n.204. Finally, we noted that the issue of \u201cwhether any particular defendant or the state would be barred from litigating a claim of this nature in the consolidated habeas proceeding that we contemplate when that defendant desires to present a different variation of the claim or when the state has a different variation of its response to the defendant\u2019s claim\u201d would be left to the discretion of former Chief Justice Callahan and the habeas judge. Id., 234 n.207; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 405 (in light of untimeliness of defendant\u2019s racial disparity claim, if defendant intended to pursue claim he was required to raise it in habeas proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">With this background in mind, we now turn to the issue of whether \u00a7 53a-46b renders participation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>consolidated habeas proceeding mandatory and nonwaivable. General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any sentence of death imposed in accordance with the provisions of section 53a-46a shall be reviewed by the supreme court pursuant to its rules. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\u201c(b) The supreme court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that: (l) The sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We agree with the dissenting justices that these provisions constitute a mandatory directive to this court to review sentences of death. We further conclude that the obligation of this court to review death sentences cannot be discharged by virtue of a defendant\u2019s expressed desire to forgo review. Accordingly, we conclude that, in every <em>case </em>in which a sentence of death is imposed, this court is required, without exception, to conduct a sentence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We do not believe, however, that \u00a7 53a-46b creates a nonwaivable right to a review of any and all <em>claims </em>implicating the arbitrariness of a death sentence, regardless of when, how and by whom the claim is raised. It is well established that, even in capital cases, the defendant waives claims\u2014including those of constitutional magnitude and those implicating the arbitrariness of the sentence\u2014if the claim is not raised at trial and the record is inadequate for review by this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 154 n.26 (\u201ceven in capital cases, we have held that, [although the defendant\u2019s brief adverts to independent rights under the [state] constitution, [when] no such arguments have been briefed . . . they are . . . deemed to have been waived\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 208, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 290 n.69, 833 A.2d 363 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 423 n.32, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 206-207 (when defense counsel made tactical decision to refrain from objecting to state\u2019s attorney\u2019s improper conduct, defendant could not raise claim on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Moreover, our cases discussing the proper procedure for bringing a racial disparity claim do not suggest that a defendant in a death penalty case cannot waive a claim of racial disparity. Rather, they indicate the opposite. We criticized the defendants in <em>Breton </em>and <em>Reynolds </em>for their attempts to delay the completion of the proceedings by bringing their claims at the eleventh hour and clearly indicated that that was the reason that the claims had to be presented in a habeas proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 405; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 231. In other words, we concluded that mandatory review of the claims by this court had been waived. Moreover, although we stated in <em>Cobb I </em>and <em>Reynolds, </em>apparently in the exercise of our supervisory power, that \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s claim of systemic racial bias, and the seriousness and finality of the death penalty, counsel against raising any undue procedural barriers to review of such a claim\u201d; <em>Cobb I, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 763; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 232 n.204; we never suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u00a7 53a-46b mandated the bringing of a habeas action or barred the habeas court from dismissing such an action on procedural grounds. Indeed, we clearly have suggested otherwise. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 379 (defendant must bring racial disparity claim in habeas action <em>if he intends to bring one); State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 407 (same); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 234 n.207 (similar claims \u201cof this nature\u201d may be barred). If \u00a7 53a-46b does not require a defendant to bring a habeas action to litigate a racial disparity claim, it does not require him to participate in such an action brought by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We further note that the case cited by Justice Norcott in support of his argument that there is a distinction between mandatory sentence review and appellate review supports the view that claims may be waived in mandatory review proceedings. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>120 Wash. 2d 1,838 P.2d 86 (1992), the Washington Supreme Court construed a death sentence review statute that, like ours, distinguished between appellate review and death sentence review, and concluded that the sentence review could not be waived. Id., 20. The defendant in that case, Westley Allan Dodd, had \u201cchose [n] not to present mitigating evidence and so instructed his attorneys.\u201d Id., 9. The Washington sentence review statute required the court to determine \u201c[w]hether sufficient evidence justifies the finding that \u2018there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency\u2019 . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 24. The court concluded that the jury\u2019s determination that sufficient mitigating circumstances did not exist to merit leniency was supported by the record. Id., 25. The court did not suggest that, because its review of the mitigating evidence was mandatory, the presentation of a case in mitigation could not be waived.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>id.; see <em>also Pike </em>v. <em>State, </em>Docket No. E2002-00766-CCA-R3-PD, 2004 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 635, *38-*41 (July 15, 2004) (defendant in death penalty case may waive right to present mitigating evidence even though statute provides for mandatory sentence review), appeal granted, Docket No. E2002-00766-SC-R11-PD, 2004 Tenn. LEXIS 1034 (November 22, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In support of their argument that claims that would be subject to mandatory sentence review if raised cannot be waived, the dissenting justices place heavy reliance on the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Martini, </em>144 N.J. 603, 677 A.2d 1106 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1063, 117 S. Ct. 699, 136 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1997). The court in that case concluded that a defendant in a death penalty case could not waive postconviction relief proceedings for certain claims. See id., 613-14. The court recognized, however, that other jurisdictions have not adopted such a rule. Id.; see also <em>Pike </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 2004 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS *43 (\u201cno jurisdiction other than . . . New Jersey . . . has adopted a bright-line rule mandating post-conviction review in every capital case, even when the challenge is over the objection of the death-sentenced inmate\u201d). In light of our clear precedent to the contrary, we see no reason to join the New Jersey court in its isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that \u00a7 53a-46b (b) does not create a nonwaivable right to mandatory sentence review by this court of any and all claims that the death sentence was \u201cthe product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d regardless of the time and manner in which the claim was raised.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, the statute does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>this court to impose a moratorium on the execution of death sentences whenever an unproven claim of systemic arbitrariness in the administration of the death penalty scheme is raised.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor do we believe that we should do so in the exercise of our supervisory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Over the course of almost twenty years of litigation, Michael Ross never has raised the claim that his death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>sentences for the brutal murders of four young women were the product of systemic racial bias. Indeed, he has expressly stated on the record during a competency hearing in the underlying criminal proceedings that he \u201c[does] not wish to be a part of [the consolidated litigation] . . . .\u201d We have no reason to think that he or his counsel, in fact, believes that his sentence was the product of such bias. We have concluded that \u00a7 53a-46b did not bar him from waiving this claim at trial, thereby waiving mandatory sentence review of the issue by this court.

Nothing in \u00a7 53a-46b suggests that this court may reverse a death sentence on the basis of a claim that is not supported by the record. Rather, our cases clearly establish that, if a claim was not made before the trial court and there is no record for review, the claim is waived. Such a claim <em>may </em>be brought in a habeas proceeding, but the habeas court may conclude that the claim is procedurally barred, thus precluding any further review by this court. Nor does \u00a7 53a-46b or our cases suggest that, if the habeas court does not dismiss the claim, there is mandatory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>nonwaivable review by this court if the court ultimately rules against the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> We note that, in conducting its sentence review, the court in <em>Dodd </em>considered the mitigating nature of the evidence that had been presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>supra, 120 Wash. 2d 25. Similarly, in Michael Ross\u2019 case, this court conducted its mandatory review of his sentence on the basis of the record before it. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 213. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>that Michael Ross chose not to present evidence of systemic racial bias does not somehow render that review defective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\"> Although we recognize that the dissenting justices go to some lengths to limit their argument that claims that the death penalty was the product of an arbitrary factor are nonwaivable to claims that the administration of</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the death penalty is infected by racial bias, we do not believe there is any principled line to be drawn between such claims and other claims of arbitrariness. We cannot conclude, for example, that a sentence that is the product of racial animus or racial favoritism is inherently more arbitrary than a sentence that is the product of prosecutorial misconduct. Cf. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>supra, 481 U.S. 315-17 (eighth amendment claim that sentence impermissibly rests on irrelevant factor of race easily could be extended to apply to claims based on other minority groups, gender, race or gender of defense attorneys or judges, defendant\u2019s facial characteristics or physical attractiveness of defendant or victim). Accordingly, adoption of the reasoning of the dissenting justices would render nonwaivable virtually <em>any </em>claim that a death sentence is \u201cthe product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-4Gb (b); regardless of when or how it was raised. This would be entirely inconsistent with our precedent and would render our death penalty scheme unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We further note that the dissent of Justice Norcott states that, \u201c[i]f the defendants who have chosen to participate in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings are successful, it will be because they will have proven that the administration of the facially nondiscriminatory death penalty statutes violates the equal protection rights guaranteed to all defendants by our state constitution . . . .\u201d The specific claims being raised in the habeas proceeding are not before us in this case, however. We note that \u00a7 53a-46b was intended to implement the eighth amendment requirement of a reliable and nonarbitrary death sentence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 494-505. The participants in the consolidated habeas proceeding could prevail by showing that racial bias creates arbitrariness in violation of the eighth amendment without establishing any equal protection violation. Thus, the racial bias claim does not necessarily implicate constitutional protections that are not implicated by other claims of arbitrariness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> We express no opinion as to the merits of the consolidated habeas litigation.

I previously have expressed my reservations about executing the defendant, Michael B.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>272 Conn. 577, 614, 863 A.2d 654 (2005) <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring). In that case, I nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>concurred in the judgment of this court dismissing the writ of error brought by the plaintiff in error, the office of the chief public defender of the state of Connecticut (public defender), concluding that this issue, although significant and worrisome, was not properly before us. Id., 616. Moreover, in accordance with that position, I previously have voted to deny the motions of third parties, including the public defender, to stay the execution of the defendant. I maintain my agreement with this court\u2019s decisions denying next friend standing to third parties, such as the public defender and the plaintiff in error, Dan Ross, and I agree with the majority\u2019s opinion in that respect. Upon due reflection, however, I now conclude that both General Statutes \u00a7 SSa-ibb<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and our inherent supervisory powers over the administration of justice in this state require this court to act, sua sponte, to stay the execution of the defendant, pending resolution of the racial discrimination claims in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings administered by the special master, former Chief Justice Robert Callahan. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from this court\u2019s order dismissing the motions to stay the execution of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I initially wrote separately from this court\u2019s otherwise well reasoned majority opinion dismissing the first writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>of error because of my concerns about the \u201clegitimate claims, still unresolved, that our death penalty system is administered in a racially discriminatory, arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 614 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>234 Conn. 735, 738, 738-39 n.4, 663 A.2d 948 (1995) (discussing preliminary data). These claims, first addressed by this court in <em>Cobb</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>have led <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>to the initiation of a comprehensive statistical study about the influence of race and other factors in the application of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty. That study presently is ongoing in the context of the aforementioned consolidated habeas corpus litigation that is being supervised by former Chief Justice Callahan. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 232-33, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004). In my concurrence, I wrote of my concern that \u201cto permit an execution to proceed without the benefit of the completion of that study and a ruling thereon amounts to an informal and premature judicial imprimatur on the fairness of the death penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>process. Moreover, should the habeas court subsequently conclude that our entire death penalty system is fundamentally flawed as discriminatory on the basis of race <em>after </em>the defendant has been executed, our citizens\u2019 confidence in this court and the rest of the judicial branch as a bastion of civil rights might suffer irreparable harm.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 615-16 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring). In the first writ of error, however, I put my reservations aside and concurred in the judgment because I concluded that this issue was not properly before the court, as the court properly concluded that the trial court had determined correctly that the defendant was competent to waive further appeals or postconviction remedies, and that the public defender had offered no \u201cmeaningful evidence\u201d to the contrary. Id., 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In an ordinary criminal matter, this court\u2019s decision upholding the trial court\u2019s determination as to the defendant\u2019s competency would provide the defendant with a path to the ultimate disposition of his case unimpeded by the desires of third parties, including the public defender and the defendant\u2019s father, Dan Ross. This case, however, implicates the death penalty, and is, therefore, emphatically not an ordinary criminal case; it is beyond cavil that \u201c[d]eath is different.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>266 Conn. 171, 226, 833 A.2d 363 (2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>we have constitutional and statutory responsibilities, unique to the context of a death sentence, that impose upon us a heightened standard of vigilance as we administer and supervise the proceedings in the present case. In my view, \u00a7 53a-46b; see footnote 1 of this dissenting opinion; <em>requires </em>us to use our supervisory powers over the administration of justice to stay the execution of this defendant until the claims of racial discrimination in the death sentencing process are finally adjudicated in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings. That no third party has standing to ask us to take this action in contravention of the wishes of both the defendant and the state is of no moment. To do otherwise would amount to an abdication of our institutional responsibilities under this state\u2019s statutory scheme, because our mandatory review of all death sentences imposed in this state, including that in the present case, is necessarily incomplete until those claims of racial discrimination are resolved by this court. Indeed, \u201cunder our form of government it is not the inmate on death row . . . who determines when and whether the [sjtate shall execute a prisoner; rather, the law itself makes that determination. The public has an interest in the reliability and integrity of a death sentencing decision that transcends the preferences of individual defendants.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martini, 144 </em>N.J. 603,605,677 A.2d 1106 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1063, 117 S.

Under \u00a7 53a-46b (a), this court is required to \u201creview\u201d and determine the \u201cvalidity\u201d of \u201c[a]ny sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of death imposed in accordance with the provisions of section 53a-46a . . . .\u201d In reviewing death sentences, we \u201cshall affirm the sentence of death unless [we determine] that: (1) <em>The sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, </em>or (2) the evidence fails to support the finding of an aggravating factor specified in subsection (i) of section 53a-46a.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b). Determination of the scope of this court\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 53a-46b presents an issue of statutory construction wherein \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 510, 857 A.2d 908 (2004); see Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">I begin, as usual, with the language of \u00a7 53a-46b, which provides: \u201c(a) Any sentence of death imposed in accordance with the provisions of section 53a-46a shall be reviewed by the Supreme Court pursuant to its rules. In addition to its authority to correct errors at trial, the Supreme Court shall either affirm the sentence of death or vacate said sentence and remand for imposition of a sentence in accordance with subdivision (1) of section 53a-35a.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\u201c(b) The Supreme Court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that: (1) The sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; or (2) the evidence fails to support the finding of an aggravating factor specified in subsection (i) of section 53a-46a.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">\u201c(c) The sentence review shall be in addition to direct appeal and, if an appeal is taken, the review and appeal shall be consolidated for consideration. The court shall then render its decision on the legal errors claimed and the validity of the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The plain language of \u00a7 53a-46b requires this court to review every sentence of death, although it leaves the process by which we undertake that review to our \u201crules,\u201d which generally involve the relevant provisions of the Practice Book. See, e.g., Practice Book \u00a7 67-6 (a) (requiring briefs of parties in death penalty appeals to \u201cinclude a discussion of the issues set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b [b]\u201d); see also Practice Book \u00a7 61-15 (providing for certain automatic stays of execution in death penalty cases).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The language, especially subsection (c) of \u00a7 53a-46b, providing that \u201c[t]he sentence review shall be in addition to direct appeal ... if an appeal is taken,\u201d also makes clear that our obligation to review death sentences exists separate and apart from any appeal that a defendant might take. Indeed, subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-46b lends further support to the proposition that the court\u2019s independent obligation to review death sentences exists \u201c[i]n addition to its authority to correct errors at trial . . . .\u201d The consolidation of the direct appeal and sentence for review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>under subsection (c) of \u00a7 53a-46b, \u201cif an appeal is taken,\u201d represents a legislative nod to judicial economy, and the reality that most capital defendants take extensive appeals of their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Section 53a-46b clearly indicates that the legislature envisioned death sentence review and direct appeal as two different legal entities, although both are creatures of statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>271 Conn. 218, 234, 856 A.2d 917 (2004) (\u201c[i]t is well settled that a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to an appeal; rather, that right exists solely by statute\u201d). Death sentence review, however, is fundamentally different from direct appeal, as well as postconviction collateral attack via habeas corpus proceedings, because death sentence review is not solely an <em>option </em>available to a defendant, but a separate mandatory obligation for this court in all capital cases. The mandatory language of \u00a7 53a-46b, specifically, the frequent use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d in conjunction with the word \u201cany,\u201d suggests that our role in the state\u2019s capital sentencing scheme is both unwaivable and separate and apart from any appeal that may be taken by a defendant. Although \u201c[definitive words, such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 623, 755 A.2d 180 (2000); it is well settled that \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 is not dispositive on the issue of whether a statute is mandatory . . . [and] \u2018the use of the word shall, though significant, does not invariably [create] a mandatory duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10,22,848 A.2d 418 (2004). \u201cThe test to be applied \u2018in determining whether a [rule] is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>supra, 622-23; see also id., 625 (relying on \u201clanguage, purpose and history of [Practice Book] \u00a7 42-31 . . . [to] conclude that the term \u2018shall,\u2019 as used in that rule of practice, constitutes a mandatory term . . . [and that] a trial court is required to conduct an individual poll of the jury pursuant to a timely request by either party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The word \u201cshall\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-46b is mandatory, rather than directory, because the statute imposes a substantive obligation on this court to review all death sentences. Section 53a-46b was enacted in 1980 as No. 80-332, \u00a7 2, of the 1980 Public Acts, and the legislature provided for mandatory review by this court in order to add an extra measure of reliability to this state\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, as well as to comport with contemporaneous United States Supreme Court decisions endorsing automatic state supreme court review as a means to that end.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See 23 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1980 Sess., p. 2900, remarks of Senator Alfred Santaniello (Stating that the statute \u201cestablishes a review by the Supreme Court on all death penalties imposed. It would be an automatic review . . . .\u201d); 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1980 Sess., p. 2768, remarks of Representative Richard Tulisano (Stating that the statute \u201cmandates that there be an automatic review by the Connecticut Supreme Court in order to affirm any death sentence which may be imposed on anybody. Most of those standards we feel would put the existing statutes within compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>with the United States Constitutional standards.\u201d);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 504-505, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (discussing history and enactment of \u00a7 53a-46b, and particularly its former provision of proportionality review). It is apparent from this legislative history that mandatory review of all death sentences by this court is not merely directory, but is a key substantive safeguard in this state\u2019s capital sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">I note that my conclusion that we have an affirmative obligation to review all death sentences imposed in Connecticut, regardless of the defendant\u2019s wishes, is consistent with the holdings of sister state courts construing similar statutes. For example, the Virginia Supreme Court has held that the purpose of mandatory sentence review \u201cis to assure the fair and proper application of the death penalty statutes in this [c]ommonwealth and to instill public confidence in the administration of justice. \u201d <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 358, 364, 535 S.E.2d 674 (2000); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>128 N.M. 119,146,990 P.2d 793 (1999) (\u201cfollowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>a competency hearing or other evidence of competency, we believe that [the defendant] may knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his right to further review of his case beyond this [c]ourt\u2019s direct review of his sentence\u201d); <em>Grasso </em>v. <em>State, </em>857 P.2d 802, 808 (Okla. Crim. App. 1993) (describing statutory sentence review, \u201cwhich we have found to be mandatory and not subject to waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The Washington Supreme Court decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>120 Wash. 2d 1, 838 P.2d 86 (1992), is illustrative of the application of mandatory statutory review. In <em>Dodd, </em>the defendant had pleaded guilty to murdering and sexually assaulting several children, and he had elected to prevent his attorneys from presenting mitigating evidence at his sentencing proceeding. Id., 9. After he was sentenced to death, the defendant wished to waive further appellate review of his conviction and sentence. Id., 13. The Washington Supreme Court nevertheless held that the state\u2019s sentence review statute; Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 10.95.100 (West 1990); which is similar in structure to \u00a7 53a-46b, and requires that \u201c \u2018the sentence shall be reviewed on the record by the supreme court of Washington\u2019 \u201d;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>14; imposed a sentence review process that was separate and apart from a general appeal, and was mandatory and unwaivable. Id., 14-15. The court concluded that distinctions in the statutory text between an appeal and sentence review suggested that the defendant could waive general direct appellate review, but not the separate mandatory sentence review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 15. The court then held that it would limit its inquiry to the statutory sentence review because the defendant was competent to waive a direct appeal, and that a next friend, therefore, lacked standing to take a direct appeal on his behalf.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 16-18, citing <em>Whitmore </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 110 S. Ct. 1717,109 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1990). After concluding that the state constitution did not require appellate review of a death penalty conviction beyond that prescribed by statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>supra, 22-23; the court undertook the mandatory statutory review and affirmed the death sentence, concluding that \u201csufficient evidence supported [the defendant\u2019s] sentence, the sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>not excessive or disproportionate, and it was not the result of passion or prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Having concluded that \u00a7 53a-46b imposes upon this court a responsibility to review sentences of death that exists independently of any appeal taken by the defendant, I now turn to the extent to which that statutory duty requires this court to stay the defendant\u2019s execution in the present case pending resolution of the racial discrimination claims in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings. I, of course, recognize that this court already has conducted a comprehensive appellate review of the defendant\u2019s sentence, including proportionality review as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 391-92, 849 A.2d 648 (2004), motion denied, 543 U.S. 1046, 125 S. Ct. 943, 160 L. Ed. 2d 766 (January 10, 2005). I certainly do not insinuate that the efforts of this court in that review were anything less than thorough and fair. See id., 393 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting) (\u201cI continue to respect the position of the majority of this court regarding this matter\u201d). I conclude, however, that because this court has knowledge of claims of racial discrimination in the administration of the death penalty, and indeed has directed their resolution in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings, we will not have discharged our responsibilities under \u00a7 53a-46b if we allow this execution to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">I begin by noting that our review responsibilities under \u00a7 53a-46b are not confined explicitly to the record before the court. The statute provides only that \u201c[a]ny sentence of death imposed in accordance with the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>visions of section 53a-46a shall be reviewed by the Supreme Court pursuant to its rules. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (a). There is no language circumscribing the scope of our sentence review, or restricting it to the review of a particular record. If the legislature had wished to limit the scope of our review obligation, it could have followed the lead of other state legislatures and done so explicitly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.13 (A) (West 2002) (\u201c[whenever the death penalty is imposed, and upon the judgment becoming final in the trial court, the sentence shall be reviewed <em>on the record </em>by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\u201d [emphasis added]); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 17.1-313 (A) (Michie 1999) (\u201c[a] sentence of death, upon the judgment thereon becoming final in the circuit court, shall be reviewed <em>on the record </em>by the Supreme Court\u201d [emphasis added]); Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 10.95.100 (West 1990) (\u201c[w]henever a defendant is sentenced to death, upon entry of the judgment and sentence in the trial court the sentence shall be reviewed <em>on the record </em>by the supreme court of Washington\u201d [emphasis added]). Inasmuch as it is well settled that \u201c[w]e are not permitted to supply statutory language that the legislature may have chosen to omit\u201d; <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 396, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993); I cannot read into the statute language restricting the scope of our review to the particular record of this defendant. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility </em>Control, 266 Conn. 108, 119, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003) (\u201c[i]f the legislature had intended to limit the application of the statute to utility property, it easily could have done so\u201d). Moreover, a narrow reading of \u00a7 53a-46b that confines our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>to the trial record would be inconsistent with the maxim that \u201ccriminal statutes are to be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364,373, 678 A.2d 462 (1996). This proposition applies with equal force to statutes governing criminal procedure; see id. (construing mandatory juvenile transfer statute); and is \u201cespecially pertinent\u201d in death penalty cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986) (construing capital felony statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">THIS COURT\u2019S OBLIGATION TO STAY THE EXECUTION BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT SUPERVISORY POWERS OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">I believe that not confining our review under \u00a7 53a-46b to the limited record before us, moreover, is consistent with this court\u2019s overarching \u201c \u2018inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 332, 715 A.2d 1 (1998); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 815, 709 A.2d 522 (1998) (\u201c[o]ur supervisory powers are invoked only in the rare circumstance where [the] traditional protections are inadequate to ensure the fair and just administration of the courts\u201d). \u201cThe standards that [are] set under this supervisory authority are not satisfied by observance of those minimal historic safeguards for securing trial by reason which are summarized as due process of law ....

Moreover, it is well established that this court need not wait for a motion from a party before it exercises its supervisory powers; the court has an obligation to act sua sponte to address serious matters that may affect the \u201cperceived fairness\u201d of our judicial system. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 332 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The New Jersey Supreme Court decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Martini, </em>supra, 144 N.J. 603, a case similar to the present matter, is illustrative of a state high court placing its institutional responsibilities to the administration of justice above the wishes of a particular defendant. In <em>Martini, </em>the defendant\u2019s death sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal to the state supreme court and the United States Supreme Court had denied his petition for certiorari. Id., 605-606. At that point, the defendant desired no further appeals or efforts to stop his execution, but his public defender wished to pursue state postconviction relief. Id., 606. The habeas court concluded that the defendant was competent to waive postconviction relief, and denied the public defender\u2019s motion to pursue collateral review. Id. The public defender then appealed to the state supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The court framed the issue as \u201cwhether a defendant who has presented mitigating factors to a jury and has had his conviction and sentence affirmed on direct appeal may waive post-conviction relief . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 609. Although the court acknowledged the state\u2019s interest in finality, it also stated that \u201cthere are some issues that one simply cannot raise on direct appeal and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>issues that are best raised\u201d postconviction, specifically claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or other events requiring factual development beyond the trial court record. Id., 609-10. The court reviewed possible issues that might be raised on postconviction review, but particularly emphasized \u201cevidence disclosed after [the defendant\u2019s] conviction that suggests that New Jersey\u2019s death penalty system may be constitutionally flawed because of systemic discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\u201d Id., 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The court stated that race discrimination \u201cfit[s] within a traditional category for which post-conviction relief would be granted.\u201d Id., 612. It rejected the state\u2019s argument that the public defender lacked standing to raise the issue, stating that, \u201cthe question is not whether the [p]ublic [d]efender has standing to raise an issue on behalf of the defendant, but whether the judiciary, in the discharge of its constitutional and statutory duty to review every judgment of death . . . must consider the issue in order to ensure the reliability of the decision to execute.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The court stated that although \u201c[i]t is a natural reaction for some to wish to be rid of an admitted murderer who asks to be executed . . . [t]he [c]ourt is nonetheless required to ensure the integrity of death sentences in New Jersey. . . . The [c]ourt must decide if issues that could not be raised on direct appeal make the prisoner\u2019s sentence of death unconstitutional or illegal.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 614. Noting that its state\u2019s \u201chistory and traditions would never countenance racial disparity in capital sentencing,\u201d the court stated that it \u201cis the appropriate branch of government to vindicate that tradition and our own constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws under [the state constitution].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Noting that the habeas court properly had determined the defendant\u2019s competency to waive further proceedings; id., 617; the New Jersey court nevertheless directed mandatory postconviction relief for the defendant, after ordering the postconviction court to take judicial notice of the resolution of the then pending statistics-based racial discrimination proceedings. Id., 616. It stated that \u201cstanding is not a conceptual obstacle to the administration of justice. Thus, it is not issues of standing or waiver that determine the matter but whether the [c]ourt provides meaningful appellate review of a capital sentence when it authorizes the execution of a prisoner at the same time that it is considering whether the [d]eath [p]enalty [a]ct is constitutional. It seems to us that the answer to that question must be no unless we no longer believe that it is self-evident that the state and its citizens have an overwhelming interest in insuring that there is no mistake in the imposition of the death penalty.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 616-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">I find that the New Jersey Supreme Court decision in <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Martini, </em>supra, 144 N.J. 603, provides exemplary guidance to this court in the discharge of our obligations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It pragmatically acknowledges that \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>cannot stay scheduled executions for each new issue that arises\u201d as \u201c[t]here must be an end to the process,\u201d and that \u201csomeone will die before every avenue of inquiry will have been ended . . . .\u201d Id., 614. I, of course, recognize that, at some point, the appeals process must stop for all, including capital defendants. Indeed, I do not read \u00a7 53a-46b as requiring this court to be a sua sponte fountain of infinite creativity in devising ways to invalidate death sentences. Nevertheless, I, like the majority in <em>Martini, </em>have grave reservations about permitting an execution to proceed when we have actual knowledge of pending claims that the entire death penalty system may be flawed as racially discriminatory. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 616 n.4 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring) (\u201c[m]y trepidation transcends the defendant in this case because our concerns of racial discrimination in the administration of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty are not the product of conjecture informed by the voracious consumption of law review articles\u201d). Indeed, it is this very court that ordered the claims consolidated into one habeas corpus proceeding. As I stated previously, \u201c[m]y concern is that to permit an execution to proceed without the benefit of the completion of that study and a ruling thereon amounts to an informal and premature judicial imprimatur on the fairness of the death penalty process. Moreover, should the habeas court subsequently conclude that our entire death penalty system is fundamentally flawed as discriminatory on the basis of race <em>after </em>the defendant has been executed, our citizens\u2019 confidence in this court and the rest of the judicial branch as a bastion of civil rights might suffer irreparable harm.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 615-16 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>concurring); cf. <em>Commonwealth v. McKenna, </em>476 Pa. 428,441-42, 383 A.2d 174 (1978) (concluding sua sponte that defendant could not be executed under facially unconstitutional death penalty statute, although defendant refused to raise issue at trial or on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS DEFENDANT OF THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS PENDING IN THE CONSOLIDATED HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">I also must address the apparent counterargument that there is no hint of racial discrimination in the present case because the defendant and his victims were white, and that the defendant has in fact elected not to participate in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings. That is irrelevant. If the defendants who have chosen to participate in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings are successful, it will be because they will have proven that the administration of the facially nondiscriminatory death penalty statutes violates the equal protection rights guaranteed to all defendants by our state constitution, specifically article first, \u00a7 20, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments, as well as the state constitution\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although this court\u2019s cases generally have confined \u201cas applied\u201d analysis to the fact-specific scenario presented by the particular party challenging legislation,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the scope of the racial discrimination review cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>rently underway in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings necessarily would require, if those defendants are to prevail, analysis of the application of the death penalty statutes to <em>all </em>capital defendants, not only individuals.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">I recognize that the United States Supreme Court has rejected the use of detailed statistical evidence to prove discriminatory application of Georgia\u2019s death penalty scheme, and has required a more particularized showing of \u201cpurposeful discrimination\u201d with respect to specific defendants in order to establish violations of the eighth or fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution. <em>McCleskey </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>481 U.S. 279, 297, 107 S. Ct. 1756, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1987) (\u201cwe hold that the [statistical study conducted by Professor David C.

It potentially may take a more charitable view under the state constitution toward the use of statistical evidence to prove the discriminatory application of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty statutes. See <em>City Recycling, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Conn. 429, 444, 778 A.2d 77 (2001) (\u201c[although we previously have stated that the equal protection provision under our state constitution provides the same limitations as the federal equal protection provision . . . we note here . . . that this does not mean that \u2018the state equal protection provision can <em>never </em>have an independent meaning from the equal protection provision in the federal constitution\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted; emphasis in original]). Indeed, I recognize that <em>McCleskey </em>has been the target of more than some academic criticism; see, e.g., J. Blume, T. Eisenberg &amp; S. Johnson, <em>\u201cPost-McCleskey </em>Racial Discrimination Claims in Capital Cases,\u201d 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1771 (1998); and more significantly, that at least one other state has rejected it as a matter of state constitutional law, allowing, but not yet validating challenges to the death penalty based solely on statistical proof. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Loftin, </em>157 N.J. 253, 298, 724 A.2d 129 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>130 N.J. 109, 207, 613 A.2d 1059 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 929, 113 S. Ct. 1306, 122 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">I am well aware that statutes are subject to a heavy presumption of constitutionality. See, e.g., <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>259 Conn. 783, 794, 792 A.2d 76 (2002). I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>also recognize the difficulty of proving impermissible discrimination based solely on statistical evidence. We cannot, however, ignore the fact that these claims exist and that their consideration is currently pending in consolidated habeas corpus proceedings being supervised by this court. Moreover, the scope of these discrimination claims, as described in this court\u2019s published decisions, indicates that a successful statistics-based \u201cas applied\u201d challenge necessarily will have results beyond the scope of individual cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 228, 230 (noting that defendant \u201csuggests] that the death penalty is imposed in a racially discriminatory and arbitrary manner in this state\u201d and \u201cwe agree with the defendant that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of presenting facts in support of his claim that, notwithstanding the jury verdict, he should be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release because of the allegedly flawed manner in which this state\u2019s death penalty statute is implemented\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 763 (noting \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s claim of <em>systemic </em>racial bias\u201d [emphasis added]); see also id., 769 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting) (noting that \u201cthe state concedes that if the defendant is correct, and if reliable statistics demonstrate that <em>defendants </em>are being subjected to the death penalty on the basis of their race, the death penalty system would be \u2018unconstitutional as applied\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added]). Indeed, this court recognized that reality in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 233, when it characterized the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings as \u201con behalf of all defendants who have been sentenced to death.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Indeed, other states have held that <em>McCleskey </em>type claims amount to \u201cas applied\u201d challenges with respect to, for example, \u201cblack defendants,\u201d and not just a specific defendant.

Of the twenty-eight capital felony convictions, only four, or 14 percent, have involved the murder of a victim who was black, and of the eighteen that have gone to a penalty phase hearing, only one, or 5.5 percent, has involved the murder of a black victim;</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">(5) of the sixty-six capital convictions in which the guilt phase has been concluded, twenty-one involved black defendants and forty-five involved nonblack defendants. Of the black defendants, thirteen of twenty-one, or 62 percent, were convicted of capital felonies and fifteen of forty-five, or 33 percent, nonwhite defendants were so convicted.\u2019 He sought \u2018the opportunity to demonstrate the number of kidnap murders of black victims and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>number of sexual assault murders of black victims that were not prosecuted as capital felonies and to demonstrate the disproportionate treatment of those crimes as compared to the treatment of comparable crimes involving white victims.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cBecause of the need for the creation of an adequate factual record as to alleged discrimination, this court concluded that the defendant\u2019s claim in <em>Cobb </em>was more appropriately raised collaterally via a habeas corpus proceeding, rather than a remand from direct appeal.

We dissent from the order of the court dismissing the motions to stay the execution. We agree with the majority that the plaintiffs in error, the office of the chief public defender and Dan Ross, Michael Ross\u2019 father, lack standing to raise claims on behalf of the defendant, Michael Ross. We nevertheless would grant a stay of execution, sua sponte, because we disagree with the majority that an individual defendant can waive the benefit of any potential relief resulting from the disposition of the pending consolidated habeas corpus litigation that questions whether the administration of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty system comports with the state constitution, which consolidated litigation was ordered by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 233, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S.

Although the defendant is free to waive possible claims of error specific to his own prosecution, it does not follow that he should be permitted to waive the public\u2019s overriding interest in a system of capital punishment that is fairly, justly and evenly imposed. We conclude that this court\u2019s supervisory authority over the administration of justice empowers it to issue a stay when, as here, there is an active systemic challenge impheating the reliability of the most final of sentences. We further conclude that the statutory mandate that this court review all capital sentences to determine whether they are the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1); requires us to issue a stay until this court has reviewed the conclusions reached by the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">As fully explicated in Justice Norcott\u2019s dissent, Connecticut\u2019s death penalty statutes require mandatory review of all capital sentences, regardless of whether any individual defendant takes a direct appeal from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>or her conviction for a capital offense.

This court previously has stated that this subsection, insofar as it provides for meaningful appellate review, is one of the features of our statutory scheme that brings it in accord with the federal constitution. State <em>v. Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285,478, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000), citing <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976). The claims ordered to be litigated in the consolidated habeas corpus proceedings arise under this subsection and, therefore, are subject to mandatory review.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Through our evolving death penalty jurisprudence, it has been established that a claim of systemic unconstitutional bias or arbitrariness in the administration of Connecticut\u2019s death penalty should be raised under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>234 Conn. 735, 738, 741, 663 A.2d 948 (1995) (raising claim that \u201cthe death penalty scheme has been disproportionately applied to black defendants or to defendants whose victims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>white\u201d); and, further, that the sole appropriate forum in which to make this claim is in one consolidated habeas corpus proceeding to be litigated \u201con behalf of <em>all </em>defendants who have been sentenced to death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 226-28, 232-34 (raising claim that \u201cthe influence of race and other arbitrary factors on the imposition of capital punishment [throughout] Connecticut\u201d resulted in sentences that were the product of prejudice and other arbitrary factors in violation of \u00a7 53a-46b [b] [1] and the equal protection and due process provisions of our state constitution). This litigation thus has evolved into a systemic challenge to the alleged unconstitutional application of our death penalty statute, thereby implicating society\u2019s right in the fair administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Although his inclusion clearly is contemplated by the order in <em>Reynolds, </em>the defendant in this matter has expressed his willingness to waive participation in the consolidated habeas proceeding. Although criminal defendants routinely are permitted to waive various constitutional rights intended for their personal protection, it nevertheless is fundamental that no one individual is entitled to waive the interests of the public as a whole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[Wjaiver, from its nature, applies ordinarily to all rights or privileges to which a person is legally entitled, <em>provided such rights or privileges belong to the individual and are intended solely for his benefit. A </em>waiver is not, however, allowed to operate so as to infringe upon the rights of others, or to transgress public policy or morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cThe public interest may not be waived. Where a law seeks to protect the public as well as the individual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>such protection to the state cannot, at will, be waived by any individual, an integral part thereof. The public good is entitled to protection and consideration and if, in order to effectuate that object, there must be enforced protection to the individual, such individual must submit to such enforced protection for the public good.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver \u00a7 161 (1966) (citing cases). Accordingly, a statutory \u201cright conferred on a private party, but affecting the public interest, may not be waived or released <em>if such waiver or release contravenes the statutory policy.'\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New York </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>528 U.S. 110, 116, 120 S. Ct. 659,145 L. Ed. 2d 560 (2000), quoting <em>Brooklyn Savings Bank </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>324 U.S. 697, 704, 65 S. Ct. 895, 89 L. Ed. 2d 1296 (1945); see also <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Merigold, </em>119 Conn. 339, 343, 176 A. 266 (1935) (\u201c[o]ne cannot waive a public obligation created by statute\u201d); <em>Haggerty </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>84 Conn. App. 675, 681, 855 A.2d 264 (2004) (\u201c [b] ecause of the combined private and public interests involved, individual parties are not entirely free to waive [a statute of limitations defense]\u201d). Further, the institutional interest of a court in reaching just verdicts through fair processes justifies its disallowance of knowing and voluntary attempts to waive purportedly personal constitutional rights. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scalzitti, </em>578 F.2d 507, 511-12 (3rd Cir. 1978) (disallowing defendant\u2019s waiver of requirement of unanimous jury verdict); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>83 Conn. App. 615, 631, 852 A.2d 762, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 910, 859 A.2d 571 (2004) (disallowing defendant\u2019s waiver of his counsel\u2019s conflict of interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">It is beyond question that <em>all citizens </em>of this state share an interest in a constitutionally administered system of capital punishment, uninfluenced by factors such as race, and, by extension, in any proceeding raising systemic challenges based on the racially biased appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>cation of that system. As noted by the New Jersey Supreme Court in a case mandating that a death sentenced prisoner pursue an expedited individualized postconviction relief application and, further, requiring that his execution be stayed until the resolution of a systemic constitutional challenge to that state\u2019s death penalty system brought by another prisoner, \u201c[t]he public has an interest in the reliability and integrity of a death sentencing decision that transcends the preferences of individual defendants.\u201d <em>Stale </em>v. Martini, 144 N.J. 603, 605, 677 A.2d 1106 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1063, 117 S. Ct. 699, 136 L. Ed. 2d 621 (1997); see also <em>Massie </em>v. Sumner, 624 F.2d 72, 74 (9th Cir. 1980) (noting state\u2019s \u201cstrong interest in the accuracy and fairness of all its criminal proceedings\u201d in disallowing death sentenced prisoner\u2019s request to waive statutorily mandated direct appeal); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, </em>71 Cal. 2d 820, 834, 457 P.2d 889, 80 Cal. Rptr. 49 (1969) (holding state \u201chas an indisputable interest [in death penalty appeal] which the appellant cannot extinguish\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Koedatich, </em>112 N.J. 225, 332, 548 A.2d 939 (1988) (\u201c[i]t is self-evident that the state and its citizens have an overwhelming interest in insuring that there is no mistake in the imposition of the death penalty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The public\u2019s interest in ensuring that Connecticut\u2019s death penalty is administered in a manner that comports with our constitution is embodied in the mandatory sentence review requirement of \u00a7 53a-46b. Our jurisprudence has established that claims of systemic bias are cognizable under \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (1) and that the sole forum in which these claims will be considered is the consolidated habeas corpus proceeding ordered by this court in <em>State </em>v. Reynolds, supra, 264 Conn. 233. By ordering this proceeding to be held on behalf of all death sentenced prisoners, we have conferred upon the defendant the personal rights both to participate therein and to benefit from any potential relief that might issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The defendant\u2019s personal stake in the outcome of this proceeding is clear; the public\u2019s interest and independent stake in this proceeding is equally apparent. If this proceeding leads to a determination that Connecticut\u2019s death penalty system has been administered prejudicially or arbitrarily, all prisoners sentenced thereunder would have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-46b (a) and (b) and 53a-35a (1). In a case involving life and death, prematurely permitting an individual defendant to waive the benefit of such a proceeding could lead to irreversible damage to the public interest in the fair administration of society\u2019s ultimate penalty. In light of the public\u2019s independent interest, the defendant\u2019s waiver of his private interest is legally irrelevant. \u201cIn this regard we are not concerned with the defendant\u2019s welfare, but rather [with] the operation of our system.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>476 Pa. 428, 445 n.7, 383 A.2d 174 (1978) (Nix, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Accordingly, we respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s order dismissing the motions to stay the execution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> This analysis of an individual\u2019s inability to waive a public right, or a right in which the public is intricately invested, is distinct from but supplements the conclusion that Justice Norcott reaches in determining that \u00a7 53a-46b provides for mandatory sentence review which, by its nature, is not subject to waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
