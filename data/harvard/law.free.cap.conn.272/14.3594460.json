Economic Alliance, Inc. (Northeast), appeal and the named defendant, ATC Partnership,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cross appeals from a judgment rendered after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>court trial held pursuant to this court\u2019s remand order in <em>Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>ATC Partnership, </em>256 Conn. 813, 776 A.2d 1068 (2001) <em>(Northeast I).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court awarded the defendant damages of $1,752,365 plus interest and costs as compensation for condemnation of its real property, namely, the Wind-ham Mills complex (property), located in the former city of Willimantic. The plaintiffs\u2019 primary claims in this appeal are that in determining the market value of the property, the trial court improperly considered: (1) the likelihood of the plaintiffs receiving $3 million in state economic development grant funds; and (2) the impact of state and federal environmental laws in determining who would bear financial responsibility for the environmental remediation of the property. The defendant cross appeals, arguing that the trial court improperly failed: (1) to incorporate in its compensation award the impact of the two separate funding sources, namely, the available state grant and the proceeds from potential environmental litigation against the American Thread Company (American Thread), the former owner and operator of the property; and (2) to give effect to the highest and best use of the property by ascribing a negative value to the Mill 4 parcel of the property, rather than severing that parcel. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The record and the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memoranda of decision reveal the following relevant facts and procedural history. The property consists of approximately forty acres of land with two dams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and approximately twenty-one industrial buildings located on both sides of the Willimantic River in the former city of Willimantic, in the town of Windham.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Most of the buildings are on parcels located on the north side of the river; the parcel containing Mill 4 is on the south side. A variety of companies, culminating with American Thread, used the property from 1854 until 1985 for the manufacture of textiles, including thread, yam and string. By 1985, American Thread had moved all of its production operations out of Connecticut, and in 1986, it sold the property to Eastern Connecticut Industrial Park Associates (Eastern).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Thereafter, Eastern sold the property to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Local authorities considered a number of redevelopment plans for the property, which has not been used for manufacturing activity since the early 1980s. Among the rejected proposals were plans to use it for housing or mixed use retail. Thereafter, in 1991, a portion of the property was designated as the Windham Heritage State Park in recognition of the historic and educational importance of the property; it was the first component of the state\u2019s heritage park system.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In 1993, a multidisciplinary team of architectural, economic and environmental consultants, with substantial input by the community and the defendant, prepared for the town a master action plan for the redevelopment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>of the park and the property (plan). The plan considered light industry with ancillary offices to be the highest and best use for the property. The plan divided the property into three large parcels, which consisted of: (1) a parcel of 10.4 acres between Main Street and the river, which contained the main complex of buildings; (2) a second parcel of approximately 22 acres located across the river to the south, which contained Mill 4;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (3) a third parcel of approximately 5.1 vacant acres located to the east of the main parcel. The plan\u2019s environmental analysis noted that the property had environmental problems, including the presence of asbestos, lead paint, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and other chemical contaminants that would need to be abated prior to demolition or rehabilitation, but it did not consider these conditions \u201cunusual.\u201d The plan, which was completed in December, 1993, estimated the total costs of a complete environmental investigation and remediation of the property to range from a low of $2.42 million to a high of $4.04 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In the early 1990s, the parties had discussed the sale of the property from the defendant to the plaintiffs. Indeed, they jointly had engaged in efforts to obtain government funding for the redevelopment and rehabilitation of the property. These sale negotiations, however, were unsuccessful. Thereafter, in August, 1994, the plaintiffs filed with the trial court a statement of compensation in the amount of $1, followed by a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>cate of taking on September 9,1994. The defendant then applied to the trial court for review of the statement of compensation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-132.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">At the first trial, the court, <em>Hon. Harry Hammer, </em>judge trial referee, considered the opinions of three appraisers, two called by the parties and one appointed by the court as an independent valuation expert, and rendered judgment awarding the defendant $1,675,000 as just compensation for the taking of the property. <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 825. In rendering its judgment, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion in limine and excluded as a matter of law evidence of environmental contamination and remediation costs. Id., 815. The plaintiffs appealed from that judgment, and this court concluded that \u201cevidence of environmental contamination and remediation costs may not be excluded, as a matter of law, from a condemnation proceeding\u201d; id., 816-17; because that exclusion results in the misapplication of \u201cthe usual standard established for calculating just compensation, namely, fair market value.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 827. Accordingly, this court reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>judgment of the trial court in <em>Northeast I </em>and remanded the matter for a new trial. Id., 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">At trial after remand, the trial court, <em>McLachlan, J., </em>heard testimony from Dean Amadon and Robert Nocera, appraisers for the plaintiffs and the defendant, respectively. It was undisputed that the highest and best use for the property was light industrial use with ancillary office support. The trial court utilized the comparable sales approach of comparing the property to the actual sales of similar land and structures, and making necessary adjustments for factors such as contamination in order to calculate the property\u2019s fair market value.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court rejected the comparables proffered by Amadon, and concluded that Nocera\u2019s analysis was more persuasive. The court, relying heavily on the plan, concluded that there was 412,802 square feet of building space to be preserved on the property, with a \u201cclean\u201d value of $20 per square foot, for a gross value of $8,256,040. The court\u2019s value of $20 per square foot reflected a \u201cconservative\u201d 20 percent reduction of Nocera\u2019s estimate as to value, and did not include any allowance for costs offset by the recycling of materials from the demolished buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">After calculating the \u201cclean\u201d value of the property, the court then deducted the \u201csubstantial expenses\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>would be incurred to clean and stabilize the property to arrive at a net fair market value of $1,752,365. In calculating these costs, the court made assumptions and findings of fact, including \u201c[a] potential buyer would seek all sources of funds to reimburse or defray the environmental costs including investigation or remediation.\u201d Among these funding sources were: (1) $3 million approved for the project by the state bond commission on October 22, 1993\u2014$60,000 of which already had been expended on environmental investigation prior to the 1994 taking; (2) American Thread\u2019s assumption of liability for the environmental cleanup to the extent required by Form III of the state department of environmental protection,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as well as the fact that its successor company was solvent and profitable; and (3) pursuant to Public Acts 1993, No. 93-382, the defendant \u201cand any other for-profit partnership, proprietorship or corporation would be permitted to seek state financial assistance for the \u2018construction or rehabilitation of commercial, industrial and mixed use structures. \u2019 \u201d Allowing deductions for legal and administrative costs, the trial court assumed specifically that 80 percent of the environmental remediation costs could be recouped from the $3 million grant and \u201cfrom other potential sources, including American Thread.\u201d The trial court ultimately found that just compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>for the defendant at the time of the taking in September, 1994, was $1,752,365, and that the defendant was entitled to an award of interest at the statutory rate of 10 percent; see General Statutes \u00a7 37-3c; and costs pursuant to \u00a7 8-133. Thereafter, costs were taxed by the court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>and this appeal and cross appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary in the context of the parties\u2019 claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs ask us to modify the judgment of the trial court. They claim that the trial court improperly: (1) \u201cawarded\u201d the defendant the $3 million in state grant funds; (2) concluded, without factual or legal foundation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq., or General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452, that a prudent investor would consider the possible recovery of moneys from prior landowners responsible for the property\u2019s environmental defects, namely, American Thread; (3) violated this court\u2019s remand order in <em>Northeast I </em>by failing to adopt the unchallenged factual findings from the first trial; (4) set a 10 percent interest rate on the just compensation award; (5) awarded certain payments to various appraisers as costs pursuant to \u00a7 8-133; and (6) accepted nonexpert testimony on environmental remediation costs. With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The defendant cross appeals, arguing that the trial court improperly failed to: (1) give full effect to the impact of the state grant and the possibility of recovery against American Thread\u2019s successor by not treating them separately and distinctly; and (2) give effect to the highest and best use of the property by ascribing a negative value to the Mill 4 parcel of the property, rather than treating it as separate surplus land with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>zero value. With respect to the defendant\u2019s cross appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Our review of the parties\u2019 specific contentions is guided by overarching and well established principles that our courts use to determine just compensation for a property owner whose land has been taken by eminent domain. They are set forth concisely in the majority opinion in <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 828-30: \u201c[T]he question of what is just compensation is an equitable one rather than a strictly legal or technical one. The paramount law intends that the condemnee shall be put in as good condition pecuniarily by just compensation as he would have been in had the property not been taken. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u201cWe have stated repeatedly that [t]he amount that constitutes just compensation is the market value of the condemned property when put to its highest and best use at the time of the taking. ... In determining market value, it is proper to consider all those elements which an owner or a prospective purchaser could reasonably urge as affecting the fair price of the land .... The fair market value is the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller based on the highest and best possible use of the land assuming, of course, that a market exists for such optimum use. . . . The highest and best use concept, chiefly employed as a starting point in estimating the value of real estate by appraisers, has to do with the use which will most likely produce the highest market value, greatest financial return, or the most profit from the use of a particular piece of real estate. ... In determining its highest and best use, the trial [court] must consider whether there was a reasonable probability that the subject property would be put to that use in the reasonably near future, and what effect such a prospective use may have had on the property\u2019s market value at the time of the taking. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201c[B]ecause each parcel of real property is in some ways unique, trial courts must be afforded substantial discretion in choosing the most appropriate method of determining the value of a taken property. ... In condemnation hearings, the state referee sitting as a court [of] appeals ... is more than just a trier of fact or an arbitrator of differing opinions of witnesses. He is charged by the General Statutes and the decisions of this court with the duty of making an independent determination of value and fair compensation in the light of all the circumstances, the evidence, his general knowledge and his viewing of the premises.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY CONSIDERED THE AVAILABILITY OF STATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT FUNDS IN VALUING THE PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly awarded the defendant the state bond commission grant funds. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the grant was a \u201ccache in the middle of the property that [had] three million dollars in it\u201d for reimbursing the property owner. The plaintiffs argue that the grant money was: (1) not part of the condemned fee estate as a matter of law; (2) available only to governmental entities under Public Act 93-382; and (3) in any event speculative financing that should not have been used in determining the property\u2019s fair market value. The defendant argues in response that the plaintiffs have mischaracterized the ruling of the trial court because the trial court did not award it any money, but rather properly and equitably considered reasonably available state eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>nomic development funds as a factor that necessarily increased the value of the property in the marketplace.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The record reveals the following additional facts. In October, 1993, the state bond commission awarded to Northeast a total grant of $3 million for construction costs attendant to the Windham Mills Heritage Park project as outlined in the plan, including demolition, site improvements and structural construction. Statutory authority for the grant, which was funded by a bond issue, came pursuant to the Regional Economic Development Act, Public Act 93-382, \u00a7 27, which is codified at General Statutes \u00a7 32-325 et seq. The state and Northeast executed an assistance agreement to implement the grant in June, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At trial, Richard Mulready, a real estate appraiser with experience as a manager for municipalities including Enfield as well as Lewiston, Maine, testified for the defendant. Mulready testified that he had experience with the rehabilitation and redevelopment of old mills through his work in Enfield. Mulready testified that his legislative and administrative research disclosed that in the summer of 1994, state and federal funds were available for the environmental rehabilitation of old industrial sites such as the property in the present case. Testifying in his capacity as an expert real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>appraiser, Mulready stated that he learned from Peter Simmons, a director at the department of economic and community development, that the property would have been eligible for consideration for the award of state environmental cleanup grants in September, 1994. Mulready testified further that the availability of such grants would be of interest to a real estate developer or purchaser.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In considering the various costs attendant to the remediation and redevelopment of the property that would affect its value and, therefore, the amount of just compensation, the trial court also considered sources of reimbursement for those costs. The trial court also assumed that \u201c[a] potential buyer would seek all sources of funds to reimburse or defray the environmental costs, including investigation or remediation.\u201d The grant was among these sources of reimbursement; indeed, the trial court noted that by September, 1994, approximately $200,000 of the grant money already had been spent toward investigation costs. The court further stated that pursuant to Public Act 93-382, \u201c[the defendant] and any other for-profit partnership, proprietorship or corporation would be permitted to seek state financial assistance for the \u2018construction or rehabilitation of commercial, industrial and mixed use structures ....\u2019\u201d The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the availability of government reimbursement moneys should not \u201cinure to the benefit of the owner,\u201d concluding that under Public Act 93-382 a \u201cnongovernmental owner would be entitled to seek such reimbursement . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that 80 percent of the environmental remediation costs could have been recovered from a variety of sources that included the grant, as well as potential litigation against American Thread, and ultimately credited approximately $2.15 million toward the total rehabilitation costs for the property excluding building l.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Our analysis begins with the now axiomatic principle that in determining fair market value, \u201cit is proper to consider all those elements which an owner or a prospective purchaser could reasonably urge as affecting the fair price of the land .... The determination of the damages to be paid requires the consideration of everything by which the value is legitimately affected . . . but considerations that may not reasonably be held to affect market value are excluded.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>127 Conn. 455, 458, 17 A.2d 507 (1941); accord <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Norback, </em>263 Conn. 155, 168, 819 A.2d 235 (2003); <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 828. This court has applied this principle in a broadly inclusive manner, and we have noted that \u201ctrial courts enjoy substantial discretion in this regard.\u201d <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 843 n.18. Inasmuch as this issue primarily presents a question of relevance, we review the trial court\u2019s consideration of the availability of public funds for abuse of discretion. Id.; see also <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Conn. 279, 332, 838 A.2d 135 (2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(\u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence .... Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">This court\u2019s jurisprudence reflects the deference that we afford our trial courts\u2019 determination of which factors are relevant in the valuation of a property. For example, in <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 83, 88, 239 A.2d 482 (1968), this court noted the realities of open market negotiations and held that when a zoning change \u201cis reasonably probable and not merely a remote or speculative possibility, the probability may properly be considered in the determination of the fair value of property taken by eminent domain.\u201d This court did, however, caution that \u201c[w]ishful thinking, optimistic conjecture, speculation, rumor and unfounded prognostications do not furnish a proper basis for a finding that a litigant has proved the reasonable probability of a future change in zone\u201d; id., 89-90; but if \u201csuch a reasonable probability is proved, it is a proper fact to be considered in the determination of the fair value of property taken by condemnation proceedings.\u201d Id., 90. In <em>Budney, </em>this court held that testimony from the town planner and the chairperson of the planning and zoning commission about the actions that the commission would have taken to change the zoning of the condemnee\u2019s property from rural residential to one that would allow construction of a motel proved the \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a zone change that would enhance the property\u2019s value. Id., 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">More recently, in <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 833, we noted the general principle from <em>Andrews </em>and concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>excluding, as a matter of law, evidence of the property\u2019s environmental contamination and the attendant remediation costs. We concluded that \u201cevidence of environmental contamination and remediation costs is relevant to the valuation of real property taken by eminent domain and admissible in a condemnation proceeding to show the effect, if any, that those factors had on the fair market value of the property on the date of the taking.\u201d Id. We stated that \u201c[i]t blinks at reality to say that a willing buyer would simply ignore the fact of contamination, and its attendant economic consequences, including specifically the cost of remediation, in deciding how much to pay for property\u201d because of the various financial and legal consequences attendant to contaminated property. Id., 833-34. The majority opinion in <em>Northeast </em>/, however, did caution that it did not \u201csay that the admissibility of the costs of remediation should necessarily result in, or should necessarily preclude, a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the market value of the property.\u201d Id., 835. It merely noted that such evidence was admissible, with the appropriate weight to be determined by the trier of fact. Id. Finally, the majority opinion in <em>Northeast I </em>emphasized that it did not \u201cmean to <em>include </em>or <em>preclude </em>any other factor that a trial court appropriately may deem relevant in its determination of the amount, if any, that is to be awarded as a result of the condemnation of the property.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id., 843 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Whether the availability of public economic development funds should be considered in calculating a property\u2019s value for just compensation purposes presents an issue of first impression in our state, and perhaps nationally, as neither the parties\u2019 briefs nor the court\u2019s independent research has disclosed sister state cases addressing this question. In light of our case law instructing us to be broadly inclusive when considering the admissibility of factors that reasonably might influence a property\u2019s fair market value, we conclude that the trial court properly considered the availability of state economic development grant funds in calculating the fair market value of the property.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>In the present case, Mulready\u2019s testimony about the available grants, as well as the fact that the state already had awarded funds to Northeast, established that it was reasonably probable that such funds were available.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It requires no great stretch of the imagination for us to conclude that a prospective real estate purchaser reasonably would consider the availability of such funds before purchasing a contaminated former industrial property located in an economically depressed region. Furthermore, it would be inequitable to consider the impact of environmental contamination on the property\u2019s value in accordance with our ruling in <em>Northeast I, </em>but exclude evidence of grant moneys that plausibly might mitigate the negative financial impact of the pollution in the eyes of a potential buyer. Thus, the availability of such moneys could only enhance the value of the property in the eyes of a reasonable prospective purchaser.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>its discretion by considering the availability of such grant funds in its calculation of the property\u2019s fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF RECOVERY FROM AMERICAN THREAD UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN VALUING THE PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The plaintiffs next contend that the trial court improperly considered the possibility of recovery from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>other sources, including American Thread, in its calculation of the property\u2019s value. In their litany of contentions, they argue that the trial court improperly allocated liability for the contamination to American Thread and its corporate successor because the court lacked the requisite factual predicate for doing so. The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court improperly concluded that the potential rights to recoveiy under the environmental statutes were themselves property rights subject to the state and federal takings clauses. The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court should have refused to admit evidence of the solvency of American Thread\u2019s coiporate successor because that evidence was irrelevant in the absence of a showing of liability. Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly failed to reduce the just compensation award and utilize the defendant\u2019s own liability under the environmental laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The defendant contends at the outset that the plaintiffs again mischaracterize the ruling of the trial court. Accordingly, we first review the memorandum of decision to determine the actual scope of the trial court\u2019s rulings. The court began with several baseline assumptions, starting with a \u201cpotential buyer would seek all sources of funds to reimburse or defray the environmental costs including investigation or remediation.\u201d After considering the availability and award of the grant funds; see part I of this opinion; the trial court noted that \u201cAmerican Thread had assumed liability for environmental cleanup to the extent required by the state [department of environmental protection] Form III and, in 1994, its successor company had sales of $3.4 billion and [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>amortization] of $390 million and was paying a dividend.\u201d The court then \u201cassumed that 80 percent of the remediation cost[s] could be recovered from the $3,000,000 grant and from other potential sources including American Thread.\u201d The trial court discounted the recovery by 20 percent because of administrative and legal fees that would be incurred during the process of seeking reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The plaintiffs had argued to the trial court that it \u201cshould not consider at all the potential right to reimbursement which the owner [the defendant] had under CERCLA and ... \u00a7 22a-452.\u201d The trial court rejected the argument, citing state and federal cases and holding that \u201c[o]bviously, these are rights which run with the land. In accordance with the public policy of both the state and federal government, those responsible for environmental pollution should not be absolved of responsibility merely by divesting themselves of the polluted property. These rights are part of the inherent rights of ownership in the land which were extinguished along with title in the condemnation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Having reviewed both the memorandum of decision and the plaintiffs\u2019 numerous claims on appeal, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling presents two substantive questions for our review. The ruling was not as wide-ranging as the plaintiffs suggest, and in particular it does not allocate actual liability for the property\u2019s contamination in any way. Accordingly, we will confine our inquiry herein to: (1) the basic question of whether the trial court properly considered in its valuation of the property the possibility of recovering the remediation costs from the successor to American Thread; and (2) whether the trial court improperly concluded that the potential rights to recovery under the state and federal environmental statutes were themselves property rights subject to the state and federal takings clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In order to set the legal landscape for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on appeal, we first engage in a brief review of the state and federal environmental statutory schemes providing for the potential recovery of remediation expenses. Under federal law, CERLCA permits the government or private parties to recover from potentially responsible parties reimbursement for remediation expenses that they have incurred in response to environmental threats. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 (a); see also <em>Gussack Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Xerox Corp., </em>224 F.3d 85, 91 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201cCERCLA does not provide compensation to a private party for damages resulting from contamination. Instead, CERCLA permits a private party to be reimbursed for all or some of the costs already incurred in response to contamination.\u201d). Among the potentially responsible parties are the past or present \u201cowners and operators\u201d of covered facilities. See, e.g., <em>Commander Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barlo Equipment Corp., </em>215 F.3d 321, 326 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 979, 121 S. Ct. 427, 148 L. Ed. 2d 436 (2000). \u201cAbsent a showing that one of CERCLA\u2019s affirmative defenses applies, liability for owners and operators is strict.\u201d Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 (b) (1) through (4) (providing affirmative defenses including \u201cany combination\u201d of \u201cact of God,\u201d \u201cact of war,\u201d or \u201cact or omission of a third party\u201d who lacks contractual or employee/agency relationship with defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In addition to being strict, liability under CERCLA is also joint and several among all potentially responsible parties. <em>Bedford Affiliates </em>v. <em>Sills, </em>156 F.3d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1998). A landowner that is itself a potentially responsible party may not file an action against other potentially responsible parties pursuant to \u00a7 9607 (a); any recovery is limited to contribution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613 (f). Id. Section 9613 (f) provides: \u201c \u2018Any person may seek contribution from any other person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>who is hable or potentially hable under \u00a7 9607 (a) . . . . In resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.\u2019 . . . Thus, the statute envisions a two-part inquiry: First, the court must determine whether the defendant is \u2018hable\u2019 under [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 (a)]. Second, the court must allocate response costs among hable parties in an equitable manner. . . . The party seeking contribution bears the burden of proof at both prongs of the court\u2019s inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Goodrich Corp. </em>v. <em>Middlebury, </em>311 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 937, 123 S. Ct. 2577, 156 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Although a \u201c \u2018[pjerson\u2019 \u201d under CERCLA is defined to include \u201ccorporations and other business organizations . . . CERCLA does not provide rules for [delineating] when corporations that are related to the responsible corporation should be held hable.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>National Services Industries, Inc., </em>352 F.3d 682, 684 (2d Cir. 2003) (discussing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 [20] and [21]). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that traditional common-law rules of successor liability apply when \u201cthe question is whether a corporation that purchased the assets of a company hable for environmental response costs under CERCLA should be held hable for those same costs as a successor corporation.\u201d Id. In <em>New York </em>v. <em>National Services Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 685, the Second Circuit responded to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 118 S. Ct. 1876, 141 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1998), by abandoning its CERCLA-specific \u201csubstantial continuity\u201d test. It held that the liability of a successor corporation would depend on \u201cthe traditional common law rule . . . that a corporation acquiring the assets of another corporation only takes on its liabilities if any of the following apply: the successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>them; the transaction may be viewed as a de facto merger or consolidation; the successor is the mere continuation of the predecessor; or the transaction is fraudulent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New York </em>v. <em>National Services Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">With respect to the relevant state laws, \u00a7 22a-452 (a) provides that persons or corporate entities who engage in environmental remediation measures \u201cshall be entitled to reimbursement from any person, firm or corporation for the reasonable costs expended for such\u201d remediation if the contamination at issue \u201cresulted from the negligence or other actions of such person, firm or corporation.\u201d Section 22a-452 provides for joint and several liability when there are multiple negligent parties. Section \u201c22a-452 (a) broadly provides that any person, firm, corporation or municipality that contains, removes or otherwise mitigates the effects of contamination may seek reimbursement from any person, firm or corporation negligently responsible for such contamination. The clear purpose of this provision is to encourage parties to pay for remediation by providing them with an opportunity to recoup at least some of their remediation costs from others who are also found to be responsible for the contamination.\u201d <em>Knight </em>v. <em>F. L. Roberts &amp; Co., </em>241 Conn. 466, 474-75, 696 A.2d 1249 (1997); id., 475-76 (holding that \u201cthe plaintiff [land seller] is entitled to reimbursement from the defendants under \u00a7 22a-452 (a) for their pro rata share of the costs of containing, removing or otherwise mitigating the contamination ... if, as the plaintiff has alleged, the defendants are also negligently responsible for contaminating that property, and [the land purchaser] used the $400,000 it received from the plaintiff to remediate the contamination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Connecticut Transfer Act (Transfer Act), which is codified at General Statutes \u00a7 22a-134 et seq. is another state environmental statute relevant to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>inquiry. The Transfer Act subjects transferors of \u201c \u2018establishments\u2019 \u201d to reporting, investigation and remediation requirements that depend on the environmental condition of the property being transferred. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-134a. The transferor makes the report on one of several forms, which are defined terms under the statute as Forms I, II, III and IV. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-134 (10) through (13) (defining form contents). In the present case, American Thread filed Form III; see General Statutes \u00a7 22a-134 (12); when it sold the property to Eastern. That form was filed because \u201ca release has occurred which has not been cleaned up in a manner approved by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection or for any other reason a negative declaration cannot be submitted.\u201d On Form III, the transferor certifies that \u201cto the extent necessary to minimize or mitigate a threat to human health or the environment, I shall contain, remove, or otherwise mitigate the effects of any discharge, spillage, controlled loss, seepage, or filtration of hazardous waste at the site of . . . establishment in accordance with procedures and a time schedule approved by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection pursuant to an order, stipulated judgment, or consent agreement.\u201d The president of American Thread signed the applicable Form III on October 25,1985, prior to the sale of the property. There is no indication that Eastern completed a Form III when it transferred the property to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Failure to comply with the Transfer Act renders the transferor strictly hable to the transferee for remediation costs and other damages. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-134b. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-134 through 22a-134d were enacted to protect purchasers of property from being hable for the subsequent discovery of hazardous waste on the property by requiring the transferor of property to submit a formal declaration that the property is free of pollution.\u201d <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>27 Conn. App. 353, 358, 606 A.2d 1001 (1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 226 Conn. 737, 629 A.2d 350 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The plaintiffs first argue that the trial court improperly considered the possibility of recovery from prior owners of the property responsible for the environmental conditions thereon. They argue that the trial court\u2019s ruling represents a fundamental misunderstanding of these laws, particularly the Transfer Act, and that the solvency of American Thread\u2019s successor corporation has nothing to do with liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We begin by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. Whether the trial court properly considered the potential recovery of cleanup costs in calculating the property\u2019s fair market value presents an issue of relevance that we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 843 n.18; see also <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 267 Conn. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The trial court\u2019s consideration of the possibility of recovery of remediation costs, pursuant to the state and federal environmental laws must, of course, be viewed in the context of the broadly inclusive approach endorsed by this court in the context of property valua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tion. See <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Norback, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 168; <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 828; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 127 Conn. 458. We cannot exclude consideration of recovery of remediation costs pursuant to environmental laws as irrelevant as a matter of law, or conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by considering them. Put differently, we cannot conclude that a prospective purchaser absolutely would not consider the reasonable possibility of such recovery. See, e.g., <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 458 (\u201c[i]t is proper to consider all those elements which an owner or a prospective purchaser could reasonably urge as affecting the fair price of the land\u201d). Inasmuch as the trial court \u201cenjoy[s] substantial discretion\u201d with respect to the factors that it considers in the valuation inquiry and the weight that it affords them, we are disinclined to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling. See <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 843 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Indeed, we note that our sister state, New York, has ruled similarly. In <em>Commerce Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors, </em>88 N.Y.2d 724,673 N.E.2d 127,649 N.Y.S.2d 932 (1996), a tax certiorari appeal, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that \u201cenvironmental contamination can depress a parcel\u2019s true value . . . [and] must be considered in assessing real property tax\u201d; id., 727; which, as a matter of state constitutional law, is calculated based on the property\u2019s fair market value. Id., 730. New York\u2019s highest court rejected the town\u2019s argument that the property\u2019s market value was unaffected by the presence of contamination because its owner was the subject of a consent order by which it agreed to pay the cleanup costs. Id. The court considered the impact of contamination on the property\u2019s value to be a separate question from the effect of the agreement to pay the cleanup costs, and held that \u201c[w]hether a property owner\u2019s agreement [by consent order] to pay the cleanup costs would affect the property\u2019s value in a given case is a factual matter for the assessment board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 730-31; but see <em>Mola Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Orange County Assessment Appeals Board, </em>80 Cal. App. 4th 309, 325, 95 Cal. Rptr. 546 (2000) (holding that \u201cidea that prudent buyers might be willing to lessen the discount that they would demand on sale of the property in light of the fact that parties other than the seller might also have to contribute to cleanup costs simply does not accord with market reality\u201d); see also footnote 18 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly considered the possibility of recovery under the state and federal environmental statutes, noting that the \u201crecovery of response costs is long, expensive, arduous and uncertain.\u201d They also contend that the requisite factual predicate for liability does not exist, noting that there was no evidence that the defendant had spent any money to rehabilitate the property. The plaintiffs also note that there are other legal issues with respect to establishing liability, including: (1) the applicable statutes of limitation; (2) a lack of proof of American Thread\u2019s culpability under \u00a7 22a-452 (a); (3) the defendant\u2019s own activities on the property; and (4) difficulties inherent in holding the successor corporation liable for the activities of American Thread under the traditional common-law rules governing that inquiry. Inasmuch as the allocation of liability under the state and federal environmental laws has no place in an eminent domain valuation action, we will not engage in a detailed analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 legal arguments under the previously discussed state and federal statutes. Such analysis would yield nothing more than an advisory opinion on the merits of the parties\u2019 environmental causes of action. Our cursory review, however, reveals a variety of meritorious claims and defenses that would present legitimate issues for litigation or, preferably, settlement. We cannot, therefore, say that a reasonable possibility of at least some recovery pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>state and federal environmental laws does not exist, or that the trial court abused its discretion by considering that possibility in this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO FOLLOW THIS COURT\u2019S REMAND ORDER FROM <em>NORTHEAST I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The plaintiffs next argue that the trial court improperly failed to follow this court\u2019s remand order from <em>Northeast I. </em>They claim that the trial court should have adopted the unchallenged factual findings as to the property\u2019s \u201cclean value\u201d that were the predicate for the first appeal, rather than conducting a completely new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 briefing of this claim is replete with violations of Practice Book \u00a7 67-4, and it fails to indicate that this issue was raised before the trial court. See, e.g., <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>269 Conn. 57, 82, 848 A.2d 395 (2004). Nevertheless, the rescript <em>in Northeast I </em>only stated: \u201cThe judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.\u201d <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 843. The rescript did not contain any direction from this court limiting the issues to be tried. It is well settled that \u201ca lower court is bound to follow the specific direction of an appellate court\u2019s mandate on remand.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 Conn. App. 592, 598, 783 A.2d 491 (2001). Inasmuch as \u201c \u2018[a]n order restricting the issues [of a new trial] is the exception, not the rule\u2019 <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>209 Conn. 450, 455, 551 A.2d 1227 (1988), quoting <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Evitts, </em>16 Conn. App. 696, 699-700, 548 A.2d 1352 (1988); we conclude that the trial court properly conducted an entirely new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY AWARDED CERTAIN COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim in this appeal is that the trial court improperly awarded costs pursuant to \u00a7 8-133 for: (1) a real estate appraiser who testified as a fact witness; (2) an appraiser who testified to a business valuation of the successor corporation to American Thread; and (3) a deposition of one of the town\u2019s expert witnesses who did not testify at trial because his testimony was precluded on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. After the trial court rendered judgment, the defendant filed a bill of costs pursuant to \u00a7 8-133 to which the plaintiffs objected, challenging all of the claimed appraisers\u2019 expenses. The trial court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>ruled on the bill of costs in a memorandum of decision dated October 7, 2003. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s bill of costs in part and denied it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Relying on its authority under this court\u2019s decision in <em>French </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>215 Conn. 197, 205, 575 A.2d 686 (1990), to decide what constituted a \u201creasonable amount\u201d of fees, the trial court concluded that Nocera\u2019s appraisal costs were reasonable. With respect to Mulready, who testified about the availability of public funding for the rehabilitation of the properly; see part I of this opinion; the trial court relied on the inclusive approach to valuation as stated in our opinion in <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 828, and concluded that appraisers\u2019 testimony need not \u201cexpressly be limited to expressions of a stated dollar value of the condemned properly.\u201d The court found Mulready\u2019s claimed fees of $12,660 reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the case. The plaintiffs also objected to the claimed costs for Charles Coyne, an appraiser who testified about the solvency of American Thread\u2019s corporate successor. The trial court again relied on our holding in <em>Northeast I </em>and granted Coyne reasonable appraisal costs of $5762.50. The trial court also granted a request by the defendant for expenses of $1554.25, for Martin Brogie, an appraiser designated as an expert by the plaintiffs, but deposed by the defendant. Brogie did not testify at the trial. The trial court noted the policy of \u00a7 8-133 of encouraging condemning agencies to make awards of reasonable compensation, and concluded that proper trial preparation required the defendant to depose the plaintiffs\u2019 expert. The court noted that the policy of encouraging compensation that lies behind \u00a7 8-133 provides for costs that go beyond those limited costs authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 52-257. Finally, the trial court awarded to the defendant various deposition, marshal and copying costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Section 8-133 provides: \u201cIf, as the result of any review under the provisions of section 8-132, the applicant obtains an award from the court greater than the amount determined as compensation by the redevelop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ment agency, <em>costs of court, including such appraised fees as the court determines to be reasonable, shall be awarded to the applicant </em>and taxed against the redevelopment agency in addition to the amount fixed by the judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have held that with respect to costs awarded pursuant to \u00a7 8-133, \u201c[t]he question of what constitutes a reasonable amount is an issue of fact for the trial court, and we will not overturn that finding unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>French </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly awarded fees to Coyne and Mulready because they did not appraise the property, and therefore their expenses were not \u201cappraisal fees.\u201d The plaintiffs also claim that General Statutes \u00a7 52-260 (f) only permits a fee award to a real estate appraiser who has been summoned to give expert testimony at a trial. They also allege that the expense was not authorized pursuant to \u00a7 52-257 because title was not at issue in the proceeding. They contend that \u00a7 8-133 only provides for an award of appraisal \u201cfees,\u201d not appraisal \u201cexpenses.\u201d Relying on our decision in <em>French </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 206, the defendant argues in response that the cost award was appropriate because the costs were for work that was \u201c \u2018necessary for the court\u2019s determination of the value of the taken property.\u2019 \u201d We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The plaintiffs do not contest the reasonableness of the <em>amount </em>of the trial court\u2019s costs award. Rather, they seem to argue that the statutory term \u201cappraisal fees\u201d does not encompass appraisal work pertaining to value impacting factors that lie beyond the property\u2019s terra firma. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim requires us to determine the breadth of the ambiguous statutory term \u201cappraisal fees,\u201d a task that presents a question of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>e.g., <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>269 Conn. 527, 534, 849 A.2d 777 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We begin our analysis with the statute\u2019s ambiguous language. Section 8-133 does not define the term \u201cappraisal fees,\u201d and the only limitation imposed on such fees by the plain language of the statute is that the court determine them to be reasonable. Our review of the statute\u2019s legislative history reveals that it is silent as well.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, we look for guidance in our prior cases addressing the scope of various costs statutes, including \u00a7 8-133.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u201cIt is a settled principle of our common law that parties are required to bear their own litigation expenses, except as otherwise provided by statute.\u201d <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 715, 674 A.2d 845 (1996). A trial court may not tax a cost unless it is \u201cclearly empower[ed]\u201d to do so by the authorizing statute. Id., 716. For example, in <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co., </em>a tax assessment appeal, the trial court ruled that a city had overassessed a property. Id., 713. The trial court awarded the taxpayer costs; it declined, however, to award reimbursement of the fees for the real estate appraiser\u2019s report and testimony. Id., 713-14. This court affirmed that ruling, concluding that real estate appraisal costs could not be taxed because neither the text nor the legislative history of the tax appeal costs statute, General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a, mentioned appraisal costs. Id., 716. Taking note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of, inter alia, \u00a7 8-133, the court further observed that \u201cin circumstances in which the legislature has intended that the prevailing party shall recover appraisal fees, it has expressly so provided.\u201d Id. Finally, the court stated that the appraisal costs were not reimbursable under \u00a7 52-260 (f) because that statute, \u201c[b]y its express terms . . . treats as taxable only those costs that arise from an expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d Id., 717; id., 718 (distinguishing report made in preparation for trial testimony from testimony itself).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This court has addressed \u00a7 8-133 on one prior occasion. In <em>French </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 205-206, an eminent domain valuation case, the trial court awarded to the plaintiffs $5000 pursuant to \u00a7 8-133 as a reasonable reimbursement of engineering fees incurred during the appraisal of their property. The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for full reimbursement of the engineer\u2019s total bill of $48,933. Id., 205. On appeal, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, holding that its award of $5000 was not clearly erroneous because the trial court reasonably could \u201chave found that the engineer\u2019s fees were based in part on work that was not necessary for the court\u2019s determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the value of the taken property.\u201d Id., 206. This court also noted that the trial court could have found $48,933 \u201cexcessive . . . [because] the appraiser\u2019s total fee, which the court ordered reimbursed in full, was only $7700.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In light of <em>French </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 206, wherein this court addressed the reasonableness of the award of <em>engineering </em>fees incurred in connection with the appraisal of a property taken by eminent domain, we conclude that appraisal costs awardable pursuant to \u00a7 8-133 are those costs reasonable and \u201cnecessary for the court\u2019s determination of the value of the taken property.\u201d Indeed, adopting an unduly restrictive construction of the statutory term \u201cappraisal costs\u201d would be inconsistent with the trial court\u2019s discretion to consider a broad variety of factors that reasonably might impact the value of real property; see parts I and II of this opinion; accordingly, we decline to reach the conclusion urged by the plaintiffs with respect to the testimony of the witnesses, Brogie, Coyne and Mulready. See, e.g., <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Montesano, </em>269 Conn. 787, 797, 849 A.2d 839 (2004) (\u201c \u2018we interpret statutes to avoid bizarre or nonsensical results\u2019 \u201d). There is no objection as to the reasonableness of the costs awarded; we, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s award of costs to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 OTHER CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The plaintiffs have made numerous other claims in this appeal, specifically that the trial court improperly:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">(1) set, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 37-3c, a 10 percent interest rate on the just compensation award; and</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">(2) excluded evidence of the actual costs of remediation, and the request of the department of environmental protection for further study of an ash landfill located on the property. We decline to review these claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>because the plaintiffs have not presented them appropriately to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 67-4.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>267 Conn. 539, 546, 839 A.2d 1259 (2004); <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Quality Steel Products, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 424, 447 n.20, 820 A.2d 258 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">CROSS APPEAL: WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY FAILED TO CONSIDER SEPARATELY AND CUMULATIVELY THE EFFECT ON THE PROPERTY\u2019S VALUE OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RECOVERY UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The defendant cross appeals, arguing that the trial court\u2019s award improperly does not reflect the two separate possible sources of remediation cost reimbursement found by the trial court, namely, the public grant funds and the possibility of recovery under state and federal statutes. The defendant contends that these two sources should have been credited separately and cumulatively in the calculation of the property\u2019s value, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and that $2,156,800 should be added to the property\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. In its initial memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that \u201c80 percent of the environmental remediation cost could be recovered from the $3,000,000 grant and from other potential sources including American Thread.\u201d The 20 percent deduction reflects administrative and legal fees incurred. Accordingly, the trial court reduced the environmental costs of $2,696,100 by 80 percent, or $2,156,800. Thereafter, ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the court actually noted that less grant funds had been spent than it had first concluded, and it increased the available reimbursement figure to $2,188,000. This adjustment, in turn, increased the net property value awarded to the defendant. Responding to the defendant\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s failure to treat the two sources of reimbursement separately, the court ruled orally that an action against American Thread\u2019s successor would be \u201cplussing in terms of the value,\u201d but not a primary source of reimbursement because \u201creal estate developers aren\u2019t in the business of buying lawsuits against foreign corporations,\u201d although the potential lawsuit would be a source of \u201csome comfort\u201d to a purchaser. In so concluding, the trial court had put itself \u201cin the position of a potential buyer that wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about buying a lawsuit against a . . . subsidiary of an English company.\u201d It referred to the possibility of a lawsuit as more of an \u201cinsurance policy than a real first line contributor,\u201d and called it an available source to draw on should problems develop with other funding sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim on appeal essentially raises the issue of whether the trial court afforded proper weight to the evidence that it had presented concerning the availability of causes of action against American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Thread and the solvency of its successor. Our review of the defendant\u2019s claim is, therefore, quite limited. \u201cIt is well established that [i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. ... On appeal, we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses. . . . We afford great weight to the trial court\u2019s findings because of its function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>De La Concha of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>269 Conn. 424, 431-32, 849 A.2d 382 (2004); accord <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 835 (\u201c[t]he weight, however, to be attributed to evidence of environmental contamination and remediation costs is to be determined by the trial court as the trier of fact\u201d). Inasmuch as the determination of the proper weight to give the evidence of the potential civil action against the successor to American Thread lies squarely within the province of the trial court, we decline to disturb this ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">CROSS APPEAL: WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY FAILED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE PROPERTY BY ASCRIBING A NEGATIVE VALUE TO THE MILL 4 PARCEL</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In the defendant\u2019s second claim on its cross appeal, it contends that the trial court improperly failed to give effect to the property\u2019s highest and best use when it ascribed a negative net value to the Mill 4 parcel. The defendant argues that the evidence did not support the court\u2019s decision to include the remediation costs for that parcel in the total valuation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>defendant asks this court to direct an increase in the judgment of $1,129,500, which is the amount by which the compensation award was reduced as a result of the negative valuation of the Mill 4 parcel. We disagree with the defendant, and we conclude that the trial court properly considered the impact of the Mill 4 parcel on the value of the entire property.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The record reveals the following additional facts. The plan did not call for any action to be taken with respect to the Mill 4 parcel other than \u201cinitial environmental cleanup . . . .\u2019\u2019It noted complications affecting the parcel, namely, environmental issues, access limitations caused by the river and the old narrow bridge, and the lack of enterprise zone designation. The plan, therefore, stated that Mill 4 \u201cshould be treated as an independent and future development opportunity.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The trial court accepted the testimony of Amadon, the plaintiffs\u2019 appraiser, that the raw land of the Mill 4 parcel had fifteen usable acres valued at $25,000 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>acre for a total of $375,000.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It also determined that parcel 4 required $612,000 worth of environmental work on the site and $267,500 for lead paint and asbestos containment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The trial court then concluded that, after an offset for recyclable materials, the Mill 4 parcel would require $625,000 worth of demolition work. The total cost of the environmental and demolition work for the Mill 4 parcel was $1,504,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The trial court concluded that these environmental and demolition costs would have to be incurred because the Mill 4 parcel could not be \u201cignored\u201d as it was. The trial court concluded from Nocera\u2019s testimony that \u201c \u2018mothball[ing]\u2019 \u201d the parcel in anticipation of future development opportunities was speculative, and that there was no evidence that a reasonable buyer or seller would find that course of action \u201cacceptable.\u201d In ruling orally on the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the trial court noted the existence of a postinspection order from the town\u2019s building department to the defendant made in February, 1993, mandating the restoration or demolition of the building. The trial court \u201cput [itself] in the position of the hypothetical buyer and seller,\u201d and determined that a hypothetical seller would not retain the useless Mill 4 and sell the rest of the property, and a hypothetical buyer would be concerned about the existence of Mill 4 because developing the rest of the property requires \u201ccooperation from the city, and the city is not going to let you do anything until you in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>some way address Mill 4.\u201d The trial court, therefore, considered the Mill 4 parcel costs as part of the $6,000,300 in environmental, stabilization and demolition costs that were applied to the property\u2019s gross value of $8,256,040 before further adjustments yielded the property\u2019s net fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The defendant argues that the highest and best use for the Mill 4 parcel would be to leave it untouched, and address the environmental problems at a later date prior to its development. Accordingly, the defendant argues that it should have been excluded from the trial court\u2019s valuation of the remainder of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Determination of a property\u2019s highest and best use is a question of fact for the trier. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s highest and best use determination for clear error. See, e.g., <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Norback, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 168; <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>221 Conn. 736, 748, 607 A.2d 402 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Having reviewed the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the Mill 4 parcel, we cannot say that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or . . . [that we have a] definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 23, 809 A.2d 955 (2002). Given the trial court\u2019s expansive discretion in determining a property\u2019s highest and best use and just compensation, it certainly was entitled to consider the effect on a hypothetical transaction of the existence of the Mill 4 parcel, the condemnation order and the attendant costs. See, e.g., <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 829-30. Indeed, the court also was entitled to credit the plan itself, which stated that demolition and cleanup could be accomplished most economically if \u201cdone in conjunction with similar activities at the rest of the site.\u201d See footnote 25 of this opinion. Inasmuch as the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>in a condemnation hearing is \u201cmore than just a trier of fact or an arbitrator of differing opinions of witnesses\u201d; <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 829; and it may rely on its \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d in addition to the record evidence; id., 830; we conclude that the court\u2019s ruling with respect to the Mill 4 parcel was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"> The Windham Mills property has been a particularly fertile spawning ground for litigation before this court.

The defendant, however, disagrees with this characterization of the ruling as an award; it argues that the trial court properly considered the existence of grant funds as a <em>relevant factor </em>in the equitable inquiry of calculating the property\u2019s value for just compensation purposes. Having reviewed both the transcript of that oral argument and the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, we disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling as an award. The defendant\u2019s characterization of the trial court\u2019s ruling as one considering the availability of grant funds merely as a factor in calculating the property\u2019s value is more accurate, and we review the trial court\u2019s ruling accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> In their brief, the plaintiffs note that they objected to much of Mulready\u2019s testimony on hearsay and expert qualification grounds; the trial court overruled most of these objections. To the cryptic and fleeting extent that the plaintiffs claim that these evidentiary rulings were improper under the admissibility standards of <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S.

In his concurrence, Chief Justice McDonald stated that he would have included potential sources of reimbursement, including the liability of American Thread and the availability of federal and state funds, in determining the property\u2019s fair market value. <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 844-45.

Id., 852-53 <em>(Flynn, J., </em>dissenting). The majority opinion in <em>Northeast I </em>emphatically did not, however, foreclose the subsequent inclusion of these factors in determination of the property\u2019s value; it did, however, question whether they existed in the record on that first appeal. Id., 843 n.18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\"> The plaintiffs argue that the trial court misread the text of Public Act 93-382 and the grant when it concluded that the defendant or another \u201cfor-profit partnership, proprietorship or corporation would be permitted to seek financial assistance for \u2018construction or rehabilitation of commercial, industrial and mixed use structures.\u2019 \u201d They state correctly that only entities that are \u201cagencies]\u201d as defined under the Regional Economic Development Act; Public Act 93-382, \u00a7 25 (2); may apply for grants pursuant to that act, and that the defendant does not fit within the definition of \u201cagency\u201d set forth therein. See General Statutes \u00a7 32-327 (2). They further note that the grant documents reference expressly \u00a7 27 of the Regional Economic Development Act. The plaintiffs argue that the trial court, therefore, should not have considered the grant funds because they would not be available to the ordinary real estate investor.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The defendant, however, argues that the relatively limited availability of the specific financing that was actually awarded to the plaintiffs is irrelevant. Moreover, it states that the trial court correctly considered the availability of state economic development funds under other programs, particularly Public Act 93-382, \u00a7 53, which was codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 4-66c (d), and explicitly allowed private entities, both for and not-for-profit, to apply for economic development grants from urban action bonds that could be used for the \u201cconstruction or rehabilitation of commercial, industrial and mixed use structures . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">We conclude that the language of Public Act 93-382, \u00a7 27, and its authorization of the grant received by the plaintiffs did not preclude the trial court from considering the availability of public economic development funds. As the defendant points out correctly, the crucial question for the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>was whether funds were <em>available </em>to potential buyers at the time of the taking in September, 1994, not the funds that actually were awarded. Moreover, Mulready testified that he considered the effect of public-private partnerships in making economic development grant money available. Such funds clearly would be available under the Regional Economic Development Act to a private entity participating in a public-private partnership, so long as the regional economic development agency applied for the grant. See General Statutes \u00a7 32-327 (4) (\u201c \u2018[eligible project\u2019 means [A] a public or private improvement or acquisition which, in the sole judgment of the commissioner, will significantly enhance economic diversification, stability, growth or scientific knowledge in the region where the project is to be located\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court acted well within its discretion by considering the availability of state grant funds under Public Act 93-382.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> The plaintiffs also argue that the grant funds are speculative financing that should not have been considered by the trial court in its valuation of the property. We disagree. This is a question of fact, and the trial court as trier of fact was free to credit Mulready\u2019s testimony about the availability of economic development funds for the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> The plaintiffs rely on <em>Mola Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Orange County Assessment Appeals Board, </em>80 Cal. App. 4th 309, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 546 (2000), in support of their contention that expected future contributions toward the cleanup of contaminated properties bear no relevance to such a property\u2019s market value because \u201cbuyers are interested in actual money, not in the promise of funds or of reimbursement hopes. \u201d In that case, a tax assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>appeal, a development company had purchased prime, but vacant real estate, for development into a mixed use commercial and residential area. Id., 312-13. The land was polluted with toxic waste from its former use as an industrial facility; the cleanup attempts had been unsuccessful. Id., 313. The developer then entered into an agreement with the two former landowners for contributions toward the remediation of the land. Id. The developer challenged the tax assessment, claiming that the costs of remediation should have been deducted from the market value used for the assessment. Id. The assessment appeals board reduced the assessment by the costs of remediation, but also added back into that reduction the amount that would be paid by the prior landowners. Id., 315. The trial court then ruled that the board\u2019s calculation was improper because the amount owed by former landowners should not have been added back. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The tax assessment board appealed to the California Court of Appeals, which held that the \u201cidea that prudent buyers might be willing to lessen the discount that they would demand on sale of the property in light of the fact that parties other than the seller might also have to contribute to cleanup costs simply does not accord with market reality, because of one unassailable fact: From the hypothetical buyer\u2019s point of view, the peculiar circumstances of the seller, such as its ability to recoup costs for which it is already liable, is irrelevant.\u201d Id., 325. The court further stated that \u201c[i]t malees no difference to the buyer whether the seller pays the cost of cleanup, or whether the seller and some third parties pay them. The fact of life is that environmental laws will require those costs to be expended on the property . . . .\u201d Id., 326. Accordingly, the California court concluded that the trial court properly determined that it was improper to add the cleanup contributions back into the market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\"><em>Mola Development Corp. </em>undoubtedly appears helpful to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in this appeal. We, however, find its reasoning fundamentally incompatible with the broadly inclusive approach to the admissibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>evidence relevant, to valuation that we follow in this state. See <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 828; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>supra, 127 Conn. 458. The better approach under our well settled principles of property valuation is to admit such evidence, and permit the trier to assess its proper weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\"> The plaintiffs also argue that the admission of evidence about the potential recovery of remediation costs under federal and state environmental laws violates this court\u2019s holding in <em>Northeast I </em>that issues of fault are irrelevant in an eminent domain valuation proceeding. <em>Northeast I, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 836-39, citing 7A P. Nichols, Eminent Domain (3d Ed. Rev. 2000, P. Rohan &amp; M. Reskin eds.) \u00a7 13B. We disagree. Just as \u201cpermitting the admission of evidence of environmental contamination and remediation costs in an eminent domain proceeding does not mean that in personam liability is being allocated in thatproceeding\u2019^Vortfeeust/, supra, 838; consideration of the <em>potential </em>for the expedient recovery of those costs similarly does not mean the court is allocating liability. See also id., 839 (\u201c[t]hus, the valuation trial no more allocates liability under the environmental statutes than it allocates third party liability in a situation where a parcel of property, prior to a taking, is damaged by a third party tortfeasor\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> The plaintiffs also contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the CERCLA and state law causes of action are \u201crights which run with the land.\u201d Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that this conclusion of law was improper, it is, in any event, harmless error. This conclusion appears in the context of the trial court\u2019s decision concluding that 80 percent of the environmental remediation costs could be recovered by a hypothetical <em>buyer. </em>The trial court's opinion does not in any way separately compensate the defendant for its loss of rights to state or federal causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">We also note that the plaintiffs apparently claim that the trial court improperly ignored the value of the town\u2019s Form in. Specifically, they claim that by filing a Form in when it transferred the property to Northeast, the town assumed all responsibility with respect to the property\u2019s condition; accordingly, the property\u2019s value should be reduced. We decline to consider this claim on appeal. The plaintiffs\u2019 brief does not indicate that this issue was raised before the trial court. Moreover, this claim is inadequately briefed, with minimal citation to authority and no citation to the record, and is therefore procedurally not in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 67-4. Accordingly, we decline to reach this issue. See, e.g., <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation &amp; Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>269 Conn. 57, 82, 848 A.2d 395 (2004); <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Quality Steel Products, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 424, 447 n.20, 820 A.2d 258 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"> The legislature added the \u201cappraisal fees\u201d provision to \u00a7 8-133 in 1965.

Sup. 390,391,191 A.2d 345 (1963), granted a municipality\u2019s objection to a $2100 appraisal fee because provisions of \u00a7 8-133 did not provide for appraisal costs at that time. The court limited the appraisal fee to $50 because \u201c[t]he allowable fees of parties in civil actions are set out in \u00a7 52-257 of the General Statutes, and the only allowable costs for a real estate expert are \u2018not exceeding\u2019 $50, paid for an expert on the value of land in an action \u2018affecting the title to real estate.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> In <em>Arnone </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>79 Conn.

In <em>Amone, </em>the trial court, acting pursuant to the undefined costs provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-5lm and 31-51q, taxed against a municipal defendant the costs of the plaintiffs economist in a whistleblower case. Id., 530. The Appellate Court,, relying primarily on our decision in <em>M.

Accordingly, neither the economist\u2019s trial preparation, or \u201cnontestimonial costs,\u201d or in-court testimony were compensable costs because \u201c[a]n economist is not a listed expert witness whose cost may be reimbursed under \u00a7 52-260 (f).\u201d Id., 534.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> More specifically, the briefing of the evidentiary claim lacks the verbatim statement of the relevant objections and the trial court\u2019s ruling thereon required pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-4 (d) (3) for appeals of evidentiary rulings.

Inasmuch as the plaintiffs\u2019 briefing of the interest issue constitutes an abstract assertion completely devoid of citation to legal authority or the appropriate standard of review, we exercise our discretion to decline to review this claim as inadequately briefed.

The defendant argues that the condemnation should have been viewed in effect as a partial taking, and that including the costs of remediating a geographically separate property permits the condemnor to achieve the site with the \u201cactual development potential for less than its fair market value.\u201d Our review of the record, including the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration filed with the trial court, indicates that the defendant confined its arguments to factual issues; the legal claim was not raised before the trial court.

Adequate access would require construction of a new bridge over the river and the adjacent Amtrak railroad tracks at a cost of up to $3 million.
