See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>75 Conn. App. 364, 368,815 A.2d 1261 (2003). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the improper admission of the challenged constancy of accusation testimony constitute harmful error?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>263 Conn. 913, 822 A.2d 242 (2003). We conclude that the evidentiary impropriety was harmless and, therefore, that, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, the improper admission of the constancy of accusation evidence does not warrant a new trial. In light of that conclusion, we also address the defendant\u2019s alternative grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) his due process right to a fair trial was violated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to maintain the appearance of impartiality; (2) the trial court improperly allowed one of the state\u2019s expert witnesses to testify in a manner that unfairly bolstered the victim\u2019s credibility; and (3) the trial court improperly permitted the victim\u2019s mother to testify regarding her belief that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the defendant had sexually abused the victim. We reject the first and third of these claims and decline to review the second of these claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cThe victim<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was bom in 1985. In 1993 and 1994, the victim lived with her mother, the victim\u2019s two half-sisters and the defendant. The defendant and the victim\u2019s mother had lived together [since] the victim was two years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u201cThe victim testified that the defendant sexually assaulted her at least four times a week during 1993 and 1994. Those assaults occurred in the family home while the victim\u2019s mother was either absent from the apartment or while she was in another part of the apartment sleeping. The victim testified that she did not cry out or otherwise attempt to tell her mother about the assaults because the defendant had threatened her. One of the victim\u2019s half-sisters witnessed the assaults on the victim on several occasions. The defendant unsuccessfully attempted to coerce the half-sister into participating in those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u201cThe half-sister eventually disclosed the defendant\u2019s abuse of the victim to a friend at school. That friend, in turn, told [a] school social worker about the sexual assaults. On March 24,1994, the [school] social worker spoke with the victim about the assaults. The victim testified that although her half-sister had encouraged her to confide in the school social worker, she initially had lied to the social worker and denied that the defendant had assaulted her. At trial, the victim stated that she had denied that those assaults had occurred because she was afraid of the defendant. The victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>eventually did tell the school social worker that the defendant had assaulted her. The victim also was interviewed by [Rita Kornblum] an intake worker for the department of children and families (department) and [Kimberly Herwerth] a sexual assault crisis counselor. During those interviews, the victim confirmed the allegations of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201cFollowing those interviews, the victim and her half-sister confronted the defendant and the victim\u2019s mother with the allegations of abuse during a meeting at the department\u2019s offices. After that meeting, the department took the children into its custody. Three days later, the defendant fled to Puerto Rico. On March 2, 2000, a fugitive task force arrested the defendant in Puerto Rico. [The defendant] was extradited to Connecticut on March 22, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201cOn April 5, 1994, a physician [Frederick Berrien] examined the victim on the department\u2019s referral. Although his examination did not establish conclusively that the victim had been sexually assaulted, the physical evidence was sufficient for [Berrien] ... to form \u2018a veiy high degree of suspicion\u2019 that the victim had been exposed to some form of sexual contact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 366-68. At the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s trial, the jury found him guilty of two counts of sexual assault in the first degree and two counts of risk of injuiy to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, that court agreed with the defendant that the trial court improperly had permitted two witnesses to testify regarding the details of complaints made by the victim in violation of <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 304, 677 A.2d 917 (1996).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Without explicitly engaging in a harmful error analysis, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction on the basis of this evidentiary impropriety and remanded the case for a new trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 368, 373, 386. On appeal to this court following our granting of certification, the state claims that, although the challenged constancy of accusation evidence exceeded the bounds of <em>Troupe, </em>its admission was harmless. The defendant contends that the Appellate Court properly concluded otherwise and contends, alternatively, that several other alleged evidentiary improprieties warrant affirmance of the judgment of the Appellate Court. We agree with the state that neither the improperly admitted constancy of accusation evidence nor the other alleged evidentiary improprieties require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We first address the state\u2019s claim that the improperly admitted constancy of accusation evidence was harmless. The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to bar the state from introducing any constancy of accusation evidence. The defendant alternatively requested that any such evidence be limited in accordance with the dictates of <em>Troupe. </em>The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to bar the state from introducing any constancy of accusation evidence with the caveat that, in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>Troupe, </em>such evidence would be limited to the fact that the victim made a complaint, the date and nature of that complaint, and the identity of the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>At trial, the state called the victim as its first witness. The victim testified at length, and in graphic detail, regarding the defendant\u2019s repeated sexual assaults. In particular, she explained that the defendant \u201cwould place [his] penis in my vagina and he would put his penis in my anus and he would put his mouth in my vagina.\u201d The victim testified that, on one occasion, the defendant \u201ccame into my bedroom, tried to wake me up, pulled down my underwear and he would put his penis in my vagina and his mouth in my vagina,\u201d and that, another time, the defendant \u201c[got] some Vaseline . . . and put it on my vagina and on my anus and then he put his penis in my vagina and in my anus and it hurt so much that\u2014it just hurt and he wouldn\u2019t stop and [it] burned.\u201d The victim further stated that, on another occasion, the defendant \u201chad [the] bathtub ready, filled with water, and he told me to take off my clothes and he took off my underwear and he was undressed and he told me to get into the bathtub and he had soap, a bar of soap, and he wet the soap and made bubbles and he put the soap in my vagina and when he was doing that it just burned ... it burned like fire. And then, while I was in the bathtub and he went in the bathtub at the same time ... he put his penis in my vagina.\u201d The victim explained that, on yet another occasion, the defendant \u201cwrestled me ... . [H]e grabbed me as if I was a baby, like he was . . . changing a baby\u2019s diaper,\u201d and that, on that occasion, \u201che put his penis in my vagina and in my anus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The victim also testified about the lurid details of other incidents of sexual abuse by the defendant. In describing one such incident, the victim stated that the defendant \u201cwas on top of [the] bed . . . and ... he told me to take off my clothes and my underwear. He had his pants down and his underwear down and put his penis in my vagina and while he was doing that\u2014 the time that he was doing that\u2014all this white stuff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>came out and that stuff just, just stink, and that made me throw up, and it just bothered me so much that, you know ... he even put the white stuff in me while he was putting his penis in me.\u201d The victim described how she \u201cwould cry because of the pain,\u201d but the defendant would not stop the abuse. She also explained that, while the defendant was penetrating her vaginally and anally, he would ask \u201cif I liked it or [if] someday I would let a guy do that to me.\u201d The victim farther indicated that there were occasions when she knew that the defendant had ejaculated because, as she explained, she \u201cwould smell the white stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">One of the victim\u2019s half sisters, who witnessed some of the abuse perpetrated on the victim by the defendant, also testified for the state. Her testimony, like that of the victim, was detailed and graphic. She explained that she had seen the defendant put \u201chis penis in [the victim\u2019s] vagina\u201d and \u201chis mouth in her vagina.\u201d She further indicated that she had seen \u201csome white stuff coming out of [the defendant\u2019s penis],\u201d and that the defendant had put the \u201cwhite stuff\u201d in the victim\u2019s vagina with his hand. The victim\u2019s half sister also testified that the defendant had asked her to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Kornblum, the department intake worker who had interviewed the victim, also testified for the state. In response to questioning by the assistant state\u2019s attorney regarding Kornblum\u2019s interview with the victim, Komblum stated: \u201c[The victim] disclosed that [the defendant] had touched her private parts and that he had inserted his penis, which she called \u2018butt\u2019 at that time, into her private parts, which she meant her vagina, and that this had happened on several occasions, and one time she described . . . some white stuff coming out of his butt called \u2018penis.\u2019 \u201d Defense counsel objected to Kornblum\u2019s testimony on the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. The court excused the jury and, after entertaining arguments con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ceming defense counsel\u2019s objection, took no specific action in regard to Kornblum\u2019s testimony. Thereafter, however, Kornblum did not revisit the details of the assault, and her testimony proceeded without further objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The state also called Herwerth, the sexual assault crisis counselor who had interviewed the victim, as a witness. On direct examination, Herwerth was asked what the victim had told her during the interview, and defense counsel objected on the basis of the court\u2019s prior ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. The court overruled the objection,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Herwerth testified in relevant part: \u201c[The victim] disclosed [to me] that, on several occasions . . . [the defendant] had . . . touched her in her private\u2014she also called it a \u2018butt.\u2019 We made sure that she was making reference\u2014what those words meant. In other words, diagrams are sometimes used\u2014children point to themselves. She clearly stated that words that she used for her vaginal area was \u2018butt\u2019 or \u2018private.\u2019 She referred to her rectal area as \u2018bottom.\u2019 She referred to a male penis as a \u2018butt.\u2019 And she said that [the defendant] put his private in her private on several occasions, that he also would rub his private and touch her private and slimy white stuff would come out into his hand. He would throw it into the toilet.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u201c[The victim] said on one occasion, in particular, [that] the slimy white stuff went into her private. She got up, went into the bathroom to clean herself with toilet paper. She said, interestingly enough, that her mother almost caught them, but that when her mother came to the bathroom, she was a little nervous. So [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>victim] said, \u2018I just told my mother I was going to the bathroom.\u2019 She said that this would happen ... in [the] housing projects [in which they lived]. And she said that it would happen in the bathroom, [the defendant\u2019s] bedroom and her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201c[The victim] said that [the defendant] told her not to tell because her mother would hit her if she did tell. She said that her . . . older sister had witnessed this happening. And she said that it would make her throw up. . . . She also said that he put his private in her bottom and that it hurt her, and she had told her mother that her bottom hurt her and her mother gave her medicine to help her go to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Sergeant John Wackerman of the Willimantic police department also testified for the state. Wackerman properly<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> testified that the victim had made a complaint to him on March 24, 1994, regarding certain acts of vaginal, oral and anal intercourse committed against her by the defendant. Wackerman also testified that the defendant had fled to Puerto Rico between three and four days after he had been confronted with the victim\u2019s allegations but before the police had had an opportunity to speak with him. Wackerman further explained that the defendant was apprehended in and extradited from Puerto Rico nearly six years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the trial, the court instructed the jury regarding the constancy of accusation evidence. Specifically, the trial court instructed the jury that the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements could not be considered as proof of the truth of the matters asserted therein but could only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>considered to the extent that such testimony corroborated or did not corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the portions of Herwerth\u2019s testimony and Kornblum\u2019s testimony that related details of the accusations made by the victim had been improperly admitted at trial. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>to introduce that evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 372. The Appellate Court stated: \u201cThe nature of the constancy of accusation testimony in the present case exemplifies the particular dangers that [were] . . . noted in <em>Troupe. </em>Specifically, the nature of that testimony was ideally designed to arouse the prejudices and sympathies of the [jurors]. The facts of this case present a situation [in which] a young child allegedly has been subjected to degrading abuse of the most heinous sort at the hands of an individual who is invited into the home by the victim\u2019s mother and who, ideally, should be filling the role of the victim\u2019s protector and guardian. When faced with the appalling details of the alleged assaults, the jury could not help but be roused by antipathy and disgust.\u201d Id., 372-73. With this background in mind, we turn to the merits of the state\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the legal principles that govern our review. \u201cThe constancy of accusation doctrine is well established in Connecticut and recently has been reaffirmed by this court. . . . The doctrine originally was premised on the arguably inaccurate premise that, if a woman had been sexually assaulted, it would be natural for her to confide in others. . . . Until <em>[Troupe], </em>we permitted witnesses to testify about the details of a victim\u2019s accounts of the alleged sexual assault on the theory that, if the victim\u2019s story were true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth would the more clearly appear. ... In <em>[Troupe], </em>however, we restricted the doctrine so that a constancy of accusation witness could testify only to the fact and the timing of the victim\u2019s complaint. Even so limited, the evidence would be admissible solely for corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony, and not for substantive purposes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>244 Conn. 640, 645, 712 A.2d 919 (1998); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Furthermore, this court has made clear that the admission of the details of a sexual assault victim\u2019s complaint for corroborative purposes does not carry constitutional implications. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 305. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if [the] error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 39, 770 A.2d 908 (2001). Two lines of cases have developed setting forth the standard for reversing non-constitutional, evidentiary improprieties. Under one line of cases, the defendant must establish, in order to obtain a reversal of his conviction, that it is more probable than not that the result of the trial would have been different if the error had not been committed. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavell, </em>235 Conn. 711, 721-22, 670 A.2d 261 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Buster, </em>224 Conn. 546, 561, 620 A.2d 110 (1993). According to a second line of cases, the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>245 Conn. 351, 371-72, 716 A.2d 36 (1998). Under either formulation, \u201c[w]hether [the improper admission of a witness\u2019 testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 174, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Upon consideration of the relevant factors, we conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the challenged testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth had any material bearing on the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had committed the sexual assaults against the victim as alleged by the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, the testimony of both witnesses was very brief. The challenged portion of Kornblum\u2019s testimony consists of only one sentence, and the challenged portion of Herwerth\u2019s testimony comprises a total of approximately one page of trial transcript. Moreover, the trial court expressly apprised the jury that it was to consider the constancy of accusation testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth solely for the purpose of evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility and not as substantive evidence establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Furthermore, and importantly, the victim and her half sister testified graphically and in detail about the sexual abuse that the victim had suffered at the hands of the defendant. Thus, the improper constancy of accusation testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth merely was cumulative of the testimony of the victim and her half sister, both of whom had witnessed the abuse firsthand.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>is well recognized that any error in the admission of evidence does not require reversal of the resulting judgment if the improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other validly admitted testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dehaney, </em>261 Conn. 336, 364, 803 A.2d 267 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1217,123 S. Ct. 1318,154 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Finally, the state\u2019s case against the defendant was very strong. In addition to the explicit and detailed testimony of the victim and her half sister, the state adduced testimony from Berrien, the physician who had examined the victim shortly after her disclosure that she had been sexually abused. Berrien stated that, on the basis of his examination of the victim, he had \u201ca very high degree of suspicion that [the victim] had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sexual contact . . . .\u201d The evidence also established that the defendant fled to Puerto Rico between three and four days after learning about the victim\u2019s allegations against him but before the police were able to interview him about those allegations. The defendant did not return to Connecticut until his arrest and extradition almost six years later. As we previously have stated, \u201c[fjlight, when unexplained, tends to prove a consciousness of guilt . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coltherst, </em>263 Conn. 478, 521, 820 A.2d 1024 (2003). The defendant testified at trial but offered no explanation for his flight beyond stating that he \u201chad to go to Puerto Rico.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In light of the graphic, detailed and firsthand nature of the properly admitted testimony of the victim and her half sister, and the strength of the state\u2019s evidence establishing that the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim, any possible harm that may have flowed from the brief portions of Kornblum\u2019s and Herwerth\u2019s testimony that exceeded the bounds of <em>Troupe </em>was minimal. We therefore disagree with the Appellate Court that the admission of the challenged testimony warrants reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The defendant claims, as the Appellate Court concluded, that the graphic details of the sexual abuse related by Kornblum and Herwerth necessarily aroused feelings of antipathy and disgust in the jurors that were so substantial as to make it impossible for the jurors to render a fair and impartial verdict. The testimony of the victim and her half sister, in which they detailed the horrific and repeated sexual abuse perpetrated against the victim by the defendant, however, also was extremely graphic and explicit in nature. Indeed, the testimony of the victim and her half sister was considerably more detailed, and certainly no less graphic, than the challenged testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth. In light of the testimony of the victim and her half sister, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>we cannot see how the objectionable constancy of accusation evidence possibly could have aroused such <em>additional and undue </em>antipathy and disgust in the jurors as to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The defendant further asserts that the challenged testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth unfairly bolstered the credibility of the victim. We also reject this claim. Both Kornblum and Herwerth properly testified, in accordance with Troupe, that the victim had told them when and where the sexual abuse had occurred, and that the defendant had committed the abuse. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304. In addition, Sergeant Wackerman also testified to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint. Thus, the credibility of the victim was buttressed by that portion of the constancy of accusation testimony of Kornblum, Herwerth and Wackerman that properly was admitted. Any additional corroborative value of the objectionable testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth was, at best, marginal. Moreover, as we have explained, the victim\u2019s credibility significantly was bolstered by other evidence adduced at trial, including eyewitness and medical testimony, and the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s unexplained flight. In view of this evidence and the constancy of accusation testimony that properly was admitted, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that Kornblum\u2019s and Herwerth\u2019s brief recitation of some of the details of the victim\u2019s complaints so significantly buttressed the victim\u2019s credibility as to taint the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that constancy of accusation evidence that exceeds the strictures of <em>Troupe </em>is inherently prejudicial. This claim also lacks merit. Prior to our decision in <em>Troupe, </em>details of the complaints made by sexual assault victims were routinely and properly admitted under the constancy of accusation doctrine. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>207 Conn. 646, 649-50, 542 A.2d 1136 (1988). In <em>Troupe, </em>of course, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>revisited that doctrine and decided that the interests of fairness are better served by limiting constancy of accusation evidence to the defendant\u2019s identity as the assailant and the time and place of the sexual assault. <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304. In balancing the interests involved, we acknowledged that defendants accused of sexual assault have \u201can interest in not being unreasonably burdened by such . . . evidence . . . .\u201d Id., 302. We also noted that \u201c[c]oncems about such evidence are magnified if the victim has reported the alleged offense to a number of persons, all of whom are permitted to testify about the details of the complaint.\u201d Id., 302-303. We recognized that, \u201c[i]n such circumstances, there is an enhanced risk that the jury may be unduly swayed by the repeated iteration of the constancy of accusation testimony.\u201d Id., 303. Nevertheless, we did not conclude in <em>Troupe </em>that the reiteration of detailed complaints by numerous constancy of accusation witnesses <em>necessarily </em>would sway a jury unduly. Thus, the fact that the challenged testimony in the present case exceeded the bounds of <em>Troupe </em>does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that its improper admission constitutes reversible error. On the contrary, for the reasons that we previously noted, we conclude that the admission of the challenged testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth was harmless in the particular circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The defendant also asserts three alternative grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) he was deprived of his right to a fair trial by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to maintain the appearance of impartiality; (2) the trial court improperly permitted an expert witness to testily in a manner that unfairly bolstered the victim\u2019s credibility; and (3) the trial court improperly allowed the victim\u2019s mother to testify as to her belief that the defendant had sexually abused the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The defendant contends that his due process right to a fair trial was violated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s failure to maintain the appearance of impartiality.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court questioned a witness in the presence of the jury in a manner that suggested that the court was acting as an advocate for the state. The defendant failed to object to the trial court\u2019s examination of the witness and, therefore, seeks to prevail on his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>adequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim because he has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists. See id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to a resolution of this claim. At trial, defense counsel adduced testimony from Eric Galin Mart, a psychologist who specializes in the sexual abuse of children. Mart testified generally regarding the ability of children to recall events and the proper method for interviewing children who allege that they have been victims of sexual abuse. Mart specifically testified, in accordance with certain allegedly relevant professional guidelines, that such interviews should be recorded either on videotape or audiotape or through contemporaneous, verbatim transcription. Defense counsel then asked Mart to give his opinion regarding the manner in which certain interviews of the victim were conducted in the present case. Mart replied that his \u201cbiggest difficulty\u201d was the lack of a verbatim record of those interviews. According to Mart, without such a record, it is impossible to tell whether questionable techniques, such as the use of leading questions or repetition of the same question, were utilized by the interviewers in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">After both parties concluded their examinations of Mart, the trial court posed some questions to him.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Neither party objected to the trial court\u2019s questioning of Mart. In its instructions to the jury at the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the trial, the court stated: \u201c[Y]ou should not draw any inferences whatsoever from any questions that I may have asked any of the witnesses in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Well established principles regarding the responsibilities of the trial judge in conducting a criminal trial guide our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cDue process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm. ... In a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is [the trial judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. . . . Consistent with his [or her] neutral role, the trial judge is free to question witnesses or otherwise intervene in a case in an effort to clarify testimony and assist the jury in understanding the evidence so long as [the trial judge] does not appear partisan in doing so. . . . Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>when it clearly appears to the judge that for one reason or another the case is not being presented intelligibly to the jury, the judge is not required to remain silent. On the contrary, the judge may, by questions to a witness, elicit relevant and important facts. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u201cOne of the chief roles of the trial judge is to see that there is no misrmderstanding of a [witness\u2019] testimony. The judge has a duty to comprehend what a witness says as much as it is [the judge\u2019s] duty to see that the witness communicates with the jury in an intelligible manner. A trial judge can do this in a fair and unbiased way. [The judge\u2019s] attempt to do so should not be a basis of error. Whe[n] the testimony is confusing or not altogether clear the alleged jeopardy to one side caused by the clarification of a [witness\u2019] statement is certainly outweighed by the desirability of factual understanding. The trial judge should strive toward verdicts of fact rather than verdicts of confusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>254 Conn. 739, 769-70, 760 A.2d 82 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The defendant first contends that it was unnecessary for the trial court to question Mart because Mart\u2019s testimony was not confusing. We reject this claim. Unlike an appellate court, the trial court is able to observe the testimony of witnesses firsthand and, therefore, is better able to assess the relative clarity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of any particular testimony. On the basis of the printed record alone, we cannot say that Mart\u2019s testimony was so clear and straightforward that the trial court\u2019s questioning of him was wholly unnecessary or inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The defendant further claims that the manner in which the trial court questioned Mart was improper. The defendant concedes that the majority of the trial court\u2019s questions and the answers that Mart had given in response were merely cumulative of Mart\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>mony. The defendant primarily takes issue with three questions posed by the trial court that, according to the defendant, demonstrated that the court was attempting to bolster the credibility or reliability of the techniques employed by the witnesses for the state who had interviewed the victim. Those questions are: (1) \u201c[I]f the questioners had been asking open-ended questions, there would be less likelihood of false memory?\u201d (2) \u201cAnd your principal concern with the interviewing in this particular case really was the absence of a verbatim record?\u201d And (3) \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that, in this particular case, the interviewers did a bad job?\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, those questions contain no necessary suggestion of advocacy by the court. Moreover, as the defendant concedes, the allegedly objectionable questions and answers thereto consisted essentially of restatements of Mart\u2019s testimony, elicited on direct examination, regarding his opinion of the integrity of the interviews of the victim. Thus, the questions served merely to clarify Mart\u2019s testimony for the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>197 Conn. 629, 641, 500 A.2d 1303 (1985) (\u201c[a court\u2019s] comments or questions for the purpose of clarifying . . . testimony are permissible and often necessary\u201d). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s questioning of a witness is not necessarily improper [merely] because it draws attention to the strengths or weaknesses of a party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 544, 550, 512 A.2d 884 (1986). Thus, the fact that the trial court\u2019s questions addressed Mart\u2019s criticism of the interview process as it relates solely to the lack of a verbatim record does not render that questioning improper. Finally, the trial court admonished the jury in forceful and straightforward language that it was not to draw any inferences on the basis of any questions that the court may have asked any of the witnesses. We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not violated by virtue of the trial court\u2019s questioning of Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted Leslie Martin Lothstein, a clinical psychologist who testified for the state regarding the psychological characteristics and behavioral patterns of child victims of sexual abuse, to testify in a manner that unfairly bolstered the credibility of the victim. We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to review of his claim of evidentiary impropriety.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Before Lothstein took the stand, defense counsel objected to any testimony by Lothstein regarding \u201csexual assault syndrome.\u201d Defense counsel noted that the characteristics of sexual assault syndrome are consistent with the fact that sexual abuse has occurred. Defense counsel thus claimed that any opinion testimony regarding whether the victim had suffered from sexual assault syndrome would embrace an ultimate issue to be decided by the jury,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> namely, whether the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim. The trial court stated that it would \u201callow the testimony,\u201d concluding that \u201ccourts generally allow the admissibility of expert testimony regarding certain types of conduct or syndromes that are beyond the competence of the average person to fully understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Lothstein then proceeded to testify generally regarding the behavioral characteristics of child victims of sexual assault.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Subsequently, the assistant state\u2019s attorney asked Lothstein whether an individual with a psychological assessment similar to that of the victim likely would delay reporting sexual abuse. Lothstein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>answered by reference to specific allegations made by the victim about her family life. Defense counsel did not object either to the form of the questions or to Lothstein\u2019s answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that Lothstein improperly expressed an expert opinion that was based upon the specific characteristics of the victim and that Lothstein improperly assumed the truth of the victim\u2019s allegations regarding her family life. According to the defendant, this claim properly was preserved by virtue of defense counsel\u2019s objection at trial. The state contends that the claim that the defendant raises on appeal is different from the claim that defense counsel made at trial in objecting to Lothstein\u2019s testimony and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claim was not properly preserved. We agree with the state that defense counsel\u2019s objection at trial did not preserve the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u201cThe standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling. . . . Once counsel states the authority and ground of [the] objection, any appeal will be limited to the ground asserted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daley </em>v. <em>McClintock, </em>267 Conn. 399, 404-405, 838 A.2d 972 (2004); see Practice Book \u00a7 5-5.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cThese requirements are not simply formalities. They serve to alert the trial court to potential error while there is still time for the court to act. . . . Assigning error to a court\u2019s evidentiary rulings on the basis of objections never raised at trial unfairly subjects the court and the opposing party to trial by ambush.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>249 Conn. 423, 428, 735 A.2d 778 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">At trial, defense counsel objected to Lothstein\u2019s proffered testimony regarding sexual assault syndrome in general on the ground that such testimony would embrace an ultimate issue to be decided by the jury. On appeal, however, the defendant does not challenge the validity of such testimony generally; rather, he claims that Lothstein improperly based some of his opinion testimony on the specific characteristics of the victim and, in addition, that he improperly assumed the truth of the victim\u2019s allegations about her family life. Defense counsel did not object to Lothstein\u2019s testimony on these grounds. Although a defendant is entitled to review of unpreserved errors of <em>constitutional </em>magnitude under <em>Golding, </em>the defendant makes no claim that the admission of the testimony that he challenges <em>on appeal </em>rises to the level of a constitutional violation. Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to review of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the victim\u2019s mother, M, to testify, during cross-examination by the state, that she believed that the defendant had sexually abused the victim. The state maintains that defense counsel \u201copened the door to this line of inquiry\u201d by eliciting testimony from other witnesses regarding M\u2019s disbelief of the victim\u2019s allegations. The state further contends that the defendant has not demonstrated that the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>sion of M\u2019s testimony, even if improper, was harmful. We agree both with the state\u2019s primary contention that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the challenged testimony and with the state\u2019s alternative contention that, even if the admission of the testimony were improper, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the testimony was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The following additional facts inform our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Defense counsel introduced evidence suggesting that M did not believe the victim\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse. Defense counsel introduced this evidence through his cross-examination of Komblum<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and through his direct examination of Gloria Rodriguez,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s wife at the time of trial. Defense counsel later called M as a witness but did not ask her if she believed the victim\u2019s allegations. On cross-examination, the assistant state\u2019s attorney asked M if she believed, at the time of her testimony, that the defendant had sexually abused the victim. Defense counsel objected, and the assistant state\u2019s attorney responded that defense counsel had \u201copened the door\u201d to the question. The trial court allowed M to answer the question, and M responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Other evidence adduced at trial indicated that M had physically abused the victim and the victim\u2019s half sisters while they were in M\u2019s care. Specifically, the victim testified that M had hit her with her hands, a broom and a belt, and that the beatings had occurred \u201c[a]lmost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>every day.\u201d The victim\u2019s half sister also testified that M had hit her and the victim. Furthermore, at the time of her testimony, M was facing criminal prosecution for risk of injury to a child and witness tampering. Both charges related to the alleged sexual abuse of the victim\u2019s half sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u201c[Determinations of credibility are for the jury, and not for witnesses. . . . Therefore, it is improper to ask a witness to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">. . . [(Questions that ask a defendant to comment on another witness\u2019 veracity invade the province of the jury. . . . Moreover, [a]s a general rule, [such] questions have no probative value and are improper and argumentative because they do nothing to assist the jury in assessing witness credibility in its fact-finding mission and in determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440,454, 832 A.2d 626 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The state concedes that, if defense counsel had not adduced testimony indicating that M disbelieved the victim\u2019s allegations, it would have been improper for the assistant state\u2019s attorney to ask M whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>believed that the defendant had sexually abused the victim. The state claims, however, that because defense counsel injected the issue into the case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the challenged testimony. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Generally, \u201c[t]he party who initiates discussion on [an] issue is said to have opened the door to rebuttal by the opposing party. Even though the rebuttal evidence would ordinarily be inadmissible on other grounds, the [trial] court may, in its discretion, allow it whe[n] the party initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 186-87, 864 A.2d 666 (2004). Because defense counsel had adduced evidence regarding M\u2019s disbelief of the victim\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse, the trial court reasonably permitted the state to rebut that evidence through the testimony of M.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant contends that he did not open the door to M\u2019s testimony because he introduced evidence of M\u2019s disbelief of the victim\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse through the testimony of Kornblum and Rodriguez and not through any testimony of M herself.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>trary to the defendant\u2019s claim, there is no reason to limit the right of a party to place in context testimony adduced by an opposing party and, consequently, appellate courts have not done so. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ankerman, </em>81 Conn. App. 503, 515-16, 840 A.2d 1182 (defendant opened door to certain witness\u2019 testimony elicited by state when defendant had cross-examined victim on same matter), cert. denied, 270 Conn. 901, 853 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 944, 125 S. Ct. 372, 160 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>53 Conn. App. 406, 413-14, 731 A.2d 758 (by introducing evidence through his own direct testimony, defendant opened door to examination of witness on same subject), cert. denied, 249 Conn. 925, 733 A.2d 849 (1999). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to rebut the evidence adduced by defense counsel regarding M\u2019s disbelief of the victim\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Even if the admission of the challenged testimony was improper, the defendant has not demonstrated that the impropriety was harmful. The jurors had ample opportunity to assess for themselves the credibility of all the witnesses, including the victim and M, and the court repeatedly instructed the jurors that they alone were to determine the credibility of the witnesses. Moreover, it is highly improbable that the jury placed much weight on the challenged testimony of M because the evidence established that M had expressed differing opinions, over time, about whether the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>sexually abused the victim. In addition, both the victim and her half sister testified that M frequently had abused them physically. Finally, the jury was aware that M was facing criminal charges, at the time of the trial, relating to the care of one of her children. Because M\u2019s credibility was questionable, her testimony regarding her belief that the defendant had sexually abused the victim was unlikely to have had any material effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In this opinion SULLIVAN, C.

The credibility of this analysis and the weight to be given this testimony is for you, the jury, to decide.

The defendant maintains that this admission so undermined the half sister\u2019s credibility that her testimony must be discounted entirely. We disagree. Although the jury would have been entitled to discredit the half sister\u2019s testimony in light of her acknowledgment of her prior false accusation, the jury also was free to credit her version of the events. Indeed, to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that the jury credited the half sister\u2019s testimony, it is likely that it did so not because of the constancy of accusation evidence adduced by the assistant state\u2019s attorney in violation of <em>Troupe, </em>but because of her demeanor on the stand and the fact that her account of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u2014 which was subject to extensive cross-examination by defense counsel\u2014 was consistent in all material respects with the victim\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> In support of his claim that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the admission of the challenged testimony mandated a new trial, the defendant emphasizes that Herweith testified to certain statements of the victim containing certain facts about which the victim had not testified. Only a small portion of Herwerth\u2019s testimony, however, contained facts about which the victim herself did not testify. Most significantly, though, those additional facts were neither so graphic nor so inflammatory as to sway the jury in favor of conviction, especially in light of the explicit and detailed testimony of the victim and her half sister, both of whom witnessed the sexual abuse firsthand. The testimony to which the defendant refers consisted of Herwerth\u2019s description of an occurrence during which the victim\u2019s mother \u201calmost caught\u201d the defendant and the victim and that, in response, the victim had lied to her mother and told her that she \u201cwas going to the bathroom.\u201d The defendant also refers to Herwerth\u2019s testimony that the victim related to her a situation whereby the victim had told her mother that \u201cher bottom hurt,\u201d and her mother gave her medicine. In light of the exceedingly graphic firsthand accounts of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the victim, we do not see how these few additional\u2014and essentially innocuous\u2014facts were likely to have had <em>any </em>effect on the jury, let alone an effect so significant and prejudicial as to cast serious doubt on the fairness of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> We disagree with the assertion of the dissent that, \u201cbecause of the professional qualifications of [Kornblum and Herwerth], the jury might reasonably have inferred that neither witness would have repeated such graphic allegations of sexual abuse unless she believed them to be true.\u201d We see no reason why any juror would have drawn an inference, one way or the other, regarding any personal belief that either Kornblum or Herwerth may have harbored concerning the victim\u2019s truthfulness. Neither Kornblum nor Herwerth was asked her personal opinion of the victim\u2019s veracity, and neither one expressed such a view. Each witness merely was asked to repeat what she had been told by the victim, and each witness did so. Indeed, the fact that Kornblum and Herwerth recited details of the victim\u2019s statements when asked to do so is no more suggestive of their personal beliefs in the victim\u2019s veracity than if they had recited only those portions of what the victim had told them that were admissible under <em>Troupe. </em>We therefore reject as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>unfounded the assertion that the improper constancy of accusation testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth likely harmed the defendant because that testimony somehow conveyed to the jury that Kornblum and Herwerth personally believed that the victim\u2019s statements were true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> The defendant also claims that his right to a fair trial under the state constitution was violated.

Even if we assume, arguendo, that M\u2019s testimony was particularly probative, in such circumstances, it would have been unfair to bar the state from seeking to rebut the testimony elicited by defense counsel indicating that M did not believe the victim\u2019s allegations. Thus, to the extent that M\u2019s testimony was damaging to the defendant because it was especially probative, that testimony also was especially important in light of the evidence presented by defense counsel regarding M\u2019s disbelief of the victim\u2019s allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\"> The defendant also claims that, because defense counsel only elicited testimony regarding whether M believed the victim\u2019s allegations <em>when they were made, </em>he did not open the door to testimony about whether M believed the victim\u2019s allegations <em>at the time of trial. </em>This claim lacks merit.

I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the state\u2019s use of constancy of accusation testimony, although beyond the scope of <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996), constituted harmful impropriety warranting reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. After a careful review of the evidence, I am persuaded that, in the present case, the iteration of the graphic details of the sexual assaults on the victim, as well as the additional details not testified to by the victim or her half sister, who had witnessed some of the sexual assaults, may have had a tendency to influence the jury by improperly bolstering the credibility of the victim and her half sister and by unfairly arousing in the jury feelings of antipathy toward the defendant. Accordingly, I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment that reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction and ordered a new trial.

Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>267 Conn. 686, 708-709, 841 A.2d 1144 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Prior to addressing the substance of the testimony in question, I believe that it is important to take note of the credentials of the two witnesses whose testimony was improperly admitted. The testimony at issue came from two highly qualified individuals who had substantial professional skill and experience in dealing with cases of alleged child molestation, thereby giving their testimony greater weight in the eyes of the jury. Rita Kornblum, an intake worker for the department of children and families (department) at the time of the investigation of the alleged incidents in this case, had worked for the department for over three and one-half years and for the New Jersey equivalent of the department for more than eight years. She testified that she had experience in social work, investigatory practices, and counseling services, and had received special training in handling cases of child molestation. Similarly, Kimberly Herwerth, a sexual assault crisis counselor, was a state certified child crisis counselor for more than ten years, and had worked at both the Northeastern Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services and Saint Francis Hospital Children\u2019s Center in that capacity. She testified that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>at the time she interviewed the victim, her counseling focused on \u201cchildren who were in crisis, who had made allegations of sexual abuse,\u201d and she had worked with more than 900 alleged victims of molestation. It is important to evaluate the significance of the testimony of these witnesses in light of their experience and expertise. I find it reasonable to presume that because of the professional qualifications of these witnesses, the jury might reasonably have inferred that neither witness would have repeated such graphic allegations of sexual abuse unless she believed them to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">1 turn next to the substance of the testimony in question. Following the testimony of the victim and her half sister, both Kornblum and Herwerth reiterated horribly graphic details of the sexual assaults as related to them by the victim. In my view, the harmfulness of the testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> derives from their repetition of the most lurid details of the sexual abuse of the victim: the defendant\u2019s multiple penetrations of the victim\u2019s vagina and anus with his penis and the defendant\u2019s multiple ejaculations resulting from his abuse of the seven year old victim. The witnesses testified that the victim had told them that the defendant, \u201con several occasions,\u201d had \u201cinserted his penis . . . into her private parts\u201d or had \u201cput his private in her private . . . .\u201d Moreover, Kornblum testified that the victim \u201cdescribed some white stuff coming out of [the defendant\u2019s] . . . \u2018penis.\u2019 \u201d Herwerth testified that the victim had told her that \u201cslimy white stuff would come out into his hand. He would throw it into the toilet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Herwerth\u2019s testimony highlighted the victim\u2019s emotional state due to the fact that the abuse had been witnessed by her half sister. Herwerth testified that the victim had told her that \u201cher [half sister] had witnessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>[the sexual assaults] . . . and it would make her throw up.\u201d Herwerth\u2019s testimony also repeated the fact of the defendant\u2019s threat to the victim. She testified that the defendant had warned the victim \u201cnot to tell because her mother would hit her if she did tell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In addition, Herwerth related an incident of abuse not mentioned by either the victim or her half sister in their testimony. This additional incident revealed the victim\u2019s anxiety that her mother might discover the abuse. Herwerth testified that the victim had mentioned an incident in which the victim\u2019s mother \u201calmost caught\u201d the defendant sexually assaulting the victim when \u201con one occasion in particular the slimy white stuff went into her [vagina]. [The victim] got up, went to the bathroom to clean herself with toilet paper. [The victim] said . . . that her mother almost caught them, but that when her mother came to the bathroom [the victim] was a little nervous ... [so she told her mother she] was going to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In my view, the testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth unfairly influenced the jury in exactly the manner we intended to avoid as we explained in <em>Troupe. </em>In <em>Troupe, </em>we reasoned that \u201ctestimony by multiple witnesses about the facts of the victim\u2019s complaint may so <em>unfairly bolster the victim\u2019s credibility </em>that, in such cases, cross-examination of the victim is not a sufficient protection from prejudice.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 303. We stated therefore that in such circumstances there is an \u201cenhanced risk that the jury may be <em>unduly swayed </em>by the repeated iteration of the constancy of accusation testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Thus, we concluded that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>I cannot conclude that in the present case this graphic testimony from two trained professionals repeating the details of multiple sexual assaults on a seven year old girl did not \u201cunfairly bolster the victim\u2019s credibility\u201d and therefore \u201cunduly [sway]\u201d the jury. Id., 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Moreover, my conclusion that the improperly admitted testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth may have unfairly influenced the jury is reinforced by the fact that: (1) the defendant raised serious questions about the credibility of both the victim and her half sister; and (2) without the testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth, the state\u2019s case was not particularly strong. The defendant undermined the credibility of both the victim and her half sister by: (1) eliciting testimony from the victim revealing a possible motive to lie; and (2) revealing prior lies told by the victim\u2019s half sister. During cross-examination of the victim, she admitted that her mother had physically abused her and her half sister. In particular, the victim testified that her mother would hit her and her half sister with her hand, a broom or a belt on her head, thighs, face, arms, back and legs, almost daily. Thus, defense counsel elicited evidence regarding a possible motive for the victim to fabricate the allegations of sexual abuse, namely, a desire to be removed from the home. Furthermore, during cross-examination, the victim\u2019s half sister, the state\u2019s only eyewitness to the abuse, admitted to falsifying an allegation of sexual assault against her mother\u2019s boyfriend in 1998. The victim\u2019s half sister admitted that she had fabricated the sexual assault allegation only because her mother\u2019s boyfriend had been \u201cgetting into [her] business\u201d and \u201csnitching\u201d on her to her mother. The jury might well have given additional weight to the testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth in light of these questions about the credibility of the victim and her half sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Additionally, I believe that without the testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth, the state\u2019s case was not particularly strong, and the defendant\u2019s conviction therefore may have resulted from the jury\u2019s increased reliance on their testimony. First, there was no physical evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, such as DNA, semen or blood analysis pointing to the defendant as the perpetrator of the alleged sexual assaults. Additionally, the medical evidence admitted on the issue of whether the victim had been sexually assaulted was ambiguous at best. On cross-examination, although Frederick B. Berrien, the physician who examined the victim, maintained that the inflammation he found in the victim\u2019s vagina was due to an infection that he believed was indicative of sexual contact, he also acknowledged that \u201cany sort of trauma could [have caused the inflammation].\u201d Berrien also testified that, at the time of the victim\u2019s examination, she did not exhibit any lacerations to the labia or her hymen, nor did she have any labial adhesions. He also acknowledged that he could not state, with any reasonable medical certainty, what type of object had penetrated the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, Berrien testified that, due to research that had been performed in the years subsequent to his examination of the victim, his findings regarding the victim \u201cwould not necessarily indicate that the full penetration . . . necessarily is confirmed by . . . the findings that were present . . . during the examination.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Thus, I am persuaded that in the present case, the testimony of Kornblum and Herwerth, two experienced professionals, concerning the graphic details of the assaults on the victim, as well as the additional details not testified to by the victim or her half sister, may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury by improperly bolstering the credibility of the victim and her half sister and by unfairly arousing feelings of antipathy in the jury. I therefore agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was entitled to a new trial and I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination to reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> Because I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment that reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction, I do not address the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> See part I of the majority opinion for the relevant excerpts of the testimony of both Kornblum and Herwerth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> Berrien also could not identify with any reasonable degree of medical certainly the person who had penetrated the victim.
