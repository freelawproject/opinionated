We conclude that \u00a7 17a-101g (c) does not require the commissioner to remove the child upon a finding of probable cause, but merely authorizes the commissioner to seek removal under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The minor plaintiffs, Teresa T. and Zazsheen P., brought this action in the United States District Court for the district of Connecticut claiming that the commissioner and certain employees of the department of children and families (department)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had violated their constitutional rights by failing to protect them from their abusive stepfather by removing them from their home. The District Court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process claims on the ground that the Connecticut child protection statutes, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-90 et seq., do not \u201ccreate a constitutionally enforceable right to child protective services subject to due process protection.\u201d <em>Sealed v. Sealed, </em>332 F.3d 51, 53 (2d Cir. 2003). The plaintiffs subsequently obtained permission from both the District Court and the Court of Appeals to pursue an interlocutory appeal from the District Court\u2019s order dismissing that portion of their complaint. Id., 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The record certified by the Second Circuit provides the following facts. \u201c[The family of the minor plaintiffs] was first brought to the attention of the [department] in October 1996 when a teacher at Teresa\u2019s school reported signs of possible abuse, including marks on Teresa\u2019s neck and troubling weight loss. After an initial inquiry, a [department] investigation worker confirmed that Teresa\u2014who was twelve years old at the time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>autistic, and non-verbal\u2014was in need of immediate [department] services given the unexplained bruises on her neck and her noticeable weight loss. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations . . . during the three-month period between October 1996 and January 1997 when the [department] closed its case on the plaintiffs\u2019 family, [the] defendants failed to conduct an adequate investigation into the initial reports of abuse and ignored multiple signs of obvious neglect and abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\u201cThe social-worker trainee assigned as the family\u2019s [department] caseworker visited [the] plaintiffs\u2019 home several times and spoke with [the] plaintiffs\u2019 mother, Ms. G. The caseworker learned that the plaintiffs\u2019 stepfather, Joseph P., lived with them occasionally, but [the] plaintiffs\u2019 mother refused to answer any additional questions about the stepfather. After some difficulty, the caseworker managed to meet Joseph P., but he was loud, belligerent, and disruptive during the conversation, making it increasingly difficult for the caseworker to communicate freely with [the] plaintiffs\u2019 mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\u201cTeresa\u2019s teacher also informed the caseworker that she was worried about Teresa\u2019s weight, especially Teresa\u2019s significant weight loss over Thanksgiving break. In addition, the teacher indicated that Teresa had been observed eating frantically and explained that the school had been feeding Teresa double portions of both breakfast and dinner. The teacher further expressed concern that Teresa was losing her hair and that she would come to school with body odor and unclean clothes. Finally, Teresa\u2019s teacher informed the caseworker that the school was concerned about Joseph P. being in the plaintiffs\u2019 home, because he had asked the school bus driver for money on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\u201cDuring the investigation, the caseworker also learned that the [department of [m]entai [r]etardation had been working with the plaintiffs\u2019 family for over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>year and that the plaintiffs\u2019 mother had been noncooperative. Moreover, after Ms. G was evaluated for substance abuse, the drug counselor reported that Ms. G was vexy angry during the interview and recommended further testing and psychological evaluation. The counselor also privately informed the caseworker that he had a \u2018hot\u2019 case on his hands and that she was afraid that Ms. G had other problems besides potential drag abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\u201cIn December 1996, Teresa received a full medical examination at the Hill Health Center (\u2018HHC\u2019) in New Haven. The HHC doctor indicated that Teresa was in \u2018good physical condition\u2019 and that he had \u2018no concerns regarding her health or weight loss.\u2019 However, the [department] caseworker apparently did not credit the doctor\u2019s assessment and asked that Teresa be examined by another physician\u2014an examination which never occurred. In January 1997, the [department] caseworker arranged to have respite care provided to [the] plaintiffs\u2019 family through the Benhaven agency in coordination with the [department of [m]ental [r]etardation. Before those sexvices began, the coordinator of Benhaven, T. Lowe (\u2018Lowe\u2019), visited the plaintiffs\u2019 home with the [department] caseworker. Lowe obsexved a sparsely furnished apartment, with almost no light, filled with a peculiar odor. She informed the [department] caseworker that her agency could not provide the plaintiffs\u2019 family with the intensive services which the family obviously needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\u201cDespite this warning, respite sexvices began, but were soon terminated after the sexvice provider assigned to the plaintiffs\u2019 family reported to Lowe that Joseph P. had called her at home, \u2018street talked\u2019 her, and requested sexual favors. The service provider also informed Lowe that [the] plaintiffs\u2019 home smelled of urine, was unclean and unsafe, and was othexwise inappropriate for children. The Benhaven agency subsequently cancelled respite services. Lowe again infoxmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>the [department] caseworker that the plaintiffs\u2019 family required more intensive services. Inexplicably, the caseworker responded by informing Lowe that he had closed the [department] file on the plaintiffs\u2019 family.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\u201cOn January 26, 1997, [the] plaintiffs\u2019 eight month old sister, Shedina P. (\u2018Shedina\u2019), was brought to the emergency room with severe head trauma and several rib fractures which the emergency room doctor found to be consistent with child abuse. As a result of her injuries, Shedina died three days later. Only at this time did the [department] place a [ninety-six] hour hold on [the] plaintiffs due to the agency\u2019s assessment that the plaintiffs were at risk of imminent harm. [The] [plaintiffs were eventually placed in foster care. Later, in February 1997, [the] plaintiffs\u2019 mother revealed to the [department] caseworker that Joseph P. had abused [the] plaintiffs and Shedina on numerous occasions and that [the] plaintiffs witnessed the beating which ultimately led to Shedina\u2019s death. Ms. G indicated that she had been too afraid to report the abuse earlier and that Joseph P. \u2018coached\u2019 her on how to . . . answer the caseworker\u2019s questions to avoid detection.\u201d Id., 53-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In its decision concerning the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal, the Court of Appeals explained that \u201cin analyzing [the] plaintiffs\u2019 [procedural due process] claims we must first understand the underlying Connecticut child welfare statutes and then determine whether those statutes create a protected property or liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\u201cIn evaluating whether a state has created a protected interest in the administrative context, we must determine whether the state statute or regulation at issue meaningfully channels official discretion by mandating a defined administrative outcome. . . . Where the administrative scheme does not require a certain outcome, but merely <em>authorizes </em>particular actions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>remedies, the scheme does not create entitlements that receive constitutional protection under the [fourteenth [ajmendment [to the United States constitution].\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Court of Appeals identified only one provision in the Connecticut statutory scheme, namely, \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c), that might require the department to take specific substantive action and thus create a protected liberty or property interest under the fourteenth amendment. See id., 57. The court, however, found the language of that provision, particularly the phrase \u201c \u2018shall authorize,\u2019 somewhat ambiguous.\u201d Id. The court stated that this ambiguity presented \u201csignificant difficulties ... in analyzing [the] plaintiffs\u2019 [procedural] due process claims. Without a clear understanding of the underlying state law, we cannot determine in an informed manner whether [the] plaintiffs have a legitimate entitlement to emergency removal potentially triggering [fourteenth [a]mendment protection.\u201d Id., 58. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals certified the following questions of law to this court to clarify the scope of the statute: \u201c(1) If the [commissioner] had probable cause to believe that the plaintiffs were in imminent risk of physical harm and that immediate removal was necessary to ensure the plaintiffs\u2019 safety, was the [c]ommissioner then <em>required </em>to cause [the] plaintiffs\u2019 removal pursuant to ... \u00a7 17a-101g (c), or would the existence of probable cause only <em>authorize </em>the [commissioner to seek emergency removal based on his or her discretionary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\u201c(2) Additionally, had the [c]ommissioner authorized removal of [the] plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101g (c), would the designated [department] employee or law enforcement officer have been statutorily required, or merely authorized, to remove [the] plaintiffs from their home?\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 59-60. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>also stated: \u201c[T]he certified questions may be deemed expanded to cover any further pertinent question of Connecticut law that the Supreme Court finds appropriate to answer in connection with this appeal.\u201d Id., 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Issues of statutory construction present questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review. See <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>269 Conn. 802, 809, 850 A.2d 114 (2004). When construing a statute, we first look to its text, as directed by Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154), which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also seek interpretive guidance from the legislative history of the statute and the circumstances surrounding its enactment, the legislative policy it was designed to implement, the statute\u2019s relationship to existing legislation and common-law principles governing the same general subject matter. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>270 Conn. 198, 205, 853 A.2d 434 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the language of \u00a7 17a-101g (c) is clear and unambiguous and that the statute requires the commissioner to seek emergency removal of a child from unsafe surroundings upon a finding of probable cause. The plaintiffs maintain that the word \u201cshall\u201d ordinarily is construed as mandatory and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>because the word \u201cshall\u201d in this case relates to the essence of the statute itself, it necessarily imposes a mandatory duty on the commissioner. They also assert that the department policy manual, which represents the views of agency officials charged with implementing the statute, interprets \u00a7 17a-101g (c) to require removal by way of a ninety-six hour hold if the commissioner believes that there is imminent risk of physical harm to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The state responds that the word \u201cshall\u201d is not always construed as mandatory and that the commissioner does not have a mandatory duty under \u00a7 17a-101g (c) to remove a child upon a finding of probable cause. The state contends that the statute, when read in its entirety, demonstrates the discretionary nature of the commissioner\u2019s authority regarding such decisions. The state also contends that the Court of Appeals has not limited this court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 17a-101g (c) to the phrase \u201cshall authorize,\u201d but seeks an interpretation of the statute in light of the broader statutory scheme pertaining to child protection. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Section 17a-101g (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the Commissioner of Children and Families, or his designee,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has probable cause to believe that the child or any other child in the household is in imminent risk of physical harm from his surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety, the commissioner, or his designee, <em>shall authorize </em>any employee of the department or any law enforcement officer to remove the child and any other child similarly situated from such surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ings without the consent of the child\u2019s parent or guardian. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We conclude that the language of the statute is not plain and unambiguous because it does not expressly require the commissioner to remove a child from unsafe surroundings upon a finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, although we \u201chave often stated [that] [definitive words, such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10, 20, 848 A.2d 418 (2004); we also have noted that the \u201cuse of the word shall, though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 623, 755 A.2d 180 (2004). Furthermore, a requirement stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words, as in the present case, generally is not viewed as mandatory. See <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 278, 492 A.2d 180 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Finally, although the word \u201cauthorize\u201d has been construed in certain contexts as having a mandatory effect; see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); the common understanding of the term as expressed in the law and in dictionaries is \u201c[t]o endow with authority or effective legal power\u201d; id.; which does not imply a mandatory duty. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 224, 796 A.2d 502 (2002) (\u201c[w]here a statute does not define a term it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). As a result, it is not entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>clear whether the phrase \u201cshall authorize\u201d was intended by the legislature to mandate that the commissioner remove a child from unsafe surroundings under a ninety-six hour hold. \u201c[T]his court cannot, by judicial construction, read into legislation provisions that clearly are not contained therein.\u201d <em>Stitzer </em>v. <em>Rinaldi\u2019s Restaurant, </em>211 Conn. 116, 119, 557 A.2d 1256 (1989). We therefore must look to other statutory language within the broader statutory scheme and extratextuai evidence to determine the statute\u2019s meaning. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 205, 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Employing the ordinary tools of statutory construction, we conclude that the commissioner is not statutorily required to remove a child in imminent risk of physical harm pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101g (c). The discretionary nature of the commissioner\u2019s authority is suggested initially by the opening words of the statute, \u201c[i]f the [commissioner . . . has probable cause to believe . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (c). This language indicates that the commissioner has discretion to make the required finding of probable cause on the basis of his or her own judgment and conscience. See <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Edward J. Peters, Jr., P.C., </em>252 Conn. 623, 628, 749 A.2d 630 (2000) (\u201c[t]he hallmark of a discretionary act is that it requires the exercise of judgment\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra (\u201c[w]hen applied to public functionaries, discretion means a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially in certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The fact that a probable cause determination is discretionary, however, does not necessarily mean that the action to follow is discretionary. See <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Castle Rock, </em>366 F.3d 1093, 1103-1106 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (police officer exercises judgment and discretion in making probable cause determination that restraining order was violated, but is required under</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>statute to arrest or seek warrant for arrest of offending party if probable cause exists). \u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. . . . If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>supra, 269 Conn. 19. \u201cIf, however, the . . . provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>229 Conn. 618, 626 n.9, 642 A.2d 1186 (1994). Under these principles of statutory construction, we conclude that the phrase \u201cshall authorize\u201d is directory and that the statute affords the commissioner discretion in the choice of an appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Section 17a-101g (c) can be understood properly only in the context of the statute as a whole. Section 17a-101g sets forth the procedures that guide the department in responding to reports of abuse. These include procedures for the immediate classification and evaluation of reported abuse; the commencement of an investigation, if warranted; the referral of certain cases to appropriate local law enforcement authorities; the removal of a child from unsafe surroundings upon a finding of probable cause; and the care and return of a child who has been removed pursuant to subsection (c). Viewed collectively, we conclude that these provisions are designed to provide order, system and dispatch in the department\u2019s response to reports of abuse. See <em>Concept Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 626 n.9. The absence of a penalty if the commissioner fails to invoke the ninety-six hour hold after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>making a finding of probable cause further suggests that \u00a7 17a-101g (c) does not impose a mandatory duty. See <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 278. Consequently, the statute should not be read to require the commissioner to remove a child under a ninety-six hour hold if probable cause exists, but to require the commissioner to follow certain procedures, including the authorization of a department employee or law enforcement officer to proceed with removal if the commissioner chooses to invoke a ninety-six hour hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Our construction of \u00a7 17a-101g (c) as directory rather than mandatory is consistent with the discretion afforded the commissioner in subsections (a) and (d) of the statute. Subsection (a) grants the commissioner discretion to determine whether a report of abuse contains sufficient information to require an investigation and, if sufficient information exists, whether the investigation should commence within two or seventy-two hours.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsection (d) of the statute confers additional discretion on the commissioner with respect to return of the child. Section 17a-101g (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe removal of a child . . . shall not exceed ninety-six hours. ... If the child is not returned home within such ninety-six hour period, with or without protective services, the department shall proceed in accordance with section 46b-129.\u201d The commissioner therefore must decide, first, whether to return the child within ninety-six hours or to petition the court for an order of temporary custody, and, second, if he elects to return the child, whether to do so with or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>protective orders. \u201cIt is an accepted principle of statutory construction that, if possible, the component parts of a statute should be construed harmoniously in order to render an overall reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>202 Conn. 106,115, 520 A.2d 162 (1987). For the statute to grant the commissioner discretion with respect to investigating a report of abuse and returning a child who has been removed, but not with respect to removing a child, is logically inconsistent and does not comport with the principle that different parts of a statute should be construed harmoniously. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">It also is well established that we are required \u201cto read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction. ... In applying these principles, we are mindful that the legislature is presumed to have intended a just and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Secretary of the Office of Policy &amp; Management </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>267 Conn. 255, 278, 837 A.2d 770 (2004) <em>(Zarella, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (a) provides the commissioner with an alternative remedy for \u201cimmediate removal\u201d of an abused or neglected child, namely, the filing of a petition with the Superior Court for an order of temporary custody. Section 46b-129 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf it appears . . . that there is reasonable cause to believe that (1) the child or youth is suffering from serious physical illness or serious physical injury or is in immediate physical danger from the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s surroundings, and (2) that as a result of said conditions, the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s safety is endangered and immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s safety, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>court shall either (A) issue an order to the parents or other person having responsibility for the care of the child or youth to appear at such time as the court may designate to determine whether the court should vest in some suitable agency or person the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s temporary care and custody pending disposition of the petition, or (B) issue an order ex parte vesting in some suitable agency or person the child\u2019s or youth\u2019s temporary care and custody. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The remedies provided in \u00a7\u00a7 46b-129 (b) and 17a-lOlg (c) are available only upon a finding that there is probable cause<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to believe that the child is in unsafe surroundings<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that immediate removal is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>to protect the child from harm. If, however, we were to determine that a finding of probable cause requires a ninety-six horn hold under \u00a7 17a-101g (c), instead of leaving the choice of a remedy to the commissioner\u2019s discretion, the commissioner would not have the option of petitioning the court for a hearing or for an ex parte order under \u00a7 46b-129 (b) until after a ninety-six hour hold had been invoked. Significantly, there is no language suggesting that \u00a7 46b-129 applies solely to children who are in the commissioner\u2019s custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101g (c). Accordingly, the only logical construction of the statutory scheme is to view the finding of probable cause as a threshold determination that permits the commissioner to choose among these and other available remedies to ensure the child\u2019s safety.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 17a-101g (c) avoids the unwise result of requiring the commissioner to seek a ninety-six hour hold in situations where immediate removal is necessary but sufficient time exists to file a petition for an order of temporary custody with the court. See <em>State </em>v. Sandoval, 263 Conn. 524, 553, 821 A.2d 247 (2003) (\u201cwe interpret statutes to avoid bizarre or nonsensical results\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Tenenbaum </em>v. Williams, 193 F.3d 581, 596 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201cit is unconstitutional for state officials to effect a child\u2019s removal on an emergency basis where there is reasonable time safely to obtain judicial authorization consistent with the child\u2019s safety\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). This construction of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>also protects children from the unnecessary disruption that will result if a ninety-six hour hold is imposed in cases where the commissioner\u2019s principal objective is an order of temporary custody, but the court subsequently determines that such an order is unwarranted. To ensure a coherent construction of the statutory scheme; see <em>Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management v. Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 278; we therefore conclude that \u00a7 17a-101g (c) is directory rather than mandatory and does not require the commissioner to invoke a ninety-six hour hold, but grants the commissioner discretion to choose the most appropriate remedy in any given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We further conclude that, even if the commissioner determines that probable cause exists and that removal is necessary pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101g (c), the authorized employee or law enforcement officer is not statutorily required to remove the child. Section 17a-101-13 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies describes the procedures that apply when the commissioner authorizes removal under a ninety-six hour hold. \u201cAdministrative rules and regulations are given the force and effect of law.\u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. v. Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 154, 285 A.2d 352 (1971). \u201cWe therefore construe agency regulations in accordance with accepted rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>211 Conn. 51, 60, 557 A.2d 1249 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Subsection (b) of the regulation is entitled \u201c[procedures prior to removal\u201d and provides in relevant part that, \u201c[p]rior to the immediate removal of a child the authorized . . . employee shall (1) investigate the situation and evaluate it . . . (2) determine if the child or family is listed in the Child Abuse and Neglect Registry . . . [and] (3) obtain [the commissioner\u2019s] approval . . . .\u201d See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-101-13 (b). Thereafter, subsection (c) of the regulation, entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201c[procedures upon removal,\u201d provides in relevant part that, \u201c[i]f the [commissioner] or his designee authorizes the employee to remove the child . . . <em>and the employee determines that immediate removal is </em>required,\u201d the employee shall notify the parent or guardian, cooperate with and accompany the designated law enforcement officer authorized to remove the child and place the child with another caretaker. (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-101-13 (c). Subsection (c) of the regulation thus contemplates a second discretionary determination, to be made by the authorized employee, that the conditions justifying the commissioner\u2019s original decision to remove the child remain unchanged and that removal should proceed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The clear implication is that the commissioner\u2019s original decision may be revoked if conditions improve in the child\u2019s surroundings in the hours following the commissioner\u2019s approval but before the scheduled removal. That conditions may improve, even in a very brief time, is specifically recognized in subsection (d) of the statute, which grants the commissioner discretion to return a child after ninety-six hours, with or without protective services. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>lOlg (d). Consequently, a review of department regulations and policies supports our conclusion that \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c) does not impose a mandatory duty on the commissioner or the authorized employee or law enforcement officer to cause removal of a child under a ninety-six hour hold if the commissioner believes that probable cause exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Removal of a child from the family is such a drastic step that it makes sense for the commissioner or the authorized employee to retain discretion with respect to the child\u2019s removal. The department policy manual advises that \u201cimmediate removal of a child [by way of a ninety-six hour hold] shall be initiated <em>only </em>as a last resort when Superior Court intervention is not possible\u201d and that \u201call less drastic procedures for intervention to secure the safety of the child shall be explored before considering immediate removal . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Department of Children and Families, Policy Manual, Vol. II, \u00a7 34-10-4, p. 2. Alternatives to removal that may accomplish the same objective include placing the child with a relative or in a temporary shelter, taking the child to a medical facility, removing the abusive parent or guardian from the child\u2019s home, obtaining a temporary restraining order to prevent the offender from having contact with the child and allowing a responsible adult into the home to protect the child. Id., \u00a7 34-10-2, p. 1. Indeed, a less draconian response may be advisable at the time of removal because the level of \u201cdanger\u201d or \u201crisk\u201d to the child, which the department policy manual describes as the first factor to be considered when contemplating removal; id., \u00a7 34-10-3, p. 2 and \u00a7 34-10-4, p. 1; may change quickly depending on the type of risk to which the child is exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">To illustrate, the department policy manual sets forth the following criteria for determining whether a child is in an unsafe environment: (1) abandonment or inadequate supervision; (2) a dangerous, inadequate or sexu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ally assaultive parent or guardian; and (3) a parent or guardian who refuses to remove the child from dangerous physical surroundings. Id., \u00a7 34-10-4, pp. 3-4. If a probable cause determination is based on information that a family member sexually assaulted the child and the authorized employee subsequently learns that the perpetrator no longer has access to the home, the employee may conclude that removal is no longer required.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Court of Appeals observed that the statutory provisions concerning child protection \u201cinvest significant discretion in the [department] to determine both whether an investigation is warranted and what remedial action, if any, to pursue based on the results of the investigation.\u201d <em>Sealed </em>v. Sealed, supra, 332 F.3d 57. Remedial actions are guided by relevant public policy considerations. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (a) describes Connecticut\u2019s child protection policy as follows: \u201cThe public policy of this state is: To protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injury and neglect; to strengthen the family and to make the home safe for children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care; to provide a temporary or permanent nurturing and safe environment for children when necessary; and for these purposes to require the reporting of suspected child abuse, investigation of such reports by a social agency, and provision of services, where needed, to such child and family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The statement of public policy in \u00a7 17a-101 thus establishes that an important goal of the child protection statutes, in addition to protecting children from abuse and neglect, is to preserve family integrity by allowing children to remain with their parents and by teaching parents the skills they need to nurture and care for their children. In situations involving unstable families, maximum flexibility is required on the part of department officials and employees investigating reports of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>abuse to ensure that the competing policy considerations of child protection and family integrity are properly balanced when devising a response in each particular case. Indeed, few other decisions require the weighing and balancing of so many complicated factors as removal of a child from the home. To construe \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c) as permitting the commissioner to exercise discretion when responding to a report of abuse is therefore consistent with the public policy of our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The plaintiffs cite <em>Comptroller v. Nelson, </em>345 Md. 706, 694 A.2d 468 (1997), and <em>Gun South, Inc. v. Brady, </em>711 F. Sup. 1054, 1063 (N.D. Ala.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 877 F.2d 858 (11th Cir. 1989), to support their claim that the meaning of the phrase \u201cshall authorize\u201d is plain and unambiguous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These cases provide us with no meaningful guidance because the present issue must be decided in the context of Connecticut\u2019s child protection scheme and neither case arose in Connecticut or involved child welfare statutes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The plaintiffs also argue that \u00a7 17a-101g (c) mandates removal upon a finding of probable cause because the department policy manual states that \u201cexamples of physical harm which <em>require </em>removal of the child are serious physical illness, serious physical injury [and] dangerous surroundings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Department of Children and Families Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 34-10-4, p. 2. \u201c[I]t is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d <em>Webster Bank </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>265 Conn. 539, 561, 830 A.2d 139 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 903, 124 S. Ct. 1603, 158 L. Ed. 2d 244 (2004). We do not agree, however, that the legislature intended the language of the statute to be read so narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">A policy manual provision that is inconsistent with a state statute or regulation regarding the same subject matter shall not govern interpretation of that statute or regulation. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>204 Conn. 672,680-81, 529 A.2d 188 (1987). In the present case, the plaintiffs overlook the department regulation providing for the authorized employee to make a determination following the commissioner\u2019s approval that immediate removal of the child is necessary. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-101-13 (c). Accordingly, the use of the word \u201crequire\u201d in \u00a7 34-10-4 of the department policy manual, insofar as it is construed to mandate immediate removal of the child, is inconsistent with the department regulations and does not govern our interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>We likewise disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, once the commissioner has determined that probable cause exists, removal becomes a ministerial act. A ministerial act is \u201cperformed in a prescribed manner without the exercise of judgment or discretion as to the propriety of the action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>Edward J. Peters, Jr. ,P.C., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 628. As previously noted, the department regulations provide for the authorized employee to make a determination that conditions in the child\u2019s surroundings continue to warrant the child\u2019s removal. Consequently, removal of the child pursuant to the statute is not a ministerial act on the part of the authorized employee or law enforcement officer. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17a-101-13 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The plaintiffs further argue that the legislative history of \u00a7 17a-101g (c) demonstrates the legislature\u2019s desire to strengthen the child protection scheme. They contend that comments made during the legislative debate indicate the legislature\u2019s intent, that children at serious risk of abuse or neglect promptly be removed from their homes. The plaintiffs assert that the legislature clarified this intent in 1996 when it repealed General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-101 (e) and recodified the removal provision at \u00a7 17a-101g (c); see Public Acts 1996, No. 96-246, \u00a7 9; because the phrase \u201cmay authorize\u201d was changed to \u201cshall authorize\u201d and one of the conditions warranting immediate removal was changed from \u201cimmediate physical danger\u201d to \u201cimminent risk of physical harm.\u201d The plaintiffs thus argue that the legislative debate and the changes in the statutory language evince a legislative intent to impose a mandatory duty on the commissioner. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">There was no discussion during the legislative debate regarding proposed changes to the language of \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c) because the changes were included in a highly publicized bill concerning the termination of parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>rights and were not a focus of the debate. See Public Acts 1996, No. 96-246, \u00a7 9; 39 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1996 Sess., pp. 4969-5058; S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1996 Sess., pp. 1925-46. Moreover, legislators who spoke of the need to protect children at risk of harm also spoke of the need to provide parents with the skills required to keep their families intact. In just one example, Representative Ellen Scalettar observed: \u201cThere have been many cases of child abuse that have received high publicity in the last year and it has brought our attention to the problem of child abuse and how to protect children who are at risk of abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\u201cIn working on the bill . . . we also realized that it\u2019s very important to balance our interest in protecting those children with the interest of parents to raise their children and to be free from unwarranted government intrusion. And it is the effort to draw that line properly that has . . . led to the draft that is before us.\u201d 39 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 4979-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Furthermore, under the rules of statutory construction, although we recognize that \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); the change in the statutory language from \u201cmay authorize\u201d to \u201cshall authorize\u201d does not necessarily reflect the legislature\u2019s intent to mandate removal because, depending on the context, the word \u201cshall\u201d has been construed as directory; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 623; and the word \u201cmay\u201d has been construed as mandatory. See <em>Capobinco </em>v. <em>Samorack, </em>102 Conn. 310, 313, 128 A. 648 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We consider the change in language from \u201cimmediate physical danger\u201d to \u201cimminent risk of physical harm\u201d equally insignificant. See footnote 9 of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 33a-8<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides for an order of temporary custody, and not for a ninety-six hour hold, in life threatening medical situations. Thus, to construe \u201cimminent risk of physical harm\u201d as a more urgent threat than \u201cimmediate physical danger,\u201d and as requiring a ninety-six hour hold on the theory that a ninety-six hour hold is the most efficient response, would be inconsistent with \u00a7 33a-8 of the Practice Book. Finally, \u00a7 17a-101g (a) grants the department thirty calendar days within receipt of a report of abuse to complete an investigation, even in urgent cases. Consequently, the reference in \u00a7 17a-101g (c) to \u201cimminent risk of physical harm\u201d should not be read to require a ninety-six hour hold because we cannot presume that emergency removal of the child by way of a temporary custody order is any less efficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The plaintiffs also rely on the principles articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>245 Conn. 209, 223, 715 A.2d 680 (1998), appeal after remand, 260 Conn. 93, 794 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 902, 123 S. Ct. 224, 154 L. Ed. 2d 175 (2002), in which this court sustained the conviction of the mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend for risk of injury to a child and first degree assault on the ground that he had knowledge that the mother had abused the child. In <em>Miranda, </em>we stated that, as a matter of common law, \u201c[i]n addition to biological and adoptive parents and legal guardians, there may be other adults who establish familial relationships with and assume responsibility for the care of a child, thereby creating a legal duty to protect that child from harm.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 222-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>23. The plaintiffs thus suggest, on the basis of <em>Miranda, </em>that a state official specifically charged with protecting children from known abuse and neglect may have a common-law duty to invoke a ninety-six hour hold when a child is in imminent risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We recognize that extratextual sources, including common-law principles governing the same subject matter, may guide this court in determining the meaning of a statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 205. The certified questions, however, do not ask us to determine whether the commissioner has a statutory or common-law duty to protect a child from reported abuse or neglect, but, rather, whether the commissioner or an authorized employee or law enforcement officer are required to remove a child from unsafe surroundings by way of a ninety-six horn hold upon a finding of probable cause. The question concerning the commissioner\u2019s duty to remove a child from unsafe surroundings is far narrower in scope than the question in <em>Miranda </em>concerning an adult\u2019s legal duty to protect a child from harm. Consequently, the common-law principles discussed in <em>Miranda </em>do not inform our resolution of the two certified questions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c) does not mandate a defined administrative outcome when the commissioner has probable cause to believe that a child is in imminent risk of physical harm and that immediate removal is necessary. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>contrary, the Connecticut child protection statutes and corresponding regulations and policies provide the commissioner and his authorized employees with numerous options to protect a child, including removal under a ninety-six hour hold; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-lOlg (c); filing a petition with the court for a hearing or an ex parte order of temporary custody; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b); obtaining a temporary</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">restraining order to prevent the offender from having access to the child; Department of Children and Families, Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 34-10-2, p. 1; or arranging for a responsible adult to enter the home to ensure the child\u2019s safety. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Accordingly, the answer to the first certified question is: No. Section 17a-101g (c) did not require the commissioner to cause the plaintiffs\u2019 removal upon a finding of probable cause, but merely authorized the commissioner to seek emergency removal based on his or her discretionary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The answer to the second certified question likewise is: No. Even if the commissioner had authorized removal of the plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101g (c), the designated department employee or law enforcement officer was not statutorily required, but was merely authorized, to remove the plaintiffs from their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">No costs shall be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199b, the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, provides in relevant part: \u201c(d) The Supreme Court may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States ... if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute of this state. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Practice Book, 2004, \u00a7 82-1 provides: \u201cThe supreme court may answer questions of law certified to it by the supreme court of the United States, a court of appeals of the United States or a United States district court when requested by the certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before it questions of law of this state which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the supreme court of this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (c) provides: \u201cIf the Commissioner of Children and Families, or his designee, has probable cause to believe that the child or any other child in the household is in imminent risk of physical harm from his surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety, the commissioner, or his designee, shall authorize any employee of the department or any law enforcement officer to remove the child and any other child similarly situated from such surroundings without the consent of the child\u2019s parent or guardian.

See also <em>Tenenbaum </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 594 (2d Cir. 1999) (Using words \u201cimminent\u201d and \u201cimmediate\u201d interchangeably in stating that \u201c[w]hile there is a sufficient emergency to warrant officials\u2019 talcing [a child into] custody without a prior hearing if [he or she] is <em>immediately </em>threatened with harm . . . the converse is also true. If the danger to the child is not so imminent that there is reasonably sufficient time to seek prior judicial authorization, <em>ex parte </em>or otherwise, for the child\u2019s removal, then the circumstances are not emergent; there is no reason to excuse the absence of the judiciary\u2019s participation in depriving the parents of the care, custody and management of their child.\u201d [Citation omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Furthermore, if the legislature had intended to distinguish between \u00a7 46b-129 (b) and \u00a7 17a-101g (c) on the basis of the urgency of the threat to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>child, it presumably would have used different language in each of those statutes to describe the necessity for removal. Instead, both statutes use identical language in providing that, as part of the probable cause determination, it must be found that \u201cimmediate removal ... is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-101g (c) and 46b-129 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> For example, the commissioner may choose to seek a temporary restraining order to prevent the offender from having contact with the child. See Department of Children and Families, Policy Manual, Vol. n, \u00a7 34-10-2,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\"> We note that \u00a7 17a-101-13 (c) of the regulations, which became effective April 25, 1984, and has not been amended substantively since that date, contains language that is inconsistent with the statute as presently written, in that the regulation provides that the commissioner \u201cmay authorize\u201d any department employee or law enforcement officer to remove a child when the prescribed conditions are met, whereas the present version of the statute provides that the commissioner \u201cshall authorize\u201d any department employee or law enforcement officer to remove a child when the prescribed conditions are met. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (c). This inconsistency is very likely due to the fact that the statute, prior to its amendment in 1996; see Public Acts 1996, No. 96-246, \u00a7 9; provided that the commissioner \u201cmay authorize\u201d the child\u2019s removal and the regulation was never modified to reflect that the phrase was changed in the amended statute to \u201cshall authorize.\u201d The inconsistency, however, does not affect our interpretation of the regulation insofar as it pertains to the authorized employee\u2019s subsequent determination that conditions continue to warrant immediate removal of the child by means of a ninety-six hour hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b777-6\"> The plaintiffs also cite several cases from other jurisdictions in which courts have found that state social services agencies have a statutory duty to assist abused children. See, e.g., <em>Mammo </em>v. <em>State, </em>138 Ariz. 528, 530-32, 675 P.2d 1347 (Ariz. App. 1983) (agency subject to liability for failure to protect child murdered by boyfriend of custodial spouse following unheeded complaint of abuse because statute specifically described social worker\u2019s duties with regard to protection of threatened children); <em>'Turner </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>532 A.2d 662, 675 (D.C. App. 1987) (agency breach of statutory duty to protect children actionable where social services agency was notified repeatedly of father\u2019s abuse and neglect of children); <em>Sabia </em>v. <em>State, </em>164 Vt. 293, 296-97, 669 A.2d 1187 (1995) (state not immune from suit when state social workers neglected statutory duty to provide assistance to children seeking protection from sexual abuse). The issue in this case, however, is distinguishable because the certified question before this court is limited to whether the commissioner has a mandatory duty under \u00a7 17a-101g (c) to remove a child upon a finding of probable cause. Consequently, the present issue is far narrower in scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\"> In <em>Comptroller </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>supra, 345 Md. 715, the Maryland Supreme Court held that a state agency was not entitled to deny its employees reclassifications based on fiscal difficulties. In examining the applicable statutory provision, the court determined that the phrase \u201cshall authorize\u201d was not ambiguous: \u201cIf the General Assembly appropriates the necessary funds, the Comptroller shall authorize payment of all outstanding awards. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The statutory procedure is couched in mandatory language.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
