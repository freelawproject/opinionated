Ragaglia, individually, and as commissioner of the department, and various department employees (department defendants);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Robert Creutz, a physician, and his employer, William Backus Hospital (William Backus), collectively referred to as the medical defendants. The plaintiffs also brought claims of medical malpractice against the medical defendants. The plaintiffs appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the trial court\u2019s grant of the medical defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing counts two, three and four of the complaint. We conclude that a physician who performs a medical examination of a child at the request of the department to determine whether reasonable cause exists to suspect child abuse is entitled to immunity from liability under \u00a7 17a-101e (b) for claims arising from that determination. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On April 21, 2001, an anonymous caller from the office of the plaintiffs\u2019 pediatrician at the Norwich Pediatric Group contacted the department to report that Kathleen Welch, a speech therapist with the Birth to Three Program, had noticed numerous bruises on both Matthew and Kaylee, and a rash on Matthew while she was conducting a home based therapy session.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, Welch noticed that both children had bruises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>in the same location on their foreheads.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Matthew and Kaylee were two and three years old, respectively, at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">On April 24, 2001 Richard Days, a department social worker, made an unannounced visit to the plaintiffs\u2019 home. Days informed the parents of the reason for the visit, and they consented to his examining the children. He noted that both children were dirty and had bruised foreheads, while Matthew also had extensive bruising on his entire back and a rash on the front and back of his torso. Upon questioning by Days, Manifold explained that he had not taken Matthew to the pediatrician because he thought the rash was from Matthew recently having eaten $50 worth of chocolate. Manifold explained to Days that his son bruised easily, and that he had sustained the bruises while roughhousing with his sister and playing with his new toy trucks and the family dog. Later that day, Days accompanied the plaintiffs to the office of their family pediatrician at the Norwich Pediatric Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Upon their arrival, Days asked whether Richard Geller, the family\u2019s regular pediatrician, could examine the children to determine whether there was reasonable cause to suspect that they had been abused. Geller stated that he was unable to examine the children at that time and that they should not have been brought to his office; he advised Days to take the children to the emergency room at William Backus if an immediate examination was needed. Days then made an appointment with Geller for the following morning, but trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ported the plaintiffs to the William Backus emergency room for a more immediate evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">At William Backus, Creutz examined both children, and ordered an X ray of Matthew. The X ray revealed no fractures, but Creutz stated in the notes of his examination that Matthew had a rash<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and bruises on his head and chest, as well as three large bruises on his back. The report also noted that Matthew had bruises on his legs, knees, thighs and both buttocks. The parents told Creutz that the bruises were the result of roughhousing with the dog and his sister, as well as a fall. Both parents denied causing the injuries, and told Creutz that no one ever had struck Matthew, except for \u201cpats on the bottom.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the basis of the number and size of the bruises, Creutz concluded, however, that the bruises were typical of inflicted, rather than accidental, injuries, and he recommended further investigation of the injuries\u2019 source. He testified at his deposition that he did not order any blood tests to determine whether a blood disorder contributed to the bruising because the physical findings alone raised a sufficiently high suspicion of child abuse to require that it be ruled out, even if the blood test result was positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Creutz explained the results of the examination to Days, who in turn discussed them with other department personnel. Shortly thereafter, Jorge Osorio, a department supervisor, authorized a ninety-six hour hold of the children pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-lOlg (d). The children then were taken into department custody with the assistance of local police, and were placed in a licensed foster home. The department subsequently applied for and obtained orders of temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>custody of the children from the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters, <em>Driscoll, J., </em>on April 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On April 25, 2001, Days met the children and the foster mother at the office of the Norwich Pediatric Group. At that time, Nancy Cusmano, a pediatrician, examined both children. Cusmano ordered blood tests for Matthew, stating that a normal blood test would indicate a high probability of abuse. Upon receiving the results of the test, however, Cusmano informed Days that Matthew\u2019s blood test showed some abnormalities, including a very low blood platelet count that generally causes clotting difficulties. She said that this condition could explain both the bruising and the rash. See also footnote 6 of this opinion. Cusmano referred Matthew to Joseph McNamara, a hematologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital (Yale), for further evaluation. Thereafter, McNamara diagnosed Matthew with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a blood disorder, and admitted him to Yale for treatment. The following day, April 26, 2001, McNamara advised Days that the marks and bruising were consistent with the blood disorder. Matthew subsequently was discharged from Yale. In light of this new information, the court granted the department\u2019s motion to vacate the orders of temporary custody. The department returned the children to the parents\u2019 custody later that same day, and Days relayed the Yale discharge instructions to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The neglect petitions that were filed with the court on April 25, 2001, however, remained active, although the department amended them to remove the initial allegations of physical abuse. The case was transferred to the department\u2019s division of protective services for further monitoring and study. A social study subsequently was filed with the court, and the neglect petitions were withdrawn in October, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In April, 2002, the plaintiffs instituted this action. In count one of the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>numerous acts of malice, negligence and recklessness by the department defendants with respect to the investigation. In count two of the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Creutz committed medical malpractice by failing to order a blood test, which resulted in a misdiagnosis of child abuse rather than a blood disorder. In count three, the plaintiffs made claims against William Backus derivative of Creutz\u2019 alleged malpractice. In count four, the plaintiffs alleged that the conduct of all the defendants, including the medical defendants, constituted negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Subsequently, the medical defendants moved for summary judgment as to all of the counts against them. The trial court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>granted their motion, concluding that Creutz was entitled to immunity from liability pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101e (b) because, as a physician, he was a \u201cmandated reporter\u201d within the scope of that statute. The trial court determined that, as a matter of public policy, Creutz was entitled to the statutory immunity because \u201cwe want to protect doctors and other people who we rely on to protect our children to feel free to participate in this often highly charged and potentially legal minefield-like environment . . . .\u201d The trial court noted that, \u201cwhether or not [the physician] is a \u2018mandated reporter\u2019 making a determination at the outset in this case or not, he is immune as somebody who is part of the evaluative process of detecting and hopefully averting the mistreatment of children.\u201d The court then concluded that William Backus was immune because the claims against it were derivative of those against Creutz, and emphasized that there was no genuine issue of material fact present that would preclude the court from granting a motion for summary judgment in favor of the medical defendants. See Practice Book \u00a7 17-49. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that Creutz was immune from liability under \u00a7 17a-101e (b). They contend that, although Creutz is, as a general matter, a \u201cmandated reporter\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (b), and hence entitled to immunity under \u00a7 17a-101e (b) when making a good faith error in the initial \u201creporting\u201d of suspected child abuse, he was not acting in that capacity when he committed routine medical malpractice by failing to order blood tests that would have detected Matthew\u2019s blood disorder. Put differently, the plaintiffs claim that Creutz\u2019 failure to order the blood test falls outside the scope of the immunity provided by \u00a7 17a-lOle (b) because his actions did not constitute the \u201cfirst person reporting]\u201d of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In response, the medical defendants argue that \u00a7 17a-lOle (b) applies to Creutz because, as a mandated reporter, he was obligated to report his reasonable suspicion of child abuse, regardless of the fact that he had examined the children at the request of the department. The medical defendants also rely on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>240 Conn. 549, 692 A.2d 781 (1997), and contend that the public policy behind the child protection statutes requires the extension of immunity to physicians who act in good faith and perform independent medical examinations at the behest of the department to determine the existence of a reasonable suspicion of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>In the present case, the underlying material facts are undisputed, and \u201cthe case distills to an issue of statutoiy interpretation over which our review is plenary.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Montesano, </em>269 Conn. 787, 792, 849 A.2d 839 (2004). It is well settled that in construing statutes, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 510,857 A.2d 908 (2004). Our well settled principles of statutoiy construction require us to interpret \u00a7 bal\u00f3le (b) as it relates to the other child protection statutes, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 et seq. See, e.g., <em>Halt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 309-10, 819 A.2d 260 (2003). We note that the text of \u00a7 17a-101e (b), both by itself and in relation to other statutes, is silent with respect to the extension of immunity to physicians who perform child abuse evaluations for the department pursuant to the investigation of a report of suspected child abuse. Such silence does not, however, necessarily equate to ambiguity, and we look first to the text of \u00a7 17a-101e (b) and the related provisions to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. See, e.g., <em>Carmel Hollow Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 133, 848 A.2d 451 (2004); see also Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We begin our analysis with a review of the relevant statutory language. Section 17a-101 (a) is an express statement of public policy and legislative intent, and provides that: \u201cThe public policy of this state is: To protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injury and neglect; to strengthen the family and to make the home safe for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care; to provide a temporary or permanent nurturing and safe environment for children when necessary; and for these purposes to require the reporting of suspected child abuse, investigation of such reports by a social agency, and provision of services, where needed, to such child and family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In furtherance of this public policy goal of protecting children from abuse, the statute provides a comprehensive list of persons who are \u201cmandated reporters,\u201d many of whom are health care providers, including physicians either licensed in Connecticut or acting as interns or residents at our hospitals. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (b). Thus, the statute prescribes that a \u201cmandated reporter . . . who in the ordinary course of [his or her] employment or profession has reasonable cause to suspect or believe that any child under the age of eighteen years (1) has been abused or neglected . . . (2) has had nonaccidental physical injury, or injury which is at variance with the history given of such injury, inflicted upon such child, or (3) is placed at imminent risk of serious harm, shall report or cause a report to be made [to the department] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101a. Indeed, \u201cmandated reporters\u201d who fail to report reasonable suspicions of child abuse are subject to a fine and compulsory participation in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>appropriate training program. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101a.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">To encourage and facilitate compliance with the reporting statute, \u00a7 17a-101e provides several protections for persons or institutions who make reports to the department, among which is immunity from civil or criminal liability. Specifically, \u00a7 17a-101e (b) provides: \u201cAny person, institution or agency which, in good faith, makes, or in good faith does not make, the report pursuant to sections 17a-101ato 17a-101d, inclusive, and 17a-103 shall be immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed and shall have the same immunity with respect to any judicial proceeding which results from such report provided such person did not perpetrate or cause such abuse or neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Resolution of the issue on appeal turns, therefore, on whether Creutz was \u201cmaking a report\u201d of suspected child abuse or neglect as contemplated by the child protection statutes, despite the fact that it was a secondary determination of abuse. We conclude that Creutz\u2019 act of describing the result of his examination of the children orally to Days, followed by his provision of a written account of that examination, clearly falls within the common usage of the term \u201creport\u201d; see American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2002);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>construe broadly given the remedial nature of the child protection statutes, \u00a7 17a-101 et seq. <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 244, 258, 754 A.2d 169 (2000) (concluding that termination of parental rights is remedial); accord <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 662-63, 847 A.2d 883 (2004) (noting that \u201ctermination of parental rights proceedings are not designed to punish parents, but to protect children\u201d). Moreover, neither the mandatory reporting statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101a; nor the immunity provision; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101e (b); contain any language that either limits their application to <em>initial </em>reporters of child abuse, or relieves mandated reporters from their obligation to report suspected abuse because the department may already have knowledge of the child\u2019s circumstances. Indeed, the immunity provision applies expressly to <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>person, institution or agency which, in good faith, makes, or in good faith does not make, the report . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101e (b). This is instructive because it is well established that we will not supply an exception or limitation to a statute that the legislature clearly intended to have broad application. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 119, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003); see also <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>267 Conn. 524, 531, 839 A.2d 1250 (2004) (noting that word \u201cany\u201d \u201ccan have a variety of meanings . . . [which] depends upon the context and subject matter of the statute\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, we conclude that a physician who performs a child abuse evaluation at the request of the department is a reporter who is entitled under \u00a7 17a-101e (b) to immunity from liability for claims arising from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>This construction of this statute extending immunity to physicians who are secondary reporters performing child abuse evaluations for the department effectuates the express legislative purpose behind the relevant child protection statutes, namely, \u201cto require the reporting of suspected child abuse, investigation of such reports by a social agency, and provision of services, where needed, to such child and family\u201d in order \u201c[t]o protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injuiy and neglect . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (a). Indeed, <em>in Zamstein v. Marvasti, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 558-64, this court both recognized the importance of the immunity provision to the reporting statutes and the danger of thwarting these public policy goals by placing limitations on that immunity. In <em>Zamstein, </em>the plaintiff parent was falsely accused of and tried on charges of sexual abuse as the result of an interview of his children conducted by the defendant psychiatrist.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 551-52. The plaintiff then brought an action against the defendant claiming, inter alia, negligence in the conduct of the examination and aiding of the prosecution. Id., 552. The plaintiff also alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress. Id. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the complaint. Id., 552-53. On appeal, this court affirmed, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>eluding that as a matter of public policy, a mental health professional performing a sexual abuse evaluation owes no duty of care to the alleged, abuser. Id., 559. The court relied on the mandated reporter statutes, including the immunity provision, as evincing the \u201cstrong public policy of encouraging medical professionals and other persons to report actual and suspected child abuse to the appropriate authorities and agencies.\u201d Id. The court discussed the policy behind the immunity statute and cautioned that \u201cimposing a duty on mental health professionals . . . would carry with it the impermissible risk of discouraging such professionals in the future from performing sexual abuse evaluations of children altogether, out of a fear of liability to the very persons whose conduct they may implicate. Such a result would necessarily run contrary to the state\u2019s policy of encouraging the reporting and investigation of suspected child abuse . . . because effective evaluation and diagnosis of children is a necessary component of discovering the abuse in the first instance.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 560-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Indeed, our construction of \u00a7 17a-101e (b) as extending immunity to secondary reporters of abuse also is consistent with the legislature\u2019s recognition of the important roles of medical professionals in the investigation of child abuse.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For example, under Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 17a-101f,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> physicians examining children \u201cwith respect to whom abuse or neglect is suspected [may] . . . keep such child in the custody of a hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>for [up to] ninety-six hours in order to perform diagnostic tests and procedures necessary to the detection of child abuse or neglect and to provide necessary medical care . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the department is required to \u201cprovide the child [who is in department custody pursuant to a ninety-six hour hold] with all necessary care, including medical care, which may include an examination by a physician or mental health professional .... During the course of a medical examination, a physician may perform diagnostic tests and procedures necessary for the detection of child abuse or neglect. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (d). A construction of \u00a7 17a-lOle (b) that affords immunity to physicians aiding the department in the investigation process encourages medical professionals to help with this highly sensitive task, rather than to avoid a role in this process out of fear of liability when the department arrives at the hospital with a child who potentially has been abused. See <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 560-61; see also <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>267 Conn. 539, 561, 839 A.2d 1259 (2004) <em>(Palmer, J., </em>concurring) (\u201c[t]he legislature provided for such immunity because of the highly sensitive, and necessarily discretionary, nature of the reporting requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The plaintiffs contend, however, that our conclusion will have a deleterious effect because it will create \u201ca loophole for medical malpractice committed against the state\u2019s children\u201d and always give \u201ca physician in a similar circumstance ... a second chance to defeat a malpractice claim.\u201d We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 assessment of this holding\u2019s effect on malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>claims predicated on other misdiagnosis or improper treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The immunity afforded to a physician under \u00a7 17a-lOle (b) is limited to \u201cdamages [that] arise from the physician\u2019s act of reporting and investigating child abuse,\u201d not those that \u201carise from an independent act of medical negligence.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Winny, </em>327 Ill. App. 3d 668, 678, 764 N.E.2d 143 (2002); id. (construing scope of Illinois immunity statute). The statutory immunity extends only to the determination of whether a child has been abused, not to the diagnosis and treatment of any underlying injuries. Put differently, if the department brings a child with a fractured leg to a physician, and asks the physician to: (1) treat the fracture; and (2) determine whether the child has been abused, the physician\u2019s \u00a7 17a-101e (b) immunity would be limited to the abuse determination. See id., 680 (rejecting construction of immunity statute that would immunize physician \u201cfor his negligence in failing to observe a cancerous tumor on a child\u2019s labia simply because the physician was examining the child as part of an investigation of a report of child abuse\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 concerns, the extension of immunity to physicians who participate in the investigation and reporting of child abuse does not give them carte blanche to commit malpractice with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We also note that our conclusion accords with our sister states that have considered this issue. Indeed, <em>Lesley </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Dept. of Social &amp; Health Services, </em>83 Wash. App. 263, 921 P.2d 1066 (1996), review denied, 131 Wash. 2d 1026,939 P.2d 216 (1997), is particularly on point.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>Lesley, </em>day care workers noticed suspicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>marks on the lower back and buttocks of an infant and were unsure whether they were birthmarks or bruises. Id., 266-67. They notified child protective services, whose caseworker called the infant\u2019s pediatrician to determine whether the child had birthmarks. Id., 267. The pediatrician\u2019s office staff advised her to take the infant to the emergency room because the physician was unavailable. Id. The caseworker and local police then took the child into protective custody and brought her to a hospital for evaluation. Id. In the meantime, the infant\u2019s parents informed the police that the infant had normal birthmarks on her back and buttocks, and the police relayed this information to the caseworker. Id. The caseworker did not, however, inform the emergency room physician about what the parents had said about the birthmarks. Id., 267-68. The physician subsequently examined the child and diagnosed the birthmarks as contusions and possible child abuse. Id., 268. He recommended further evaluation by a specialist; the caseworker did not follow up on the suggestion. Id. The child remained in the temporary custody of the department for several days until another physician diagnosed the marks as birthmarks. Id., 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Thereafter, the infant\u2019s parents brought an action against the social worker and the physician alleging, inter alia, negligent investigation and medical malpractice. Id., 266. With respect to the physician, the Washington Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court properly determined that he was entitled to qualified immunity under that state\u2019s mandatory reporting statute. Id., 280. The court rejected the parents\u2019 argument that the physician\u2019s acts did not constitute making a report under the applicable statute, which \u201cprovides immunity to any person participating in good faith in reporting or testifying as to alleged child abuse or neglect in a judicial proceeding.\u201d Id. The court concluded that \u201c \u2018any person\u2019 \u201d encompassed reporters beyond the initial reporter of suspected child abuse; the physician, therefore, was entitled to qualified immunity because there was no evidence in the record that he acted in bad faith. Id., 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In light of our conclusion that \u00a7 17a-101e (b) immunity is applicable to a physician who performs a medical examination of a child at the request of the department to determine whether reasonable cause exists to suspect child abuse, we turn to the facts in the present case. It is clear that Creutz, a mandated reporter under \u00a7 17a-101 (b), examined the children in the \u201cordinary course of [his] employment or profession\u201d at the William Backus emergency room. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101a. He then complied with \u00a7 17a-101awhen he relayed his findings, namely, that there was a reasonable suspicion of child abuse, to the department both orally and via written documentation. Inasmuch as the plaintiffs have not alleged that Creutz acted in bad faith during the examination and reporting process,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>that his actions constituted a report of suspected child abuse protected by \u00a7 17a-101e (b), and, therefore, that the trial court properly granted the medical defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101e (b) provides: \u201cAny person, institution or agency which, in good faith, makes, or in good faith does not make, the report pursuant to sections 17a-101a to 17a-101d, inclusive, and 17a-103 shall be immune from any liability, civil or criminal, which might otherwise be incurred or imposed and shall have the same immunity with respect to any judicial proceeding which results from such report provided such person did not perpetrate or cause such abuse or neglect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\"> The following department employees were named as defendants both in their individual and official capacities: (1) Richard Days, a social worker; (2) Nancy Liebenson-Davis, a social work supervisor; (3) Antonio Donis, a program supervisor; and (4) Daphne Knight, a social worker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> At her deposition, Welch testified that, on Friday, April 20, 2001, she had told the parents that she thought they should take Matthew to his pediatrician as soon as possible because she was worried that the bruising and rash might be signs of an underlying medical problem. She explained to them that she was a mandated reporter of suspected child abuse, and that it was imperative that Matthew be seen by a physician. Welch testified that, although the parents seemed agreeable to her suggestion, she contacted their pediatrician\u2019s office the following morning to follow up on her concerns. Welch testified that she had attempted to contact the parents during the remainder of the weekend, but was unsuccessful. The next time Welch spoke with the pediatrician\u2019s office was Tuesday, April 24, 2001, and the receptionist informed her at that time that the office already had made a report to the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> Welch also reported that Manifold initially had expressed his desire to cancel or postpone the speech therapy appointment, but was dissuaded from doing so because there would be substantial delays in securing another appointment. At Manifold\u2019s deposition, he stated that he realized that his son had the bruises and rash, and that he did not want his son\u2019s appearance to be \u201cmisconstrued\u201d because he had heard some \u201chorror stories\u201d about the department\u2019s actions in similar circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> Creutz testified at his deposition that the rash was actually petichiae, which are skin discolorations that may be caused either by trauma or platelet abnormalities.

During proceedings to dissolve their marriage, the plaintiffs wife accused him of sexually abusing their children; he was then arrested and prosecuted. <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 551. At the same time, the plaintiffs wife brought the children to the defendant for a sexual abuse evaluation. Id. He met with the children and videotaped each session. Id. The plaintiffs complaint alleged that the defendant then provided copies of those videotapes for use in the criminal proceedings; the defendant, however, had deleted exculpatory material from the videotapes prior to providing them to the prosecutor. Id., 551-52. After a three month trial wherein the defendant testified for the state, the plaintiff was acquitted of the sexual abuse charges. Id., 552. The plaintiff \u201calleged that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s prosecution of the plaintiff would not have continued but for the defendant\u2019s provision of the edited videotapes.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\"> The court acknowledged in <em>Zamstein </em>\u201cthat persons falsely charged with sexual abuse of children on the basis of incorrect evaluations may suffer great harm in both their social and personal relationships, and that such accusations have the potential of causing serious damage to a person\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 564. The court, however, nevertheless concluded that the greater social harm would be allowing the sexual abuse of children to go undetected. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\"> We note briefly that the legislative history of the immunity provision, while silent with respect to the precise issue in the present case, does, however, demonstrate the legislature\u2019s awareness of the importance of the medical community\u2019s role in the child abuse investigation and reporting process, and the health care professionals\u2019 reluctance to be involved in the process in the absence of immunity from liability. Section 17a-101e (b) initially was enacted in 1965 as \u00a7 3 of Connecticut\u2019s first mandatory reporting statute, Public Acts 1965, No. 580, and applied only to physicians and surgeons. Moving for passage of the bill that was enacted as Public Act 580, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Senator Gloria Schaffer remarked that mandatory reporting was \u201cvital to both the health and the welfare of the children of our state\u201d because many cases of child abuse were seen, but unreported by physicians. 11 S. Proc., Pt. 5,1965 Sess., p. 1909. Indeed, undisputed testimony before the legislative committees demonstrated that the medical community considered the immunity provision to be vital to the success of the mandatory reporting statute. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary and Governmental Functions, 1965 Sess., p. 350 (testimony of legislative chairman of state medical society describing immunity as \u201cessential\u201d and stating that lack of immunity resulted in physicians\u2019 reluctance to report suspected abuse cases); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Welfare and Humane Institutions, 1965 Sess., p. 89 (testimony of commissioner of mental health stating that mandatory reporting legislation \u201cwould be entirely ineffective, no matter what the legislation and no matter what the penalties unless there is a provision for exemption from any civil or criminal liability\u201d). Further understanding of the impact of liability fears on the medical community was shown in 1997, when the legislature in Public Acts 1997, No. 97-319, \u00a7 12, amended \u00a7 17a-101e (b) to allow immunity for physicians and other reporters who \u201cin good faith, [do] not make,\u201d such reports. Explaining the change, Representative Ellen Scalettar stated that it was meant to add some \u201cbalance\u201d and address the overreporting of child abuse by extending immunity to those who determine in the \u201cexercis[e] [of] their professional judgment\u201d that there has been no abuse. 40 H.R.
