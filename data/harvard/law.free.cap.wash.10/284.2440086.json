The party of the first part agrees to have the machinery hereinbefore mentioned in operation and good working order on or before November fifteenth, 1889, provided no unnecessary delay is caused by unavoidable accidents or strikes or by the railroad carrying the machinery, and providing the party of the first has free and unrestrained access to the rooms and cellars wherein the machinery is to be erected which is hereby agreed to by said party of the second part.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u2018 \u2018 In consideration of the foregoing conditions the parties of the second part agree to well and truly pay or cause to be paid to said parties of the first part, the just and full sum of sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) as follows : Two thous- and dollars when said second parties are notified by said first party that the machinery is ready to be shipped.

Co. per Aebert Waeeber, Vice Prest.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">(Seal).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">This contract was thereafter assumed by the defendant Donau Brewing Company, by whom the cash payments provided for therein were duly made. On May 25, 1890, in pursuance to the contract, the defendant Donau Brewing Company, executed and delivered to appellant its note for $11,000, payable six months after date, which note is still wholly unpaid. On the 20th day of March, 1890, the said Donau Brewing Company executed one hundred and twenty bonds, numbered from 1 to 120, both inclusive, each of the denomination of $500, dated March 20, 1890, and payable to the order of S. Donau ; and at the same time, to secure the payment of such bonds, executed and delivered to the respondent F. M. Wade, president of the National Bank of Commerce, as trustee for the bond-holders, its mortgage on the brewery premises. Upon the maturity of the mortgage, the respondent brought suit to foreclose the same, in which action the appellant Weisel &amp; Vilter Mfg. Co., was joined as party defendant, because it claimed ownership of the machinery described in the agreement above set forth, and the appellant Goetz &amp; Brada Mfg. Co. because it claimed a. lien on the property. The decree of the court was adverse to the claim of the appellants, and they have brought the case here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">The first contention of the appellants is that the agree-</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ment constitutes a conditional sale instead of a chattel mortgage. With the view we take of the other propositions in the case it will not be necessary to pass upon that question, for we are of the opinion that the machinery furnished by the appellant was substantially attached to the realty on which the mortgage was given, and that it became a fixture thereto and lost its chattel characteristic. It seems to us that this question was decided by this court in <em>Cherry v. </em>Arthur, 5 Wash. 787 (32 Pac. 744). There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cIn ascertaining whether such a machine does become part of the realty in favor of mortgagees, the rule is, that the manner, purpose and effect of annexation to the freehold must be regarded. If a building be erected for a definite purpose, or to enhance its value for occupation, whatever is built into it to further those objects, becomes a part of it, even though there be no permanent fastenings such as would cause permanent injury if removed. But mere furniture, although some fastening be necessary to its advantageous use, is removable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">It is true in that case that the machine in question, which was a planer used in a sawmill, was held by the court not to be a fixture because it was held peculiarly subject to be used in one place as well as another; and it is a notorious fact that planers are so used and are for all practical purposes portable. But the machinery in controversy in this case is not of that character. It is described in whole as \u201c one direct expansion refrigerating plant,\u201d and the different parts of the machinery which go to make up this plant are dependent more or less one upon the other, and were furnished to supply the building, which was erected for a definite purpose, and the purpose of this machinery was definite and adapted to the particular building into which it was placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Many of these pieces of machinery are of such character that the court has not sufficient technical knowledge to determine their exact use and relation to the other parts of the machinery, or to the building itself. But the testimony, which we have examined with some care, convinces us that they fall within the rule announced above. The testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of the president of the brewing company, in answer to this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201c Now, \u2022 in making the plans for that building, Mr. Donau, did you have in view the placing of brewery machinery in it and appliances ?\u201d was \u201cthat belongs all to one plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">Question. \u201c Now you may state just how the building was made with reference to any machinery that was placed in it ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">Answer. \u201cThe building was built so that everything went to its place. The machinery is placed where it belongs according to the plans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">Q. \u201cWas the plan made before the machinery was ordered?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">A. \u201cCertainly; it must be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">Q. \u201cAnd were the openings and places where the machinery was to go made before the machinery was received?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">It seems to us that this testimony, which is undisputed, without any question at all brings the case squarely within the rule announced in <em>Cherry v. Arthur, supra. </em>We are perfectly aware that there is a wilderness of authority on this vexed question of when machinery loses its character of chattelism and becomes a fixture to real estate, and thereby a part of the realty; and that there is a lamentable conflict also in the authorities. But we are satisfied to abide by the rule which we have prescribed above, and which was the rule announced in <em>McConnell v. Blood, </em>123 Mass. 47 (25 Am. Rep. 12), and it has been uniformly followed by the Massachusetts courts since that time, and we think by a majority of other courts; so that it would be profitless to undertake to review or harmonize the many authorities which are cited, or which could be cited, on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Concluding, then, that the machinery in question became a part of the realty, we are satisfied that the testimony shows that the same was placed in the building before the execution of the mortgage to respondent, although we do not now pass upon the question of what effect the mortgage would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>have on the machinery, if it were conceded that it was placed there after the mortgage was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">When we say that the machinery was placed there before the mortgage was executed, we mean to say, before the mortgage went into legal effect or before it had a legal existence. There is some conflict in the testimony as to just when the last of the machinery was placed in the building. The major part of it had evidently been placed there prior to the execution of the mortgage, on the 20th day of March, 1890. Some small portion, however, we are satisfied was placed afterwards. But it plainly appears that it was all in place prior to the date of the pledging of the first bonds. And although the respondent Wade was named as trustee of the bond-holders, he was appointed by the mortgagor, and there being no bond-holders in existence prior to the date that the bonds were purchased, there could be no trustee. Consequently, until the bonds were delivered to the bond-holders, the mortgage had no real existence, having nothing on which to act, there being no debt in existence for it to secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The mortgage, then, in reality cannot be considered executed until after the bonds were sold. This being true, and the testimony showing that at that time the machinery had been placed in the building, and the machinery being of a nature which by reason of its being placed there became a part of the realty, the judgment of the lower court was correct, and will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">This also disposes of the claim of appellant, Goetz &amp; Brada Manufacturing Company as the judgment is affirmed as to them also.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Hoyt, Stiles and Scott, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
