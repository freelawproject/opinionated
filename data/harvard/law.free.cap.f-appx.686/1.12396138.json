See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b25-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s August 18, 2016 order be affirmed. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). See Smalls v. United States, 471 F.3d 186, 191 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The Eleventh Circuit vacated the Georgia district court\u2019s adjusted restitution order in appellant\u2019s criminal case because that court had not specified \u201cthe manner in which, and the schedule according to which, the restitution is to be' paid,\u201d as required by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2). See United States v. Dupree, 590 Fed.Appx. 857 (11th Cir. 2014), at 7. The district court\u2019s order dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint in this case held only, as a general matter, that insofar as the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program is used to implement a court\u2019s restitution order, it does not constitute excessive delegation of judicial power to the Bureau of Prisons. See 12/4/13 Order in No, 13-cv-1926. Accordingly, as the district court recognized in the order challenged in this appeal, the prior order dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint was not \u201cbased on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). See 8/18/16 Order in No. 13-cv-1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
