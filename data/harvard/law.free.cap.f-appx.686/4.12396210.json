The district court properly dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254 (providing for Supreme Court review of decisions of circuit courts of appeals), and appellant has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion, see Browder v. Director, Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, 434 U.S. 257, 263 n.7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); Firestone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C.

App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
