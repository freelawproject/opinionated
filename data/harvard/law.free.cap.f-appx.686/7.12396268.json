Upon consideration of the foregoing and the motion for appointment of counsel, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">ORDERED that the motion for appointment of counsel be denied.

The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d in order to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ciralsky v. CIA, 355 F.3d 661, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The dismissal without prejudice allows appellant to file a new complaint that complies with Rule 8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.
