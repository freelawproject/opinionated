See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). Upon consideration of the foregoing and the motion for appointment of counsel, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">ORDERED that the motion for appointment of counsel be denied. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the case be remanded for the district court to determine whether appellant should have been allowed to file the second amended complaint that is attached to his brief and, if so, for further proceedings concerning the complaint. The second amended complaint was stamped \u201creceived\u201d by the clerk of the district and bankruptcy courts on November 24, 2015, but, for reasons unclear, it does not appear on the district court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Pursuant to D.C.

The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R.
