Domenico Garufi (\u201cImpresa\u201d) appeals the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims denying, as untimely filed, its Application for Fees and Other Expenses Under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the decision of untimeliness, and remand to the Court of Federal Claims for determination of the merits of the EAJA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">In 1999 Impresa filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, protesting a contract award by the Department of the Navy. The court denied the protest. <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>44 Fed.Cl. 540 (1999). On appeal the Federal Circuit reversed, <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324 (Fed.Cir.2001), and on remand the Court of Federal Claims granted the protest. However, the court denied Impresa\u2019s claim for bid preparation and proposal costs on the ground that Impresa had not provided sufficient evidentiary support for these costs. <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Do-menico Garufi v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 175 (2004). Impresa filed an appeal to the Federal Circuit on August 26, 2004, but on December 27, 2004 Impresa filed a motion to withdraw the appeal and issue final judgment in favor of the government. There was no opposition. This court granted the motion, issued final judgment on March 11, 2005, and on the same day issued the mandate. <em>Impresa Construz-ioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 310 (Fed.Cir.2005) (non-precedential).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">On July 5, 2005 Impresa filed in the Court of Federal Claims an EAJA Application for Fees and Other Expenses relating to Impresa\u2019s successful bid protest. On July 8, 2005 the court rejected the EAJA application as premature, in the court\u2019s \u201cmistaken belief that a final judgment had not yet issued.\u201d <em>Impresa Con-struzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>73 Fed.Cl. 718, 719 (2006). Impresa\u2019s attempts at clarification were rejected on the same mistaken belief. On April 4, 2006 Impresa filed a motion to resubmit the EAJA application; the Court of Federal Claims then recognized its er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>ror and ruled that the EAJA application was deemed filed on its actual filing date of July 5, 2005. However, the court also held that the July 5, 2005 filing was untimely because it occurred more than thirty days after the final judgment of this court on March 11, 2005. Although Impresa argued that the Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment had not become \u201cfinal and not appealable,\u201d the words of the EAJA, until expiration of the 90-day period for filing an appeal to the Supreme Court by petition for certiorari, the Court of Federal Claims held that the EAJA petition was due within thirty days after the March 11, 2005 judgment date. This appeal is from that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">In accordance with the EAJA, a party that prevails against the United States in a civil action may recover attorney fees and expenses if certain criteria are met. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. The EAJA requires submission of the application \u201cwithin thirty days of final judgment in the action,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B), and by amendment enacted in 1985 defines \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as \u201ca judgment that is final and not appealable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(G). A judgment is \u201cnot appealable\u201d in EAJA terms after the time for filing an appeal has elapsed. The question of finality for EAJA purposes received attention from the Supreme Court in <em>Melkonyan v. Sullivan, </em>501 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991), where the Court ruled that the filing period under the EAJA starts to accrue only after the time to appeal has expired for all parties. <em>Melkonyan </em>did not address the circumstance of a final judgment entered on voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The Court of Federal Claims held that since Impresa had voluntarily requested dismissal of its appeal to the Federal Circuit, that judgment was final and not ap-pealable as of its issue date. The Federal Rules are silent as to whether a final judgment entered on an unopposed motion for dismissal is amenable to appeal, but most of the circuits have answered the question in the affirmative. As summarized by the First Circuit in <em>John\u2019s Insulation v. L. Addison &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 101 (1st Cir.1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-9\">It is no longer the rule that voluntary dismissals are unappealable; to the contrary, most circuits hold that voluntary dismissals, and especially those with prejudice, are appealable final orders. <em>See generally 15A Federal Practice and Procedure </em>3914.8 at 614-16 (citing cases); <em>cf. Soto v. Flores, </em>103 F.3d 1056, 1059 n. 1 (1st Cir.1997) (noting without discussion that Plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed her complaint in order to have a final judgment from which she could appeal).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The regional circuits have generally applied the principle that for EAJA purposes a consent judgment of dismissal is subject to the same appeal accrual rules as other judgments. The court in <em>Hoa Hong Van v. Barnhart, </em>483 F.3d 600 (9th Cir.2007) stated that for EAJA filing purposes a uniform rule should be based on the statutory period to file an appeal, whether or not an appeal is likely to be filed in the particular case. In <em>Hoa Hong Van </em>the United States had consented to judgment favoring the petitioner in the district court, and no appeal was taken by either side; the government argued that the 30-day EAJA clock began on entry of the district court\u2019s judgment, because generally neither party can appeal a consent judgment. The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument, stating that <em>Melkonyan </em>rendered it inappropriate to foster a threshold EAJA debate as to whether a particular judgment is appealable \u201cregardless of the specific form of the court\u2019s judgment, or the partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>ular nature of the government\u2019s non-opposition to or acquiescence in an award of benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. The court cited the EAJA legislative history as favoring \u201csuch a uniform approach\u201d where \u201clitigants will have clear guidance on what is expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting H.R.Rep. No. 99-120 at 7 (1985), <em>reprinted in </em>1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. 132, 135).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">The District of Columbia Circuit also has ruled that a single rule should apply in calculating the EAJA time periods, whatever the state of appealability of the judgment. In <em>Adams v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, </em>287 F.3d 183 (D.C.Cir.2002) the court recognized divergences among the circuits and explained its preference for a uniform rule whereby the time for filing an EAJA request would run from the expiration of the time for appeal, without consideration of whether the particular final judgment would have or could have been appealed. Reasoning from the case law and legislative history concerning the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(G), the <em>Adams </em>court concluded that the clarity and judicial economy of a uniform rule, applied in the administrative context as in the courts, \u201celiminates the high potential for confusion from determining \u2018appealability\u2019 on a case-by-case basis and avoids practical problems ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191. The Third Circuit in <em>Scafar Contracting, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>325 F.3d 422 (3d Cir.2003), applied the D.C. Circuit\u2019s reasoning and held that a uniform rule should apply, stating that a stricter interpretation would \u201cbreathe life into the hypothetical problems and concerns earlier expressed by this Court and others over the proper interpretation of \u00a7 2412\u2019s \u2018final judgment\u2019 in the context of \u00a7 504. We decline to adopt the [stricter] interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">In distinction, the Fifth and Tenth Circuits have adopted what they call a \u201cfunctional approach\u201d to determining the time for filing an EAJA petition, generally requiring the case by case exploration of whether an appeal could have been taken by either party. This approach was applied in <em>Briseno v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 377 (5th Cir.2002) to a voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2), on joint motion to dismiss without prejudice. The court stated that such dismissals are \u201cordinarily\u201d not appealable, described this case as of first impression, and held that \u201c[n]ormally, the thirty-day period would start once the time to file an appeal has passed____ In this case, however, [appellant] did not have the option to appeal\u201d because the appellant had voluntarily dismissed under Rule 41(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 379. The court held that the EAJA application could not benefit from the time to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">In <em>Bryan v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>165 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.1999), the parties had filed a joint motion for voluntary dismissal by the district court under Rule 41(a)(2) so that the plaintiff could obtain further consideration at the administrative level; the circuit court held that the 30-day EAJA clock began running from the grant of the voluntary motion for dismissal. However, the Tenth Circuit noted that \u201c[e]xceptions to this rule exist, but are inapplicable to Mrs. Bryan\u2019s situation. For instance, movant may appeal an order granting voluntary dismissal where the dismissal is with prejudice, <em>see, e.g., Chappelle v. Beacon Communications Corp., </em>84 F.3d 652, 653 (2d Cir.1996); where the dismissal disposed of fewer than all of plaintiff\u2019s claims, <em>see, e.g., Chappelle, </em>84 F.3d at 653; or where the court imposes terms as a condition of permitting dismissal, <em>see, e.g., LeCompte v. Mr. Chip, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 601, 603-04 (5th Cir.1976).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321 n. 7, citing <em>Chappelle, </em>84 F.3d at 653 (allowing appeal from a voluntary dismissal when the \u201csolicitation of the formal dismissal was designed only to expe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>dite review of a prior order which in effect dismissed [plaintiffs] complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The variety of possible situations leads us to conclude that the better procedure is to avoid preliminary litigation of time periods for EAJA filings when there has been a voluntary dismissal, at least where the order of dismissal does not specifically prohibit appeal. We generally agree with the circuits that have taken this path, as in <em>Hoa Hong Van, </em>483 F.3d at 610; <em>Adams, </em>287 F.3d at 191; and <em>Scafar, </em>325 F.3d at 429. The Court in <em>Melkonyan </em>explained the legislative policy of removing obstacles that had arisen to the filing of EAJA applications. <em>See </em>501 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. 2157 (citing S.Rep. No. 98-586, at 16 (1984)). The circuits that have preserved \u201cfunctional\u201d exceptions to the inquiry have recognized that such exceptions are narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">When the path of appeal would be to the Supreme Court by certiorari petition, the government argues that because it is highly unlikely that the Court would grant a petition for a case where the appeal in the circuit court had been dismissed without prosecution, the time limit for filing a cer-tiorari petition should not apply to EAJA filings. The Court of Federal Claims observed that such a petition if filed should not be granted, for it would have the effect of bypassing intermediate appellate review. However, the question is not whether the Supreme Court might ever grant a petition in these circumstances; the question is whether Impresa was entitled to count the 90-day period for filing a petition in calculating when the Federal Circuit judgment became final and unappeala-ble. In <em>Latham v. United States, </em>527 F.3d 651, 653 (7th Cir.2008) the court held, applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that a judgment entered upon a voluntary dismissal of an appeal from a conviction does not become \u201cfinal\u201d until expiration of the time for filing a petition for certiorari. That time runs from the date of the decision. <em>See S.Ct. Rule 13.3. </em>Further, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254 permits Supreme Court review where a court of appeals has not yet issued final judgment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1254(1) (authorizing Court review \u201cbefore or after rendition of judgment.\u201d). There is no blanket prohibition on the filing of a petition for certiorari after voluntary dismissal in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The imposition of case by case determination of the time for filing an EAJA petition when a judgment arises from voluntary dismissal, as urged by the government, would contravene the purpose of the 1985 amendments to \u201cgive both courts and litigants clear guidance on what is expected and avoid the unnecessary confusion which accompanied this issue in the past.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-120, at 7 (1985), <em>reprinted in </em>1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 135. The House Report stressed that the time for filing an EAJA fee application should not be \u201ca trap for the unwary resulting in the unwarranted denial of fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18 n. 26, 1985 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 146. <em>See Myers v. Sullivan, </em>916 F.2d 659, 669 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cAcknowledging that the thirty-day filing requirement was not designed to serve \u2018as a trap for the unwary,\u2019 this court has recognized that the filing requirement, although jurisdictional, should be interpreted broadly and that overtechnical constructions of the requirement should be avoided.\u201d) (citations omitted). <em>Cf. Scarborough v. Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 414, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (\u201cthe provision\u2019s 30-day deadline [of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B)] for fee applications and its application-content specifications are not properly typed \u2018jurisdictional\u2019.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The issue before us is not whether the Court might grant certiorari if Impresa had filed such a petition; the issue is whether the 30-day EAJA period will start and end during the 90 days available for Impresa to request certiorari. Precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>weighs against creating a special category for voluntary dismissals in cases originating in the Court of Federal Claims, whereby it would be necessary to determine whether a petition for certiorari can be filed or might be granted, in order to calculate the period for filing an application under the EAJA. Taking cognizance of rulings of the Court and the regional circuits, we conclude that a clear rule better serves the interests of litigants and the courts, rather than encouraging, as here, satellite litigation on \u201cfunctional\u201d premises, adding cost and delay while not yet reaching the merits. We adopt a uniform rule for EAJA petitions in the Court of Federal Claims, whereby appeal rights from voluntary dismissals are presumed unless expressly disclaimed or specifically prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Applying this rule, Impresa\u2019s period for filing its EAJA fee application started on expiration of the period for filing a petition for certiorari from the final judgment of the Federal Circuit. The decision that Impresa\u2019s EAJA application was untimely is reversed. We remand to the Court of Federal Claims for determination of the merits of Impresa\u2019s EAJA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-10\">. <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom.

Our court issued the mandate\u2014by all measures a final judgment because it covered the entire case and all issues. The grant of the voluntary dismissal ended this litigation with a judgment that is \u201cfinal and not appealable.\u201d <em>See Melkonyan v. Sullivan, </em>501 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 2157, 115 L.Ed.2d 78 (1991). After all, Impresa cannot appeal the grant of its own motion. None of the exceptions to this rule in <em>Briseno v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 377 (5th Cir.2002), or <em>Bryan v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>165 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.1999), apply to this voluntary dismissal which neither party could appeal. Therefore, Impresa cannot now revive a corpse it buried with its own motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
