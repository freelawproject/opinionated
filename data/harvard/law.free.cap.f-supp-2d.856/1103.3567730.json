KOH, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1147-24\">Before the Court are Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>Amended Complaint (\u201cJoint Mot\u201d), ECF No. 79, and Defendant Lucasfilm Ltd.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (\u201cLucasfilm Mot.\u201d), ECF No. 83. The Court held a hearing on the motions on January 26, 2012. Having considered the parties\u2019 submissions, arguments, and the relevant law, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, and DENIES Lucasfilm\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">This is a consolidated class action brought by employees alleging antitrust claims against their employers, all of whom are high-tech companies with a principal place of business in the San Francisco-Silicon Valley area of California. Plaintiffs challenge an alleged conspiracy among Defendants to fix and suppress employee compensation and to restrict employee mobility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">The Court recites the factual allegations as pled in the Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cCAC\u201d), ECF No. 65, and as indicated in judicially noticed documents. The Court then recounts the procedural background.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">Unless otherwise noted, the following allegations are taken from the CAC and presumed to be true for purposes of ruling on Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. <em>See Marder v. Lopez, </em>450 F.3d 445, 447 n. 1 (9th Cir.2006). The Court also takes judicial notice of documents from a related Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) investigation and civil lawsuit that are referenced in the CAC or attached as exhibits to the Declaration of Christina J. Brown (\u201cBrown Deck\u201d), ECF No. 79-1, and the Declaration of Dean M. Harvey (\u201cHarvey Deck\u201d), ECF No. 93. A court \u201cmay take notice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.\u201d <em>United States ex </em>rel. <em>Robinson Rancher\u00eda Citizens Council v. Borneo, Inc., </em>971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir.1992). A court may also take judicial notice of the existence of matters of public record, such as a prior order or decision, but not the truth of the facts cited therein. <em>See Lee v. City of L.A., </em>250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir.2001). The Court may consider documents referenced in, but not attached to a complaint without converting a motion to dismiss into one seeking summary judgment. <em>See Swartz v. KPMG LLP, </em>476 F.3d 756, 763 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">1. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">Defendants include the following high-tech companies with principal places of business located in the following cities in California: Adobe Systems Inc. (\u201cAdobe\u201d), San Jose; Apple Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d), Cupertino; Google Inc. (\u201cGoogle\u201d), Mountain View; Intel Corp. (\u201cIntel\u201d), Santa Clara; Intuit Inc. (\u201cIntuit\u201d), Santa Clara; Lucasfilm Ltd. (\u201cLucasfilm\u201d), San Francisco; and Pixar, Emeryville. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 16-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-12\">Plaintiffs Michael Devine, Mark Fichtner, Siddharth Hariharan, Brandon Marshall, and Daniel Stover (collectively \u201cNamed Plaintiffs\u201d), all worked as software engineers for some of the Defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-27. Mr. Devine worked for Adobe in the State of Washington from October 2006, through July 7, 2008. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 16. Mr. Fichtner worked for Intel in Arizona from May 2008 through May 2011. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 17. Mr. Hariharan worked for Lucasfilm in California from January 8, 2007, through August 15, 2008. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 18. Mr. Marshall worked for Adobe in California from July 2006 through December 2006. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 19. Finally, Mr. Stover worked for Intuit in California from July 2006 through December 2010. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>Named Plaintiffs purport to represent the following nationwide class of similarly situated individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-5\">All natural persons employed by Defendants in the United States on a salaried basis during the period from January 1, 2005 through January 1, 2010 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Excluded from the Class are: retail employees; corporate officers, members of the boards of directors, and senior executives of Defendants who entered into the illicit agreements alleged herein; and any and all judges and justices, and chambers\u2019 staff, assigned to hear or adjudicate any aspect of this litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">2. DOJ Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Many of the factual allegations in the CAC come directly from two civil complaints filed by the DOJ in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the \u201cD.C. District Court\u201d). <em>See </em>Joint Mot. 5-6. Plaintiffs reference these documents in the CAC, and both Defendants and Plaintiffs have attached documents from the DOJ lawsuit to their briefing. <em>See </em>Harvey Decl. Exs. A-B; Brown Decl. Exs. A-F.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">From 2009 through 2010, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ conducted an investigation into Defendants\u2019 employment and recruitment practices. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 111. After receiving documents produced by Defendants and interviewing witnesses, the DOJ concluded that Defendants reached \u201cfacially anticompetitive\u201d agreements that \u201celiminated a significant form of competition ... to the detriment of the affected employees who were likely deprived of competitively important information and access to better job opportunities.\u201d DOJ Complaint against Adobe, et al. (\u201cDOJ Adobe Compl.\u201d), Harvey Decl. Ex. A, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 14; DOJ Complaint against Lucasfilm (\u201cDOJ Lucasfilm Compl.\u201d), Harvey Decl. Ex. D, at \u00b6\u00b62, 15, 22; CAC \u00b6 112. The DOJ also determined that the agreements \u201cwere not ancillary to any legitimate collaboration,\u201d \u201cwere much broader than reasonably necessary for the formation or implementation of any collaborative effort,\u201d and \u201cdisrupted the normal price-setting mechanisms that apply in the labor setting.\u201d DOJ Adobe Compl. \u00b6 16; DOJ Lucasfilm Compl. \u00b6 17; CAC \u00b6 112. The DOJ concluded that Defendants entered into agreements that were naked restraints of trade that were <em>per se </em>unlawful under the antitrust laws. DOJ Adobe Compl. \u00b6 35; DOJ Lucasfilm Compl. \u00b6 3; CAC \u00b6 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">On September 24, 2010, the DOJ filed a complaint against Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, and Pixar regarding Defendants\u2019 agreements. DOJ Final J. against Adobe, et al. (\u201cDOJ Adobe J.\u201d), Brown Decl. Ex. A, at 2; CAC \u00b6 114. On December 14, 2010, the DOJ filed another complaint against Lucasfilm and Pixar regarding Defendants\u2019 agreements. DOJ Final J. against Lucasfilm (\u201cDOJ Lucas-film J.\u201d) Order at 1, <em>United States v. Lucasfilm, Inc., </em>No. 10-02220-RBW (D.D.C. June 3, 2011), 2011 WL 2636850 at *1;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CAC \u00b6 114. In both cases, the DOJ filed stipulated proposed final judgments in which Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm, and Pixar agreed that the DOJ\u2019s complaints \u201cstate[] a claim upon which relief may be granted\u201d under federal antitrust law. DOJ Proposed Final J. against Lucasfilm (\u201cDOJ Proposed Lucas-film J.\u201d), Brown Decl. Ex. B, at 2; CAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>\u00b6 114.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Defendants did not admit any wrongdoing or violation of law, Defendants agreed to be \u201cenjoined from attempting to enter into, maintaining or enforcing any agreement with any other person or in any way refrain from, requesting that any person in any way refrain from, or pressuring any person in any way to refrain from soliciting, cold calling, recruiting, or otherwise competing for employees of the other person.\u201d DOJ Adobe J. at 5; DOJ Proposed Lucasfilm J. at 4; CAC \u00b6 115. The D.C. District Court entered the stipulated proposed final judgments on March 17, 2011, and June 2, 2011, respectively. DOJ Adobe J. at 12, DOJ Lucasfilm J. at 1; CAC \u00b6 115.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">3. Alleged Conspiracy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to eliminate competition between them for skilled labor, with the intent and effect of suppressing the compensation and mobility of Defendants\u2019 employees. CAC \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">According to Plaintiffs, the conspiracy consisted of an interconnected web of express bilateral agreements, each with the active involvement and participation of a company under the control of the late Steven P. Jobs (\u201cMr. Jobs\u201d) and/or a company whose board shared at least one .member of Apple\u2019s board of directors. <em>Id. </em>Defendants\u2019 senior executives actively participated in negotiating, executing, monitoring compliance with, and policing violations of the bilateral agreements. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56, 65, 74, 79, 84, 85, 91, 98, 102, 104, 107. Defendants\u2019 senior executives also actively concealed each bilateral agreement, and Defendants\u2019 employees were not informed of, nor did they agree to, the terms of any of the agreements. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64, 77, 82, 89, 100, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">From 2005 to 2007, each pair of Defendants in a bilateral agreement entered into nearly identical \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements, whereby each company placed the names of the other company\u2019s employees on a \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d list and instructed recruiters not to cold call the employees of the other company. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67, 78, 83, 90, 101.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a properly functioning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>lawfully competitive labor market, each Defendant would compete for employees by \u201ccold calling,\u201d that is, soliciting current employees of one or more other Defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 41. Cold calling includes communicating directly in any manner (including orally, in writing, telephonically, or electronically) with another company\u2019s employee who has not otherwise applied for a job opening. <em>Id. </em>The use of cold calling among competitors commonly increases total compensation and mobility of all Defendants\u2019 employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Each bilateral agreement in this case applied to all employees of a given pair of Defendants; was not limited by geography, job function, product group, or time period; and was not related to a collaboration between that pair of Defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63, 76, 81, 88, 100, 105. The bilateral relationships between pairs of Defendants are described in more detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\"><em>Pixar and Lucasfilm. </em>In January 2005, while Mr. Jobs was CEO of Pixar, senior executives of Pixar and Lucasfilm entered into express, written agreements to eliminate competition between them for skilled labor. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 62. Pixar drafted the terms of the agreements in Emeryville, California and sent those terms to Lucas-film. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 62. Pixar and Lucasfilm entered into agreements: (1) not to cold call each other\u2019s employees; (2) to notify the other company when making an offer to an employee of the other company, even if that employee had applied for the prospective position on his own initiative in the absence of cold calling; and (3) not to engage in \u201cbidding wars,\u201d i.e., counteroffer above the initial offer, if either company made an offer to the employee of the other company. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 59-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">In 2007, Pixar twice contacted Lucasfilm regarding suspected violations of the agreement, and Lucasfilm responded by changing its conduct to conform to the agreement. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\"><em>Apple and Adobe. </em>In May 2005, while Mr. Jobs was CEO of Apple (concurrently serving as CEO of Pixar), Apple, and Adobe entered into an express \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement, similar to the first agreement between Pixar and Lucasfilm. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72, 73. Apple and Adobe reached the agreement through direct and explicit communications between their senior executives, who actively managed and enforced the agreement through further direct communications. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\"><em>Apple and Google. </em>In 2006, while Arthur D. Levinson (\u201cMr. Levinson\u201d) sat on the boards of both Apple and Google, these two companies entered into an express \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement identical to the \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement between Apple and Adobe. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">In February and March 2007, Apple contacted Google to complain about suspected violations of the agreement. In response, Google conducted an internal investigation and reported its findings back to Apple. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-13\"><em>Apple and Pixar. </em>In April 2007, Apple entered into an agreement with Pixar that was identical to Apple\u2019s earlier \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements with Adobe and Google. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 85. At this time, Mr. Jobs, as the single largest shareholder of the Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201d), continued to exert substantial control over Pixar. <em>Id. </em>\u00b687. Disney had acquired Pixar in 2006, and Mr. Jobs thereafter sat on Disney\u2019s board of directors and continued to oversee Pixar\u2019s animation business. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-14\"><em>Google and Intuit. </em>In June 2007, Google entered into an express \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement with Intuit that was iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>tical to Google\u2019s earlier agreement with Apple, and identical to the earlier agreements between Apple and Adobe, and between Apple and Pixar. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 103. At this time, Google CEO Eric Schmidt (\u201cMr. Schmidt\u201d) sat on Apple\u2019s board of directors, along with Mr. Levinson, who continued to sit on the boards of both Apple and Google. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\"><em>Google and Intel. </em>In September 2007, Google entered into an express \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement with Intel that was identical to Google\u2019s earlier agreements with Apple and Intuit, and identical to Apple\u2019s earlier agreements with Adobe and Pixar. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 98. At this time, Google CEO Mr. Schmidt continued to sit on Apple\u2019s board of directors, along with Mr. Levinson, who continued to sit on the boards of both Apple and Google. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Plaintiffs allege that each member of the Class was harmed by each and every agreement described above, which together made up \u201can overarching conspiracy\u201d to decrease competition for skilled labor, reduce employee mobility, and suppress compensation. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 108-110. Each Defendant is alleged to have entered into this conspiracy with knowledge of the other Defendants\u2019 participation in the conspiracy, and with the intent of suppressing Plaintiffs\u2019 compensation and mobility through eliminating competition for skilled labor. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55, 108. The elimination of competition and suppression of compensation and mobility had a cumulative effect on all Class members. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Plaintiffs allege that in August 2007, Mr. Jobs contacted the CEO of Palm Inc. (\u201cPalm\u201d), Edward T. Colligan (\u201cMr. Colligan\u201d), to propose that Apple and Palm also agree to refrain from cold calling and hiring each other\u2019s employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 92, 94. Mr. Jobs said to Mr. Colligan, \u201cWe must do whatever we can\u201d to stop cold calling each other\u2019s employees and other competitive recruiting efforts between the companies. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 94. Mr. Jobs also threatened litigation to intimidate Palm into entering into a \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Colligan declined Mr. Jobs\u2019s proposal, telling him, \u2018Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other\u2019s employees, regardless of the individual\u2019s desires, is not only wrong, it is likely illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">4. Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC contains four claims for relief under the following statutes: (1) Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1; (2) California\u2019s Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7\u00a7 16720, <em>et seq.; </em>(3) Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 16600<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and (4) California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d), Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200, <em>et seq. Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 119-152. Plaintiffs seek damages, restitution, costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and prejudgment and post-judgment interest. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 153-164.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">The original complaints in the five actions underlying this consolidated action were filed in California state court. <em>Hariharan v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11574066 (Alameda Super.Ct. filed May 4, 2011); <em>Marshall v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-204052 (Santa Clara Super.Ct. filed June 28, 2011); <em>Devine v. Adobe Sys. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number><em>Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-204053 (Santa Clara Super.Ct. filed June 28, 2011); <em>Fichtner v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-204187 (Santa Clara Super.Ct. filed June 30, 2011); <em>Stover v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-25090 (Santa Clara Super.Ct. filed July 14, 2011).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendants subsequently removed the five state court actions to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. <em>Hariharan v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-2509-JCS (removed May 23, 2011); <em>Marshall v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-3538-HRL (removed July 19, 2011); <em>Devine v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-3539-HRL (removed July 19, 2011); <em>Fichtner v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-3540PSG (removed July 19, 2011); <em>Stover v. Adobe Sys. Inc., </em>Case No. 11-CV-3541PSG (removed July 19, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">On June 1, 2011, the lead case, <em>Hariharan v. Adobe Systems Inc., </em>was reassigned from Magistrate Judge Spero to Judge Armstrong. ECF No. 24. On July 19, 2011, Intuit filed a motion to relate the five underlying actions, ECF No. 41, which Judge Armstrong granted on July 27, 2011, ECF No. 52. On August 2, 2011, Plaintiff Siddharth Hariharan moved to transfer the five underlying actions to the San Jose Division, ECF No. 56, which Judge Armstrong granted on August 4, 2011, ECF No. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">On August 5, 2011, the underlying actions were reassigned to the undersigned judge. The Court consolidated the five underlying actions on September 12, 2011, ECF No. 64, and Plaintiffs filed the CAC on September 13, 2011. ECF No. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">On October 26, 2011, the Court held a Case Management Conference, where the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants\u2019 joint motion to stay discovery, ECF No. 80. <em>See </em>ECF No. 88. The Court ordered that Defendants respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 Document Request Nos. 1-7 and produce responsive, non-privileged documents already produced to the DOJ. <em>See id. </em>Pursuant to the Court\u2019s instructions at the Case Management Conference, Plaintiffs withdrew their prayer for injunctive relief, ECF No. 89, and voluntarily dismissed a related case, <em>Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &amp; Bernstein, LLP v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Antitrust Div., </em>Case No. 11-CV-5105-HRL (N.D.Cal. Oct. 18, 2011), ECF No. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">Defendants filed the instant joint motion to dismiss on October 13, 2011, ECF No. 79, and, with leave of the Court, Lucasfilm filed its separate motion to dismiss on October 17, 2011, ECF No. 83. Plaintiffs opposed both of these motions on November 4,-2011. ECF Nos. 91, 92. Defendants filed their joint reply on December 2, 2011, ECF No. 97, and Lucasfilm filed its reply that same day, ECF No. 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">II. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \u201ctests the legal sufficiency of a claim.\u201d <em>Navarro v.

ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">The Court addresses Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss before turning to Lucas-film\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">A. Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">Defendants jointly move to dismiss the CAC on the grounds that it fails to state an antitrust claim under federal and California law because: (1) the CAC fails to allege evidentiary facts to support the claim of an \u201coverarching conspiracy\u201d among all Defendants to suppress their employees\u2019 wages; (2) such a conspiracy is implausible on its face; and (3) the CAC fails to plead antitrust injury. Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the UCL fail for the same reasons as Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims. Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because Plaintiffs are former employees with no stated intention of working for any Defendant, and the alleged conduct has already been enjoined by the DOJ. The Court need not reach this last argument, however, because it was rendered moot by Plaintiffs\u2019 withdrawal of their prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief. ECF Nos. 89, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">1. Antitrust Claims Under the Sherman Act and California\u2019s Cartwright Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">The parties appear to agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 federal and state antitrust claims rise and fall together. \u201cIndeed, the analysis under California\u2019s antitrust law mirrors the analysis under federal law because the Cartwright Act was modeled after the Sherman Act.\u201d <em>Cnty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., </em>236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Nova Designs, Inc. v. Scuba Retailers Ass\u2019n, </em>202 F.3d 1088, 1091 (9th Cir.2000). Thus, if Plaintiffs plead a valid Sherman Act claim, they likewise plead a valid Cartwright Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-12\">a. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, prohibits \u201c[ejvery contract, combination ..., or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.\u201d To state a claim under Section 1, a plaintiff must allege that \u201c(1) there was an agreement, conspiracy, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>combination between two or more entities; (2) the agreement was an unreasonable restraint of trade under either a per se or rule of reason analysis;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (3) the restraint affected interstate commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. GTE Corp., </em>92 F.3d 781, 784 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also Tanaka v. Univ. of S. Cal., </em>252 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir.2001). The Supreme Court has stated that a plaintiff must plead \u201c \u2018enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. Asking for plausible grounds to infer an agreement does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an illegal agreement____[A]n allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., </em>518 F.3d 1042, 1047 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556-57, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">Section 4 of the Clayton Act creates a private right of action under the Sherman Act for a plaintiff who has been \u201cinjured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a). Thus, an antitrust plaintiff must have suffered antitrust injury, that is, \u201cinjury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d <em>Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of Cal., </em>190 F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">b. Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts to establish an \u201coverarching conspiracy.\u201d Specifically, Defendants argue that: (1) Plaintiffs fail to plead the \u201cwho, what, where, and when\u201d describing the alleged conspiracy, and (2) Plaintiffs have not alleged the requisite knowledge and intent to show a conspiracy. Joint Mot. 2 (citing <em>Kendall, </em>518 F.3d 1042). Defendants also contend that an \u201coverarching conspiracy\u201d consisting of six bilateral agreements is implausible on its face, primarily because each Defendant remained free to cold call most of the other Defendants\u2019 employees. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to plead antitrust injury. The Court addresses these arguments in turn,</p>\n<p id=\"A3fF\">i. Who, What, to Whom, Where, and When</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to plead the \u201cwho, what, where, and when\u201d of the alleged overarching conspiracy. Defendants urge the Court to ignore Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d and mere \u201cformulaic recitation[s] of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d Joint Mot. 9 (citing <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949). While it is true, as Defendants note, that Plaintiffs refer to the \u201coverarching conspiracy,\u201d CAC \u00b6\u00b6 55, 108, as an \u201cinterconnected web of agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>ments,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 55, 108, these labels are not the only facts that Plaintiffs have alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Defendants rely primarily on <em>Kendall </em>to support their argument that Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts supporting an overarching conspiracy. <em>Kendall, </em>however, is distinguishable. Even after conducting depositions, the plaintiffs in <em>Kendall </em>did \u201cnot allege <em>any </em>facts to support their theory that the [defendants] conspired or agreed with each other ... to restrain trade.\u201d <em>Kendall, </em>518 F.3d at 1048 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of mere parallel conduct, without more, were insufficient to plead a Section 1 violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1049. The Ninth Circuit also held that, to survive a motion to dismiss, a Section 1 claim should \u201canswer the basic questions: who, did what, to whom (or with whom), where, and when?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">Plaintiffs here have alleged much more than mere parallel conduct, despite not having any discovery before filing the CAC. Unlike the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in <em>Kendall, </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC details the actors, effect, victims, location, and timing of the six bilateral agreements between Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\"><em>Who. </em>Plaintiffs allege that the' agreements were negotiated, executed, and, in most cases, enforced by Defendants\u2019 \u201csenior executives.\u201d CAC \u00b6\u00b6 62, 64, 65, 74, 77, 79, 84, 85, 91, 98, 102, 107. The Ninth Circuit has expressed concern that \u201c[a] bare allegation of a conspiracy is almost impossible to defend against, particularly where the defendants are large institutions with hundreds of employees entering into contracts and agreements.\u201d <em>Kendall, </em>518 F.3d at 1047. This concern, however, is inapplicable here, where Plaintiffs allege that, at all relevant times, at least one of three individuals had significant influence over at least one party to each of the six bilateral agreements: Apple CEO and Pixar CEO Mr. Jobs; Apple and Google board member Mr. Levinson; and Google CEO and Apple board member Mr. Schmidt. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 55, 57, 58, 72, 79, 87, 97, 103, 108. Specifically, Mr. Jobs exerted significant influence over companies involved in four of the bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements: Pixar-Lucasfilm; Apple-Pixar; Apple-Google; and Apple-Adobe. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 72, 79, 85, 87. Mr. Schmidt, CEO of Google, sat on Apple\u2019s board of directors when Google entered into agreements with Intel and Inuit. Id. \u00b6 97. Mr. Levinson sat on the boards of both Apple and Google when the two companies entered into their bilateral agreement; when Google entered into agreements with Intel and with Intuit; and when Apple entered into an agreement with Pixar. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 79, 97,103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">Moreover, the identical nature of the six bilateral agreements may support the inference that these individuals played a role in shaping these agreements. For example, it strains credulity that Apple and Adobe reached an agreement in May 2005 that was identical to the \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement Pixar entered into with Lucasfilm in January 2005, id. \u00b6\u00b6 58, 72, without some communication or coordination between these two sets of Defendants. The only apparent link between the Apple-Adobe agreement and the Pixar-Lueasfilm agreement is Mr. Jobs, who controlled Apple, <em>id., </em>and who oversaw Pixar. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 87. Plaintiffs allege that all of the bilateral agreements were reached in secrecy. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56-91. Thus, the identical nature of the six secret bilateral agreements further supports the plausible inference that the agreements were negotiated, reached, and policed at the highest levels of the Defendant companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-9\">Furthermore, Plaintiffs provide an example of Mr. Jobs personally negotiating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>potential \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement directly with the CEO of Palm, Mr. Colligan. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 92-96. Plaintiffs quote Mr. Jobs as allegedly telling Mr. Colligan, \u201c \u2018We must do whatever we can\u2019 to stop cold calling each other\u2019s employees and other competitive recruiting efforts between the companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 94. Based on Mr. Jobs\u2019s attempt to negotiate a \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement directly with Palm\u2019s CEO, it is reasonable to infer that such agreements were negotiated directly CEO to CEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Finally, because the bilateral agreements were not limited by geography, job function, product group, or time period, and were not related to a collaboration between defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63, 76, 81, 88, 100, 105, it is reasonable to infer that such significant wide-ranging, company-wide, and worldwide policies would have been approved at the highest levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">The Court finds that at the pleading stage, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled who negotiated and entered into the bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">What, to Whom, Where, and When. Plaintiffs also allege that the agreements removed cold calling as an upward pressure on Plaintiffs\u2019 salaries, resulting in artificially lower salaries. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 70, 72, 79, 85, 98. As discussed in greater detail in Section III.A.l.b.ii, infra, Plaintiffs describe a plausible scenario as to how, in light of basic economic principles, these agreements formed an overarching conspiracy that resulted in artificially lower salaries. Plaintiffs also set forth how the nearly identical agreements, of identical scope, were entered into in various cities and counties in California, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 62, 75, 80, 86, 99, between 2005 and 2007. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 73, 79, 85, 98, 103. Plaintiffs allege how these agreements were the subject of a DOJ investigation in which the DOJ found the agreements to be \u201cper se unlawful\u201d and in which Defendants agreed that the DOJ stated a federal antitrust claim. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 112, 114. Indeed, Defendants note that \u201cvirtually all of the facts alleged in the Complaint relate to six bilateral agreements among Defendants,\u201d apparently conceding that Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to establish the existence of these bilateral agreements. Joint Mot. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Kendall, </em>Plaintiffs here have \u201canswer[ed] the basic questions: who, did what, to whom (or with whom), where, and when?\u201d <em>Kendall, </em>518 F.3d at 1047. Moreover, Plaintiffs have alleged facts beyond mere parallel conduct that \u201ctend[] to exclude the possibility of independent action.\u201d <em>Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., </em>465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984) (holding that \u201cevidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action ... create[s] a jury issue\u201d); <em>see also Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp., </em>850 F.2d 477, 484 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cconcerted action may be inferred from circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct and course of dealings\u201d) (internal citation omitted); <em>In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig., </em>630 F.3d 622, 627-29 (7th Cir.2010) <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2165, 179 L.Ed.2d 937 (2011) (holding that where a \u201ccomplaint allege[d] a mixture of parallel behaviors, details of industry structure, and industry practices, that facilitate collusion,\u201d this \u201cconstitute^] supporting evidence of collusion,\u201d and \u201cprovide[d] a sufficiently plausible case of price fixing to warrant allowing the plaintiffs to proceed to discovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">Accordingly, failure to plead the \u201cwho, what, to whom, where, and when\u201d is not a basis to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1 claims here. <em>Cf. In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., </em>738 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1018 (N.D.Cal.2010) (Conti, J.)

Knowledge and Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show \u201csome meeting of the minds.\u201d Specifically, Defendants argue that the mere fact of overlapping board members is not evidence of a conspiracy and that multiple bilateral agreements do not make up an overarching conspiracy. Joint Mot. 11-12. The Court is not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">In order to plausibly state a Section 1 claim, Plaintiffs must allege something more than parallel conduct and a conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point. \u201c[W]hen allegations of parallel conduct are set out in order to make a \u00a7 1 claim, they must be placed in a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent action.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1966. To establish a conspiracy, the conspirators must have a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding. <em>Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 781, 810, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1946). A co-conspirator need not know of the existence or identity of the other members of the conspiracy or the full extent of the conspiracy. <em>Beltz Travel Serv. Inc. v. Int\u2019l Air Transp. Ass\u2019n, </em>620 F.2d 1360, 1366-67 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201cParticipation by each conspirator in every detail in the execution of the conspiracy is unnecessary to establish liability, for each conspirator may be performing different tasks to bring about the desired result.\u201d); <em>cf. Blumenthal v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 539, 557, 68 S.Ct. 248, 92 L.Ed. 154 (1947) (stating the same proposition in the criminal context). In antitrust conspiracy cases, \u201cplaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each.... [T]he character and effect of a conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole.... \u201d <em>Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corp., </em>370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 8 L.Ed.2d 777 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to implement a conspiracy to restrain competition for employees. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 senior executives negotiated, executed, monitored, and policed a series of identical \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements in an effort to eliminate competition for skilled labor. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 56, 74, 79, 85, 98, 104. Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that, at all relevant times, at least one of three individuals had significant influence over at least one party to each of the six bilateral agreements: Apple and Pixar CEO Mr. Jobs, Apple and Google board member Mr. Levinson, and Google CEO and Apple board member Mr. Schmidt. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55, 57, 58, 72, 79, 87, 97, 103, 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">Defendants cite <em>Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. Supron Energy Corp., </em>728 F.2d 1555, 1561 (10th Cir.1984), for the proposition that service on multiple boards is \u201cnot evidence of a conspiracy.\u201d Joint Mot. 12. However, <em>Jicarilla </em>does not stand for this proposition. To the contrary, the <em>Jicarilla </em>Court acknowledged that overlapping board membership \u201cmay indicate an opportunity to conspire.... \u201d <em>Jicarilla, </em>728 F.2d at 1561. This is precisely the reason for which Plaintiffs allege overlapping board membership here: to indicate an opportunity to conspire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">Specifically, Mr. Levinson sat on the boards of both Apple and Google when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>two companies entered into their bilateral agreement; when Google entered into an agreement with Intel and Intuit; and when Apple entered into an agreement with Pixar. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79, 97, 103. Mr. Schmidt, CEO of Google, sat on Apple\u2019s board of directors when Google entered into agreements with Intel and Inuit, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 97. Mr. Levinson\u2019s and Mr. Schmidt\u2019s positions on the boards of companies entering into virtually identical, yet secret, bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements provided an opportunity for Defendants to share knowledge and to conspire. Thus, their overlapping board membership lends plausibility to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that each Defendant entered into this conspiracy \u201cwith knowledge of the other Defendants\u2019 participation in the conspiracy, and with the intent of ... redue[ing] employee compensation and mobility through eliminating competition for skilled labor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 55; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 108. These bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements were negotiated by senior executives and represented the \u201cpolicies\u201d of several hi-tech companies. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 116. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that such significant policies would have to be approved at the highest levels. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs, Opp\u2019n to Joint Mot. 10, that it is plausible to infer that the overlapping board membership here provided an opportunity to conspire and an opportunity for transfer of the requisite knowledge and intent regarding the bilateral agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">The plausibility of these inferences increases when the Court considers that Mr. Jobs also exerted significant influence over companies involved in four of the bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements: Pixar-Lucasfilm; Apple-Pixar; Apple-Google; and Apple-Adobe. Plaintiffs provide an example of Mr. Jobs personally negotiating the same kind of \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement directly with the CEO of Palm. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 92-96. Notwithstanding the fact that this example involved a non-Defendant, Mr. Jobs\u2019s alleged personal involvement lends further plausibility to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the agreements at issue here were executed, policed, and enforced by senior executives. Furthermore, Plaintiffs quote Mr. Jobs as allegedly telling Palm\u2019s CEO, Mr. Colligan, \u201c \u2018We must do whatever we can\u2019 to stop cold calling each other\u2019s employees and other competitive recruiting efforts between the companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 94. From this quote it is reasonable to infer that Mr. Jobs had the intent to reduce competition for skilled labor and was aware that \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements were effective means of doing so. Given that Mr. Jobs, as CEO of Apple, had contact with Messrs. Levinson and Schmidt, who were members of Apple\u2019s Board, it is also reasonable to infer that the overlapping board membership provided an opportunity for Mr. Jobs to expand the conspiracy. Thus, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts plausibly suggesting \u201ca unity of purpose[,] a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement.\u201d <em>Monsanto, </em>465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Defendants also argue that six bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements do not add up to an overarching conspiracy.- Defendants rely principally on <em>In re Iowa Ready-Mix Concrete Antitrust Litigation, </em>768 F.Supp.2d 961 (N.D.Iowa 2011), to support this argument. In addition to not being binding on this Court, <em>Iowa Ready-Mix Concrete </em>is distinguishable. There, the plaintiffs sought to rely on bilateral agreements \u2014 which were the basis for three of the defendants\u2019 guilty pleas to criminal antitrust violations \u2014 to show one conspiracy among all defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 972.

In dismissing the complaint, the court noted that the plaintiffs failed to allege: (1) \u201cparallel conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 974; (2) a \u201clarger picture from which inferences of a wider conspiracy can be drawn from guilty pleas to separate bilateral conspiracies,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 975; (3) \u201cany facts that could tie together the specific, discrete incidents of admitted misconduct and the overarching all-defendant four-plus year conspiracy ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 972; and (4) \u201cthat the defendants ever systematically interacted with each other, much less that they had some mechanism to operate the alleged conspiracy, allocate its profits, and police its participants,\u201d <em>id. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had the additional defect of failing to allege when, where, and from whom plaintiffs purchased the allegedly price-fixed product. <em>Id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\"><em>As </em>discussed above, Plaintiffs here have alleged a \u201clarger picture\u201d of senior executives from closely connected high-tech companies in Northern California contemporaneously negotiating and enforcing six bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements. The fact that all six identical bilateral agreements were reached in secrecy among seven Defendants in a span of two years suggests that these agreements resulted from collusion, and not from coincidence. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Iowa Ready-Mix Concrete, </em>therefore, Plaintiffs here have alleged facts plausibly suggesting \u201ca unity of purpose!,] a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement.\u201d <em>Monsanto, </em>465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464 (internal citation omitted). Whether Plaintiffs can adduce sufficient evidence in discovery to <em>prove </em>an overarching conspiracy is a question that is not before the Court today. At the pleading stage, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. Accordingly, failure to plead sufficient evidentiary facts supporting an overarching conspiracy is not a ground for dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">iii. Plausibility of the Conspiracy Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of an overarching conspiracy is implausible. Joint Mot. 14 (citing <em>William O. Gilley Enters., Inc. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 588 F.3d 659, 662 </em>(9th Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cGilley </em>\u201d)). While it is true that the facts alleged must be \u201c \u2018plausible\u2019 in light of basic economic principles,\u201d <em>Gilley, </em>588 F.3d at 662, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations meet this plausibility standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">As Defendants note, the bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements alleged in Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC do not cover all possible pairings between Defendants \u2014 that is, while Adobe cannot cold call Apple employees or vice versa, nothing in the CAC indicates that Adobe could not cold-call Adobe, Intuit, Google, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. Joint. Mot. 15. In fact, of the 21 possible pairings between the 7 Defendants, only 6 pairings have a bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement, leaving competition open among the remaining 15 pairings. <em>Id. </em>Defendants argue that the economics of this situation evidence the lack of an overarching conspiracy, as a rational conspiracy would seek to eliminate these additional price pressures in order to make the existing bilateral constraints effective. <em>Id. </em>Relatedly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged conspiracy is implausible because Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Defendants have market power over a rel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>evant market. <em>Id. </em>at 16. For the reasons below, neither of these arguments prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">First, the Court does not agree with Defendants that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of an overarching conspiracy are implausible on their face. While Defendants accurately point out that only 6 bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements have been alleged, Plaintiffs nonetheless adequately allege that the \u201ccompensation effects of cold calling are not limited to the particular individuals who receive cold calls, or to the particular individuals who would have received cold calls but for the anticompetitive agreements alleged herein. Instead, the effects of ... eliminating cold calling ... commonly impact all salaried employees of the participating companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 50. Plaintiffs allege that \u201cPlaintiffs and each member of the Class were harmed by each and every agreement herein alleged. The elimination of competition and suppression of compensation and mobility had cumulative effect on all Class members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 110. For example, \u201can individual who was an employee of Lucasfilm received lower compensation and faced unlawful obstacles to mobility as a result of not only the illicit agreements with Pixar, but also as a result of Pixar\u2019s agreement with Apple.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Defendants do not attack Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of the cumulative harm of the bilateral agreements beyond calling the allegations \u201cconclusory.\u201d Joint Mot. 17. The Court disagrees with Defendants\u2019 characterization. Far from asserting mere conclusions of law, Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC details how cold calling normally works in the labor market for skilled employees in the high-tech industry and how eliminating cold calling would reduce such employees\u2019 compensation and mobility. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 41-54. Plaintiffs provide specific examples of various ways in which cold calling significantly impacts employee compensation. First, Plaintiffs allege that when an employee of Company A receives a cold call from rival Company B, the current employee may either move to Company B, or use Company B\u2019s offer as leverage to negotiate increased compensation from Company A. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 46. Second, when a current employee of Company A receives a cold call from rival Company B, that information is likely to spread through informal employee communication channels, empowering other Company A employees to use that information in their own compensation negotiations. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 47. Third, when rival Company B cold calls a Company A employee, Company B is likely to glean information about Company A\u2019s compensation practices. As a result, in a normal, competitive labor market, Company B is likely to match or exceed the compensation package offered by its rivals. This iterative process tends to lead to increased compensation levels across the industry, as companies vie for rivals\u2019 employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 48. Finally, when Company A knows that its employees may be cold called by rival Company B, Company A is more likely to forfend prospective poaching of its employees by preemptively increasing the compensation of its current employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">While these allegations concerning the labor market effects of cold calling remain to be proven, the Court presumes these factual allegations to be true for purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss. In light of Plaintiffs\u2019 specific allegations concerning the industry-wide procompetitive effects of cold calling recruiting practices, it is plausible to infer that even a single bilateral agreement would have the ripple effect of depressing the mobility and compensation of employees of companies that are not direct parties to the agreement. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of six parallel bilateral agreements render the inference of an anticompetitive ripple effect that much more plau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>sible. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled facts alleging the economic plausibility of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Defendants\u2019 second argument, which challenges the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy theory based on Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege a relevant market and that Defendants have power within that market, also fails. \u201cThere is no requirement that [the market definition] elements of the antitrust claim be pled with specificity.\u201d <em>Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, </em>513 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir.2008). \u201cAn antitrust complaint therefore survives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion unless it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the alleged market suffers a fatal legal defect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The existence of a \u201crelevant market\u201d is typically a factual inquiry for the jury. <em>Id. </em>A complaint may be dismissed on this ground only if the market definition is \u201cfacially unsustainable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are high-tech companies in the market for skilled labor, where cold calling plays an important role in determining salaries and labor mobility. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 41-54. Plaintiffs further allege that the labor market for skilled high-tech labor is national. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30, 39. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that \u201cDefendants succeeded in lowering the compensation and mobility of their employees below what would have prevailed in a lawful and properly functioning labor market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 108. Thus, the Court accepts as true, as the Court must on a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Defendants succeeded in distorting the market through their agreements. Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that Defendants had the market power to do so. <em>Cf. Theme Promotions, Inc. v. News Am. Mktg. FSI, </em>546 F.3d 991, 1001 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cEvidence of restricted output and supracompetitive prices is direct evidence of market power.\u201d (quoting <em>Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 1467, 1475 (9th Cir.1997))).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">Moreover, the Court need not engage in a market analysis until the Court decides whether to apply a <em>per se </em>or rule of reason analysis. <em>See F.T.C. v. Ind. Fed\u2019n of Dentists, </em>476 U.S. 447, 462, 106 S.Ct. 2009, 90 L.Ed.2d 445 (1986); <em>Nat\u2019l Soc\u2019y of Prof'l Eng\u2019rs v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S.Ct. 1355, 55 L.Ed.2d 637 (1978). Defendants\u2019 argument relies on the false assumption that the Court should apply a rule of reason analysis, but as the parties agree, Joint Mot. 9; Tr. 29:15-17, the Court need not decide now whether <em>per se </em>or rule of reason analysis applies. Indeed, that decision is more appropriate on a motion for summary judg ment. <em>See Pecover v. Elecs. Arts Inc., </em>633 F.Supp.2d 976, 983 (N.D.Cal.2009) (deferring market analysis under rule of reason, under Cartwright Act, until after deciding motion to dismiss); <em>In re Beer Distrib. Antitrust Litig., </em>188 F.R.D. 557, 564 (N.D.Cal.1999) (Williams, J.). Plaintiffs have successfully pled a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sherman Act for purposes of surviving a 12(b)(6) motion, <em>see </em>CAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 32(b), 125, 134, 155; Opp\u2019n to Joint Mot. 1, and therefore no market analysis is required at this time. <em>See United States v.

The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-8\">In general, \u201c[a]ntitrust injury requires the plaintiff to have suffered its injury in the market where competition is being restrained.\u201d <em>Am. Ad Mgmt., </em>190 F.3d at 1057. However, \u201cit is not the status as a consumer or competitor that confers antitrust standing, but the relationship between the defendant\u2019s alleged unlawful conduct and the resulting harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058. The Ninth Circuit has held that, where, as here, an employee is the direct and intended object of an employer\u2019s anticompetitive conduct, that employee has standing to sue for antitrust injury. <em>Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., </em>740 F.2d 739, 742-43 (9th Cir.1984); <em>accord Eichorn v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>248 F.3d 131, 140-41 (3d Cir.2001); <em>Roman v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>55 F.3d 542 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-9\">Plaintiffs have asserted that their salary and mobility were suppressed by Defendants\u2019 agreements not to cold call, and that the alleged agreements were entered into to suppress competition for skilled labor. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 108-10. Plaintiffs have specifically alleged that they were injured by Defendants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive conduct, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-20, 70, 108, 110; have explained the means by which Defendants allegedly caused this injury, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-55, 108; and have suggested how this injury should be quantified, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 32(h). In alleging that Defendants conspired to fix salaries at artificially low levels, Plaintiffs have alleged \u201can example of the type of injury the antitrust laws are meant to protect against.\u201d <em>Doe v.

Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17203 (authorizing injunctive and restitutionary relief); <em>AICCO, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N.

Thus, the only relief Plaintiffs seek under the UCL is restitution. However, because, as explained below, Plaintiffs are not entitled to restitution, Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury is in the form of elimination of competition and suppression of compensation and mobility. CAC \u00b6 110. In their claim under the UCL, Plaintiffs pray that Defendants be required to \u201cdisgorge their illegal gains for the purpose of making full restitution to all injured class members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">Under the UCL, \u201c \u2018the concept of restoration or restitution ... is not limited only to the return of money or property that was once in the possession of that person. Instead, restitution is broad enough to allow a plaintiff to recover money or property in which he or she has a vested interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lozano v. AT &amp; T Wireless Servs. Inc., </em>504 F.3d 718, 733-34 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Juarez v. Arcadia Fin., Ltd., </em>152 Cal.App.4th 889, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 382 (2007)). For example, a plaintiff has a vested interest in unpaid wages and therefore may state a restitution claim under the UCL to recover such lost money or property. <em>See Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Prods. Co., </em>23 Cal.4th 163, 177-78, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706 (2000). The California Supreme Court has made clear, however, that a mere \u201cexpectation interest\u201d is not a \u201cvested interest\u201d for purposes of stating a claim for restitution under the UCL. <em>See Pineda v. Bank of Am., </em>50 Cal.4th 1389, 1401-02, 117 Cal.Rptr.3d 377, 241 P.3d 870 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">The Court finds that the speculative higher compensation Plaintiffs may have gotten in the absence of the alleged conspiracy, unlike unpaid wages, is not a vested interest. In <em>Cortez, </em>the California Supreme Court held that \u201cearned wages that are due and payable pursuant to section 200 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor Code are as much the property of the employee who has given his or her labor to the employer in exchange for that property as is property a person surrenders through an unfair business practice.\u201d 23 Cal.4th at 178, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706. \u201c[R]estitutionary awards encompass quantifiable sums one person owes to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court agrees with Defendants that the salaries Plaintiffs may have been able to negotiate in the absence of the alleged conspiracy is an \u201cattenuated expectancy\u201d \u2014 akin to \u201clost business opportunity\u201d or lost revenue \u2014 which cannot serve as the basis for restitution. <em>Korea Supply, </em>29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>Cal.4th at 1150-51, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937. Plaintiffs are notably silent in response to Defendants\u2019 arguments that Plaintiffs are not entitled to restitutionary relief. Plaintiffs request for disgorgement is also foreclosed, because this remedy is available \u201conly to the extent that it constitutes restitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1145, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937. Any profits Defendants made through the alleged conspiracy at the expense of Plaintiffs\u2019 wages are likewise attenuated expectancies. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled neither to restitution nor to disgorgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Thus, because \u201cthe only relief the UCL provides is unavailable here, [Plaintiffs\u2019] UCL claim fails.\u201d <em>Doe v.

Lucas-film argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim fails as a matter of law because, under the federal enclave doctrine, the Act does not apply to conduct on the Presidio, where Lucasfilm has been located since July 2005. Lucasfilm Mot. 3. All other Defendants join Lucasfilm\u2019s motion on the ground that some of the events of the alleged overarching conspiracy occurred on the Presidio. Joint Mot. 1 n. 1. The Court disagrees with Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-11\">The parties appear to agree that since July 2005, Lucasfilm has been located on the Presidio of San Francisco \u2014 a federal enclave that was ceded to the United States government by the state of California in 1897. Lucasfilm Mot. 1. The parties also agree that any state law enacted after a property becomes a federal enclave cannot be enforced on the enclave unless Congress specifically authorizes its enforcement on the federal enclave. Plaintiffs\u2019 only remaining state law claim is under the Cartwright Act. The parties apparently agree that, because the Cartwright Act was enacted after 1897, and Congress has not authorized its enforcement on the Presidio, the Cartwright Act does not apply to the Presidio. The parties disagree, however, on the nexus required between the Cartwright Act claim and the Presidio for the federal enclave doctrine to bar Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-12\">Defendants argue that the federal enclave doctrine applies as long as some of the alleged events occurred on the federal enclave. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that the federal enclave doctrine only applies when the locus in which the claim arose is the federal enclave itself. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs. The Ninth Circuit has held that in federal enclave cases, \u201cthe jurisdiction of the federal court depends upon ... the locus in which the claim arose.\u201d <em>Alvares v. Erickson, </em>514 F.2d 156, 160 (9th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That Lu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>casfilm is now located on the Presidio, therefore, does not automatically bar <em>all </em>state law claims brought against it. Rather, the federal enclave doctrine bars only those claims which arose \u201con a federal enclave.\u201d <em>Totah v. Bies, </em>No. 10-CV-05956-CW, 2011 WL 1324471, at <em>*2 </em>(N.D.Cal. Apr. 6, 2011). Thus, the Court looks to whether the locus in which Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim arose is the Presidio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">To state a claim under the Cartwright Act, Plaintiffs must allege, \u201c(1) the formation and operation of the conspiracy; (2) illegal acts done pursuant thereto; and (3) damage proximately caused by such acts.\u201d <em>Kolling v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., </em>137 Cal.App.3d 709, 718, 187 Cal.Rptr. 797 (1982). Plaintiffs allege that Lucasfilm and Pixar formed a conspiracy by entering into a bilateral agreement \u201cno later than January 2005.\u201d CAC \u00b6 128. Though Plaintiffs allege that this conspiracy would later expand to include numerous other players, Plaintiffs have successfully alleged that the conspiracy had already formed and was operating by January 2005, six months before Lucasfilm moved to the Presidio. Plaintiffs also allege that the negotiation, execution, and enforcement of this bilateral agreement \u2014 the first of the six such agreements in the overarching conspiracy \u2014 took place in Emeryville, CA. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 62, 65-70. Thus, the locus of the first two Cartwright Act elements was not the Presidio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">The Court recognizes that the federal enclave doctrine may extinguish the Cartwright Act claims of a putative subclass of Plaintiffs, and may not extinguish the Cartwright Act claims of another putative subclass of Plaintiffs. For example, the named Plaintiff who suffered the earliest injury, Mr. Marshall, began work at Adobe in July 2006, over a year after Adobe had entered into its bilateral \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement with Apple. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73. Although Mr. Marshall\u2019s injury did not arise until a year after Lucasfilm had moved to a federal enclave, Adobe is not located on the Presidio, and nothing in the CAC suggests that Mr. Marshall was injured on the Presidio. Thus, regardless of the fact that Lucasfilm had already moved to the Presidio by the time of Mr. Marshall\u2019s alleged injury in 2006, all three elements of Mr. Marshall\u2019s Cartwright Act claim arose outside the Presidio. Accordingly, the locus in which Mr. Marshall\u2019s Cartwright Act claim arose was not the Presidio, and the federal enclave doctrine does not extinguish Mr. Marshall\u2019s Cartwright Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">Defendants\u2019 federal enclave defense is more appropriately addressed when the Court considers class certification, and is not ground to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC. Accordingly, Lucasfilm\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the Court rules as follows on Defendants\u2019 joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>motion to dismiss and Lucasfilm\u2019s motion to dismiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-6\">1. Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss is DENIED as to Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 1 Sherman Act claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-7\">2. Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss is DENIED as to Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-8\">3. Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss is DENIED, as moot, as to Plaintiffs\u2019 Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof.Code \u00a7 16600 claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-9\">4. Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-10\">5. Defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss is DENIED, as moot, as to Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for injunctive and declaratory relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-11\">6. Lucasfilm\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">. The D.C. District Court Order suggests that the DOJ\u2019s complaint against Lucasfilm was filed on December 21, 2010, whereas the CAC states that it was filed on December 14, 2010. The difference is immaterial here, but the Court takes the date as pled in the CAC to be true for purposes of these motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">. Plaintiffs ask this Court to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel to prevent Defendants from taking a position on this motion that is inconsistent \\6ith the position they took before the D.C. District Court that the same allegations \"stated a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d Opp\u2019n to Joint Mot. 6 n. 2 (citing <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). The Court declines to apply the judicial estoppel doctrine here. Defendants' apparent concession that the DOJ stated a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act is not clearly inconsistent with Defendants' position here that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Section 1 of the Sherman Act governs a claim to relief by the government. Section 4 of the Clayton Act governs a claim to relief by an individual and has the additional requirement of antitrust injury, which is inapplicable to the government\u2019s Section 1 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">. As with the discrepancy in the date of the filing of the DOJ's complaint against Lucas-film, as described in footnote 1, the D.C. District Court Order suggests that the final judgment against Lucasfilm was filed on June 3, 2011, whereas the CAC states that it was filed on June 2, 2011. The difference is immaterial here, but the Court takes the date as pled in the CAC to be true for purposes of this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">. Plaintiffs included additional factual allegations supporting a conspiracy, allegedly uncovered in discovery, in their section of the Joint Case Management Statement. ECF No. 109. Although the Court does not opine on the eventual admissibility of this evidence, the Court presently gives no weight to these additional factual allegations as they are not properly before the Court on these motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">. As discussed below, Pixar and Lucasfilm entered into other agreements in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>entering into a \"Do Not Cold Call\u201d agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">. After the hearing, Plaintiffs withdrew their claim under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 16600. ECF No. 111. Accordingly, Defendants'joint motion to dismiss as to this claim is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">. The CAC originally contained a prayer for injunctive relief, <em>see </em>CAC \u00b6\u00b6 126, 135, 143, and declaratory relief, <em>see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 143, 152, 154, 155, 157, 158. However, Plaintiffs have since withdrawn their prayer for injunctive relief, <em>see </em>ECF No. 89, and declaratory relief, <em>see </em>ECF No. 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">. While the name of each Superior Court case listed only Adobe Systems Inc. as the defendant, the Superior Court complaints also named as defendants Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Does 1-200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">. Defendants\u2019 briefing does not contest that the individual bilateral agreements are horizontal agreements between competitors in restraint of trade, which are either <em>per se </em>unlawful, <em>Am. Ad Mgmt., 92 </em>F.3d at 786, or at least, as alleged here, prima facie anticompetitive under the rule of reason analysis. <em>See Brantley v. NBC Universal, Inc., </em>675 F.3d 1192, 1198 (9th Cir.2012). As an initial matter, the parties agree that the Court need not decide, at this stage, whether the rule of reason or <em>per se </em>analysis applies to this case. Reply 9; Tr. 29:15-17. Thus, whether Defendants had a procompetitive justification for their bilateral agreements, a consideration that is relevant only under a rule of reason analysis, is properly decided in later stages of litigation. <em>See Arizona v. Maricopa Cnty. Med. Soc'y, </em>457 U.S. 332, 343, 102 S.Ct. 2466, 73 L.Ed.2d 48 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1155-16\">. The third factor, whether the alleged restraint affected interstate commerce, is not in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1163-10\">. Defendants focus their arguments on antitrust injury, but appear cursorily to attack Plaintiffs' Article III standing. Joint Mot. 9. Plaintiffs meet the requirements for Article III standing: (1) injury in fact; (2) causal connection; (3) redressability. <em>Takhar v. Kessler, </em>76 F.3d 995, 999-1000 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs allege that their salaries were artificially reduced as a result of Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct and that their injury can be redressed through the payment of damages should Plaintiffs establish liability. As Plaintiffs were directly affected by the alleged agreement to eliminate competition, they have antitrust standing as well. <em>AGC v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 U.S. 519, 545, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1163-16\">. Defendants repeat their argument that Plaintiffs have failed to allege a relevant market and control of that market, <em>see </em>Section III.A.l.b.iii, <em>supra, </em>to argue that Plaintiffs have also failed to allege antitrust injury. <em>See </em>Joint Mot. 18-19. As discussed above, the Court declines to require a market analysis at the motion to dismiss stage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1165-9\">. The Court notes that even if Plaintiffs' UCL claim were to survive a motion to dismiss, the UCL claim would likely face an insurmountable hurdle at the class certification stage given that the Ninth Circuit has foreclosed the certification of nationwide classes under the UCL. <em>See Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>666 F.3d 581, 585 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1165-14\">. To the extent <em>Corley v. Long-Lewis, Inc., </em>688 F.Supp.2d 1315, 1336 (N.D.Ala.2010), conflicts by suggesting that the federal enclave doctrine applies as long as \u201csome of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>events alleged ... occurred on a federal enclave,\u201d the Court instead follows the Ninth Circuit, which has held to the contrary. While it is true, as Lucasfilm notes, Lucasfilm Reply 2, that Judge Wilken applied the federal enclave doctrine to bar plaintiff's defamation claim in <em>Totah </em>even though the defamatory statement was uttered and republished outside of the Presidio, <em>Totah </em>is not an example of a sister court adopting <em>Corley\u2019s </em>\u201csome of the events\u201d standard. Judge Wilken stated that \u201cthe substance and consummation of the tort [of libel] occurs when and where the third person receives, reads, and comprehends the libelous matter,\u201d and held that federal enclave jurisdiction applied because the allegedly libelous statements at issue in that case had been received on a federal enclave. <em>Totah, </em>2011 WL 1324471, at *2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
