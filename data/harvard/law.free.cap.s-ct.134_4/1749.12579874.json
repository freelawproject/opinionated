In 1952, when Congress used the word in \u00a7 285 (and today, for that matter), \"[e]xceptional\" meant \"uncommon,\" \"rare,\" or \"not ordinary.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934). An \"exceptional\" case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts may determine whether a case is \"exceptional\" in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances. Cf.\n  <em>\n   Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc.,\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230153\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/517/\">\n   510 U.S. 517\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230153\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/517/\">\n   114 S.Ct. 1023\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230153\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/517/\">\n   127 L.Ed.2d 455\n  </extracted-citation>\n  .

Pp. 1756 - 1758.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Brooks Furniture\n   </em>\n   is too restrictive in defining the two categories of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category-cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct-appears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party's unreasonable, though not independently sanctionable, conduct is so \"exceptional\" as to justify an award. For litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must determine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to be \"exceptional.\" The Federal Circuit imported this second category from\n   <em>\n    Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.

Under the standard crafted in\n   <em>\n    Brooks Furniture\n   </em>\n   , a case is \"exceptional\" only if a district court either finds litigation-related misconduct of an independently sanctionable magnitude or determines that the litigation was both \"brought in subjective bad faith\" and \"objectively baseless.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9175550\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/1378/#p1381\">\n    393 F.3d, at 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This formulation superimposes an inflexible framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For one thing, the first category of cases in which the Federal Circuit allows fee awards-those involving litigation misconduct or certain other misconduct-appears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9175550\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/1378/#p1381\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (defining litigation-related misconduct to include \"willful infringement, fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent, misconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified litigation, conduct that violates Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, or like infractions\"). But sanctionable conduct is not the appropriate benchmark. Under the standard announced\n   today, a district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party's unreasonable conduct-while not necessarily independently sanctionable-is nonetheless so \"exceptional\" as to justify an award of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The second category of cases in which the Federal Circuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive. In order for a case to fall within this second category, a district court must determine\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that the litigation is objectively baseless\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award.
