At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents' front porch about 15 to 20 feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate any clearly established right.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n    713 F.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, \"[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

At around 2:00 on the morning of December 31, 2008, John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential street. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number 696BGK, he entered 695BGK. That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This match caused the squad car's computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ordered Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He accused Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper responded, \"That's not true.\" Record 1295. And Tolan explained, \"That's my car.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tolan then complied with the officer's demand to lie face-down on the home's front porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commotion, Tolan's parents exited the front door in their pajamas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolan's father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Edwards told Tolan's parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan's father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan's mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed. Tolan's father explained, with his hands in the air, \"[T]his is my nephew. This is my son. We live here. This is my house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 2059. Tolan's mother similarly offered, \"[S]ir this is a big mistake. This car is not stolen.... That's our car.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 2075.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant\n   Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan's mother reiterated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding. Cotton then ordered her to stand against the family's garage door. In response to Cotton's order, Tolan's mother asked, \"[A]re you kidding me? We've lived her[e] 15 years. We've never had anything like this happen before.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2077; see also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1465\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan's mother and Cooper testified during Cotton's criminal trial\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn0\" id=\"fr0\" name=\"fr0\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2035, 2078-2080. Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2479. In addition, Tolan offered testimony from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2078-2079, 2089-2091. By contrast, Cotton testified in his deposition that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1043. He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1044.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded. Tolan testified in his deposition and during the criminal trial that upon seeing his mother being pushed,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1249, he rose to his knees,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1928. Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1051-1052, 1121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly 15 to 20 feet away,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n    713 F.3d, at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.\" Record 1928. The parties also agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2019, 2080. One of the bullets entered Tolan's chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering injury that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2009, Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan's parents filed this suit in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Rev.

But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Although the parties agree that Tolan's mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information. Cotton stated during his deposition that Tolan's mother was \"very agitated\" when she spoke to the officers. Record 1032-1033. By contrast, Tolan's mother testified at Cotton's criminal trial that she was neither \"aggravated\" nor \"agitated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2075, 2077.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was \"shouting,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n    713 F.3d, at 306, 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"verbally threatening\" the officer,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n    at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in the moments before the shooting. The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, \"[G]et your fucking hands off my mom.\" Record 1928. But Tolan testified that he \"was not screaming.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2544.

Tolan's mother testified in Cotton's criminal trial that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days. Record 2078-2079.

The court appears to have credited Edwards' account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet \"[i]n a crouch\" or a \"charging position\" looking as if he was going to move forward. Record 1121-1122. Tolan testified at trial, however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1928, a fact corroborated by his mother,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 2081.

It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system.

This is not to say, of course, that these are the only facts that the Fifth Circuit should consider, or that no other facts might contribute to the reasonableness of the officer's actions as a matter of law. Nor do we express a view as to whether Cotton's actions violated clearly established law.

I note, however, that the granting of review in this case sets a precedent that, if followed in other cases, will very substantially alter the Court's practice. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   this Court's Rule 10 (\"A petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely granted when the asserted error consists of erroneous factual findings or the misapplication of a properly stated rule of law\"); S.

The present case falls into that very large category. There is no confusion in the courts of appeals about the standard to be applied in ruling on a summary judgment motion, and the Court of Appeals invoked the correct standard here. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n    713 F.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (C.A.5 2013). Thus, the only issue is whether the relevant evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is sufficient to support a judgment for that party. In the courts of appeals, cases presenting this question are utterly routine. There is no question that this case is important for the parties, but the same is true for a great many other cases that fall into the same category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On the merits of the case, while I do not necessarily agree in all respects with the Court's characterization of the evidence, I agree that there are genuine issues of material fact and that this is a case in which summary judgment should not have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   I therefore concur in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The events described here led to Cotton's criminal indictment in Harris County, Texas, for aggravated assault by a public servant.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559322\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/299/\">\n     713 F.3d 299\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 303 (C.A.5 2013).
