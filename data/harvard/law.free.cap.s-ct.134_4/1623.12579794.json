In\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , voters overturned an Akron ordinance that was enacted to address widespread racial discrimination in housing sales and rentals had forced many to live in \" 'unhealthful, unsafe, unsanitary and overcrowded' \" segregated housing,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n    393 U.S., at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Seizing upon the statement in Justice Harlan's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   that the procedural change in that case had \"the clear purpose of making it more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n    393 U.S., at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   Court established a new and far-reaching rationale: Where a government policy \"inures primarily to the benefit of the minority\" and \"minorities ... consider\" the policy to be \" 'in their interest,' \" then any state action that \"place[s] effective decisionmaking authority over\" that policy \"at a different level of government\" is subject to strict scrutiny.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n    458 U.S., at 472, 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pp. 1632 - 1634.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) To the extent\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   is read to require the Court to determine and declare which political policies serve the \"interest\" of a group defined in racial terms, that rationale was unnecessary to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   ; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious equal protection concerns. In cautioning against \"impermissible racial stereotypes,\" this Court has rejected the assumption that all individuals of the same race think alike, see\n   <em>\n    Shaw v. Reno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355840\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/630/#p647\">\n    509 U.S. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355840\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/630/#p647\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355840\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/630/#p647\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation to control. And if it were deemed necessary to probe how some races define their own interest in political matters, still another beginning point would be to define individuals according to race. Such a venture would be undertaken with no clear legal standards or accepted sources to guide judicial decision. It would also result in, or impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable constitutionality on their own terms. Assuming these steps could be taken, the court would next be required to determine the policy realms in which groups defined by race had a political interest. That undertaking, again without guidance from accepted legal standards, would risk the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose certain policies to cast the debate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Adoption of the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation could affect any number of laws or decisions, involving,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   tax policy or housing subsidies. And racial division would be validated, not discouraged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It can be argued that objections to the larger consequences of the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation need not be confronted here, for race was an undoubted subject of the ballot issue. But other problems raised by\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   , such as racial definitions, still apply. And the principal flaw in the Sixth Circuit's decision remains: Here there was no infliction of a specific injury of the kind at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mulkey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   and in the history of the Seattle schools, and there is no precedent for extending these cases to restrict the right of Michigan voters to determine that race-based preferences\n   granted by state entities should be ended. The Sixth Circuit's judgment also calls into question other States' long-settled rulings on policies similar to Michigan's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unlike the injuries in\n   <em>\n    Mulkey,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   , the question here is not how to address or prevent injury caused on account of race but whether voters may determine whether a policy of race-based preferences should be continued. By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding \u00a7 26 to their State Constitution, Michigan voters exercised their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power, bypassing public officials they deemed not responsive to their concerns about a policy of granting race-based preferences. The mandate for segregated schools,\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Board of Education,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301409\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/\">\n    347 U.S. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11301409\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/\">\n    74 S.Ct. 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20873\">\n    98 L.Ed. 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and scores of other examples teach that individual liberty has constitutional protection. But this Nation's constitutional system also embraces the right of citizens to speak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral process, as Michigan voters have done here. These precepts are not inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted on racial minorities by the encouragement or command of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress by the courts. Such circumstances were present in\n   <em>\n    Mulkey,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   , but they are not present here. Pp. 1634 - 1638.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Justice SCALIA, joined by Justice THOMAS, agreed that \u00a7 26 rightly stands, though not because it passes muster under the political-process doctrine. It likely does not, but the cases establishing that doctrine should be overruled. They are patently atextual, unadministrable, and contrary to this Court's traditional equal protection jurisprudence. The question here, as in every case in which neutral state action is said to deny equal protection on account of race, is whether the challenged action reflects a racially discriminatory purpose. It plainly does not.

In those cases, one level of government exercised borrowed authority over an apparently \"racial issue\" until a higher level of government called the loan.

Those cases involved a restructuring of the political process that changed the political level at which policies were enacted, while this case involves an amendment that took decisionmaking authority away from unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters. Hence, this case does not involve a diminution of the minority's ability to participate in the political process.

After a statewide debate on the question of racial preferences in the context of governmental decisionmaking, the voters, in 2006, adopted an amendment to the State Constitution prohibiting state and other governmental entities in Michigan from granting certain preferences, including race-based preferences, in a wide range of actions and decisions. Under the terms of the amendment, race-based preferences cannot be part of the admissions process for state universities. That particular prohibition is central to the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The ballot proposal was called Proposal 2 and, after it passed by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent, the resulting enactment became Article I, \u00a7 26, of the Michigan Constitution. As noted, the amendment is in broad terms. Section 26 states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"(1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and any other public college or university, community college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"(2) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"(3) For the purposes of this section 'state' includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the state itself, any city, county, any public college, university, or community college, school district, or other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of or within the State of Michigan not included in sub-section 1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 26 was challenged in two cases. Among the plaintiffs in the suits were the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary\n   (BAMN); students; faculty; and prospective applicants to Michigan public universities.

In\n   <em>\n    Mulkey,\n   </em>\n   voters amended the California Constitution to prohibit any state legislative interference with an owner's prerogative to decline to sell or rent residential property on any basis. Two different cases gave rise to\n   <em>\n    Mulkey\n   </em>\n   . In one a couple could not rent an apartment, and in the other a couple were evicted from their apartment. Those adverse actions were on account of race. In both cases the complaining parties were barred, on account of race, from invoking the protection of California's statutes; and, as a result, they were unable to lease residential property. This Court concluded that the state constitutional provision was a denial of equal protection. The Court agreed with the California Supreme Court that the amendment operated to insinuate the State into the decision to discriminate by encouraging that practice. The Court noted the \"immediate design and intent\" of the amendment was to \"establis[h] a purported constitutional right to privately discriminate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337097\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/369/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337097\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/369/\">\n    at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337097\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/369/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted).

It is this reading of\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   that the Court of Appeals found to be controlling here. And that reading must be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The broad rationale that the Court of Appeals adopted goes beyond the necessary holding and the meaning of the precedents said to support it; and in the instant case neither the formulation of the general rule just set forth nor the precedents cited to authenticate it suffice to invalidate Proposal 2. The expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   has no principled limitation and raises serious questions of compatibility with the Court's settled equal protection jurisprudence. To the extent\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   is read to require the Court to determine and declare which political policies serve the \"interest\" of a group defined in racial terms, that rationale was unnecessary to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   ; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious constitutional concerns. That expansive language does not provide a proper guide for decisions and should not be deemed authoritative or controlling.

It cannot be entertained as a serious proposition that all individuals of the same race think alike. Yet that proposition would be a necessary beginning point were the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation to control, as the Court of Appeals held it did in this case. And if it were deemed necessary to probe how some races define their own interest in political matters, still another beginning point would be to define individuals according to race. But in a society in which those lines are becoming more blurred, the attempt to define race-based categories also raises serious questions of its own. Government action that classifies individuals on the basis\n   of race is inherently suspect and carries the danger of perpetuating the very racial divisions the polity seeks to transcend. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Ho v. San Francisco Unified School Dist.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358947\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/854/#p858\">\n    147 F.3d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858 (C.A.9 1998) (school district delineating 13 racial categories for purposes of racial balancing). Were courts to embark upon this venture not only would it be undertaken with no clear legal standards or accepted sources to guide judicial decision but also it would result in, or at least impose a high risk of, inquiries and categories dependent upon demeaning stereotypes, classifications of questionable constitutionality on their own terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even assuming these initial steps could be taken in a manner consistent with a sound analytic and judicial framework, the court would next be required to determine the policy realms in which certain groups-groups defined by race-have a political interest. That undertaking, again without guidance from any accepted legal standards, would risk, in turn, the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose certain policies to cast the debate in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Thus could racial antagonisms and conflict tend to arise in the context of judicial decisions as courts undertook to announce what particular issues of public policy should be classified as advantageous to some group defined by race. This risk is inherent in adopting the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There would be no apparent limiting standards defining what public policies should be included in what\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   called policies that \"inur[e] primarily to the benefit of the minority\" and that \"minorities ... consider\" to be \" 'in their interest.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n    458 U.S., at 472, 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those who seek to represent the interests of particular racial groups could attempt to advance those aims by demanding an equal protection ruling that any number of matters be foreclosed from voter review or participation. In a nation in which governmental policies are wide ranging, those who seek to limit voter participation might be tempted, were this Court to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation, to urge that a group they choose to define by race or racial stereotypes are advantaged or disadvantaged by any number of laws or decisions. Tax policy, housing subsidies, wage regulations, and even the naming of public schools, highways, and monuments are just a few examples of what could become a list of subjects that some organizations could insist should be beyond the power of voters to decide, or beyond the power of a legislature to decide when enacting limits on the power of local authorities or other governmental entities to address certain subjects. Racial division would be validated, not discouraged, were the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation, and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this case, to remain in force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Perhaps, when enacting policies as an exercise of democratic self-government, voters will determine that race-based preferences should be adopted. The constitutional validity of some of those choices regarding racial preferences is not at issue here. The holding in the instant case is simply that the courts may not disempower the voters from choosing which path to follow. In the realm of policy discussions the regular give-and-take of debate ought to be a context in which rancor or discord based on race are avoided, not invited. And if these factors are to be interjected, surely it ought not to be at the invitation or insistence of the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   One response to these concerns may be that objections to the larger consequences of the\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   formulation need not be confronted in this case, for here race was an undoubted subject of the ballot issue. But a number of problems raised by\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   , such as racial definitions, still apply. And this principal flaw in the ruling of the Court of Appeals does remain: Here there was no infliction of a specific injury of the kind at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mulkey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   and in the history of the Seattle schools. Here there is no precedent for extending these cases to restrict the right of Michigan voters to determine that race-based preferences granted by Michigan governmental entities should be ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It should also be noted that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case of necessity calls into question other long-settled rulings on similar state policies. The California Supreme Court has held that a California constitutional amendment prohibiting racial preferences in public contracting does not violate the rule set down by\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Coral Constr., Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050657\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/50/315/\">\n    50 Cal.4th 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20279\">\n    113 Cal.Rptr.3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=235%20P.3d%20947\">\n    235 P.3d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the same amendment, which also barred racial preferences in public education, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    Wilson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302371\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/692/\">\n    122 F.3d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). If the Court were to affirm the essential rationale of the Court of Appeals in the instant case, those holdings would be invalidated, or at least would be put in serious question. The Court, by affirming the judgment now before it, in essence would announce a finding that the past 15 years of state public debate on this issue have been improper. And were the argument made that\n   <em>\n    Coral\n   </em>\n   might still stand because it involved racial preferences in public contracting while this case concerns racial preferences in university admissions, the implication would be that the constitutionality of laws forbidding racial preferences depends on the policy interest at stake, the concern that, as already explained, the voters deem it wise to avoid because of its divisive potential. The instant case presents the question involved in\n   <em>\n    Coral\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   but not involved in\n   <em>\n    Mulkey,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Seattle\n   </em>\n   . That question is not how to address or prevent injury caused on account of race but whether voters may determine whether a policy of race-based preferences should be continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding \u00a7 26 to their State Constitution, the Michigan voters exercised their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power.

Yet freedom does not stop with individual rights. Our constitutional system embraces, too, the right of citizens to debate so they can learn and decide and then, through the political process, act in concert to try to shape the\n   course of their own times and the course of a nation that must strive always to make freedom ever greater and more secure. Here Michigan voters acted in concert and statewide to seek consensus and adopt a policy on a difficult subject against a historical background of race in America that has been a source of tragedy and persisting injustice. That history demands that we continue to learn, to listen, and to remain open to new approaches if we are to aspire always to a constitutional order in which all persons are treated with fairness and equal dignity. Were the Court to rule that the question addressed by Michigan voters is too sensitive or complex to be within the grasp of the electorate; or that the policies at issue remain too delicate to be resolved save by university officials or faculties, acting at some remove from immediate public scrutiny and control; or that these matters are so arcane that the electorate's power must be limited because the people cannot prudently exercise that power even after a full debate, that holding would be an unprecedented restriction on the exercise of a fundamental right held not just by one person but by all in common. It is the right to speak and debate and learn and then, as a matter of political will, to act through a lawful electoral process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The respondents in this case insist that a difficult question of public policy must be taken from the reach of the voters, and thus removed from the realm of public discussion, dialogue, and debate in an election campaign. Quite in addition to the serious First Amendment implications of that position with respect to any particular election, it is inconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning democracy. One of those premises is that a democracy has the capacity-and the duty-to learn from its past mistakes; to discover and confront persisting biases; and by respectful, rationale deliberation to rise above those flaws and injustices. That process is impeded, not advanced, by court decrees based on the proposition that the public cannot have the requisite repose to discuss certain issues. It is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds. The process of public discourse and political debate should not be foreclosed even if there is a risk that during a public campaign there will be those, on both sides, who seek to use racial division and discord to their own political advantage. An informed public can, and must, rise above this. The idea of democracy is that it can, and must, mature. Freedom embraces the right, indeed the duty, to engage in a rational, civic discourse in order to determine how best to form a consensus to shape the destiny of the Nation and its people. These First Amendment dynamics would be disserved if this Court were to say that the question here at issue is beyond the capacity of the voters to debate and then to determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   These precepts are not inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted on racial minorities by the encouragement or command of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires redress by the courts.

Those cases were ones in which the political restriction in question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used, to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race. What is at stake here is not whether injury will be inflicted but whether government can be instructed not to follow a course that entails, first, the definition of racial categories and, second, the grant of favored status to persons in some racial categories and not others. The electorate's instruction to governmental entities not to embark upon the course of race-defined and race-based preferences was adopted, we must assume, because the voters deemed a preference system to be unwise, on account of what voters may deem its latent potential to become itself a source of the very resentments and hostilities based on race that this Nation seeks to put behind it. Whether those adverse results would follow is, and should be, the subject of debate. Voters might likewise consider, after debate and reflection, that programs designed to increase diversity-consistent with the Constitution-are a necessary part of progress to transcend the stigma of past racism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved.

Although school boards in Washington retained authority over\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    student-assignment issues and over most matters of educational policy generally, under Initiative 350, minorities favoring race-based busing would have to \"surmount a considerably higher hurdle\" than the mere petitioning of a local assembly: They \"now must seek relief from the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate,\" a \"different level of government.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n      Ibid\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The relentless logic of\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    would point to a similar conclusion in this case. In those cases, one level of government exercised borrowed authority over an apparently \"racial issue,\" until a higher level of government called the loan. So too here. In those cases, we deemed the revocation an equal-protection violation\n    <em>\n     regardless\n    </em>\n    of whether it facially classified according to race or reflected an invidious purpose to discriminate. Here, the Court of Appeals did the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The plurality sees it differently.

Maybe, but the\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    Court neither found that to be so nor considered it relevant, bypassing the question of intent entirely, satisfied that its newly minted political-process theory sufficed to invalidate the charter amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    As for\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    , what was\n    <em>\n     really\n    </em>\n    going on, according to the plurality, was that Initiative 350 had the consequence (if not the purpose) of preserving the harms effected by prior\n    <em>\n     de jure\n    </em>\n    segregation. Thus, \"the political restriction in question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used, to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1638. That conclusion is derived not from the opinion but from recently discovered evidence that the city of Seattle had been a cause of its schools' racial imbalance all along: \"Although there had been no judicial finding of\n    <em>\n     de jure\n    </em>\n    segregation with respect to Seattle's school district, it appears as though school segregation in the district in the 1940's and 1950's may have been the partial result of school board policies.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1633.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    That the district's effort to end racial imbalance had been stymied by Initiative 350 meant that the people, by passing it, somehow had become complicit in Seattle's equal-protection-denying status quo, whether they knew it or not. Hence, there was in\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    a government-furthered \"infliction of a specific\"-and, presumably, constitutional-\"injury.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1635 - 1636.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Once again this describes what our opinion in\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    might have been, but assuredly not what it was.

Nor did it anywhere state that the current racial imbalance was the (judicially remediable) effect of prior\n    <em>\n     de jure\n    </em>\n    segregation. Absence of\n    <em>\n     de jure\n    </em>\n    segregation or the effects of\n    <em>\n     de jure\n    </em>\n    segregation was a necessary premise of the\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    opinion.

If the dissent thinks that worth considering today, it should explain why the election of a university's governing board is a \"political process which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation,\" but Michigan voters' ability to amend their Constitution is not. It seems to me quite the opposite. Amending the Constitution requires the approval of only \"a majority of the electors voting on the question.\" Mich. Const., Art. XII, \u00a7 2. By contrast, voting in a favorable board (each of which has eight members) at the three major public universities requires electing by majority vote at least 15 different candidates, several of whom would be running during different election cycles.

If indeed the Fourteenth Amendment forbids States to \"place effective decisionmaking authority over\" racial issues at \"different level[s] of government,\" then it must be true that the Amendment's ratification in 1868 worked a partial ossification of each State's governing structure, rendering basically irrevocable the power of any subordinate state official who, the day\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    the Fourteenth Amendment's passage, happened to enjoy legislatively conferred authority over a \"racial issue.\" Under the Fourteenth Amendment, that subordinate entity (suppose it is a city council) could itself take action on the issue, action either favorable or unfavorable to minorities. It could even reverse itself later. What it could not do, however, is redelegate its power to an even lower level of state government (such as a city-council committee) without forfeiting it, since the necessary effect of wresting it back would be to put an additional obstacle in the path of minorities. Likewise, no entity or official higher up the state chain (\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    a county board) could exercise authority over the issue. Nor, even, could the state legislature, or the people by constitutional amendment, revoke the legislative conferral of power to the subordinate, whether the city council, its subcommittee, or the county board.\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    's logic would create affirmative-action safe havens wherever subordinate officials in public universities (1) traditionally have enjoyed \"effective decisionmaking authority\" over admissions policy but (2) have not yet used that authority to prohibit race-conscious admissions decisions. The mere existence of a subordinate's discretion over the matter would work a kind of reverse pre-emption. It is \"a strange notion-alien to our system-that local governmental bodies can forever pre-empt the ability of a State-the sovereign power-to address a matter of compelling concern to the State.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     458 U.S., at 495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 3187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Powell, J., dissenting).

Although the boards unquestionably retained the\n    <em>\n     power\n    </em>\n    to set policy regarding race-conscious admissions, see\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 1664 - 1667 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting), in\n    <em>\n     fact\n    </em>\n    faculty members and administrators set the race-conscious admissions policies in question. (It is often true that elected bodies-including, for example, school boards, city councils, and state legislatures-have the power to enact policies, but in fact delegate that power to administrators.) Although at limited times the university boards were advised of the content of their race-conscious admissions policies, see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709205\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/466/\">\n     701 F.3d 466\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 481-482 (C.A.6 2012), to my knowledge no board voted to accept or reject any of those policies. Thus, unelected faculty members and administrators, not voters or their elected representatives, adopted the race-conscious admissions programs affected by Michigan's constitutional amendment. The amendment took decisionmaking authority away from these unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Why does this matter? For one thing, considered conceptually, the doctrine set forth in\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    does not easily fit this case. In those cases minorities had participated in the political process and\n    they had won. The majority's subsequent reordering of the political process repealed the minority's successes and made it more difficult for the minority to succeed in the future. The majority thereby diminished the minority's ability to participate meaningfully in the electoral process. But one cannot as easily characterize the movement of the decisionmaking mechanism at issue here-from an administrative process to an electoral process-as diminishing the minority's ability to participate meaningfully in the\n    <em>\n     political\n    </em>\n    process. There is no prior electoral process in which the minority participated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    For another thing, to extend the holding of\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    to reach situations in which decisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative body to a political one would pose significant difficulties. The administrative process encompasses vast numbers of decisionmakers answering numerous policy questions in hosts of different fields. See\n    <em>\n     Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     561 U.S. 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     130 S.Ct. 3138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 3174,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644210,12455286\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/477/\">\n     177 L.Ed.2d 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010) (BREYER, J., dissenting). Administrative bodies modify programs in detail, and decisionmaking authority within the administrative process frequently moves around-due to amendments to statutes, new administrative rules, and evolving agency practice. It is thus particularly difficult in this context for judges to determine when a change in the locus of decisionmaking authority places a comparative structural burden on a racial minority. And to apply\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    to the administrative process would, by tending to hinder change, risk discouraging experimentation, interfering with efforts to see when and how race-conscious policies work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Finally, the principle that underlies\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    runs up against a competing principle, discussed above. This competing principle favors decisionmaking though the democratic process. Just as this principle strongly supports the right of the people, or their elected representatives, to adopt race-conscious policies for reasons of inclusion, so must it give them the right to vote not to do so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    As I have said, my discussion here is limited to circumstances in which decisionmaking is moved from an unelected administrative body to a politically responsive one, and in which the targeted race-conscious admissions programs consider race solely in order to obtain the educational benefits of a diverse student body. We need now decide no more than whether the Federal Constitution permits Michigan to apply its constitutional amendment in those circumstances. I would hold that it does. Therefore, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    <strong>\n     Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    We are fortunate to live in a democratic society. But without checks, democratically approved legislation can oppress minority groups. For that reason, our Constitution places limits on what a majority of the people may do. This case implicates one such limit: the guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Although that guarantee is traditionally understood to prohibit intentional discrimination under existing laws, equal protection does not end there. Another fundamental strand of our equal protection jurisprudence focuses on process, securing to all citizens the right to participate meaningfully and equally in self-government. That right is the bedrock of our democracy, for it preserves all other rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Yet to know the history of our Nation is to understand its long and lamentable record of stymieing the right of racial minorities to participate in the political process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    At first, the majority acted with an open, invidious purpose. Notwithstanding the command of the Fifteenth Amendment, certain States shut racial minorities out of the political process altogether by withholding the right to vote. This Court intervened to preserve that right. The majority tried again, replacing outright bans on voting with literacy tests, good character requirements, poll taxes, and gerrymandering. The Court was not fooled; it invalidated those measures, too. The majority persisted. This time, although it allowed the minority access to the political process, the majority changed the ground rules of the process so as to make it more difficult for the minority, and the minority alone, to obtain policies designed to foster racial integration. Although these political restructurings may not have been discriminatory in purpose, the Court reaffirmed the right of minority members of our society to participate meaningfully and equally in the political process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    This case involves this last chapter of discrimination: A majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic rules of the political process in that State in a manner that uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fr13\" name=\"fr13\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Prior to the enactment of the constitutional initiative at issue here, all of the admissions policies of Michigan's public colleges and universities-including race-sensitive admissions policies\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    -were in the hands of each institution's governing board. The members of those boards are nominated by political parties and elected by the citizenry in statewide elections. After over a century of being shut out of Michigan's institutions of higher education, racial minorities in Michigan had succeeded in persuading the elected board representatives to adopt admissions policies that took into account the benefits of racial diversity. And this Court twice blessed such efforts-first in\n    <em>\n     Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p289\">\n     438 U.S. 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p289\">\n     98 S.Ct. 2733\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p289\">\n     57 L.Ed.2d 750\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1978), and again in\n    <em>\n     Grutter v.

Those voters were of course free to pursue this end in any number of ways. For example, they could have persuaded existing board members to change their minds through individual or grassroots lobbying efforts, or through general public awareness campaigns. Or they could have mobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out of office, replacing them with members who would share their desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies. When this Court holds that the Constitution permits a particular policy, nothing prevents a majority of a State's voters from choosing not to adopt that policy. Our system of government encourages-and indeed, depends on-that type of democratic action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    But instead, the majority of Michigan voters changed the rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the existing political process in Michigan in a manner that burdened racial minorities. They did so in the 2006 election by amending the Michigan Constitution to enact Art. I, \u00a7 26, which provides in relevant part that Michigan's public universities \"shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    As a result of \u00a7 26, there are now two very different processes through which a Michigan citizen is permitted to influence the admissions policies of the State's universities: one for persons interested in race-sensitive admissions policies and one for everyone else. A citizen who is a University of Michigan alumnus, for instance, can advocate for an admissions policy that considers an applicant's legacy status by meeting individually with members of the Board of Regents to convince them of her views, by joining with other legacy parents to lobby the Board, or by voting for and supporting Board candidates who share her position. The same options are available to a citizen who wants the Board to adopt admissions policies that consider athleticism, geography, area of study, and so on. The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions policy that considers race in an individualized manner when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not adequate to achieve diversity. For that policy alone, the citizens of Michigan must undertake the daunting task of amending the State Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Our precedents do not permit political restructurings that create one process for racial minorities and a separate, less burdensome process for everyone else. This Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not tolerate \"a political structure that treats all individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.\"\n    <em>\n     Washington v.

Such restructuring, the Court explained, \"is no more permissible than denying [the minority] the [right to] vote, on an equal basis with others.\"\n    <em>\n     Hunter v. Erickson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n     393 U.S. 385\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 391,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"368\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n     89 S.Ct. 557\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11316380\" index=\"369\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/385/\">\n     21 L.Ed.2d 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1969). In those cases-\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    -the Court recognized what is now known as the \"political-process doctrine\": When the majority reconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority, that alteration triggers strict judicial scrutiny.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Today, disregarding\n    <em>\n     stare decisis,\n    </em>\n    a majority of the Court effectively discards those precedents. The plurality does so, it tells us, because the freedom actually secured by the Constitution is the freedom of self-government-because the majority of Michigan citizens \"exercised their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1636\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    It would be \"demeaning to the democratic process,\" the plurality concludes, to disturb that decision in any way.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1637 - 1638. This logic embraces majority rule without an important constitutional limit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The plurality's decision fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the injustice worked by \u00a7 26. This case is not, as the plurality imagines, about \"who may resolve\" the debate over the use of race in higher education admissions.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1638. I agree wholeheartedly that nothing vests the resolution of that debate exclusively in the courts or requires that we remove it from the reach of the electorate. Rather, this case is about\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    the debate over the use of race-sensitive admissions policies may be resolved, contra,\n    <em>\n     ibid.\n    </em>\n    -that is, it must be resolved in constitutionally permissible ways. While our Constitution does not guarantee minority groups victory in the political process, it does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to that process. It guarantees that the majority may not win by stacking the political process against minority groups permanently, forcing the minority alone to surmount unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals-here, educational diversity that cannot reasonably be accomplished through race-neutral measures. Today, by permitting a majority of the voters in Michigan to do what our Constitution forbids, the Court ends the debate over race-sensitive admissions policies in Michigan in a manner that contravenes constitutional protections long recognized in our precedents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Like the plurality, I have faith that our citizenry will continue to learn from this Nation's regrettable history; that it will strive to move beyond those injustices towards a future of equality. And I, too, believe in the importance of public discourse on matters of public policy. But I part ways with the plurality when it suggests that judicial intervention in this case \"impede[s]\" rather than \"advance[s]\" the democratic process and the ultimate hope of equality.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1637. I firmly believe that our role as judges includes policing the process of self-government and stepping in when necessary to secure the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Because I would do so here, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    For much of its history, our Nation has denied to many of its citizens the right to participate meaningfully and equally in its politics. This is a history we strive to put behind us. But it is a history that still informs the society we live in, and so it is one we must address with candor. Because the political-process doctrine is best understood against the backdrop of this history, I will briefly trace its course.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, promised to racial minorities the right to vote. But many States ignored this promise. In addition to outright tactics of fraud, intimidation, and violence, there are countless examples of States categorically denying to racial minorities access to the political process. Consider Texas; there, a 1923 statute prevented racial minorities from participating in primary elections. After this Court declared that statute unconstitutional,\n    <em>\n     Nixon v.

The effect of \u00a7 26 is that a white graduate of a public Michigan university who wishes to pass his historical privilege on to his children may freely lobby the board of that university in favor of an expanded legacy admissions policy, whereas a black Michigander who was denied the opportunity to attend that very university cannot lobby the board in favor of a policy that might give his children a chance that he never had and that they might never have absent that policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Such reordering of the political process contravenes\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    .\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fr19\" name=\"fr19\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    See\n    <em>\n     Seattle,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"473\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     458 U.S., at 467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 3187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (the Equal Protection Clause prohibits \" 'a political structure that treats all individuals as equals,' yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation\" (citation omitted)).

According to the plurality, the\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    Courts were not concerned with efforts to reconfigure the political process to the detriment of racial minorities; rather, those cases invalidated governmental actions merely because they reflected an invidious purpose to discriminate. This is not a tenable reading of those cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The plurality identifies \"invidious discrimination\" as the \"necessary result\" of the restructuring in\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1632 - 1633.

Under the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis,\n    </em>\n    we usually stand by our decisions, even if we disagree with them, because people rely on what we say, and they believe they can take us at our word.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    And what now of the political-process doctrine? After the plurality's revision of\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    , it is unclear what is left. The plurality certainly does not tell us. On this point, and this point only, I agree with Justice SCALIA that the plurality has rewritten those precedents beyond recognition. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1641 - 1643 (opinion concurring in judgment).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    Justice BREYER concludes that\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    do not apply. Section 26, he reasons, did not move the relevant decisionmaking authority from one political level to another; rather, it removed that authority from \"unelected actors and placed it in the hands of the voters.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1650 (opinion concurring in judgment). He bases this conclusion on the premise that Michigan's elected boards \"delegated admissions-related decisionmaking authority to unelected university\n    faculty members and administrators.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But this premise is simply incorrect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    For one thing, it is undeniable that prior to \u00a7 26, board candidates often pledged to end or carry on the use of race-sensitive admissions policies at Michigan's public universities. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1660 - 1661. Surely those were not empty promises. Indeed, the issue of race-sensitive admissions policies often dominated board elections. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    George, Detroit Free Press, at 2B (observing that \"[t]he race for the University of Michigan Board of Regents could determine ... the future of [the University's] affirmative action policies\"); Kosseff, UM Policy May Hang On Election, Crain's Detroit Business, Sept. 18, 2000, p. 1 (noting that an upcoming election could determine whether the University would continue to defend its affirmative action policies); University of Michigan's Admissions Policy Still an Issue for Regents' Election, Black Issues in Higher Education, Oct. 21, 2004, p. 17 (commenting that although \"the Supreme Court struck down the University of Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy as too formulaic,\" the issue \"remains an important [one] to several people running\" in an upcoming election for the Board of Regents).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Moreover, a careful examination of the boards and their governing structure reveals that they remain actively involved in setting admissions policies and procedures. Take Wayne State University, for example. Its Board of Governors has enacted university statutes that govern the day-to-day running of the institution. See Wayne State Univ. Stat., online at http:// bog. wayne. edu/ code. A number of those statutes establish general admissions procedures, see \u00a7 2.34.09 (establishing undergraduate admissions procedures); \u00a7 2.34.12 (establishing graduate admissions procedures), and some set out more specific instructions for university officials, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2.34.09.030 (\"Admissions decisions will be based on a full evaluation of each student's academic record, and on empirical data reflecting the characteristics of students who have successfully graduated from [the university] within the four years prior to the year in which the student applies\"); \u00a7\u00a7 2.34.12.080, 2.34.12.090 (setting the requisite grade point average for graduate applicants).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The Board of Governors does give primary responsibility over day-to-day admissions matters to the university's President. \u00a7 2.34.09.080. But the President is \"elected by and answerable to the Board.\" Brief for Respondent Board of Governors of Wayne State University et al. 15. And while university officials and faculty members \"serv[e] an important advisory role in recommending educational policy,\"\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 14, the Board alone ultimately controls educational policy and decides whether to adopt (or reject) program-specific admissions recommendations. For example, the Board has voted on recommendations \"to revise guidelines for establishment of honors curricula, including admissions criteria\"; \"to modify the honor point criteria for graduate admission\"; and \"to modify the maximum number of transfer credits that the university would allow in certain cases where articulation agreements rendered modification appropriate.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 17; see also\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 18-20 (providing examples of the Board's \"review[ing] and pass[ing] upon admissions requirements in the course of voting on broader issues, such as the implementation of new academic programs\"). The Board also \"engages in robust and regular review of administrative actions involving admissions policy and related matters.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    Other public universities more clearly entrust admissions policy to university officials. The Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, for example, gives primary\n    responsibility for admissions to the Associate Vice Provost, Executive Director of Undergraduate Admissions, and Directors of Admissions. Bylaws \u00a7 8.01, online at http:// www. regents. umich. edu/ bylaws. And the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University relies on the President to make recommendations regarding admissions policies. Bylaws, Art. 8, online at http:// www. trustees. msu. edu/ bylaws. But the bylaws of the Board of Regents and the Board of Trustees \"make clear that all university operations remain subject to their control.\" Brief for Respondents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University et al. 13-14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    The boards retain ultimate authority to adopt or reject admissions policies in at least three ways. First, they routinely meet with university officials to review admissions policies, including race-sensitive admissions policies. For example, shortly after this Court's decisions in\n    <em>\n     Gratz v. Bollinger,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897864\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/244/#p270\">\n     539 U.S. 244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897864\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/244/#p270\">\n     123 S.Ct. 2411\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897864\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/244/#p270\">\n     156 L.Ed.2d 257\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2003), and\n    <em>\n     Grutter,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p343\">\n     539 U.S., at 306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p343\">\n     123 S.Ct. 2325\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the President of the University of Michigan appeared before the University's Board of Regents to discuss the impact of those decisions on the University. See Proceedings 2003-2004, pp. 10-12 (July 2003), online at http:// name. umdl. umich. edu/ ACW 7513. 2003. 001. Six members of the Board voiced strong support for the University's use of race as a factor in admissions.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 11-12. In June 2004, the President again appeared before the Board to discuss changes to undergraduate admissions policies.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 301 (June 2004). And in March 2007, the University's Provost appeared before the Board of Regents to present strategies to increase diversity in light of the passage of Proposal 2. Proceedings 2006-2007, pp. 264-265 (Mar. 2007), online at http:// name. umdl. umich. edu/ ACW 7513. 2006. 001.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    Second, the boards may enact bylaws with respect to specific admissions policies and may alter any admissions policies set by university officials. The Board of Regents may amend any bylaw \"at any regular meeting of the board, or at any special meeting, provided notice is given to each regent one week in advance.\" Bylaws \u00a7 14.03. And Michigan State University's Board of Trustees may, \"[u]pon the recommendation of the President[,] ... determine and establish the qualifications of students for admissions at any level.\" Bylaws, Art. 8. The boards may also permanently remove certain admissions decisions from university officials.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fr22\" name=\"fr22\">\n      10\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    This authority is not merely theoretical. Between 2008 and 2012, the University of Michigan's Board of Regents \"revised more than two dozen of its bylaws, two of which fall within Chapter VIII, the section regulating admissions practices.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    Finally, the boards may appoint university officials who share their admissions goals, and they may remove those officials if the officials' goals diverge from those of the boards. The University of Michigan's Board of Regents \"directly appoints [the University's] Associate Vice Provost and Executive Director of Undergraduate Admissions,\" and Michigan State University's Board of Trustees elects that institution's President. Brief for Respondents Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of\n    Trustees of Michigan State University et al. 14.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    The salient point is this: Although the elected and politically accountable boards may well entrust university officials with certain day-to-day admissions responsibilities, they often weigh in on admissions policies themselves and, at all times, they retain complete supervisory authority over university officials and over all admissions decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    There is no question, then, that the elected boards in Michigan had the power to eliminate or adopt race-sensitive admissions policies prior to \u00a7 26. There is also no question that \u00a7 26 worked an impermissible reordering of the political process; it removed that power from the elected boards and placed it instead at a higher level of the political process in Michigan. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1660 - 1663. This case is no different from\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    in that respect. Just as in\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    , minorities in Michigan \"participated in the political process and won.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1650 - 1651 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). And just as in\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    , \"the majority's subsequent reordering of the political process repealed the minority's successes and made it more difficult for the minority to succeed in the future,\" thereby \"diminish[ing] the minority's ability to participate meaningfully in the electoral process.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    There is therefore no need to consider \"extend[ing] the holding of\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    to reach situations in which decisionmaking authority is moved from an administrative body to a political one,\"\n    <em>\n     ibid\n    </em>\n    .

The political-process doctrine, grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment, is a central check on majority rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    The Fourteenth Amendment instructs that all who act for the government may not \"deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" We often think of equal protection as a guarantee that the government will apply the law in an equal fashion-that it will not intentionally discriminate against minority groups. But equal protection of the laws means more than that; it also secures the right of all citizens to participate meaningfully and equally in the process through which laws are created.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Few rights are as fundamental as the right to participate meaningfully and equally in the process of government.

That right is the bedrock of our democracy, recognized from its very inception. See J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 87 (1980) (the Constitution \"is overwhelmingly concerned, on the one hand, with procedural fairness in the resolution of individual disputes,\" and on the other, \"with ensuring broad participation in the processes and distributions of government\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    This should come as no surprise.

It is the means by which citizens may both obtain desirable legislation and repeal undesirable legislation. Of course, we do not expect minority members of our society to obtain every single result they seek through the political process-not, at least, when their views conflict with those of the majority. The minority plainly does not have a right to prevail over majority groups in any given political contest. But the minority does have a right to play by the same rules as the majority. It is this right that\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    so boldly vindicated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    This right was hardly novel at the time of\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    .

Citing cases involving restrictions on the right to vote, restraints on the dissemination of information, interferences with political organizations, and prohibition of peaceable assembly, the Court recognized that \"legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation\" could be worthy of \"more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of legislation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10798\" index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/144/#p152\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10798\" index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/144/#p152\">\n     at 152, n. 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10798\" index=\"501\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/144/#p152\">\n     58 S.Ct. 778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also Ely,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 76 (explaining that \"[p]aragraph two [of\n    <em>\n     Carolene Products\n    </em>\n    footnote 4] suggests that it is an appropriate function of the Court to keep the machinery of democratic government running as it should, to make sure the channels of political participation and communication are kept open\").

These values are central tenets of our equal protection jurisprudence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    Our cases recognize at least three features of the right to meaningful participation in the political process. Two of them, thankfully, are uncontroversial. First, every eligible citizen has a right to vote. See\n    <em>\n     Shaw v. Reno,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355840\" index=\"507\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/630/#p647\">\n     509 U.S. 630\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 639,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355840\" index=\"508\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/630/#p647\">\n     113 S.Ct. 2816\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355840\" index=\"509\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/630/#p647\">\n     125 L.Ed.2d 511\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993). This, woefully, has not always been the case. But it is a right no one would take issue with today. Second, the majority may not make it more difficult for\n    the minority to exercise the right to vote. This, too, is widely accepted. After all, the Court has invalidated grandfather clauses, good character requirements, poll taxes, and gerrymandering provisions.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fr23\" name=\"fr23\">\n      11\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    The third feature, the one the plurality dismantles today, is that a majority may not reconfigure the existing political process in a manner that creates a two-tiered system of political change, subjecting laws designed to protect or benefit discrete and insular minorities to a more burdensome political process than all other laws. This is the political-process doctrine of\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    My colleagues would stop at the second. The plurality embraces the freedom of \"self-government\" without limits. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1645 - 1646. And Justice SCALIA values a \"near-limitless\" notion of state sovereignty. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1645 - 1646 (opinion concurring in judgment). The wrong sought to be corrected by the political-process doctrine, they say, is not one that should concern us and is in any event beyond the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment. As they see it, the Court's role in protecting the political process ends once we have removed certain barriers to the minority's participation in that process. Then, they say, we must sit back and let the majority rule without the key constitutional limit recognized in\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    That view drains the Fourteenth Amendment of one of its core teachings. Contrary to today's decision, protecting the right to meaningful participation in the political process must mean more than simply removing barriers to participation. It must mean vigilantly policing the political process to ensure that the majority does not use other methods to prevent minority groups from partaking in that process on equal footing. Why? For the same reason we guard the right of every citizen to vote. If \"[e]fforts to reduce the impact of minority votes, in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the ballot,\" were \" 'second-generation barriers' \" to minority voting,\n    <em>\n     Shelby County v. Holder,\n    </em>\n    570 U.S. ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698477\" index=\"510\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/529/#p2634\">\n     133 S.Ct. 2612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2634,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698477\" index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/529/#p2634\">\n     186 L.Ed.2d 651\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting), efforts to reconfigure the political process in ways that uniquely disadvantage minority groups who have already long been disadvantaged are third-generation barriers. For as the Court recognized in\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    , \"minorities are no less powerless with the vote than without it when a racial criterion is used to assign governmental power in such a way as to exclude particular racial groups 'from effective participation in the political proces[s].' \"\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fr24\" name=\"fr24\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    458 U.S., at 486,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"512\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 3187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    To accept the first two features of the right to meaningful participation in the political process, while renouncing the third, paves the way for the majority to do what it has done time and again throughout our Nation's history: afford the minority the opportunity to participate, yet manipulate the ground rules so as to ensure the minority's defeat. This is entirely at odds with our idea of equality under the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    To reiterate, none of this is to say that the political-process doctrine prohibits the exercise of democratic self-government. Nothing prevents a majority of citizens from pursuing or obtaining its preferred outcome in a political contest. Here, for instance, I agree with the plurality that Michiganders who were unhappy with\n    <em>\n     Grutter\n    </em>\n    were free to pursue an end to race-sensitive admissions policies in their State. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1647 - 1648. They were free to elect governing boards that opposed race-sensitive admissions policies or, through public discourse and dialogue, to lobby the existing boards toward that end. They were also free to remove from the boards the authority to make any decisions with respect to admissions policies, as opposed to only decisions concerning race-sensitive admissions policies. But what the majority could not do, consistent with the Constitution, is change the ground rules of the political process in a manner that makes it more difficult for racial minorities alone to achieve their goals. In doing so, the majority effectively rigs the contest to guarantee a particular outcome. That is the very wrong the political-process doctrine seeks to remedy. The doctrine \"hews to the unremarkable notion that when two competitors are running a race, one may not require the other to run twice as far or to scale obstacles not present in the first runner's course.\"\n    <em>\n     BAMN v.

This criticism ignores the obvious: Discrimination against an individual occurs because of that individual's membership in a particular group.

But the doctrine is inapplicable to the majority. The minority cannot achieve such restructurings against the majority, for the majority is, well, the majority. As the\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    Court explained, \" '[t]he majority needs no protection against discriminat[ory restructurings], and if it did, a referendum, [for instance], might be bothersome but no more than that.' \" 458 U.S., at 468,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 3187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Stated differently, the doctrine protects only the minority because it implicates a problem that affects only the minority. Nothing in my opinion suggests, as Justice SCALIA says, that under the political-process doctrine, \"the Constitution prohibits discrimination against minority groups, but not against majority groups.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1644, n. 7. If the minority somehow managed to effectuate a political restructuring that burdened only the majority, we could decide then whether to apply the political-process doctrine to safeguard the political right of the majority. But such a restructuring is not before us, and I cannot fathom how it could be achieved.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Justice SCALIA next invokes state sovereignty, arguing that \"we have emphasized the near-limitless sovereignty of each State to design its governing structure as it sees fit.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1646 (opinion concurring in judgment). But state sovereignty is not absolute; it is subject to constitutional limits. The Court surely did not offend state sovereignty by barring States from changing their voting procedures to exclude racial minorities. So why does the political-process doctrine offend state sovereignty? The doctrine takes nothing away from state sovereignty that the Equal Protection Clause does not require. All it says is that a State may not reconfigure its existing political processes in a manner that establishes a distinct and more burdensome process for minority members of our society alone to obtain legislation in their interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    More broadly, Justice SCALIA is troubled that the political-process doctrine would create supposed \"affirmative-action safe havens\" in places where the ordinary political process has thus far produced race-sensitive admissions policies.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1645 - 1647. It would not. As explained previously, the voters in Michigan who opposed race-sensitive admissions policies had any number of options available to them to challenge those policies. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 1669 - 1670. And in States where decisions regarding race-sensitive admissions policies are not subject to the political process in the first place, voters are entirely free to eliminate such policies via a constitutional amendment because that action would not reallocate power in the manner condemned in\n    <em>\n     Hunter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    (and, of course, present here). The\n    <em>\n     Seattle\n    </em>\n    Court recognized this careful balance\n    between state sovereignty and constitutional protections:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    \"[W]e do not undervalue the magnitude of the State's interest in its system of education.

He would acknowledge, however, that an act that draws racial distinctions or makes racial classifications triggers strict scrutiny regardless of whether discriminatory intent is shown.

That should settle the matter: Section 26 draws a racial distinction.

In any event, it is clear that the constitutional amendment in this case has a racial focus; it is facially race-based and, by operation of law, disadvantages only minorities.

Before the advent of race-sensitive admissions policies, those institutions, like others\n    around the country, were essentially segregated. In 1868, two black students were admitted to the University of Michigan, the first of their race. See Expert Report of James D. Anderson 4, in\n    <em>\n     Gratz v. Bollinger,\n    </em>\n    No. 97-75231 (E.D.Mich.). In 1935, over six decades later, there were still only 35 black students at the University.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"597\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p224\">\n      Ibid\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"597\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p224\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    By 1954, this number had risen to slightly below 200.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"598\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p224\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And by 1966, to around 400, among a total student population of roughly 32,500-barely over 1 percent.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564297\" index=\"599\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/200/#p224\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The numbers at the University of Michigan Law School are even more telling. During the 1960's, the Law School produced 9 black graduates among a total of 3,041-less than three-tenths of 1 percent. See App. in\n    <em>\n     Grutter v. Bollinger,\n    </em>\n    O.T. 2002, No. 02-241, p. 204.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    The housing and extracurricular policies at these institutions also perpetuated open segregation. For instance, incoming students were permitted to opt out of rooming with black students. Anderson,\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 7-8. And some fraternities and sororities excluded black students from membership.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 6-7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    In 1966, the Defense Department conducted an investigation into the University's compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and made 25 recommendations for increasing opportunities for minority students.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 9. In 1970, a student group launched a number of protests, including a strike, demanding that the University increase its minority enrollment.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 16-23. The University's Board of Regents responded, adopting a goal of 10 percent black admissions by the fall of 1973.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 23.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    During the 1970's, the University continued to improve its admissions policies,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fr27\" name=\"fr27\">\n      15\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    encouraged by this Court's 1978 decision in\n    <em>\n     Bakke\n    </em>\n    . In that case, the Court told our Nation's colleges and universities that they could consider race in admissions as part of a broader goal to create a diverse student body, in which students of different backgrounds would learn together, and thereby learn to live together. A little more than a decade ago, in\n    <em>\n     Grutter,\n    </em>\n    the Court reaffirmed this understanding.

With good reason. Diversity ensures that the next generation moves beyond the stereotypes, the assumptions, and the superficial perceptions that students coming from less-heterogeneous communities may harbor, consciously or not, about people who do not look like them. Recognizing the need for diversity acknowledges that, \"[j]ust as growing up in a particular region or having particular professional experiences is likely to affect an individual's views, so too is one's own, unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters.\"\n    <em>\n     Grutter,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"612\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p343\">\n     539 U.S., at 333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"613\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p343\">\n     123 S.Ct. 2325\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

They must be free to immerse their students in a multiracial environment that fosters frequent and meaningful interactions with students of other races, and thereby\n    pushes such students to transcend any assumptions they may hold on the basis of skin color. Without race-sensitive admissions policies, this might well be impossible. The statistics I have described make that fact glaringly obvious. We should not turn a blind eye to something we cannot help but see.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-273\">\n    To be clear, I do not mean to suggest that the virtues of adopting race-sensitive admissions policies should inform the legal question before the Court today regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 26. But I cannot ignore the unfortunate outcome of today's decision: Short of amending the State Constitution, a Herculean task, racial minorities in Michigan are deprived of even an opportunity to convince Michigan's public colleges and universities to consider race in their admissions plans when other attempts to achieve racial diversity have proved unworkable, and those institutions are unnecessarily hobbled in their pursuit of a diverse student body.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-274\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-275\">\n    The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat. But neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities. The political-process doctrine polices the channels of change to ensure that the majority, when it wins, does so without rigging the rules of the game to ensure its success. Today, the Court discards that doctrine without good reason.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-276\">\n    In doing so, it permits the decision of a majority of the voters in Michigan to strip Michigan's elected university boards of their authority to make decisions with respect to constitutionally permissible race-sensitive admissions policies, while preserving the boards' plenary authority to make all other educational decisions. \"In a most direct sense, this implicates the judiciary's special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\"\n    <em>\n     Seattle,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"616\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     458 U.S., at 486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636723\" index=\"617\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/457/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 3187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court abdicates that role, permitting the majority to use its numerical advantage to change the rules mid-contest and forever stack the deck against racial minorities in Michigan.

The racial-focus prong has never required a policy to benefit\n     <em>\n      only\n     </em>\n     a minority group. The sentence from which Justice SCALIA appears to quote makes the altogether different point that the political-process doctrine is obviously not implicated in the first place by a restructuring that burdens members of society equally. This is the second prong of the political-process doctrine. See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 1641 - 1642 (explaining that the political-process doctrine is implicated \"[w]hen the majority reconfigures the political process in a manner that burdens only a racial minority\"). The second version-which asks whether a policy \"benefits\n     <em>\n      primarily\n     </em>\n     a racial minority,\"\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1643, n. 4-is the one articulated by the\n     <em>\n      Seattle\n     </em>\n     Court and, as I have explained, see\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 1647 and this page, it is easily met in this case. And the third-whether the policy has \"the incidental effect\" of benefitting racial minorities,\"\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1643, n. 4-is not a test I advance at all.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5.\">\n    <p id=\"p-299\">\n     By stripping the governing boards of the authority to decide whether to adopt race-sensitive admissions policies, the majority removed the decision from bodies well suited to make that decision: boards engaged in the arguments on both sides of a matter, which deliberate and then make and refine \"considered judgment[s]\" about racial diversity and admissions policies, see\n     <em>\n      Grutter,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"659\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p343\">\n      539 U.S., at 387\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"660\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p343\">\n      123 S.Ct. 2325\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6.\">\n    <p id=\"p-300\">\n     In the face of this overwhelming evidence, Justice SCALIA claims that it is actually easier, not harder, for minorities to effectuate change at the constitutional amendment level than at the board level. See\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1644 - 1645 (opinion concurring in judgment) (\"voting in a favorable board (each of which has eight members) at the three major public universities requires electing by majority vote at least 15 different candidates, several of whom would be running during different election cycles\"). This claim minimizes just how difficult it is to amend the State Constitution. See\n     <em>\n      supra,\n     </em>\n     at 1660 - 1662. It is also incorrect in its premise that minorities must elect an entirely new slate of board members in order to effectuate change at the board level. Justice SCALIA overlooks the fact that minorities need not elect any new board members in order to effect change; they may instead seek to persuade existing board members to adopt changes in their interests.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7.\">\n    <p id=\"p-301\">\n     I do not take the position, as Justice SCALIA asserts, that the process of amending the Michigan Constitution is not a part of Michigan's existing political process. See\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1645 - 1647 (opinion concurring in judgment). It clearly is. The problem with \u00a7 26 is not that \"amending Michigan's Constitution is simply not a part of that State's 'existing political process.' \"\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1632 - 1633. It is that \u00a7 26 reconfigured the political process in Michigan such that it is now more difficult for racial minorities, and racial minorities alone, to achieve legislation in their interest. Section 26 elevated the issue of race-sensitive admissions policies, and not any other kinds of admissions policies, to a higher plane of the existing political process in Michigan: that of a constitutional amendment.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8.\">\n    <p id=\"p-302\">\n     It certainly is fair to assume that some voters may have supported the\n     <em>\n      Hunter\n     </em>\n     amendment because of discriminatory animus. But others may have been motivated by their strong beliefs in the freedom of contract or the freedom to alienate property. Similarly, here, although some Michiganders may have voted for \u00a7 26 out of racial animus, some may have been acting on a personal belief, like that of some of my colleagues today, that using race-sensitive admissions policies in higher education is unwise. The presence (or absence) of invidious discrimination has no place in the current analysis. That is the very purpose of the political-process doctrine; it operates irrespective of discriminatory intent, for it protects a process-based right.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9.\">\n    <p id=\"p-303\">\n     The plurality relies on Justice BREYER's dissent in\n     <em>\n      Parents Involved\n     </em>\n     to conclude that \"one permissible reading of the record was that the school board had maintained policies to perpetuate racial segregation in the schools.\"\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 1633.
