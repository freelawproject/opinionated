This case concerns the proper reading of the statute's clarity and precision demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Assigned to respondent Biosig Instruments, Inc., the patent in dispute (the '753 patent) involves a heart-rate monitor used with exercise equipment. Prior heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals) because of the presence of other electrical signals (electromyogram or EMG signals), generated by the user's skeletal muscles, that can impede ECG signal detection. The invention claims to improve on prior art by detecting and processing ECG signals in a way that filters out the EMG interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Claim 1 of the '753 patent, which contains the limitations critical to this dispute, refers to a \"heart rate monitor for use by a user in association with exercise apparatus and/or exercise procedures.\" The claim \"comprise[s],\" among other elements, a cylindrical bar fitted with a display device; \"electronic circuitry including a difference amplifier\"; and, on each half of the cylindrical bar, a \"live\" electrode and a \"common\" electrode \"mounted ... in spaced relationship with each other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Biosig filed this patent infringement suit, alleging that Nautilus, Inc., without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing Biosig's patented technology. The District Court, after conducting a hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent's claims, granted Nautilus' motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claim term \"in spaced relationship with each other\" failed \u00a7 112, \u00b6 2's definiteness requirement. The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded, concluding that a patent claim passes the \u00a7 112, \u00b6 2 threshold so long as the claim is \"amenable to construction,\" and the claim, as construed, is not \"insolubly ambiguous.\" Under that standard, the court determined, the '753 patent survived indefiniteness review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1.

According to the Federal Circuit, a patent claim passes the \u00a7 112, \u00b6 2 threshold so long as the claim is \"amenable to construction,\" and the claim, as construed, is not \"insolubly ambiguous.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n     715 F.3d 891\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 898-899 (2013).

Previous heart-rate monitors, the patent asserts, were often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying each heartbeat (electrocardiograph or ECG signals). The inaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different sort, known as electromyogram or EMG signals, generated by an exerciser's skeletal muscles when, for example, she moves her arm, or grips an exercise monitor with her hand. These EMG signals can \"mask\" ECG signals and thereby impede their detection.

According to Biosig, StairMaster, without ever obtaining a license, sold exercise machines that included Biosig's patented technology, and petitioner Nautilus, Inc., continued to do so after acquiring the StairMaster brand. In 2004, based on these allegations, Biosig brought a patent infringement suit against Nautilus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    With Biosig's lawsuit launched, Nautilus asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reexamine the '753 patent. The reexamination proceedings centered on whether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious by prior art-principally, a patent issued in 1984 to an inventor named Fujisaki, which similarly disclosed a heart-rate monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a difference amplifier. Endeavoring to distinguish the '753 patent from prior art, Biosig submitted a declaration from Dr. Lekhtman. The declaration attested, among other things, that the '753 patent sufficiently informed a person skilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes so as \"to produce equal EMG [signals] from the left and right hands.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C337%2C753\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C337%2C753\">\n     at 160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Although the electrodes' design variables-including spacing, shape, size, and material-cannot be standardized across all exercise machines, Dr. Lekhtman explained, a skilled artisan could undertake a \"trial and error\" process of equalization. This would entail experimentation with different electrode configurations in order to optimize EMG signal cancellation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C337%2C753\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C337%2C753\">\n     at 155-156, 158\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fr4\" name=\"fr4\">\n      4\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    In 2010, the PTO issued a determination confirming the patentability of the '753 patent's claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit, which the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prejudice while PTO reexamination was underway.

Nautilus, seizing on Biosig's submissions to the PTO during the reexamination, maintained that the \"spaced relationship\" must be a distance \"greater than the width of each electrode.\" App. 245. The District Court ultimately construed the term to mean \"there is a defined relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on one side of the cylindrical bar and the same or a different defined relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,\" without any reference to the electrodes' width.

The District Court granted the motion. Those words, the District Court concluded, \"did not tell [the court] or anyone what precisely the space should be,\" or even supply \"any parameters\" for determining the appropriate spacing.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/#p373\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 72a.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded.

Under that standard, the majority determined, the '753 patent survived indefiniteness review. Considering first the \"intrinsic evidence\"-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    the claim language, the specification, and the prosecution history-the majority discerned \"certain inherent parameters of the claimed apparatus, which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to understand the metes and bounds of 'spaced relationship.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n     715 F.3d, at 899\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These sources of meaning, the majority explained, make plain that the distance separating the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar \"cannot be greater than the width of a user's hands\"; that is so \"because claim 1 requires the live and common electrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two distinct points of a hand.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Furthermore, the majority noted, the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance cannot be \"infinitesimally small, effectively merging the live and common electrodes into a single electrode with one detection point.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The claim's functional provisions, the majority went on to observe, shed additional light on the meaning of \"spaced relationship.\" Surveying the record before the PTO on reexamination, the majority concluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could attain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing EMG signals by adjusting design variables, including spacing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In a concurring opinion, Judge Schall reached the majority's result employing \"a more limited analysis.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n     at 905\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Judge Schall accepted the majority's recitation of the definiteness standard, under which claims amenable to construction are nonetheless indefinite when \"the construction remains insolubly ambiguous.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (internal\n    quotation marks omitted). The District Court's construction of \"spaced relationship,\" Judge Schall maintained, was sufficiently clear: the term means \"there is a fixed spatial relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode\" on each side of the cylindrical bar.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Judge Schall agreed with the majority that the intrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing. But, unlike the majority, Judge Schall did not \"presum[e] a functional linkage between the 'spaced relationship' limitation and the removal of EMG signals.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047888\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/891/\">\n     at 906\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

First, definiteness is to be evaluated from the perspective of someone skilled in the relevant art. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     General Elec. Co. v.

Second, in assessing definiteness, claims are to be read in light of the patent's specification and prosecution history. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
