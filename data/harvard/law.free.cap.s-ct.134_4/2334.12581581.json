Anthony List (SBA) violated an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false statements made during the course of a political campaign. Specifically, Driehaus alleged that SBA violated the law when it stated that his vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a vote in favor of \"taxpayer funded abortion.\" After Driehaus lost his re-election bid, the complaint was dismissed, but SBA continued to pursue a separate suit in Federal District Court challenging the law on First Amendment grounds. Petitioner Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) also filed a First Amendment challenge to the Ohio law, alleging that it had planned to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained due to the proceedings against SBA. The District Court consolidated the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable, concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness. The Sixth Circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : Petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article III purposes.

Here, by contrast, petitioners' speech focuses on the broader issue of support for the ACA, not on the voting record of a single candidate. Nor does SBA's insistence that its previous statements were true render its fears of enforcement misplaced. After all, that insistence did not prevent the Commission from finding probable cause for a violation the first time. Pp. 2344 - 2345.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (3) Finally, the threat of future enforcement is substantial. There is a history of past enforcement against petitioners.

The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a complaint may be filed with the State Commission by \"any person,\" Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 3517.153(A), not just a prosecutor or agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The threatened Commission proceedings are of particular concern because of the burden they impose on electoral speech. Moreover, the target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days before an election. But this Court need not decide whether the threat of Commission proceedings standing alone is sufficient; here, those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of criminal prosecution. Pp. 2345 - 2346.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (c) The Sixth Circuit separately considered two other \"prudential factors\": \"fitness\" and \"hardship.\" This Court need not resolve the continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case because those factors are easily satisfied here.

The question in this case is whether their preenforcement challenge to that law is justiciable-and in particular, whether they have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for the purposes of Article III.

As relevant here, the statute makes it a crime for any person to \"[m]ake a false statement concerning the voting record of a candidate or public official,\" \u00a7 3517.21(B)(9), or to \"[p]ost, publish, circulate, distribute, or otherwise disseminate a false statement concerning a candidate, either knowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,\" \u00a7 3517.21(B)(10).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \"[A]ny person\" acting on personal knowledge may file a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission (or Commission) alleging a violation of the false statement statute. \u00a7 3517.153(A) (Lexis Supp. 2014). If filed within 60 days of a primary election or 90 days of a general election, the complaint is referred to a panel of at least three Commission members. \u00a7\u00a7 3517.156(A), (B)(1) (Lexis 2013). The panel must then hold an expedited hearing, generally within two business days, \u00a7 3517.156(B)(1), to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the alleged violation occurred, \u00a7 3517.156(C). Upon a finding of probable cause, the full Commission must, within 10 days, hold a hearing on the complaint. \u00a7 3517.156(C)(2); see also Ohio Admin.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 3517-1-11(B)(2)(c), (d), (g).

During the 2010 election cycle, SBA publicly criticized various Members of Congress who voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). In particular, it issued a press release announcing its plan to \"educat[e] voters that their representative voted for a health care bill that includes taxpayer-funded abortion.\" App. 49-50. The press release listed then-Congressman Steve Driehaus, a respondent here, who voted for the ACA. SBA also sought to display a billboard in Driehaus' district condemning that vote. The planned billboard would have read: \"Shame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 37. The advertising company that owned the billboard space refused to display that message, however, after Driehaus' counsel threatened legal action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    On October 4, 2010, Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission alleging, as relevant here, that SBA had violated \u00a7\u00a7 3517.21(B)(9) and (10) by falsely stating that he had voted for \"taxpayer-funded abortion.\"\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Because Driehaus filed his complaint 29 days before the general election, a Commission panel held an expedited hearing. On October 14, 2010, the panel voted 2 to 1 to find probable cause that a violation had been committed. The full Commission set a hearing date for 10 business days later, and the parties commenced discovery. Driehaus noticed depositions of three SBA employees as well as individuals affiliated with similar advocacy groups. He also issued discovery requests for all evidence that SBA would rely on at the Commission hearing, as well as SBA's communications with allied organizations, political party committees, and Members of Congress and their staffs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    On October 18, 2010-after the panel's probable-cause determination, but before the scheduled Commission hearing-SBA filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that \u00a7\u00a7 3517.21(B)(9) and (10) violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The District Court stayed the action under\n    <em>\n     Younger v.

The Sixth Circuit denied SBA's motion for an injunction pending appeal. Driehaus\n    and SBA eventually agreed to postpone the full Commission hearing until after the election.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    When Driehaus lost the election in November 2010, he moved to withdraw his complaint against SBA. The Commission granted the motion with SBA's consent. Once the Commission proceedings were terminated, the District Court lifted the stay and SBA amended its complaint. As relevant here, the amended complaint alleged that Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3517.21(B)(9) and (10) are unconstitutional both facially and as applied. Specifically, the complaint alleged that SBA's speech about Driehaus had been chilled; that SBA \"intends to engage in substantially similar activity in the future\"; and that it \"face [d] the prospect of its speech and associational rights again being chilled and burdened,\" because \"[a]ny complainant can hale [it] before the [Commission], forcing it to expend time and resources defending itself.\" App. 121-122.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The District Court consolidated SBA's suit with a separate suit brought by petitioner Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST), an advocacy organization that also alleged that the same Ohio false statement provisions are unconstitutional both facially and as applied.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    According to its amended complaint, COAST intended to disseminate a mass e-mail and other materials criticizing Driehaus' vote for the ACA as a vote \"to fund abortions with tax dollars,\" but refrained from doing so because of the Commission proceedings against SBA.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n     at 146, 148, 162\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . COAST further alleged that it \"desires to make the same or similar statements about other federal candidates who voted for\" the ACA, but that fear \"of finding itself subject to the same fate\" as SBA has deterred it from doing so.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n     at 149, 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fr4\" name=\"fr4\">\n      4\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The District Court dismissed both suits as non-justiciable, concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness.

The Court of Appeals analyzed three factors to assess whether the case was ripe for review: (1) the likelihood that the alleged harm would come to pass; (2) whether the factual record was sufficiently developed; and (3) the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Regarding the first factor, the Sixth Circuit concluded that SBA's prior injuries-the probable-cause determination and the billboard rejection-\"do not help it show an imminent threat of\n    <em>\n     future\n    </em>\n    prosecution,\" particularly where \"the Commission never found that SBA ... violated Ohio's false-statement law.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n     at 420\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court further reasoned that it was speculative\n    whether any person would file a complaint with the Commission in the future, in part because Driehaus took a 2-year assignment with the Peace Corps in Africa after losing the election. Finally, the court noted that SBA has not alleged that \"it plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech\" in the future, but rather maintains that the statements it intends to make are factually true.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n     at 422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    As for the remaining factors, the court concluded that the factual record was insufficiently developed with respect to the content of SBA's future speech, and that withholding judicial relief would not result in undue hardship because, in the time period leading up to the 2010 election, SBA continued to communicate its message even after Commission proceedings were initiated. The Sixth Circuit therefore determined that SBA's suit was not ripe for review, and that its analysis as to SBA compelled the same conclusion with respect to COAST.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    We granted certiorari, 571 U.S. ----, --- S.Ct. ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2014), and now reverse.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const., Art.

See Reply Brief 4-5 (identifying other elected officials who plan to seek reelection as potential objects of SBA's criticisms). Because petitioners' alleged future speech is not directed exclusively at Driehaus, it does not matter whether he \"may run for office again.\" Brief for Respondents 33 (internal quotation marks omitted). As long as petitioners continue to engage in comparable electoral speech regarding support for the ACA, that speech will remain arguably proscribed by Ohio's false statement statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Respondents, echoing the Sixth Circuit, contend that SBA's fears of enforcement are misplaced because SBA has not said it \" 'plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 15 (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n     525 Fed.Appx., at 422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). The Sixth Circuit reasoned that because SBA \"can only be liable for making a statement 'knowing' it is false,\" SBA's insistence that its speech is factually true \"makes the possibility of prosecution for uttering such statements exceedingly slim.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=525%20Fed.%20Appx.%20415\">\n     at 422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Sixth Circuit misses the point. SBA's insistence that the allegations in its press release were true did not prevent the Commission panel from finding\n    probable cause to believe that SBA had violated the law the first time around. And, there is every reason to think that similar speech in the future will result in similar proceedings, notwithstanding SBA's belief in the truth of its allegations. Nothing in this Court's decisions requires a plaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a law to confess that he will in fact violate that law. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Babbitt,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532087\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/289/#p298\">\n     442 U.S., at 301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532087\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/289/#p298\">\n     99 S.Ct. 2301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (case was justiciable even though plaintiffs disavowed any intent to \"propagate untruths\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Finally, the threat of future enforcement of the false statement statute is substantial. Most obviously, there is a history of past enforcement here: SBA was the subject of a complaint in a recent election cycle. We have observed that past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not \" ' chimerical.' \"\n    <em>\n     Steffel,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177476\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/452/#p459\">\n     415 U.S., at 459\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177476\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/452/#p459\">\n     94 S.Ct. 1209\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; cf.\n    <em>\n     Clapper,\n    </em>\n    568 U.S., at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p1146\">\n     133 S.Ct., at 1148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (plaintiffs' theory of standing was \"substantially undermine[d]\" by their \"fail [ure] to offer any evidence that their communications ha[d] been monitored\" under the challenged statute). Here, the threat is even more substantial given that the Commission panel actually found probable cause to believe that SBA's speech violated the false statement statute. Indeed future complainants may well \"invoke the prior probable-cause finding to prove that SBA\n    <em>\n     knowingly\n    </em>\n    lied.\" Brief for Petitioners 32.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that authority to file a complaint with the Commission is not limited to a prosecutor or an agency. Instead, the false statement statute allows \"any person\" with knowledge of the purported violation to file a complaint. \u00a7 3517.153(A). Because the universe of potential complainants is not restricted to state officials who are constrained by explicit guidelines or ethical obligations, there is a real risk of complaints from, for example, political opponents. See Brief for Michael DeWine, Attorney General of Ohio, as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    8 (hereinafter DeWine Brief); see also\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 6 (noting that \"the Commission has no system for weeding out frivolous complaints\").

The burdens that Commission proceedings can impose on electoral speech are of particular concern here. As the Ohio Attorney General himself notes, the \"practical effect\" of the Ohio false statement scheme is \"to permit a private complainant ... to gain a campaign advantage without ever having to prove the falsity of a statement.\" DeWine Brief 7. \"[C]omplainants may time their submissions to achieve maximum disruption of their political opponents while calculating that an ultimate decision on the merits will be deferred until after the relevant election.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 14-15. Moreover, the target of a false statement complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days leading up to an election. And where, as here, a Commission panel issues a preelection probable-cause finding, \"such a determination itself may be viewed [by the electorate] as a sanction by the State.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 13.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Although the threat of Commission proceedings is a substantial one, we need not decide whether that threat standing alone gives rise to an Article III injury. The burdensome Commission proceedings here are backed by the additional threat of criminal prosecution. We conclude that the combination of those two threats suffices to create an Article III injury under the circumstances of this case.

See Brief for Respondents 26-27, 34. In\n    <em>\n     Younger,\n    </em>\n    the plaintiff had been indicted for distributing leaflets in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act. When he challenged the constitutionality of the law in federal court, several other plaintiffs intervened, arguing that their own speech was inhibited by Harris' prosecution. The Court concluded that only the plaintiff had standing because the intervenors \"d[id] not claim that they ha[d] ever been threatened with prosecution, that a prosecution [wa]s likely, or even that a prosecution [wa]s remotely possible.\" 401 U.S., at 42,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n     91 S.Ct. 746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    That is not this case.

Also unlike the intervenors in\n    <em>\n     Younger,\n    </em>\n    who had never been threatened with prosecution, COAST has been the subject of Commission proceedings in the past.
