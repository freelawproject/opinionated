Pp. 2021 - 2023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) The officers acted reasonably in using deadly force. A \"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/\">\n    at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rickard's outrageously reckless driving-which lasted more than five minutes, exceeded 100 miles per hour, and included the passing of more than two dozen other motorists-posed a grave public safety risk, and the record conclusively disproves that the chase was over when Rickard's car came to a temporary standstill and officers began shooting. Under\n   the circumstances when the shots were fired, all that a reasonable officer could have concluded from Rickard's conduct was that he was intent on resuming his flight, which would again pose a threat to others on the road. Pp. 2021 - 2022.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) Petitioners did not fire more shots than necessary to end the public safety risk. It makes sense that, if officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. Here, during the 10-second span when all the shots were fired, Rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee and eventually managed to drive away. A passenger's presence does not bear on whether officers violated Rickard's Fourth Amendment rights, which \"are personal rights [that] may not be vicariously asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Alderman v.

Even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, petitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity.

Near midnight on July 18, 2004, Lieutenant Joseph Forthman of the West Memphis, Arkansas, Police Department pulled over a white Honda Accord because the car had only one operating headlight. Donald Rickard was the driver of the Accord, and Kelly Allen was in the passenger seat. Forthman noticed an indentation, \" 'roughly the size of a head or a basketball' \" in the windshield of the car.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Allen v.

He asked Rickard if he had been drinking, and Rickard responded that he had not. Because Rickard failed to produce his driver's license upon request and appeared nervous, Forthman asked him to step out of the car. Rather than comply with Forthman's request, Rickard sped away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Forthman gave chase and was soon joined by five other police cruisers driven by Sergeant Vance Plumhoff and Officers Jimmy Evans, Lance Ellis, Troy Galtelli, and John Gardner. The officers pursued Rickard east on Interstate 40 toward Memphis, Tennessee. While on I-40, they attempted to stop Rickard using a \"rolling roadblock,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at *2, but they were unsuccessful. The District Court described the vehicles as \"swerving through traffic at high speeds,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at *8, and respondent does not dispute that the cars attained speeds over 100 miles per hour.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   See Memorandum of Law in Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 2:05-cv-2585 (WD Tenn.), p. 16; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 54:23-55:6.

As we have explained\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----, the chase in this case exceeded 100 miles per hour and lasted over five minutes. During that chase, Rickard passed more than two dozen other vehicles, several of which were forced to alter course. Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk. And while it is true that Rickard's car eventually collided with a police car and came temporarily to a near standstill, that did not end the chase. Less than three seconds later, Rickard resumed maneuvering his car. Just before the shots were fired, when the front bumper of his car was flush with that of one of the police cruisers, Rickard was obviously pushing down on the accelerator because the car's wheels were spinning, and then Rickard threw the car into reverse \"in an attempt to escape.\" Thus, the record conclusively\n   disproves respondent's claim that the chase in the present case was already over when petitioners began shooting. Under the circumstances at the moment when the shots were fired, all that a reasonable police officer could have concluded was that Rickard was intent on resuming his flight and that, if he was allowed to do so, he would once again pose a deadly threat for others on the road. Rickard's conduct even after the shots were fired-as noted, he managed to drive away despite the efforts of the police to block his path-underscores the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In light of the circumstances we have discussed, it is beyond serious dispute that Rickard's flight posed a grave public safety risk, and here, as in\n   <em>\n    Scott,\n   </em>\n   the police acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We now consider respondent's contention that, even if the use of deadly force was permissible, petitioners acted unreasonably in firing a total of 15 shots. We reject that argument. It stands to reason that, if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended. As petitioners noted below, \"if lethal force is justified, officers are taught to keep shooting until the threat is over.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=509%20Fed.%20Appx.%20388\">\n    509 Fed.Appx., at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, during the 10-second span when all the shots were fired, Rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee. Indeed, even after all the shots had been fired, he managed to drive away and to continue driving until he crashed. This would be a different case if petitioners had initiated a second round of shots after an initial round had clearly incapacitated Rickard and had ended any threat of continued flight, or if Rickard had clearly given himself up. But that is not what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In arguing that too many shots were fired, respondent relies in part on the presence of Kelly Allen in the front seat of the car, but we do not think that this factor changes the calculus. Our cases make it clear that \"Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which ... may not be vicariously asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Alderman v.

Thus, the question before us is whether petitioners violated Rickard's Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen's. If a suit were brought on behalf of Allen under either \u00a7 1983 or state tort law, the risk to Allen would be of central concern.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fr5\" name=\"fr5\">\n     4\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   But Allen's presence in the car cannot enhance Rickard's Fourth Amendment rights.

Indeed, the lone dissenting Justice in\n   <em>\n    Brosseau\n   </em>\n   emphasized that in\n   that case, \"there was no ongoing or prior high-speed car chase to inform the [constitutional] analysis.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925704\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/194/#p201\">\n    543 U.S., at 206, n. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5925704\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/194/#p201\">\n    125 S.Ct. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Stevens, J.). Attempting to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brosseau,\n   </em>\n   respondent focuses on the fact that the officer there fired only 1 shot, whereas here three officers collectively fired 15 shots. But it was certainly not clearly established at the time of the shooting in this case that the number of shots fired, under the circumstances present here, rendered the use of force excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Since respondent cannot meaningfully distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brosseau,\n   </em>\n   her only option is to show that its analysis was out of date by 2004. Yet respondent has not pointed us to any case-let alone a controlling case or a robust consensus of cases-decided between 1999 and 2004 that could be said to have clearly established the unconstitutionality of using lethal force to end a high-speed car chase. And respondent receives no help on this front from the opinions below. The District Court cited only a single case decided between 1999 and 2004 that identified a possible constitutional violation by an officer who shot a fleeing driver, and the facts of that case-where a reasonable jury could have concluded that the suspect merely \"accelerated to eighty to eighty-five miles per hour in a seventy-miles-per-hour zone\" and did not \"engag[e] in any evasive maneuvers,\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughan v.
