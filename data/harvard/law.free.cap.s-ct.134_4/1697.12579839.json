And it was a blanket instruction that was requested and denied in this case; respondent's requested instruction would have informed the jury that \"[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him\n    <em>\n     in any way\n    </em>\n    .\" App. 31 (emphasis added). Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument that remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18, yet the proposed instruction would have precluded the jury from considering respondent's silence as indicative of his lack of remorse. Indeed, the trial judge declined to give the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because he was \"aware of no case law that precludes the jury from considering the defendant's lack of expression of remorse ... in sentencing.\" App. 36.

If the Court holds in Case A that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then holds in Case B that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the First Amendment as to the States, then it is clear that the First Amendment prohibits the States from discriminating based on viewpoint. By the same logic, because the Court held in\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n    that the Fifth Amendment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and held in\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    that there is no basis for distinguishing between the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, it is clear that the Fifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested no-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase of a capital trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Court avoids this logic by reading\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    too narrowly. First, it contends that\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    's holding that the Fifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty phases was mere dictum.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1704 - 1705, and n. 4. But this rule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is binding precedent, not dictum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority acknowledges that\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    \"held that the privilege against self-incrimination\n    <em>\n     applies\n    </em>\n    to the penalty phase,\" but it concludes that\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    said nothing about the\n    <em>\n     content\n    </em>\n    of the privilege in the penalty phase.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1703 (emphasis added). This interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    ignores its rationale. The reason that\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    concluded that the Fifth Amendment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that the Court saw \"no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of [a defendant's] capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n     451 U.S., at 462-463\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n     101 S.Ct. 1866\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Sentencing proceedings, particularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on factual matters that do not directly concern facts of the crime. Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his growing-up years? Is he suffering from a severe physical or mental impairment? Was he supportive of his family? Is he remorseful?\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    itself involved compelled statements introduced to establish the defendant's future dangerousness-another fact often unrelated to the circumstances or details of a defendant's crime.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n     451 U.S., at 456\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n     101 S.Ct. 1866\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In addition, States typically place the burden to prove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the defendant. A reasonable jurist would not believe that\n    <em>\n     Mitchell,\n    </em>\n    by refusing to create an exception to\n    <em>\n     Estelle,\n    </em>\n    intended to undermine the very case it reaffirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     Mitchell\n    </em>\n    held, simply and only, that the normal rule of\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    applied in the circumstances of the particular case before the Court. That holding does not destabilize settled law beyond its reach. We frequently resist reaching beyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so. That does not mean that we throw cases involving all other factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The majority also places undue weight on dictum in\n    <em>\n     Mitchell\n    </em>\n    reserving judgment as to whether to create additional exceptions to the normal rule of\n    <em>\n     Estelle\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n    . We noted: \"Whether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in \u00a7 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question. It is not before us, and we express no view on it.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133167\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/314/#p327\">\n     526 U.S., at 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133167\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/314/#p327\">\n     119 S.Ct. 1307\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This dictum, says the majority, suggests that some inferences, including about remorse (which was at issue in Woodall's case), may be permissible.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1703 - 1704.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    When the Court merely reserves a question that is \"not before us\" for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal principles that are already clearly established. The Court often identifies questions that it is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    answering in order to clarify the question it\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    answering. In so doing-that is, in \"express[ing] no view\" on questions that are not squarely before us-we do not create a state of uncertainty as to those questions. And in respect to\n    <em>\n     Mitchell,\n    </em>\n    where the Court reserved the question whether to create an exception to the normal rule, this is doubly true. The normal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well as the guilt phase remained clearly established after\n    <em>\n     Mitchell\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established law, the majority declares that if a court must \"extend\" the rationale of a case in order to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1705 - 1707. I read this to mean simply that if there may be \"fairminded disagreement\" about whether a rationale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will not unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that rationale, and I agree.

I do not understand the majority to suggest that reading two\n    legal principles together would necessarily \"extend\" the law, which would be a proposition entirely inconsistent with our case law. As long as fairminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal rules considered together would dictate a particular outcome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it holds otherwise.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/770/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court committed here.

It held that\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n    did not apply because Woodall had already pleaded guilty-that is, because Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his trial.\n    <em>\n     Woodall v.
