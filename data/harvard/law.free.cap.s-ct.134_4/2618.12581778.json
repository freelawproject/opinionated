Under State law, the homecare recipients (designated \"customers\") and the State both play some role in the employment relationship with the PAs. Customers control most aspects of the employment relationship, including the hiring, firing, training, supervising, and disciplining of PAs; they also define the PA's duties by proposing a \"Service Plan.\" Other than compensating PAs, the State's involvement in employment matters is minimal. Its employer status was created by executive order, and later codified by the legislature, solely to permit PAs to join a labor union and engage in collective bargaining under Illinois' Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA).\n </p>\n <history id=\"p-9\">\n  Pursuant to this scheme, respondent SEIU Healthcare Illinois &amp; Indiana (SEIU-HII) was designated the exclusive union representative for Rehabilitation Program employees. The union entered into collective-bargaining agreements with the State that contained an agency-fee provision, which requires all bargaining unit members who do not wish to join the union to pay the union a fee for the cost of certain activities, including those tied to the collective-bargaining process. A group of Rehabilitation Program PAs brought a class action against SEIU-HII and other respondents in Federal District Court, claiming that the PLRA violated the First Amendment insofar as it authorized the agency-fee provision. The District Court dismissed their claims, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant part, concluding\n  that the PAs were state employees within the meaning of\n  <em>\n   Abood v.

The First Amendment analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hanson\n   </em>\n   was thin, and\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   was not a constitutional decision. And the Court fundamentally misunderstood\n   <em>\n    Hanson\n   </em>\n   ' s narrow holding, which upheld the authorization, not imposition, of an agency fee. The\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   Court also failed to appreciate the distinction between core union speech in the public sector and core union speech in the private sector, as well as the conceptual difficulty in public-sector cases of distinguishing union expenditures for collective bargaining from those designed for political purposes. Nor does the\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   Court seem to have anticipated the administrative problems that would result in attempting to classify union expenditures as either chargeable or nonchargeable, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n    500 U.S. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n    114 L.Ed.2d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or the practical problems that would arise from the heavy burden facing objecting nonmembers wishing to challenge the union's actions. Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   Court's critical \"labor peace\" analysis rests on the unsupported empirical assumption that exclusive representation in the public sector depends on the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers. Pp. 2627 - 2634.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (b) Because of\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's questionable foundations, and because Illinois' PAs are quite different from full-fledged public employees, this Court refuses to extend\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   to the situation here. Pp. 2634 - 2638.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) PAs are much different from public employees. Unlike full-fledged public employees, PAs are almost entirely answerable to the customers and not to the State, do not enjoy most of the rights and benefits that inure to state employees, and are not indemnified by the State for claims against them arising from actions taken during the course of their employment. Even the scope of collective bargaining on their behalf is sharply limited. Pp. 2634 - 2637.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's rationale is based on the assumption that the union possesses the full scope of powers and duties generally available under American labor law. Even the best argument for\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's anomalous approach is a poor fit here. What justifies the agency fee in the\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   context is the fact that the State compels the union to promote and protect the interests of nonmembers in \"negotiating and administering\n   a collective-bargaining agreement and representing the interests of employees in settling disputes and processing grievances.\"\n   <em>\n    Lehnert, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 556,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That rationale has little application here, where Illinois law requires that all PAs receive the same rate of pay and the union has no authority with respect to a PA's grievances against a customer. Pp. 2636 - 2637.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) Extending\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's boundaries to encompass partial public employees would invite problems. State regulations and benefits affecting such employees exist along a continuum, and it is unclear at what point, short of full-fledged public employment,\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   should apply. Under respondents' view, a host of workers who currently receive payments from a government entity for some sort of service would become candidates for inclusion within\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   's reach, and it would be hard to see where to draw the line. P. 2638.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (c) Because\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   does not control here, generally applicable First Amendment standards apply. Thus, the agency-fee provision here must serve a \" 'compelling state interes[t] ... that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.' \"\n   <em>\n    Knox, supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407170\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/298/#p2289\">\n    132 S.Ct., at 2289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . None of the interests that respondents contend are furthered by the agency-fee provision is sufficient. Pp. 2639 - 2641.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) Their claim that the agency-fee provision promotes \"labor peace\" misses the point. Petitioners do not contend that they have a First Amendment right to form a rival union or that SEIU-HII has no authority to serve as the exclusive bargaining representative. This, along with examples from some federal agencies and many state laws, demonstrates that a union's status as exclusive bargaining agent and the right to collect an agency fee from nonmembers are not inextricably linked. Features of the Illinois scheme-\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   PAs do not work together in a common state facility and the union's role is very restricted-further undermine the \"labor peace\" argument. P. 2640.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) Respondents also argue that the agency-fee provision promotes the welfare of PAs, thereby contributing to the Rehabilitation Program's success. Even assuming that SEIU-HII has been an effective advocate, the agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless the union could not adequately advocate without the receipt of nonmember agency fees. No such showing has been made. Pp. 2640 - 2641.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (d) Respondents' additional arguments for sustaining the Illinois scheme are unconvincing. First, they urge the application of a balancing test derived from\n   <em>\n    Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/\">\n    391 U.S. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767525\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/563/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has never viewed\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and its progeny as based on\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balancing. And even assuming that\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   applies, that case's balancing test clearly tips in favor of the objecting employees' First Amendment interests. Second, respondents err in contending that a refusal to extend\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   here will call into question this Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Keller v. State Bar of Cal.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    496 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.

In order to prevent these individuals from having to enter a nursing home or other facility, the federal Medicaid program funds state-run programs that provide in-home services to individuals whose conditions would otherwise require institutionalization. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396n(c)(1). A State that adopts such a program receives federal funds to compensate persons who attend to the daily needs of individuals needing in-home care.\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    ; see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20440.180\">\n     42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 440.180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 441.300-441.310 (2013). Almost every State has established such a program. See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Understanding Medicaid Home and Community Services: A Primer (2010).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    One of those States is Illinois, which has created the Illinois Department of Human Services Home Services Program, known colloquially as the state \"Rehabilitation Program.\" Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, \u00a7 2405/3(f) (West 2012); 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 676.10 (2007). \"[D]esigned to prevent the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals who may instead be satisfactorily maintained at home at a lesser cost to the State,\" \u00a7 676.10(a), the Rehabilitation\n    Program allows participants to hire a \"personal assistant\" who provides homecare services tailored to the individual's needs. Many of these personal assistants are relatives of the person receiving care, and some of them provide care in their own homes. See App. 16-18.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Illinois law establishes an employer-employee relationship between the person receiving the care and the person providing it. The law states explicitly that the person receiving home care-the \"customer\"-\"shall be\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    employer of the [personal assistant].\" 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 676.30(b) (emphasis added). A \"personal assistant\" is defined as \"an individual employed\n    <em>\n     by the customer\n    </em>\n    to provide ... varied services that have been approved by the customer's physician,\" \u00a7 676.30(p) (emphasis added), and the law makes clear that Illinois \"shall not have control or input in the employment relationship between the customer and the personal assistants.\" \u00a7 676.10(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Other provisions of the law emphasize the customer's employer status. The customer \"is responsible for controlling all aspects of the employment relationship between the customer and the [personal assistant (or PA) ], including, without limitation, locating and hiring the PA, training the PA, directing, evaluating and otherwise supervising the work performed by the personal assistant, imposing ... disciplinary action against the PA, and terminating the employment relationship between the customer and the PA.\" \u00a7 676.30(b).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    In general, the customer \"has complete discretion in which Personal Assistant he/she wishes to hire.\" \u00a7 684.20(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    A customer also controls the contents of the document, the Service Plan, that lists the services that the customer will receive. \u00a7 684.10(a). No Service Plan may take effect without the approval of both the customer and the customer's physician. See \u00a7 684.10, 684.40, 684.50, 684.75. Service Plans are highly individualized. The Illinois State Labor Relations Board noted in 1985 that \"[t]here is no typical employment arrangement here, public or otherwise; rather, there simply exists an arrangement whereby the state of Illinois pays individuals ... to work under the direction and control of private third parties.\"\n    <em>\n     Illinois Dept. of Central Management Serv.,\n    </em>\n    No. S-RC-115, 2 PERI \u00b6 2007, p.

Laws p. 1929.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    While customers exercise predominant control over their employment relationship with personal assistants, the State, subsidized by the federal Medicaid program, pays the personal assistants' salaries. The amount paid varies depending on the services provided, but as a general matter, it \"corresponds to the amount the State would expect to pay for the nursing care component of institutionalization if the individual chose institutionalization.\" 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 679.50(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Other than providing compensation, the State's role is comparatively small. The State sets some basic threshold qualifications for employment. See\n    \u00a7\u00a7 686.10(h)(1)-(10).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    (For example, a personal assistant must have a Social Security number, must possess basic communication skills, and must complete an employment agreement with the customer. \u00a7\u00a7 686.10, 686.20, 686.40.)

In the public sector, core issues such as wages, pensions, and benefits are important political issues, but that is generally not so in the private sector. In the years since\n    <em>\n     Abood,\n    </em>\n    as state and local expenditures on employee wages and benefits have mushroomed, the importance of the difference between bargaining in the public and private sectors has been driven home.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    failed to appreciate the conceptual difficulty of distinguishing in public-sector cases between union expenditures that are made for collective-bargaining purposes and those that are made to achieve political ends.

As we will explain, see\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 2640 - 2641, this assumption is unwarranted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Despite all this, the State of Illinois now asks us to approve a very substantial expansion of\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's reach.\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    involved full-fledged public employees, but in this case, the status of the personal assistants is much different. The Illinois Legislature has taken pains to specify that personal assistants are public employees for one purpose only: collective bargaining. For all other purposes, Illinois regards the personal assistants as private-sector employees. This approach has important practical consequences.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    For one thing, the State's authority with respect to these two groups is vastly different. In the case of full-fledged public employees, the State establishes all of the duties imposed on each employee, as well as all of the qualifications needed for each position. The State vets applicants and chooses the employees to be hired. The State provides or arranges for whatever training is needed, and it supervises and evaluates the employees' job performance and imposes corrective measures if appropriate. If a state employee's performance is deficient, the State may discharge the employee in accordance with whatever procedures are required by law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    With respect to the personal assistants involved in this case, the picture is entirely changed. The job duties of personal assistants are specified in their individualized Service Plans, which must be approved by the customer and the customer's physician. 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 684.10. Customers have complete discretion to hire any personal assistant who meets the meager basic qualifications that the State prescribes in \u00a7 686.10. See \u00a7 676.30(b) (the customer \"is responsible for controlling all aspects of the employment relationship between the customer and the [personal assistant], including,\n    <em>\n     without limitation,\n    </em>\n    locating and hiring the [personal assistant]\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 684.20(b) (\"complete discretion in which Personal Assistant [the customer] wishes to hire\" subject to baseline eligibility requirements).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Customers supervise their personal assistants on a daily basis, and no provision of the Illinois statute or implementing regulations gives the State the right to enter the home in which the personal assistant is employed for the purpose of checking on the personal assistant's job performance. Cf. \u00a7 676.20(b) (customer controls \"without limitation ... supervising the work performed by the [personal assistant], imposing ... disciplinary action against the [personal assistant]\"). And while state law mandates an annual review of each personal assistant's work, that evaluation is also controlled by the customer. \u00a7\u00a7 686.10(k), 686.30. A state counselor is assigned to assist the customer in performing the review but has no power to override the customer's evaluation. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1797219\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/927/88/#p93\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Nor do the regulations empower the State to discharge a personal assistant for substandard performance. See n. 1,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . Discharge, like hiring, is entirely in the hands of the customer. See \u00a7 676.30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Consistent with this scheme, under which personal assistants are almost entirely answerable to the customers and not to the State, Illinois withholds from personal assistants most of the rights and\n    benefits enjoyed by full-fledged state employees. As we have noted already, state law explicitly excludes personal assistants from statutory retirement and health insurance benefits. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, \u00a7 2405/3(f). It also excludes personal assistants from group life insurance and certain other employee benefits provided under the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971.\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . (\"Personal assistants shall not be covered by the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971\"). And the State \"does not provide paid vacation, holiday, or sick leave\" to personal assistants. 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 686.10(h)(7).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Personal assistants also appear to be ineligible for a host of benefits under a variety of other state laws, including the State Employee Vacation Time Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, \u00a7 360/1); the State Employee Health Savings Account Law (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, \u00a7 377/10-1); the State Employee Job Sharing Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, \u00a7 380/0.01); the State Employee Indemnification Act (see Ill. Stat., ch. 5, \u00a7 350/2); and the Sick Leave Bank Act. See Ill. Stat., ch. 5, \u00a7 400/1. Personal assistants are apparently not entitled to the protection that the Illinois Whistleblower Act provides for full-fledged state employees. See Ill. Stat., ch. 740, \u00a7 174/1. And it likewise appears that personal assistants are shut out of many other state employee programs and benefits. The Illinois Department of Central Management Services lists many such programs and benefits, including a deferred compensation program, full worker's compensation privileges,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    behavioral health programs, a program that allows state employees to retain health insurance for a time after leaving state employment, a commuter savings program, dental and vision programs, and a flexible spending program.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n      9\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    All of these programs and benefits appear to fall within the provision of the Rehabilitation Program declaring that personal assistants are not state employees for \"any purposes\" other than collective bargaining. See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, \u00a7 2405/3(f).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Just as the State denies personal assistants most of the rights and benefits enjoyed by full-fledged state workers, the State does not assume responsibility for actions taken by personal assistants during the course of their employment. The governing statute explicitly disclaims \"vicarious liability in tort.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid\n    </em>\n    . So if a personal assistant steals from a customer, neglects a customer, or abuses a customer, the State washes its hands.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Illinois deems personal assistants to be state employees for one purpose only, collective bargaining,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fr10\" name=\"fr10\">\n      10\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    but the scope of bargaining that may be conducted on their behalf is sharply limited. Under the governing Illinois statute, collective bargaining can occur only for \"terms and conditions of employment that are within the State's control.\" Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, \u00a7 2405/3(f). That is not very much.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    As an illustration, consider the subjects of mandatory bargaining under federal and state labor law that are out of bounds when it comes to personal assistants. Under federal law, mandatory subjects include the days of the week and the hours of the day during which an employee must work,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fr11\" name=\"fr11\">\n      11\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    lunch breaks,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fr12\" name=\"fr12\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    holidays,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fr13\" name=\"fr13\">\n      13\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    vacations,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n      14\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    termination of employment,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fr15\" name=\"fr15\">\n      15\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    and changes in job duties.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fr16\" name=\"fr16\">\n      16\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    Illinois law similarly makes subject to mandatory collective-bargaining decisions concerning the \"hours and terms and conditions of employment.\"\n    <em>\n     Belvidere v.

But under the Rehabilitation Program, all these topics are governed by the Service Plan, with respect to which the union has no role. See \u00a7 676.30(b) (the customer \"is responsible for controlling all aspects of the employment relationship between the customer and the PA, including, without limitation, locating and hiring the PA, training the PA, directing, evaluating, and otherwise supervising the work performed by the PA, imposing ... disciplinary action against the PA, and terminating the employment relationship between the customer and the PA\"); \u00a7 684.50 (the Service Plan must specify \"the frequency with which the specific tasks are to be provided\" and \"the number of hours each task is to be provided per month\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     1\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The unusual status of personal assistants has important implications for present purposes.\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's rationale, whatever its strengths and weaknesses, is based on the assumption that the union possesses the full scope of powers and duties generally available under American labor law.

In that vein,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's reasoning has been described as follows. The mere fact that nonunion members benefit from union speech is not enough to justify an agency fee because \"private speech often furthers the interests of nonspeakers, and that does not alone empower the state to compel the speech to be paid for.\"\n    <em>\n     Lehnert,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n     500 U.S., at 556\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n     111 S.Ct. 1950\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (opinion of SCALIA, J.). What justifies the agency fee, the argument goes, is the fact that the State compels the union to promote and protect the interests of nonmembers.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n      Ibid\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Specifically, the union must not discriminate between members and nonmembers in \"negotiating and administering a collective-bargaining agreement\n    and representing the interests of employees in settling disputes and processing grievances.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This means that the union \"cannot, for example, negotiate particularly high wage increases for its members in exchange for accepting no increases for others.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n      Ibid\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227527\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/507/\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    And it has the duty to provide equal and effective representation for nonmembers in grievance proceedings, see Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., ch. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 315/6, 315/8, an undertaking that can be very involved. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    SEIU: Member Resources, available at www. seiu. or/ a/ members/ disputes- and- grievances- rights- procedures- and- best- practices. php (detailing the steps involved in adjusting grievances).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    This argument has little force in the situation now before us. Illinois law specifies that personal assistants \"shall be paid at the hourly rate set by law,\" see 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7 686.40(a), and therefore the union cannot be in the position of having to sacrifice higher pay for its members in order to protect the nonmembers whom it is obligated to represent. And as for the adjustment of grievances, the union's authority and responsibilities are narrow, as we have seen. The union has no authority with respect to any grievances that a personal assistant may have with a customer, and the customer has virtually complete control over a personal assistant's work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The union's limited authority in this area has important practical implications. Suppose, for example that a customer fires a personal assistant because the customer wrongly believes that the assistant stole a fork. Or suppose that a personal assistant is discharged because the assistant shows no interest in the customer's favorite daytime soaps. Can the union file a grievance on behalf of the assistant? The answer is no.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    It is true that Illinois law requires a collective-bargaining agreement to \"contain a grievance resolution procedure which shall apply to all employees in the bargaining unit,\" Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 5, \u00a7 315/8, but in the situation here, this procedure appears to relate solely to any grievance that a personal assistant may have with the State,\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fr17\" name=\"fr17\">\n      17\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    not with the customer for whom the personal assistant works.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fr18\" name=\"fr18\">\n      18\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Because of\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's questionable foundations, and because the personal assistants are quite different from full-fledged public employees, we refuse to extend\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    to the new situation now before us.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fr19\" name=\"fr19\">\n      19\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    itself has clear boundaries; it applies to public employees. Extending those boundaries to encompass partial-public employees, quasi-public employees, or simply private employees would invite problems. Consider a continuum, ranging, on the one hand, from full-fledged state employees to, on the other hand, individuals who follow a common calling and benefit from advocacy or lobbying conducted by a group to which they do not belong and pay no dues.

Petitioners do not contend that they have a First Amendment right to form a rival union. Nor do they challenge the authority of the SEIU-HII to serve as the exclusive representative of all the personal assistants in bargaining with the State. All they seek is the right not to be forced to contribute to the union, with which they broadly disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    A union's status as exclusive bargaining agent and the right to collect an agency fee from non-members are not inextricably linked. For example, employees in some federal agencies may choose a union to serve as the exclusive bargaining agent for the unit, but no employee is required to join the union or to pay any union fee. Under federal law, in agencies in which unionization is permitted, \"[e]ach employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization,\n    <em>\n     or to refrain from any such activity,\n    </em>\n    freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207102\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fr22\" name=\"fr22\">\n      22\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Moreover, even if the agency fee provision at issue here were tied to the union's status as exclusive bargaining agents, features of the Illinois scheme would still undermine the argument that the agency fee plays an important role in maintaining labor peace. For one thing, any threat to labor peace is diminished because the personal assistants do not work together in a common state facility but instead spend all their time in private homes, either the customers' or their own. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Perry Ed. Assn. v.

Federal labor law reflects the fact that the organization of household workers like the personal assistants does not further the interest of labor peace. \"[A]ny individual employed ... in the domestic service of any family or person at his home\" is excluded from coverage under the National Labor Relations Act. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The union's very restricted role under the Illinois law is also significant. Since the union is largely limited to petitioning the State for greater pay and benefits, the specter of conflicting demands by personal assistants is lessened. And of course, State officials must deal on a daily basis with conflicting pleas for funding in many contexts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Respondents also maintain that the agency-fee provision promotes the welfare of personal assistants and thus contributes to the success of the Rehabilitation Program. As a result of unionization, they claim, the wages and benefits of personal assistants have been substantially improved;\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fr23\" name=\"fr23\">\n      23\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    orientation and training programs,\n    background checks, and a program to deal with lost and erroneous paychecks have been instituted;\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fr24\" name=\"fr24\">\n      24\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    and a procedure was established to resolve grievances arising under the collective-bargaining agreement (but apparently not grievances relating to a Service Plan or actions taken by a customer).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fr25\" name=\"fr25\">\n      25\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The thrust of these arguments is that the union has been an effective advocate for personal assistants in the State of Illinois, and we will assume that this is correct. But in order to pass exacting scrutiny, more must be shown. The agency-fee provision cannot be sustained unless the cited benefits for personal assistants could not have been achieved if the union had been required to depend for funding on the dues paid by those personal assistants who chose to join. No such showing has been made.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    In claiming that the agency fee was needed to bring about the cited improvements, the State is in a curious position. The State is not like the closed-fisted employer that is bent on minimizing employee wages and benefits and that yields only grudgingly under intense union pressure. As Governor Blagojevich put it in the executive order that first created the Illinois program, the State took the initiative because it was eager for \"feedback\" regarding the needs and views of the personal assistants. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 46. Thereafter, a majority of the personal assistants voted to unionize. When they did so, they must have realized that this would require the payment of union dues, and therefore it may be presumed that a high percentage of these personal assistants became union members and are willingly paying union dues. Why are these dues insufficient to enable the union to provide \"feedback\" to a State that is highly receptive to suggestions for increased wages and other improvements? A host of organizations advocate on behalf of the interests of persons falling within an occupational group, and many of these groups are quite successful even though they are dependent on voluntary contributions. Respondents' showing falls far short of what the First Amendment demands.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <strong>\n     V\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Respondents and their supporting\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    make two additional arguments that must be addressed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    First, respondents and the Solicitor General urge us to apply a balancing test derived from\n    <em>\n     Pickering v.

In this case, for example, the category of union speech that is germane to collective bargaining unquestionably includes speech in favor of increased wages and benefits for personal assistants.

We held that members of this bar could not be required to pay the portion of bar dues used for political or ideological purposes but that they could be required to pay the portion of the dues used for activities connected with proposing ethical codes and disciplining bar members.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n     ., at 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n     110 S.Ct. 2228\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    This decision fits comfortably within the framework applied in the present case. Licensed attorneys are subject to detailed ethics rules, and the bar rule requiring the payment of dues was part of this regulatory scheme. The portion of\n    the rule that we upheld served the \"State's interest in regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121452\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/1/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    States also have a strong interest in allocating to the members of the bar, rather than the general public, the expense of ensuring that attorneys adhere to ethical practices. Thus, our decision in this case is wholly consistent with our holding in\n    <em>\n     Keller\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Contrary to respondents' submission, the same is true with respect to\n    <em>\n     Southworth,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . In that case, we upheld the constitutionality of a university-imposed mandatory student activities fee that was used in part to support a wide array of student groups that engaged in expressive activity. The mandatory fee was challenged by students who objected to some of the expression that the fee was used to subsidize, but we rejected that challenge, and our holding is entirely consistent with our decision in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Public universities have a compelling interest in promoting student expression in a manner that is viewpoint neutral. See\n    <em>\n     Rosenberger v.

This may be done by providing funding for a broad array of student groups. If the groups funded are truly diverse, many students are likely to disagree with things that are said by some groups. And if every student were entitled to a partial exemption from the fee requirement so that no portion of the student's fee went to support a group that the student did not wish to support, the administrative problems would likely be insuperable.

That is exactly what Illinois did in entering into collective bargaining agreements with the Service Employees International Union Healthcare (SEIU) which included fair-share provisions. Contrary to the Court's decision, those agreements fall squarely within\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's holding. Here, Illinois employs, jointly with individuals suffering from disabilities, the in-home care providers whom the SEIU represents. Illinois establishes, following negotiations with the union, the most important terms of their employment, including wages, benefits, and basic qualifications. And Illinois's interests in imposing fair-share fees apply no less to those caregivers than to other state workers. The petitioners' challenge should therefore fail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    And that result would fully comport with our decisions applying the First Amendment to public employment.\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    is not, as the majority at one point describes it, \"something of an anomaly,\" allowing uncommon interference with individuals' expressive activities.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2627. Rather, the lines it draws and the balance it strikes reflect the way courts generally evaluate claims that a condition of public employment violates the First Amendment. Our decisions have long afforded government entities broad latitude to manage their workforces, even when that affects speech they could not regulate in other contexts.\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    is of a piece with all those decisions: While protecting an employee's most significant expression, that decision also enables the government to advance its interests in operating effectively-by bargaining, if it so chooses, with a single employee representative and preventing free riding on that union's efforts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    For that reason, one aspect of today's opinion is cause for satisfaction, though hardly applause. As this case came to us, the principal question it presented was whether to overrule\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    : The petitioners devoted the lion's share of their briefing and argument to urging us to overturn that nearly 40-year-old precedent (and the respondents and\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    countered in the same vein). Today's majority cannot resist taking potshots at\n    <em>\n     Abood,\n    </em>\n    see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2632 - 2634, but it ignores the petitioners' invitation to depart from principles of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    . And the essential work in the majority's opinion comes from its extended (though mistaken) distinction of\n    <em>\n     Abood,\n    </em>\n    see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2633 - 2638, not from its gratuitous dicta critiquing\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's foundations. That is to the good-or at least better than it might be. The\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    rule is deeply entrenched, and is the foundation for not tens or hundreds, but thousands of contracts between unions and governments across the Nation. Our precedent about precedent, fairly understood and applied, makes it impossible for this Court to reverse that decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    I begin where this case should also end-with this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    .

In so doing, the Court acknowledged that such a fair-share provision \"has an impact upon [public employees'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    ] First Amendment interests\"; employees, after all, might object to policies adopted or \"activities undertaken by the union in its role as exclusive representative.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     at 222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Still, the Court thought, the government's own interests \"constitutionally justified\" the interference.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Detroit had decided, the Court explained, that bargaining with a single employee representative would promote \"labor stability\" and peaceful labor relations-by ensuring, for example, that different groups of employees did not present \"conflicting demands.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     at 221, 229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And because such an exclusive bargaining agent has a legal duty to represent all employees, rather than just its own members, a compulsory surcharge fairly distributes \"the cost of [bargaining] among those who benefit\" and \"counteracts the incentive that employees might otherwise have to become 'free riders.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     at 222\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    This case thus raises a straightforward question: Does\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    apply equally to Illinois's care providers as to Detroit's teachers? No one thinks that the fair-share provisions in the two cases differ in any relevant respect. Nor do the petitioners allege that the SEIU is crossing the line\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    drew by using their payments for political or ideological activities. The only point in dispute is whether it matters that the personal assistants here are employees not only of the State but also of the disabled persons for whom they care. Just as the Court of Appeals held, that fact should make no difference to the analysis. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831193\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/692/\">\n     656 F.3d 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 698 (C.A.7 2011).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    To see how easily\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    resolves this case, consider how Illinois structured the petitioners' employment, and also why it did so. The petitioners work in Illinois's Medicaid-funded Rehabilitation Program, which provides in-home services to persons with disabilities who otherwise would face institutionalization. Under the program, each disabled person (the State calls them \"customers\") receives care from a personal assistant; the total workforce exceeds 20,000. The State could have asserted comprehensive control over all the caregivers' activities. But because of the personalized nature of the services provided, Illinois instead chose (as other States have as well) to share authority with the customers themselves. The result is that each caregiver has joint employers-the State and the customer-with each controlling significant aspects of the assistant's work.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fr31\" name=\"fr31\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    For its part, Illinois sets all the workforce-wide terms of employment. Most notably, the State determines and pays the employees' wages and benefits, including health insurance (while also withholding taxes). See 89 Ill. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 686.10(h)(10), 686.40(a)-(b) (2007); App. 44-46. By regulation, Illinois establishes the job's basic qualifications: for example, the assistant must provide references or recommendations and have adequate experience and training for the services given. See \u00a7\u00a7 686.10(c), (f). So too, the State describes the services any personal assistant may provide, and prescribes the terms of standard employment contracts entered into between personal assistants and customers. See \u00a7\u00a7 686.10(h), 686.20.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Illinois as well structures the individual relationship between the customer and his assistant (in ways the majority barely acknowledges). Along with both the customer and his physician, a state-employed counselor develops a service plan laying out the assistant's specific job responsibilities, hours, and working conditions. See \u00a7\u00a7 684.10, 684.50. That counselor also assists the customer in conducting a state-mandated annual performance review, based on state-established criteria, and mediates any resulting disagreements. See \u00a7 686.30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Within the structure designed by the State, the customer of course has crucial responsibilities. He exercises day-to-day supervisory control over the personal assistant. See \u00a7 676.30(b). And he gets both to hire a particular caregiver (from among the pool of applicants Illinois has deemed qualified) and to impose any needed discipline, up to and including discharge. See\n    <em>\n     ibid.\n    </em>\n    ; \u00a7 677.40(d). But even as to those matters, the State plays a role. Before a customer may hire an assistant, the counselor must sign off on the employee's ability to follow the customer's directions and communicate with him. See \u00a7\u00a7 686.10(d)-(e) (requiring that the employee demonstrate these capabilities \"to the satisfaction of\" the counselor). And although only a customer can actually fire an assistant, the State can effectively do so by refusing to pay one who fails to \"meet [state] standards.\" \u00a7 677.40(d). The majority reads that language narrowly, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2624, n. 1, 22, but the State does not: It has made clear not just in its litigation papers, but also in its collective bargaining agreements and customer guidance that it will withhold payment from an assistant (or altogether disqualify her from the program) based on credible allegations of customer abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation. See App. 55; Brief for Respondent Quinn 3, 50; Ill. Dept. of Human Servs., Customer Guidance for Managing Providers 8, online at http:// www. dhs. state. il. us/ One Net Library/ 27897/ documents/ Brochures/ 4365. pdf (as visited June 27, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fr32\" name=\"fr32\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Given that set of arrangements,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    should control. Although a customer can manage his own relationship with a caregiver, Illinois has sole authority over every workforce-wide term and condition of the assistants' employment-in other words, the issues most likely to be the subject of collective bargaining. In particular, if an assistant wants an increase in pay, she must ask the State, not the individual customer. So too if she wants better benefits. (Although the majority notes that caregivers do not receive\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n    retirement and health insurance benefits, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2634 - 2635, that is irrelevant: Collective bargaining between the State and SEIU has focused on benefits from the beginning, and has produced state-funded health insurance for personal assistants.) And because it is Illinois that would sit down at a bargaining table to address those subjects-the ones that matter most to employees and so most affect workforce stability-the State's stake in a fair-share provision is the same as in\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    . Here too, the State has an interest in promoting effective operations by negotiating with an equitably and adequately funded exclusive bargaining agent over terms and conditions of employment. That Illinois has delegated to program customers various individualized employment issues makes\n    no difference to those state interests. If anything, as the State has contended, the dispersion of employees across numerous workplaces and the absence of day-to-day state supervision provides an additional reason for Illinois to want to \"address concerns common to all personal assistants\" by negotiating with a single representative: Only in that way, the State explains, can the employees effectively convey their concerns about employment under the Rehabilitation Program. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a (Exec. Order No. 2003-8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Indeed, the history of that program forcefully demonstrates Illinois's interest in bargaining with an adequately funded exclusive bargaining agent-that is, the interest\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    recognized and protected. Workforce shortages and high turnover have long plagued in-home care programs, principally because of low wages and benefits. That labor instability lessens the quality of care, which in turn, forces disabled persons into institutions and (massively) increases costs to the State. See Brief for Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    16-26; Brief for State of California et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    4-5. The individual customers are powerless to address those systemic issues; rather, the State-because of its control over workforce-wide terms of employment-is the single employer that can do so. And here Illinois determined (as have nine other States, see Brief for Respondent SEIU 51, n. 14) that negotiations with an exclusive representative offered the best chance to set the Rehabilitation Program on firmer footing. Because of that bargaining, as the majority acknowledges, home-care assistants have nearly doubled their wages in less than 10 years, obtained state-funded health insurance, and benefited from better training and workplace safety measures. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2640 - 2641; Brief for Respondent Quinn 7; App. 44-48. The State, in return, has obtained guarantees against strikes or other work stoppages, see\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831193\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/692/\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 55-and most important, believes it has gotten a more stable workforce providing higher quality care, thereby avoiding the costs associated with institutionalization. Illinois's experience thus might serve as a veritable poster child for\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    -not, as the majority would have it, some strange extension of that decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    It is not altogether easy to understand why the majority thinks what it thinks: Today's opinion takes the tack of throwing everything against the wall in the hope that something might stick. A vain hope, as it turns out. Even once disentangled, the various strands of the majority's reasoning do not distinguish this case from\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Parts of the majority's analysis appear to rest on the simple presence of another employer, possessing significant responsibilities, in addition to the State. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2633 - 2634, 2636. But this Court's cases provide no warrant for holding that joint public employees are not real ones. To the contrary, the Court has made clear that the government's wide latitude to manage its workforce extends to such employees, even as against their First Amendment claims. The government's prerogative as employer, we recently explained, turns not on the \"formal status\" of an employee, but on the nature of the public \"interests at stake\"; we therefore rejected the view that \"the Government's broad authority in managing its affairs should apply with diminished force\" to contract employees whose \"direct employment relationship\" is with another party.\n    <em>\n     NASA v.

Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 20, \u00a7 2405/3(f) (West 2012); see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2626, 2634 - 2635; but cf.\n    <em>\n     Martin v.

The majority must agree (this Court has made the point often enough) that \"state law labels,\" adopted for a whole host of reasons, do not determine whether the State is acting as an employer for purposes of the First Amendment.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Umbehr,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p676\">\n     518 U.S., at 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730211\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/668/#p676\">\n     116 S.Ct. 2342\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The true issue is whether Illinois has a sufficient stake in, and control over, the petitioners' terms and conditions of employment to implicate\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's rationales and trigger its application. And once more, that question has a clear answer: As I have shown, Illinois negotiates all workforce-wide terms of the caregivers' employment as part of its effort to promote labor stability and effectively administer its Rehabilitation Program. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2626 - 2627. As contrasted to that all-important fact, whether Illinois incurs vicarious liability for caregivers' torts, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2635, or grants them certain statutory benefits like health insurance, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2634 - 2635, is beside the point. And still more so because the State and SEIU can\n    <em>\n     bargain\n    </em>\n    over most such matters; for example, as I have noted, the two have\n    reached agreement on providing state-funded health coverage, see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2648.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    Further, the majority claims, \"the scope of bargaining\" that the SEIU may conduct for caregivers is \"circumscribed\" because the customer has authority over individualized employment matters like hiring and firing.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2635 - 2637. But (at the risk of sounding like a broken record) so what? Most States limit the scope of permissible bargaining in the public sector-often ruling out of bounds similar, individualized decisions. See R. Kearney &amp; P. Mareschal, Labor Relations in the Public Sector 75-77 (5th ed. 2014) (\"The great majority of state statutes\" exclude \"certain matters from the scope of negotiations,\" including, for example, personnel decisions respecting \"hiring, promotion, and dismissal\"); Note, Developments in the Law-Public Employment,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201611\">\n     97 Harv. L.Rev. 1611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1684 (1984) (Many state statutes \"explicitly limit [ ] the scope of bargaining, typically by excluding decisions on personnel management\"). Here, the scope of collective bargaining-over wages and benefits, as well as basic duties and qualifications-more than suffices to implicate the state interests justifying\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    . Those are the matters, after all, most likely to concern employees generally and thus most likely to affect the nature and quality of the State's workforce. The idea that\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    applies only if a union can bargain with the State over every issue comes from nowhere and relates to nothing in that decision-and would revolutionize public labor law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Finally, the majority places weight on an idiosyncrasy of Illinois law: that a regulation requires uniform wages for all personal assistants. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2636. According to the majority, that means\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's free-rider rationale \"has little force in the situation now before us\": Even absent the duty of fair representation (requiring the union to work on behalf of all employees, members and non-members alike, see\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    at 2656 - 2657), the union could not bargain one employee's wages against another's.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2637.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fr36\" name=\"fr36\">\n      6\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    But that idea is doubly wrong. First, the Illinois regulation applies only to wages. It does not cover, for example, the significant health benefits that the SEIU has obtained for in-home caregivers, or any other benefits for which it may bargain in the future. Nor does the regulation prevent preferential participation in the grievance process, which governs all disputes between Illinois and caregivers arising from the terms of their agreement. See n. 2,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . And second, even if the regulation covered everything subject to collective bargaining, the majority's reasoning is a non-sequitur. All the regulation would do then is serve as suspenders to the duty of fair representation's belt: That Illinois has\n    <em>\n     two\n    </em>\n    ways to ensure that the results of collective bargaining redound to the benefit of all employees serves to compound, rather than mitigate, the union's free-rider problem.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    As far as I can tell, that covers the majority's reasons for distinguishing this case from\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    . And even when considered in combination, as the majority does, they do not succeed. What makes matters still worse is the perverse result of the majority's decision: It penalizes the State for giving disabled persons some control over their own care. If Illinois had structured the program, as it could have, to centralize every aspect of the employment relationship, no question could possibly\n    have arisen about\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's application. Nothing should change because the State chose to respect the dignity and independence of program beneficiaries by allowing them to select and discharge, as well as supervise day-to-day, their own caregivers. A joint employer remains an employer, and here, as I have noted, Illinois kept authority over all workforce-wide terms of employment-the very issues most likely to be the subject of collective bargaining. The State thus should also retain the prerogative-as part of its effort to \"ensure efficient and effective delivery of personal care services\"-to require all employees to contribute fairly to their bargaining agent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a (Exec. Order No. 2003-8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    <strong>\n     II\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Perhaps recognizing the difficulty of plausibly distinguishing this case from\n    <em>\n     Abood,\n    </em>\n    the petitioners raised a more fundamental question: the continued viability of\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    as to\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    public employees, even what the majority calls \"full-fledged\" ones.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2627. That issue occupied the brunt of the briefing and argument in this Court. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Brief for Petitioners 16-24; Brief for Respondent SEIU 15-44; Brief for Respondent Quinn 15-29; Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    14-28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-21, 32-39, 42-47, 50-60. The majority declines the petitioners' request to overturn precedent-and rightly so: This Court does not have anything close to the special justification necessary to overturn\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    .

And on top of that, \"[c]onsiderations in favor of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Payne,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/#p827\">\n     501 U.S., at 828\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108176\" index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/808/#p827\">\n     111 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, governments and unions across the country have entered into thousands of contracts involving millions of employees in reliance on\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    . Reliance interests do not come any stronger.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    The majority's criticisms of\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    do not remotely defeat those powerful reasons for adhering to the decision. The special justifications needed to reverse an opinion must go beyond demonstrations (much less assertions) that it was wrong; that is the very point of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    . And the majority's critique extends no further. It is mostly just a catalog of errors\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    supposedly committed-reproaches that could have been leveled as easily 40 years ago as today. Only the idea that\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    did not \"anticipate\" or \"foresee\" the difficulties of distinguishing between collective bargaining and political activities, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2632 - 2633, might be thought different. But in fact,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    predicted precisely those issues. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     431 U.S., at 236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"There will, of course, be difficult problems in drawing lines between collective-bargaining ... and ideological activities\"). It simply disagreed with today's majority about whether in this context, as in many others, lines that are less than pristine are still worth using. And in any event, the majority much overstates the difficulties of classifying union expenditures. The Court's most recent decision on the subject unanimously resolved the single issue that had divided lower courts. See\n    <em>\n     Locke,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679510\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/207/\">\n     555 U.S., at 217-221\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679510\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/207/\">\n     129 S.Ct. 798\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . So it is not surprising that the majority fails to offer any concrete examples of thorny classification problems. If the kind of hand-wringing about blurry lines that the majority offers were enough to justify breaking with precedent, we might have to discard whole volumes of the U.S. Reports.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    And the majority says nothing to the contrary: It does not pretend to have the requisite justifications to overrule\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    . Readers of today's decision will know that\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    does not rank on the majority's top-\n    ten list of favorite precedents-and that the majority could not restrain itself from saying (and saying and saying) so. Yet they will also know that the majority could not, even after receiving full-dress briefing and argument, come up with reasons anywhere near sufficient to reverse the decision. Much has gone wrong in today's ruling, but this has not: Save for an unfortunate hiving off of ostensibly \"partial-public\" employees,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2638,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    remains the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    And even apart from\n    <em>\n     stare decisis,\n    </em>\n    that result is as it should be; indeed, it is the only outcome that makes sense in the context of our caselaw. In numerous cases decided over many decades, this Court has addressed the government's authority to adopt measures limiting expression in the capacity not of sovereign but of employer.\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    fits-fits hand-in-glove-with all those cases, in both reasoning and result. Were that rule not in place, our law respecting public employees' speech rights would contain a serious anomaly-a different legal standard (and not a good one) applying exclusively to union fees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    This Court has long acknowledged that the government has wider constitutional latitude when it is acting as employer than as sovereign.

Accordingly, we have devised methods for distinguishing between speech restrictions reflecting the kind of concerns private employers often hold (which are constitutional) and those exploiting the employment relationship to restrict employees' speech as private citizens (which are not).

But the Court concluded that the government, acting as employer, should have the same prerogative as a private business in deciding how best to negotiate with its employees over such matters as wages and benefits. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     at 229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]here can be no principled basis for\" distinguishing between a public and private employer's view that a fair-share clause will promote \"labor stability\"). At the same time, the Court recognized the need for some mechanism to ensure that the government could not leverage its power as employer to impinge on speech its employees undertook as citizens on matters of public import. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     at 234-236\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The Court struck the appropriate balance by drawing a line, corresponding to\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    's, between fees for collective bargaining and those for political activities. On the one side,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    decided, speech within the employment relationship about pay and working conditions pertains mostly to private concerns and implicates the government's interests as employer; thus, the government could compel fair-share fees for collective bargaining. On the other side, speech in political campaigns relates to matters of public concern and has no bearing on the government's interest in structuring its workforce; thus, compelled fees for those activities are forbidden. In that way, the law surrounding fair-share provisions coheres with the law relating to public employees' speech generally. Or, said otherwise, an anomaly in the government's regulation of its workforce would arise in\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's absence: Public employers could then pursue all policies, except this single one, reasonably designed to manage personnel and enhance the effectiveness of their programs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    The majority's critique of\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    principally goes astray by deeming all this irrelevant. This Court, the majority insists, has never \"seen\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    as based on\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    balancing.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2641. But to rely on\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    ' s failure to cite\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    more often, as the majority does, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2641, n. 26, is to miss the essential point. Although stemming from different historic antecedents, the two decisions addressed variants of the same issue: the extent of the government's power to adopt employment conditions affecting expression. And as just discussed, the two gave strikingly parallel answers, providing a coherent framework to adjudicate the constitutionality of those regulations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    To the extent the majority engages with that framework, its analysis founders at\n    the first step, in assessing the First Amendment value of the speech at issue here. A running motif of the majority opinion is that collective bargaining in the public sector raises significant questions about the level of government spending.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2632 - 2633 and n. 7, 2642 and nn. 28-29. By financing the SEIU's collective bargaining over wages and benefits, the majority suggests, in-home caregivers-whether they wish to or not-take one side in a debate about those issues.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    But that view of the First Amendment interests at stake blinks decades' worth of this Court's precedent. Our decisions (tracing from\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    as well as\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    ) teach that internal workplace speech about public employees' wages, benefits, and such-that is, the prosaic stuff of collective bargaining-does not become speech of \"public concern\" just because those employment terms may have broader consequence. To the contrary, we have made clear that except in narrow circumstances we will not allow an employee to make a \"federal constitutional issue\" out of basic \"employment matters, including working conditions, pay, discipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and terminations.\"\n    <em>\n     Borough of Duryea v.

Indeed, even\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's original detractors conceded that an employee's interest in expressing views, within the workplace context, about \"narrowly defined economic issues [like] salaries and pension benefits\" is \"relatively insignificant\" and \"weak.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"372\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     431 U.S., at 263, n. 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Powell, J., concurring in judgment). (Those Justices saved their fire for teachers' speech relating to education policy. See\n    <em>\n     ibid.\n    </em>\n    ) And nowhere has the Court ever suggested, as the majority does today, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2642 and n. 28, that if a certain dollar amount is at stake (but how much, exactly?), the constitutional treatment of an employee's expression becomes any different.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    Consider an analogy, not involving union fees: Suppose an employee violates a government employer's work rules by demanding, at various inopportune times and places, higher wages for both himself and his co-workers (which, of course, will drive up public spending). The government employer disciplines the employee, and he brings a First Amendment claim. Would the Court consider his speech a matter of public concern under\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    ? I cannot believe it would, and indeed the petitioners' own counsel joins me in that view. He maintained at oral argument that such speech would concern merely an \"internal proprietary matter,\" thus allowing the employer to take disciplinary action. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 10. If the majority thinks otherwise, government entities across the country should prepare themselves for unprecedented limitations on their ability to regulate their workforces. But again, I doubt they need to worry, because this Court has never come close to holding that any matter of public employment affecting public spending (which is to say most such matters) becomes for that reason alone an issue of public concern. (And on the off-chance that both the petitioners and I are wrong on that score, I am doubly confident that the government would prevail under\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    's balancing test.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    I can see no reason to treat the expressive interests of workers objecting to payment of union fees, like the petitioners here, as worthy of greater consideration. The subject matter of the speech is the same: wages and benefits for public employees. Or to put the point more fully: In both cases (mine and the real one), the employer is sanctioning employees for\n    choosing either to say or not to say something respecting their terms and conditions of employment. Of course, in my hypothetical, the employer is stopping the employee from speaking, whereas in this or any other case involving union fees, the employer is forcing the employee to support such expression. But I am sure the majority would agree that that difference does not make a difference-in other words, that the \"difference between compelled speech and compelled silence\" is \"without constitutional significance.\"\n    <em>\n     Riley v.

Hence, in analyzing the kind of expression involved in this case,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    corresponds to\n    <em>\n     Pickering\n    </em>\n    (and vice versa)-with each permitting a government to regulate such activity in aid of managing its workforce to provide public services.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Perhaps, though, the majority's skepticism about\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    comes from a different source: its failure to fully grasp the government's interest in bargaining with an adequately funded exclusive bargaining representative.

A State, the majority (a bit grudgingly) acknowledges, may well have reasons to bargain with a single agent for all employees; and without a fair-share agreement, that union's activities will benefit employees who do not pay dues.

The law compels unions to represent-and represent fairly-every worker in a bargaining unit, regardless whether they join or contribute to the union. That creates a collective action problem of far greater magnitude than in the typical interest group, because the union cannot give any special advantages to its own backers. In such a circumstance, not just those who oppose but those who favor a union have an economic incentive to withhold dues; only altruism or loyalty-as\n    <em>\n     against\n    </em>\n    financial self-interest-can explain their support. Hence arises the legal rule countenancing fair-share agreements: It ensures that a union will receive adequate funding, notwithstanding its legally imposed disability-and so that a government wishing to bargain with an exclusive representative will have a viable counterpart.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    As is often the case, Justice SCALIA put the point best:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    \"Where the state imposes upon the union a duty to deliver services, it may permit the union to demand reimbursement for them; or, looked at from the other end, where the state creates in the nonmembers a legal entitlement from\n    the union, it may compel them to pay the cost. The 'compelling state interest' that justifies this constitutional rule is not simply elimination of the inequity arising from the fact that some union activity redounds to the benefit of 'free-riding' nonmembers; private speech often furthers the interests of nonspeakers, and that does not alone empower the state to compel the speech to be paid for. What is distinctive, however, about the 'free riders' [in unions] ... is that ... the law\n    <em>\n     requires\n    </em>\n    the union to carry [them]-indeed, requires the union to go\n    <em>\n     out of its way\n    </em>\n    to benefit [them], even at the expense of its other interests....

Exactly right; indeed, that is as clear a one-sentence account of\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    's free-rider rationale as appears in this Court's decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Still, the majority too quickly says, it has no worries in this case: Given that Illinois's caregivers voted to unionize, \"it may be presumed that a high percentage of [them] became union members and are willingly paying union dues.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2641. But in fact nothing of the sort may be so presumed, given that union supporters (no less than union detractors) have an economic incentive to free ride. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2656 - 2657. The federal workforce, on which the majority relies, see\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2640, provides a case in point. There many fewer employees pay dues than have voted for a union to represent them.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fr37\" name=\"fr37\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    And why, after all, should that endemic free-riding be surprising? Does the majority think that public employees are immune from basic principles of economics? If not, the majority can have no basis for thinking that absent a fair-share clause, a union can attract sufficient dues to adequately support its functions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    This case in fact offers a prime illustration of how a fair-share agreement may serve important government interests. Recall that Illinois decided that collective bargaining with an exclusive representative of in-home caregivers would enable it to provide improved services through its Rehabilitation Program. See\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 2648. The State thought such bargaining would enable it to attract a better and more stable workforce to serve disabled patients, preventing their institutionalization and thereby decreasing total state expenditures. The majority does not deny the State's legitimate interest in choosing to negotiate with an exclusive bargaining agent, in service of administering an effective program. See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2640 - 2641. But the majority does deny Illinois the means it reasonably deemed appropriate to effectuate that policy-a fair-share provision ensuring that the union has the funds necessary to carry out its responsibilities\n    on behalf of in-home caregivers. The majority does so against the weight of all precedent, and based on \"empirical assumption[s],\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2634, lacking any foundation.\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    got this matter right; the majority gets it wrong: Illinois has a more than sufficient interest, in managing its workforce and administering the Rehabilitation Program, to require employees to pay a fair share of a union's costs of collective bargaining.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    For many decades, Americans have debated the pros and cons of right-to-work laws and fair-share requirements. All across the country and continuing to the present day, citizens have engaged in passionate argument about the issue and have made disparate policy choices. The petitioners in this case asked this Court to end that discussion for the entire public sector, by overruling\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    and thus imposing a right-to-work regime for all government employees. The good news out of this case is clear: The majority declined that radical request. The Court did not, as the petitioners wanted, deprive every state and local government, in the management of their employees and programs, of the tool that many have thought necessary and appropriate to make collective bargaining work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    The bad news is just as simple: The majority robbed Illinois of that choice in administering its in-home care program. For some 40 years,\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    has struck a stable balance-consistent with this Court's general framework for assessing public employees' First Amendment claims-between those employees' rights and government entities' interests in managing their workforces. The majority today misapplies\n    <em>\n     Abood,\n    </em>\n    which properly should control this case. Nothing separates, for purposes of that decision, Illinois's personal assistants from any other public employees. The balance\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    struck thus should have defeated the petitioners' demand to invalidate Illinois's fair-share agreement. I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-204\">\n     The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

As we have explained, the best argument that can be mounted in support of\n     <em>\n      Abood\n     </em>\n     is based on the fact that a union, in serving as the exclusive representative of all the employees in a bargaining unit, is required by law to engage in certain activities that benefit nonmembers and that the union would not undertake if it did not have a legal obligation to do so. But where the law withholds from the union the authority to engage in most of those activities, the argument for\n     <em>\n      Abood\n     </em>\n     is weakened. Here, the dissent does not claim that the union's approach to negotiations on wages or benefits would be any different if it were not required to negotiate on behalf of the nonmembers as well as members. And there is no dispute that the law does not require the union to undertake the burden of representing personal assistants with respect to their grievances with customers; on the contrary, the law entirely excludes the union from that process. The most that the dissent can identify is the union's obligation to represent nonmembers regarding grievances with the State, but since most aspects of the personal assistants' work is controlled entirely by the customers, this obligation is relatively slight. It bears little resemblance to the obligation imposed on the union in\n     <em>\n      Abood\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"19.\">\n    <p id=\"p-223\">\n     It is therefore unnecessary for us to reach petitioners' argument that\n     <em>\n      Abood\n     </em>\n     should be overruled, and the dissent's extended discussion of\n     <em>\n      stare decisis\n     </em>\n     is beside the point.

The $338 payment at issue in\n     <em>\n      Guarnieri\n     </em>\n     had a negligible impact on public coffers, but payments made to public-sector bargaining units may have massive implications for government spending.

We do not doubt that a single public employee's pay is usually not a matter of public concern.

This latter program is similar in its basic structure to the Rehabilitation Program, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a, but the Disabilities Program personal assistants have not yet unionized. The Disabilities Program petitioners claim that under Illinois Executive Order No. 2009-15, they face imminent unionization and, along with it, compulsory dues payments.

The decisions I cite dealt with First Amendment claims that joint or contract employees made against the government. The only difference is that those suits challenged different restrictions on the employees' expressive activities.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4.\">\n    <p id=\"p-239\">\n     In a related argument, the majority frets that if\n     <em>\n      Abood\n     </em>\n     extends to the joint employees here, a \"host of workers who receive payments from a governmental entity for some sort of service would be candidates for inclusion within\n     <em>\n      Abood\n     </em>\n     's reach.\"\n     <em>\n      Ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2638. But as I have just shown, this Court has not allowed such worries about line-drawing to limit the government's authority over joint and contract employees in the past. And rightly so, because whatever close cases may arise at the margin (there always are some), the essential distinction between such employees and mere recipients of government funding is not hard to maintain. Consider again the combination of things Illinois does here: set wages, provide benefits, administer payroll, withhold taxes, set minimum qualifications, specify terms of standard contracts, develop individualized service plans, fund orientation and training, facilitate annual reviews, and resolve certain grievances. That combination of functions places the petitioners so securely on one side of the boundary between public employees and mere recipients of public funding as to justify deferral of line-drawing angst to another case.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5.\">\n    <p id=\"p-240\">\n     As the opinion's quadruple repetition of the words \"appear\" and \"apparently\" suggests,\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2634 - 2635, the majority is mostly guessing as to in-home caregivers' eligibility for various state programs.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6.\">\n    <p id=\"p-241\">\n     The majority also suggests in this part of its opinion that even if the union had latitude to demand higher wages only for its own supporters, it would not do so.
