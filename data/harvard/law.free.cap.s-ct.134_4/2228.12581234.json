The Lanham Act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20321\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), 331. To implement the FDCA's provisions, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling, including one concerning juice blends. Unlike the Lanham Act, which, relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors, the FDCA and its regulations give the United States nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit private enforcement suits. The FDCA also pre-empts certain state misbranding laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Petitioner POM Wonderful LLC, which produces, markets, and sells,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a pomegranate-blueberry juice blend, filed a Lanham Act suit against respondent Coca-Cola Company, alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of one of Coca-Cola's juice blends mislead consumers into believing the product\n   consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices, and that the ensuing confusion causes POM to lose sales. The District Court granted partial summary judgment to Coca-Cola, ruling that the FDCA and its regulations preclude Lanham Act challenges to the name and label of Coca-Cola's juice blend. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : Competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like POM's challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA. Pp. 2236 - 2241.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (a) This result is based on the following premises. First, this is not a pre-emption case, for it does not raise the question whether state law is pre-empted by a federal law, see\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v. Levine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    555 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute. Pre-emption principles may nonetheless be instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on the same subject. Second, this is a statutory interpretation case; and analysis of the statutory text, aided by established interpretation rules, controls. See\n   <em>\n    Chickasaw Nation v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    534 U.S. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    122 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While a principle of interpretation may be countered \"by some maxim pointing in a different direction,\"\n   <em>\n    Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p115\">\n    532 U.S. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p115\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p115\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court need not decide what maxim establishes the proper framework here: Even assuming that Coca-Cola is correct that the Court's task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied repeal in part of another statute, Coca-Cola is incorrect that the best way to do that is to bar POM's Lanham Act claim. Pp. 2236 - 2237.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (b) Neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in express terms, forbids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA. The absence of such a textual provision when the Lanham Act and the FDCA have coexisted for over 70 years is \"powerful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means\" of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling. See\n   <em>\n    Wyeth,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, and contrary to Coca-Cola's argument, Congress, by taking care to pre-empt only some state laws, if anything indicated it did not intend the FDCA to preclude requirements arising from other sources. See\n   <em>\n    Setser v. United States,\n   </em>\n   566 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/#p1469\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1469-1470,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/#p1469\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The structures of the FDCA and the Lanham Act reinforce this conclusion. Where two statutes are complementary, it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that Congress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the operation of the other. See\n   <em>\n    J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int'l, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108062\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/124/#p144\">\n    534 U.S. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108062\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/124/#p144\">\n    122 S.Ct. 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108062\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/124/#p144\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Lanham Act and the FDCA complement each other in major respects, for each has its own scope and purpose. Both touch on food and beverage labeling, but the Lanham Act protects commercial interests against unfair competition, while the FDCA protects public health and safety. They also complement each other with respect to remedies. The FDCA's enforcement is largely committed to the FDA, while the Lanham Act empowers private parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-case basis. Allowing Lanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies among multiple methods of regulation. A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage\n   labels also could lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend. Because the FDA does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regarding all objectionable labels, preclusion of Lanham Act claims could leave commercial interests-and indirectly the public at large-with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in other less regulated industries. Pp. 2237 - 2239.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (c) Coca-Cola's arguments do not support its claim that preclusion is proper because Congress intended national uniformity in food and beverage labeling. First, the FDCA's delegation of enforcement authority to the Federal Government does not indicate that Congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes. Second, the FDCA's express pre-emption provision applies by its terms to state, not federal, law. Even if it were proper to stray from that text, it not clear that Coca-Cola's national uniformity assertions reflect the congressional design. Finally, the FDCA and its implementing regulations may address food and beverage labeling with more specificity than the Lanham Act, but this specificity would matter only if the two Acts cannot be implemented in full at the same time. Here, neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the Court is aware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms. Pp. 2239 - 2240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (d) The Government's intermediate position-that a Lanham Act claim is precluded \"to the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations specifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label,\" and that this rule precludes POM's challenge to the name of Coca-Cola's product-is flawed, for the Government assumes that the FDCA and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling when Congress intended the Lanham Act and the FDCA to complement each other with respect to labeling. Though the FDA's rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests, it neither discusses nor cites the Lanham Act; and the Government points to no other statement suggesting that the FDA considered the full scope of interests protected by the Lanham Act. Even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so, it is a bridge too far to accept an agency's after-the-fact statement to justify that result here. An agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.

App. 23a. One of POM's competitors is the Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola's Minute Maid Division makes a juice blend sold with a label that, in describing the contents, displays the words \"pomegranate blueberry\" with far more prominence than other words on the label that show the juice to be a blend of five juices. In truth, the Coca-Cola product contains but 0.3% pomegranate juice and 0.2% blueberry juice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Alleging that the use of that label is deceptive and misleading, POM sued Coca-Cola under \u00a7 43 of the Lanham Act.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20441\">\n     60 Stat. 441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , as amended,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That provision allows one competitor to sue another if it alleges unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that, in the realm of labeling for food and beverages, a Lanham Act claim like POM's is precluded by a second federal statute. The second statute is the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which forbids the misbranding of food, including by means of false or misleading labeling. \u00a7\u00a7 301, 403,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%201042\">\n     52 Stat. 1042\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1047, as amended,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20331\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 343.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The ruling that POM's Lanham Act cause of action is precluded by the FDCA was incorrect. There is no statutory text or established interpretive principle to support the contention that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act suits like the one brought by POM in this case. Nothing in the text, history, or structure of the FDCA or the Lanham Act shows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these suits. Quite to the contrary, the FDCA and the Lanham Act complement each other in the federal regulation of misleading food and beverage labels. Competitors, in their own interest, may bring Lanham Act claims like POM's that challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated by the FDCA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    This case concerns the intersection and complementarity of these two federal laws.

As the Court held this Term, the private remedy may be invoked only by those who \"allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.

One provision of those regulations is particularly relevant to this case: If a juice\n    blend does not name all the juices it contains and mentions only juices that are not predominant in the blend, then it must either declare the percentage content of the named juice or \"[i]ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or flavoring,\"\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    \"raspberry and cranberry flavored juice drink.\" \u00a7 102.33(d). The Government represents that the FDA does not preapprove juice labels under these regulations. See Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    in Opposition 16. That contrasts with the FDA's regulation of other types of labels, such as drug labels, see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), and is consistent with the less extensive role the FDA plays in the regulation of food than in the regulation of drugs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Unlike the Lanham Act, which relies in substantial part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors, the FDCA and its regulations provide the United States with nearly exclusive enforcement authority, including the authority to seek criminal sanctions in some circumstances.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20333\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), 337.

The answer to that question is based on the following premises.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    First, this is not a pre-emption case. In pre-emption cases, the question is whether state law is pre-empted by a federal statute, or in some instances, a federal agency action. See\n    <em>\n     Wyeth v. Levine,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     555 U.S. 555\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 563,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     173 L.Ed.2d 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009). This case, however, concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute. So the state-federal balance does not frame the inquiry. Because this is a preclusion case, any \"presumption against pre-emption,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n      id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     at 565, n. 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , has no force. In addition, the preclusion analysis is not governed by the Court's complex categorization of the types of pre-emption. See\n    <em>\n     Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413796\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/363/#p372\">\n     530 U.S. 363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 372-373,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413796\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/363/#p372\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2288\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413796\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/363/#p372\">\n     147 L.Ed.2d 352\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000). Although the Court's pre-emption precedent does not govern preclusion analysis in this case, its principles are instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws that bear on the same subject.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Second, this is a statutory interpretation case and the Court relies on traditional rules of statutory interpretation. That does not change because the case involves multiple federal statutes. See\n    <em>\n     FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p137\">\n     529 U.S. 120\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 137-139,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p137\">\n     120 S.Ct. 1291\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p137\">\n     146 L.Ed.2d 121\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000). Nor does it change because an agency is involved. See\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p137\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Analysis of the statutory text, aided by established principles of interpretation, controls.

Adams,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p115\">\n     532 U.S. 105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 115,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p115\">\n     121 S.Ct. 1302\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300786\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/105/#p115\">\n     149 L.Ed.2d 234\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001). It is thus unsurprising that in this case a threshold dispute has arisen as to which of two competing maxims establishes the proper framework for decision. POM argues that this case concerns whether one statute, the FDCA as amended, is an \"implied repeal\" in part of another\n    statute,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    the Lanham Act. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carcieri v. Salazar,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679608\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/379/#p395\">\n     555 U.S. 379\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 395,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343136,3679608\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/129/1058/\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1058\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679608\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/379/#p395\">\n     172 L.Ed.2d 791\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009). POM contends that in such cases courts must give full effect to both statutes unless they are in \"irreconcilable conflict,\" see\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    and that this high standard is not satisfied here. Coca-Cola resists this canon and its high standard. Coca-Cola argues that the case concerns whether a more specific law, the FDCA, clarifies or narrows the scope of a more general law, the Lanham Act. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Fausto,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600843\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/439/#p453\">\n     484 U.S. 439\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 453,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3348824,600843\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/108/668/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600843\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/439/#p453\">\n     98 L.Ed.2d 830\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1988); Brief for Respondent 18. The Court's task, it claims, is to \"reconcil[e]\" the laws,\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    and it says the best reconciliation is that the more specific provisions of the FDCA bar certain causes of action authorized in a general manner by the Lanham Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Court does not need to resolve this dispute. Even assuming that Coca-Cola is correct that the Court's task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes and not, as POM urges, to enforce both statutes in full unless there is a genuinely irreconcilable conflict, Coca-Cola is incorrect that the best way to harmonize the statutes is to bar POM's Lanham Act claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Beginning with the text of the two statutes, it must be observed that neither the Lanham Act nor the FDCA, in express terms, forbids or limits Lanham Act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the FDCA. By its terms, the Lanham Act subjects to suit any person who \"misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin\" of goods or services.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). This comprehensive imposition of liability extends, by its own terms, to misrepresentations on labels, including food and beverage labels. No other provision in the Lanham Act limits that understanding or purports to govern the relevant interaction between the Lanham Act and the FDCA. And the FDCA, by its terms, does not preclude Lanham Act suits. In consequence, food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA are not, under the terms of either statute, off limits to Lanham Act claims. No textual provision in either statute discloses a purpose to bar unfair competition claims like POM's.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    This absence is of special significance because the Lanham Act and the FDCA have coexisted since the passage of the Lanham Act in 1946.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20427\">\n     60 Stat. 427\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1946); ch. 675,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%201040\">\n     52 Stat. 1040\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1938). If Congress had concluded, in light of experience, that Lanham Act suits could interfere with the FDCA, it might well have enacted a provision addressing the issue during these 70 years. See\n    <em>\n     Wyeth,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     at 574\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"If Congress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an express pre-emption provision at some point during the FDCA's 70-year history\"). Congress enacted amendments to the FDCA and the Lanham Act, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Stat.%202353\">\n     104 Stat. 2353\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, \u00a7 132,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Stat.%203946\">\n     102 Stat. 3946\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , including an amendment that added to the FDCA an express pre-emption provision with respect to state laws addressing food and beverage misbranding, \u00a7 6,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Stat.%202362\">\n     104 Stat. 2362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Yet Congress did not enact a provision addressing the preclusion of other federal laws that might bear on food and beverage labeling.

Just as significant, the provision does not refer to requirements imposed by other sources of law, such as federal statutes. For purposes of deciding whether the FDCA displaces a regulatory or liability scheme in another statute, it makes a substantial difference whether that other statute is state or federal.

Enforcement of the FDCA and the detailed prescriptions of its implementing regulations is largely committed to the FDA. The FDA, however, does not have the same perspective or expertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day competitors possess. Competitors who manufacture or distribute products have detailed knowledge regarding how consumers rely upon certain sales and marketing strategies. Their awareness of unfair competition practices may be far more immediate and accurate than that of agency rulemakers and regulators. Lanham Act suits draw upon this market expertise by empowering private parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a case-by-case basis. By \"serv[ing] a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward,\" Lanham Act suits, to the extent they touch on the same subject matter as the FDCA, \"provide incentives\" for manufacturers\n    to behave well. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 579,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679327\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/555/#p563\">\n     129 S.Ct. 1187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Allowing Lanham Act suits takes advantage of synergies among multiple methods of regulation. This is quite consistent with the congressional design to enact two different statutes, each with its own mechanisms to enhance the protection of competitors and consumers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    A holding that the FDCA precludes Lanham Act claims challenging food and beverage labels would not only ignore the distinct functional aspects of the FDCA and the Lanham Act but also would lead to a result that Congress likely did not intend. Unlike other types of labels regulated by the FDA, such as drug labels, see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), it would appear the FDA does not preapprove food and beverage labels under its regulations and instead relies on enforcement actions, warning letters, and other measures. See Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    in Opposition 16. Because the FDA acknowledges that it does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regarding all objectionable labels,\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    if Lanham Act claims were to be precluded then commercial interests-and indirectly the public at large-could be left with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in many other, less regulated industries. It is unlikely that Congress intended the FDCA's protection of health and safety to result in less policing of misleading food and beverage labels than in competitive markets for other products.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     C\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Coca-Cola argues the FDCA precludes POM's Lanham Act claim because Congress intended national uniformity in food and beverage labeling. Coca-Cola notes three aspects of the FDCA to support that position: delegation of enforcement authority to the Federal Government rather than private parties; express pre-emption with respect to state laws; and the specificity of the FDCA and its implementing regulations. But these details of the FDCA do not establish an intent or design to preclude Lanham Act claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Coca-Cola says that the FDCA's delegation of enforcement authority to the Federal Government shows Congress' intent to achieve national uniformity in labeling. But POM seeks to enforce the Lanham Act, not the FDCA or its regulations. The centralization of FDCA enforcement authority in the Federal Government does not indicate that Congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Coca-Cola next appeals to the pre-emption provision added to the FDCA in 1990. See \u00a7 343-1. It argues that allowing Lanham Act claims to proceed would undermine the pre-emption provision's goal of ensuring that food and beverage manufacturers can market nationally without the burden of complying with a patchwork of requirements. A significant flaw in this argument is that the pre-emption provision by its plain terms applies only to certain state-law requirements, not to federal law. See Part II-B,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . Coca-Cola in effect asks the Court to ignore the words \"State or political subdivision of a State\" in the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Even if it were proper to stray from the text in this way, it is far from clear that Coca-Cola's assertions about national uniformity in fact reflect the congressional design. Although the application of a federal statute such as the Lanham Act by judges and juries in courts throughout the country may give rise to some variation in outcome, this is the means Congress chose to enforce a national policy to ensure fair competition. It is quite different from the disuniformity that would arise from the multitude of state laws, state regulations, state administrative agency rulings, and\n    state-court decisions that are partially forbidden by the FDCA's pre-emption provision. Congress not infrequently permits a certain amount of variability by authorizing a federal cause of action even in areas of law where national uniformity is important.

The Lanham Act itself is an example of this design: Despite Coca-Cola's protestations, the Act is uniform in extending its protection against unfair competition to the whole class it describes. It is variable only to the extent that those rights are enforced on a case-by-case basis. The variability about which Coca-Cola complains is no different than the variability that any industry covered by the Lanham Act faces. And, as noted, Lanham Act actions are a means to implement a uniform policy to prohibit unfair competition in all covered markets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Finally, Coca-Cola urges that the FDCA, and particularly its implementing regulations, addresses food and beverage labeling with much more specificity than is found in the provisions of the Lanham Act. That is true. The pages of FDA rulemakings devoted only to juice-blend labeling attest to the level of detail with which the FDA has examined the subject.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    Food Labeling; Declaration of Ingredients; Common or Usual Name for Nonstandardized Foods; Diluted Juice Beverages, 58 Fed.Reg. 2897-2926 (1993). Because, as we have explained, the FDCA and the Lanham Act are complementary and have separate scopes and purposes, this greater specificity would matter only if the Lanham Act and the FDCA cannot be implemented in full at the same time.

But neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the Court is aware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms.

It submits that a Lanham Act claim is precluded \"to the extent the FDCA or FDA regulations specifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of [the] label.\" Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    11. Applying that standard, the Government argues that POM may not bring a Lanham Act challenge to the name of Coca-Cola's product, but that other aspects of the label may be challenged. That is because, the Government argues, the FDA regulations specifically authorize the names of juice blends but not the other aspects of the label that are at issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    In addition to raising practical concerns about drawing a distinction between regulations that \"specifically ... authorize\" a course of conduct and those that merely tolerate that course,\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 10-11, the flaw in the Government's intermediate position is the same as that in Coca-Cola's theory of the case. The Government assumes that the FDCA and its regulations are at least in some circumstances a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling. But, as discussed above, Congress intended the Lanham Act and the FDCA to complement each other with respect to food and beverage labeling.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Government claims that the \"FDA's juice-naming regulation reflects the agency's 'weigh[ing of] the competing interests relevant to the particular requirement in question.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 19 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Medtronic, Inc. v.

The rulemaking indeed does allude, at one point, to a balancing of interests: It styles a particular requirement as \"provid[ing] manufacturers with flexibility for labeling products while providing consumers with information that they need.\" 58 Fed.Reg. 2919-2920. But that rulemaking does not discuss or even cite the Lanham Act, and the Government cites no other statement in the rulemaking suggesting that the FDA considered the full scope of the interests the Lanham Act protects. In addition, and contrary to the language quoted above, the FDA explicitly encouraged manufacturers to include material on their labels that is not required by the regulations.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 2919. A single isolated reference to a desire for flexibility is not sufficient to transform a rulemaking that is otherwise at best inconclusive as to its interaction with other federal laws into one with preclusive force, even on the assumption that a federal regulation in some instances might preclude application of a federal statute.
