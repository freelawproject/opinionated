Welford Holmes et al., from order of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Co., Sept. T., 1907, No. 8-4, refusing application for Charter of Iron City Lodge No. 17, Improved Benevolent <em>&amp; </em>Protective Order of Elks of the World.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmW\">Before Rice, P. J., Porter, Henderson, Morrison, Orlady, Head and Beaver, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AbEg\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\">Exceptions to application for charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">The court filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-6\">The purposes of the proposed corporation are proper, the organization is composed of worthy citizens of this county, and the charter should be granted unless the exceptions are well taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">They are filed by Pittsburg Lodge No. 11, Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, a corporation incorporated by the court of common pleas No. 2, of this county in the year 1891, the lodge itself having existed since 1878, and they are in short that the application is made with intent to produce confusion in the public mind in respect to the identity of the proposed corporation and that of the exceptant and is a fraud upon the exceptant; and, secondly, that the effect of granting the charter would be to produce confusion in the public mind in respect to identity with consequent injury to the exceptant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">A third exception is that the application is contained upon more than one sheet of paper. With reference to this exception it is to be regretted that the practice of the courts of this county has been relaxed, and the rule laid down by Chief Justice Lowrie In re Alexander Presbyterian Church, 30 Pa. 154, would be a wholesome addition to our rules of court. The writer of this opinion endeavored to enforce that practice but found that it was not uniform and has felt obliged to content himself with recommending that it be followed. This exception is not sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\">The date of the organization of the order of which the applicant lodge is a part does not appear, although the lodge itself was organized in 1902. It was charged in the testimony with being an imitation, and we may safely assume that had it antedated that of the exceptant the fact would have appeared. It is a palpable imitation of the other organization not only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>name but in the denomination of its officers, in the insignia and emblems of the order, and it is apparent that an effort has been made to approach as nearly as possible without transgressing the line bounding the rights of the exceptant. It is to be regretted that with nearly the whole animal kingdom to choose from the applicants did not select some name not already preempted. With the enormous growth of social and fraternal organizations the time seems to be not far distant when the roll of names will be exhausted, but it is not yet at hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\">The distinguishing as well as the common appellation of the exceptants is \u201cElk.\u201d The members are known as Elks, their clubhouse as \u201cElk\u2019s Lodge.\u201d Its members wear a small metal elk\u2019s head, and the device B. P. O. E. is used to indicate the name of the order. It is a fraternal order, and one of its principal purposes is beneficial in the aiding of sick members and the widows and children of those deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">The applicants\u2019 organization is in these respects identical except that the device was described by counsel as having a small I. before and a small W. after the B. P. O. E., and their house is known as \u201cElk\u2019s Rest.\u201d They have, of course, a perfect right to have the same purposes, and the testimony as to the other matters is important in showing that they aid in creating the confusion which exists.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">The exceptant\u2019s constitution confines the membership to persons of the white race. There is no such limitation in that of the applicant, and thus far all of its members are of the negro race. This fact, if known by the public, would prevent confusion as to which order a member belonged, but the ground of the objection made is not that the exceptant would lose members or business. It is that confusion will result, in fact has already resulted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">There is no doubt that confusion has arisen. Telephone calls to the wrong house, letters delivered to the exceptant\u2019s place intended for that of the applicant, a case of whisky, which both parties repudiate, was delivered with the bill to exceptant\u2019s clubhouse, and a large number of colored men have sought admission to the white men\u2019s building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">\u201cBut even without this, the authorities have settled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>exclusive right of a corporation to its name is one that of itself carries the presumption of injury by interference and will therefore be protected:\u201d Mitchell, C. J., in American Clay Manufacturing Company v. American Clay Mfg. Co. of N. J., 198 Pa. 189. Although that was a case of a manufacturing corporation, it recognizes the right in a name. A beneficial society in a sense does business, and while it is not likely, as already said, that it will lose members the confusion in the minds of the public leading to mistakes in charging and delivering of goods, in the delivery of letters and in other ways will indoubtedly lead to financial loss. It was settled in that case that the intention was immaterial and cases were quoted and approved which held that the use of names not in all respects identical was an infringement upon the rights of those first to use them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-3\">There are many cases in this state refusing incorporation under somewhat similar circumstances as this, but it is only necessary to quote a few. In First Presbyterian Church of Harrisburg, 2 Grant, 240, the application for a charter in that name was refused because the chief justice knew of the existence of The English Presbyterian Church of Harrisburg \"and he thought that each would be known as the Presbyterian Church of Harrisburg, leading to confusion. While this case would probably not now be so decided, the underlying idea has governed the courts. A charter to the \u201cGrand Lodge of the Independent Order Sons of Progress\u201d was refused on exceptions filed by the \u201cGrand Lodge of the Order Sons of Progress,\u201d Judge Arnold disposing of the case in the brief sentences, \u201cBut the word \u2018Independent' is simply descriptive. The true name is Sons of Progress: \u201d 14 W. N. C. 31. So here the word \u201cImproved\u201d is simply descriptive, and the names of the two organizations are practically identical. In Polish National Catholic Church of St. Francis, 31 Pa. Superior Ct. 87, and Philadelphia Lying-In Charity v. Maternity Hospital, 29 Pa. Superior Ct. 420, the Superior Court would not interfere with the discretion of the lower court but approved the refusal of the charters. In the first case the objecting corporation's name was the St. Francis Roman Catholic Church, that of the applicant the Polish National Catholic Church of St. Francis. In the other the proposed name was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u201cThe Central Maternity and Hospital for Women,\u201d and that of the exceptant, \u201cThe Maternity Hospital.\u201d The court said, \u201cThe similarity of the name to that of another corporation having its hospital in the vicinity was a matter eminently proper for consideration by the court to whose sound legal discretion the application was addressed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">\u201cSt. Francis\u201d were the prominent distinguishing words in each of the churches, and Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks are such here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">We have considered the able argument and briefs of counsel with care but think we have demonstrated by the decisions of our own state that our refusal of the charter is based upon sound legal discretion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">The application is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree refusing the charter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-8\"><em>J. Welford Holmes, </em>for appellants. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-8\">It is a well-settled principle that the Superior Court will not review the discretion of the lower court in granting or refusing to grant a charter where there is nothing to show that the decree involved an abuse of discretion or where the decree of the lower court was based upon due consideration of local conditions and of all the pertinent facts and circumstances bearing upon the situation: Philadelphia Lying-In Charity v.
