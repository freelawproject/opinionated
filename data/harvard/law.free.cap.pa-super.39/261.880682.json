H. Baker to his wife and from his wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to these boys was a fraud upon the creditors, and if that were the case the purchases in the name of Baker Brothers of yams which were levied upon showing that they were purchased by Baker Brothers before the levy, they would be the property of E. H. Baker, we contend, and not the property of Baker Brothers, and that is why we contend this examination is proper. The machinery is only incidentally inquired of for the purpose of questioning the title of Baker Brothers, not by this transaction for that preceded the time that they got the title from their mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">The Court: The proposition here is, you claim title by virtue of purchase as it now stands from Mrs. E. H. Baker, and the contention of counsel for the defendant is that that purchase is not an honest purchase; the Baker Brothers are simply carrying on this business as a cover for E. H. Baker, their father. Now it is very difficult to limit the inquiry upon an examination of your witness as to the character of all the goods in this mill, as to the possession of all the goods, and as to the value of them and anything that may throw any light on this title. It is an attack on your title; that your title is a fraudulent title, and we think in a question of this kind the rule has been and is, as I understand it, to allow a great deal of latitude in the examination and cross-examination. They are attempting to show there is a fraud, but they cannot establish fraud by a five-minute examination or five-minute cross-examination, but that is not any reason why we should limit them to their cross-examination where they are attempting to show fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">Mr. Shepherd: What right have they got to bring in matters here that have no bearing upon this issue whatever?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">The Court: I am not prepared to say they have not some.

' We say for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. The consideration mentioned in the deeds and the bill of sale are the only considerations referred to in dollars and cents. There is no other valuable consideration referred to. It seems to me it is not fair and not right to add to these deeds and these papers that which was not part of them at the time, and not considered at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-4\">The Court: If the title to any of the real estate or property is in controversy here I think counsel would have a right to explain the full consideration, but it is not in controversy. The only property that is in controversy here at all were some few wooden boxes, a safe, scales and a few chairs. It seems to me that it would be proper if you desire to show the value of that property which is in controversy as paid for was a fair consideration, but I do not see the necessity of going into the full consideration of the real estate or personal property which is not in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-5\">Mr. Shepherd: The witness is called for further cross-examination for the purpose of showing the real consideration for the transfer of the properties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">Mr. Koch: We call this witness for further cross-examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-7\">Mr. Shepherd: Plaintiffs have called him and examined him for the purpose of showing the real consideration for the transfers which have been offered in evidence by the defendants in this case.

We therefore ask to cross-examine this witness on the value of this property, the real consideration of the transfer of these properties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-8\">The Court: The offering of those deeds and this bill of sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>was not to show the inadequacy of price, but was to show that Mr. Baker divested himself of all his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">Mr. Whalen: We have put in evidence the papers made by the Bakers themselves.

When this witness was upon the stand he was not asked anything in direct examination as to the consideration for the deed or the consideration in the bill of sale, and no inquiry was made of him as to the consideration of any kind of any transaction or sales or transfers, and therefore the question proposed is not a cross-examination and is incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-13\">Plaintiffs except.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The first three assignments of error relate to the admission of evidence, the nature of which appears in the offers quoted in the assignments, and its relevancy is shown by the following extract from the opinion of the learned court below overruling plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial: \u201cEdward S. Hyde, defendant above named, on May 29, 1902, obtained a judgment against E. H. Baker for $2,454.30 for goods sold to him by the defendant, Edward S.. Hyde, during the early part of the year 1901, and prior to the transfer of E. H. Baker of all his real estate and personal property to George W. Gise, an attorney, and by the attorney to Deborah L. Baker, wife of E. H. Baker, under whom the plaintiffs above named claim title. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>further establishes that at the same time E. H. Baker was indebted to other parties in several thousand dollars and that judgments were subsequently obtained against him. It further appears that Mr. Baker sold his bank stock for $3,100, and drew out of the bank $4,000 which the same day was credited to Baker Brothers, above named plaintiffs. Subsequent to Mr. Hyde obtaining his judgment on May 29, 1902, an execution was issued against Mr. Baker, the father, a levy made upon some of the personal property, which formerly belonged to the father and which had been sold to Gise, the attorney, on April 15,1901, and by him sold to Mrs. Baker, the wife of E. H. Baker and the mother of plaintiffs, who claimed the property in controversy. Under the evidence, the execution creditor claimed that the transfer by E. H. Baker, of practically all his property, was done for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, and the sale of the goods in controversy, to the plaintiffs and then carrying on of the business, which had been carried on for years by their father was simply a cover for their father to enable him to defeat his creditors. For this purpose the execution creditor put in evidence the bill of sale of the personal property, the deeds for the transfer of real estate, the sale of the bank stock, and the withdrawal of the $4,000, deposit of the father and the subsequent depositing of same to the credit of the sons, who are plaintiffs in this controversy, and followed these transfers by showing the value of the personal property and of the real estate.\u201d In connection with his references to these transactions and to the evidence as to the actual value of the property as contrasted with the expressed consideration, the learned trial judge said in his charge: \u201cThe object of admitting that evidence was to show on the part of the plaintiffs (defendant) that this transfer of the property by the father to the wife and the transfer of the money in bank from the father to the sons\u2019 account was done for the purpose of defrauding creditors, several creditors, at least of the father, and for the purpose of satisfying you that the sons, who are the plaintiffs in this case, knew of this fraudulent transaction and were a party to it, and that the sons at the present time, or at the time of the levy, subsequent to April 11, 1901, were carrying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>on this business simply as a cover for the father. In other words, that the business was really the father\u2019s business and not the sons\u2019 business, and that in my opinion is the vital question in this case.\u201d No part of the charge is assigned for error, and even if this part were, we would hold it to be a fair statement of the main question in the case, and as showing, without necessity for much argument, the relevancy thereto of the evidence now under consideration. In their affidavit in support of their claim, the plaintiffs alleged that they derived title to the property levied upon by sale from E. H. Baker. If so, it was competent for the defendant to show by all the circumstances that this transaction was part of one scheme to defraud the creditors of E. H. Baker. And, even if it be assumed that some of the property was acquired by the. plaintiffs from other sources in the course of the business after they ostensibly took charge of it, it certainly was competent to show that the business was really the father\u2019s and not the sons\u2019; and, as counsel for the appellee well say, in trying the title to the personal property levied on, the whole transaction had to be revealed in order to understand its different parts. \u201cThe rule that great latitude should be given in investigating questions of fraud is elementary: B. &amp; O. R. R. Co. v. Hoge, 34 Pa. 214. It was said in Reinhard v. Keenbartz, 6 Watts, 93: \u2018Upon the trial of an issue involving questions of fraud, great liberality should be allowed in the admission of evidence, that the jury may be able to determine from all the circumstances whether the transaction was fraudulent or not.\u2019 In Stauffer v. Young, 39 Pa. 455, the reason of the rule was fully and clearly stated: \u2018The meaning of the maxim that great liberality of evidence is to be allowed in the trial of questions of fraud is that every circumstance in the condition and relation of the parties, and every act and declaration of the person charged with the fraud, shall be competent evidence, if in the opinion of the judicial mind it bears such a relation to the transaction under investigation as in its nature is calculated to persuade the jury that the allegation of fraud is or is not well founded:\u2019 Fell, J., in Glessner v. Patterson, 164 Pa. 224. We are of opinion that the evidence under consideration is within the rule and the reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>of it and was properly admitted. The first three assignments are overruled. We remark in addition, lest our omission to do so be misunderstood, that the first and third assignments do not conform to our rule, in that they do not incorporate the evidence admitted under the offers, and might be dismissed for that reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">The appellant\u2019s counsel place greater reliance on the fourth assignment. The question arose in this way: In the presentation of their case the defendant called E. H. Baker, who was evidently not a friendly witness, and examined him as to the fact of his having transferred his real estate and personal property \u2014 a fact otherwise proved and not in dispute \u2014 but not as to the consideration. After the defendant rested, the plaintiffs recalled the witness for the purpose of showing the real consideration of the transfer. As shown by the bill of exception quoted in the assignment, considerable discussion took place between court and counsel as to the relevancy of the testimony, but in the end, counsel for plaintiff stated that they did not call him in rebuttal but for cross-examination. Then the objection was distinctly made that the proposed cross-examination did not relate to anything upon which he was examined in chief, and it is apparent that the court rejected the proposed cross-examination upon that ground. In this there was no error. The ruling, and it is the only ruling upon the examination or cross-examination of this witness that is assigned for error, did not preclude the plaintiffs from calling him in rebuttal and obtaining a ruling as to the relevancy of his testimony and assigning that for error, if it was against them. While they did afterwards call him distinctly in rebuttal, they have assigned no ruling then made for error. There were substantial reasons, growing out of the attitude of this witness towards the parties, why the defendant was justified in insisting that the plaintiffs\u2019 rebuttal should not be brought out in the cross-examination of the witness, unless it was strictly cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Upon a full consideration of all the matters assigned for error we find no cause for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
