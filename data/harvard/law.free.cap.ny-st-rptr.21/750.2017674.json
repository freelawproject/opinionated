They are, however? lessees who took a lease from the trustees, and being unable to meet their pecuniary obligations thereunder were relieved to the extent formally expressed in the agreement, mentioned, and to that extent only.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">Whatever may have been the power the managers possessed on that subject, they did not exercise it directly, but applied to the certificate holders who had a pecuniary interest in the rental secured by the lease, and asked their assent to the contemplated change of the liability of the rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>road company under that instrument, and having secured a large majority assenting, in virtue thereof and not from any inherent powers, made the compromise formulated by the agreement referred to. No ingenuity of counsel, no invocation of subtle device can overcome this fact. That paper expressly states that it is made on behalf of such holders of certificates, issued by the parties of the first part as trustees, or their predecessors in the trust as have already authorized or should thereafter authorize the same, and had caused or should cause such authorization to be endorsed upon the respective certificates held by them, and thus contracted for them, and such as should subsequently come in and assent to the arrangement. The defendant railroad company was advised therefore at the outset of this feature of the compromise, that all the parties in interest, namely, the certificate holders, had not acquiesced and could have refused to accept the partial compact, had they seen fit to adopt that course. The agreement by the trustees, clearly bound the assenting holders of the certificates, and the railroad company as lessees, were benefited to that extent, and the agreement, though limited as to such holders, was an advantage to themselves by payment to them under it and according to its terms. It makes no difference whether the original compact or organization created a co-partnership or not, inasmuch' as the railroad company by accepting a lease, assumed new responsibilities and relations \u201cto the Car Trust of New York No. 2,\u201d duly expressed in writing, and that relation has continued, however changed or modified the terms of the lease. They are designated as lessees, and the cars and locomotives are hired and let and leased to them by that instrument. The trustees did not, as already suggested, modify the terms of that paper, by any exercise of authority derived from any source other than from the assenting certificate holders, whose assent had been obtained as proved upon the trial. What they \u2022did was necessary as trustees to give form to the assent to this compromise, and to secure to the said railroad company the benefits to accrue from such assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\">Various technical and refined theories and subtle suggestions of varied relations created, by the different papers have been invoked, which tend rather to obscure than to enlighten us upon the real subject of the controversy, and great ingenuity and zeal have been thus displayed by the learned counsel for the said railroad company in the array; but, however, devoted and laudable, professionally it can be of no avail. The obligations of their client, the railroad \u2022company, are too plainly set down to be attenuated by abstruse and specious argument. The common sense view of the situation must predominate, and declare their liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ties under the lease to which reference has been made. ' Indeed, it may be said, that Judge Van Brunt in the opinion he delivered upon considering the propriety of the demurrer interposed herein, has covered the whole subject. It should be remarked here, in passing, that it is now urged that the plaintiffs have not the legal capacity to sue on a ground not taken by demurrer and waived therefore; but, if it were-otherwise, the point'is not well taken, for the reason that the claim urged is under' a lease between the trustees and the railroad company, and whatever rental remains unpaid may be collected by the former under the covenants in the lease contained. The modification of that instrument operated as a reduction of the rent <em>protanto, </em>and the assent of the certificate holders was, in effect, a receipt or legal discharge of so much of it exceeding the reduction as they would be entitled to if the whole were paid. The construction adopted by the special term of the' agreements, brought to view for the reason given, was correct, and the judgment pronounced should not be disturbed. The exception to the exclusion of evidence, which was designed-to show what was intended by the compromise agreement, is of no value. There is no such ambiguity in that paper as would warrant such a procedure, and the effect of such evidence, if admitted and effectuated, would be to enlarge the sphere of the written paper in favor of the railroad company, and to diminish the rights of the non-assenters. Familiar rules require courts to reject such evidence under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\">It is perhaps unnecessary to continue this opinion beyond what has been already said, but some observations may be indulged in in reference to some of the positions taken on. behalf of the appellant. It is said for example that it is not necessary that all the members of an association shall personally join in performing an act, in order to make it legal and binding upon them all. They may delegate authority to others, to bind them by acting as agents on their behalf, and this principle seems to be invoked for the purpose of sustaining the proposition that a majority of the certificate holders having assented to the compromise agreement, it is binding upon the whole. .The answer to this proposition, assuming it to be correct, is that by the terms of the organization, the entire management of its affairs is vested in a board of management whose determinations were to be executed by the trustees named in the articles of association in whom the legal title to this property was vested, and they determined in the management of its affairs to seek the assent of the certificate holders, and to carry out their views; as far as expressed in reference to the subject-matter to which the assent related. The same view is taken of the protest of- some of the assenting certificate, holders against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the propriety of bringing and continuing this action. If such a procedure were given any force, it would be in effect interfering with the management of the business and might arrest the entire business of the association at least for a time. It is also suggested that it is the duty of the court, if it can legally do so, to construe the agreement particularly under consideration, as binding upon all the certificate holders.
