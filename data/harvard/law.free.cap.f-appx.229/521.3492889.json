We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The record does not compel the conclusion that the incidents Raj experienced in Fiji, including burglaries and extortion, constitute past persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[Pjersecution is an extreme concept [that] does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Nor are we compelled to conclude that Raj has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See id. </em>(requiring \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record of facts that would support a reasonable fear of persecution\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-16\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Raj fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">Petitioners\u2019 counsel is cautioned that his opening brief, which refers to outdated law and lacks record citations, does not meet this court\u2019s standards. <em>See generally </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28; 9th Cir. R. 28-2.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b550-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
