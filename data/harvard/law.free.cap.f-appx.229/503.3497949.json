We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Soriano-Arellano\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to establish \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) and 1229a(e)(l). Soriano-Arellano\u2019s prescription for medicine for stomach pain and his own declaration that he had a stomach virus and diarrhea do not establish that his illness was \u201cserious\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>See Celis-Castellano, </em>298 F.3d at 892 (BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that petitioner\u2019s evidence, consisting of a declaration and a medical form, failed to establish that his asthma attack amounted to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that the agency applied the incorrect standard and did not consider all of the evidence is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
