The district court did not err by considering at the sentencing phase the writings discovered in Bonacich\u2019s home. The writings were admitted and considered only to the limited extent they were relevant to assess Bonacich\u2019s history and characteristics, and to rebut his contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that he was merely curious about child pornography. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); <em>Wisconsin v. Mitchell, </em>508 U.S. 476, 489, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 124 L.Ed.2d 436 (1993); <em>Barclay v. Florida, </em>463 U.S. 939, 949, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983). Moreover, even if the district court had erred, we are persuaded that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Because the sentencing judge focused primarily on the content and volume of the pornographic images found in Bonacich\u2019s home and gave scant weight to the content of the writings, it is beyond any reasonable doubt that the resulting sentence would have been the same. <em>See Valerio v. Crawford, </em>306 F.3d 742, 756 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">2. Bonacich\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence is without merit. The district court carefully and explicitly considered Bonacich\u2019s individual characteristics and background, along with the other factors required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. The district court did not afford improper weight to the Guidelines, its procedures were not otherwise defective, and it ultimately imposed a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b518-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
