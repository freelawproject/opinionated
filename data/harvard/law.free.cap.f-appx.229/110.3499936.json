Russell, Philadelphia, PA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b139-9\">Before: MCKEE, FUENTES and ROTH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"AM\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">James Russell, awaiting trial on a federal charge of mailing a threatening communication, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In his petition to challenge his indictment as \u201cvoid ab initio,\u201d he plainly stated that he was incarcerated in the Federal Detention Center located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He did not identify the court in which he would be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Because Russell was being held in custody in Philadelphia, within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and outside the District of New Jersey, the District Court dismissed Russell\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court concluded that it could not transfer Russell\u2019s petition because Russell had not identified the district court of his prosecution, and noted that Russell could bring his claim at any stage of his federal criminal proceedings. Russell filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Russell appeals and moves for summary action on his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">We deny Russell\u2019s motion for summary action, but we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order because no substantial question is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>Local Rule 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. The District Court, sitting in the District of New Jersey while Russell was sitting in prison in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, lacked jurisdiction over Russell\u2019s petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a); <em>Yi v. Maugans, </em>24 F.3d 500, 507 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201cA district court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisdiction is territorially limited and extends only to persons detained and custodial officials acting within the boundaries of that district.\u201d); <em>but see Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 440-41, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004) (describing a possible departure from the ordinary rule in circumstances different from those in this case, namely a prisoner transfer after proper filing).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Russell, who submitted argument in support of his appeal, claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>District Court erred by not transferring his petition to the appropriate district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. The determination whether a case should be transferred in the interest of justice, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, \u201cis generally committed to the discretion of the District Court in the first instance.\u201d <em>See Island Insteel Sys. v. Waters, </em>296 F.3d 200, 218 (3d Cir.2002). The District Court was within the bounds of its discretion in this case. Although Russell later apprised the District Court of the location of his prosecution, he did not include the pertinent information in his petition. Furthermore, as the District Court noted, Russell can advance his \u201cvoid ab initio\u201d claim at any stage of his criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-12\">. Russell also submitted a letter to the District Court, noting that his criminal case was pending in the District of New Jersey. In response, the District Court amended its first opinion to note that Russell\u2019s criminal prosecution proceeded in the District of New Jersey. The District Court determined that the location of the prosecution did not affect the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
