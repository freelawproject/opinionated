Walker\u2019s counsel now moves to withdraw and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he represents that he has conscientiously examined the record and has found no non-frivolous issues to appeal. Counsel describes what in the record might arguably support the appeal, and explains why the issues are frivolous. <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988); <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 299-300 (3d Cir.2001). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-21\">The instant violation proceeding was commenced with a petition filed by Walker\u2019s probation officer on September 1, 2005, alleging that Walker had violated the conditions of his supervised release by: (1) testing positive for the use of cocaine and admitting the use of cocaine; (2) failing to report to his probation officer; and (3) failing to participate in outpatient drug treatment. The District Court held a hearing on these allegations on October 19, 2005, and Walker did not contest them. Instead, Walker took the stand and admitted the violations (except that he did not recall whether or not he told his probation officer that he had used cocaine), simply offering reasons why he had failed to report to his probation officer and to participate in drug treatment, as charged. Find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ing Walker in violation of his supervised release for using cocaine, failing to report, and failing to complete outpatient drug treatment, the District Court revoked his supervised release and imposed the sentence recounted above. In his brief, counsel discusses the District Court\u2019s authority pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) to revoke Walker\u2019s term of supervised release upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Walker violated a condition thereof; the procedural protections Walker was afforded under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1; the satisfaction of due process requirements; the sufficiency of the evidence; and the propriety of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Having reviewed the record, we agree that Walker has no non-frivolous issues to appeal, and conclude that counsel has satisfied his obligations under <em>Anders. </em>Accordingly, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ACd\">. Although counsel served Walker with copies of the Brief for Appellant, the appendix, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and Walker was given time to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, Walker did not submit any brief to the Court or file any opposition to the motion to withdraw. The United States submitted a brief indicating its agreement with counsel's assessment of the case as lacking any non-frivolous issues to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-14\">. The issues presented in the appeal do not require counsel to file a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR Mise. 109.2(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
