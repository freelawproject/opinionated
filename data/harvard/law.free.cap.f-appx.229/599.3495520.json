We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-20\">Coleman challenges his conviction for first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, claiming (1) the jury conflated two separate conspiracies into a single conspiracy, which allowed the jury to find him guilty without the requisite finding of an actual\u2014as opposed to constructive\u2014intent to kill; (2) he was denied an opportunity to present his defense of voluntary intoxication that applied to one conspiracy but not to the other; and (3) he was denied his right to adequate notice of the charges due to the variance between the single-conspiracy theory on which the case was submitted and the double-conspiracy theory on which the jury allegedly relied. In rejecting Coleman\u2019s claims, the California Court of Appeal correctly determined that the evidence established a single conspiracy under California law. Thus, Coleman has failed to demonstrate that the issue he raises is of federal constitutional proportions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Holgerson v. Knowles, </em>309 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>F.3d 1200, 1202 (9th Cir.2002) (federal habeas court generally bound by a state court\u2019s interpretation of state law).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We reject also Coleman\u2019s claim that the jury instruction on adoptive admissions impermissibly commented on his right to remain silent. There was no <em>Doyle </em>error because Coleman, after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, waived unequivocally his right to remain silent. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 618-19, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <em>Anderson v. Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980). Moreover, Coleman cannot point to any identifiable harm caused by the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The district court\u2019s denial of Coleman\u2019s habeas petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
