Montague\u2019s sentence is at the low end of his Guidelines sentencing range of 46 to 57 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">On appeal, Montague argues that the district court erred by (1) failing to adequately consider all of the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing a sentence that is greater than necessary under the circumstances, and (2) failing to specifically address each of the factors raised by Montague at sentencing. Montague argues that therefore his sentence is unreasonable and \u201cmeaningful appellate review\u201d is not possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2007). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. Rather, an acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">Here, the record demonstrates that the district court heard all of Montague\u2019s arguments and stated that it considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In addition, the district court recommended other correctional treatment and stated that it considered the specific factors of punishment, deterrence, and incapacitation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(D). The record conclusively shows that the district court properly considered the advisory Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the final sentence. Therefore, Montague\u2019s 46-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range, was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Montague\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
