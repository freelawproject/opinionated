We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In the aftermath of a custody dispute, Mawson\u2014on behalf of himself and his children\u2014filed a complaint accusing the Court of Common Pleas for Luzerne County (\u201cCCP\u201d) of \u201cmaliciously designing] and earr[ying]-out a process\u201d to, among other things, deny him and his children \u201ctheir Constitutional right to family bond, associate and visitation.\u201d The District Court construed Mawson\u2019s complaint as asserting civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but dismissed it because the CCP is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to liability for federal civil rights violations. Mawson timely appealed and applied to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Initially, we note that we have appellate jurisdiction despite the District Court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice because Maw-son has elected to stand on his complaint. <em>Lucas v. Township of Bethel, </em>319 F.3d 595, 600 (3d Cir.2003). Having granted Maw-son leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we must now determine whether his appeal should be dismissed as lacking an arguable basis in law or fact pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Section 1983 imposes liability only upon \u201cpersons\u201d who deprive others of \u201cany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. And neither states nor divisions of state government are \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 70-71, 109 S.Ct. 2304,105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Due to Pennsylvania\u2019s unitary court system, we consider all Pennsylvania courts, including the CCP, to be state entities not subject to \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>Callahan v. City of Phila., </em>207 F.3d 668, 672-73 (3d Cir.2000). As such, Mawson\u2019s claims are without legal merit, and we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). As a result of our disposition, we deny Maw-son\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. Despite Mawson\u2019s assertion that the District Court erred in analyzing his complaint under \u00a7 1983, there appears to be no other legal basis for his claims\u2014all of which accuse the CCP of violating his constitutional rights. Accordingly, we will also review his complaint as falling within the ambit of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
