The defendant contends that his sentence of eighteen months is unreasonable because the district court considered an impermissible factor and because the sentence is greater than the guidelines advisory range of six to twelve months. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">The defendant Terrell Jiles was convicted in August 2001 of being a felon in possession of a firearm and sentenced to forty-one months in prison followed by three years supervised release. His term of supervised release began December, 30, 2004. On November 29, 2005, the defendant\u2019s supervising probation officer filed a petition for a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest based on the defendant\u2019s recent state conviction for assaulting a police officer. On November 5, 2005, the defendant was stopped by a Memphis police officer for a violation of the vehicle registration law. A scuffle ensued and the defendant was accused of punching the police officer in the eye with a closed fist. On November 8, 2005, the defendant pled guilty in Shelby County General Sessions Court to \u201cAssault-Bodily Harm\u201d and received a four-day sentence with credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">In addition to the recent conviction, the petition also alleged that the defendant failed to attend scheduled mental health sessions, failed to notify his probation officer of a change in address, and failed to seek and maintain employment. At the revocation hearing, the probation officer testified as to the basis of each of the violations. The defendant also testified and attempted to explain the reasons for the violations. First, the defendant stated that he did not hit the police officer, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>entered a \u201cbest interest\u201d plea to the assault to get out of jail. Second, he explained that he quit going to mental health treatment because he did not like his new counselor. Finally, he admitted that he was living with another relative instead of his mother and said he was looking for a job but thought he needed some kind of training. After hearing testimony of the probation officer and the defendant, the district court found that the defendant had committed all four violations and sentenced the defendant to eighteen months in prison followed by six months supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The district court was very concerned that the defendant had been convicted of the assault of the police officer, but found that it was the cumulative effect of all the violations that required the sentence imposed. The district court characterized the defendant\u2019s actions as \u201cnegative\u201d responses to the conditions of release. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">So the difficulty in the case is that where there is a pattern of an inability to get one\u2019s life together enough to get to counseling, to get to a job, which I think you could do before, to advise your officer of the changes of address, to stay in compliance with those requirements, and then you\u2019re stopped by an officer, and there was enough of an incident to result in a guilty plea in the state court system, we have a situation where I should not be blind to the direction which things are going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">I can\u2019t ignore where we\u2019re going and not be concerned about my ultimate responsibilities under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 to\u2014 which includes responsibility to protect the public where I can....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">[W]e need to talk about the criteria and the things that we have to consider---We consider the nature of the offense conduct, and we have talked about that because it\u2019s not just one thing, it\u2019s a pattern of things, but it does involve a dispute with an officer, which is a negative thing, but it involves a number of other things, difficulties in complying with the rules and regulations in a serious way. We also look at the history and characteristics of the defendant, and, frankly before all these things occurred, before we had the problems in prison and didn\u2019t get our good time and all that, I would not have predicted we would be here....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">The sentence needs to reflect the seriousness of the offense, and I have already said that all these are serious offenses. What the court obviously is always concerned about is when it involves an officer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">The need to afford adequate deterrence, and for a sentence to do that, there needs to be a clear message that you can\u2019t get in a dispute with an officer, and also you can\u2019t disregard the instructions of the court officers in what you need to do while you\u2019re on supervised release____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">The need to protect the public, I come back to that one, there\u2019s some problem here, and it has become one which we have attempted unsuccessfully---- We attempted mental health counseling....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">The need for training, mental health counseling, so forth, there\u2019s no doubt that it would be beneficial, but we have sort of played that card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-16\">The kinds of sentences available, well, it could be a six-month sentence, a 12-month sentence, no sentence at all, put him back out there for additional assistance or it can be up to 24 months and no period of additional supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-17\">The policy considerations of the guidelines, it is always very important. Obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ously, I prefer a sentence usually within the guidelines because they\u2019re very well reasoned, it makes a lot of sense. It takes into consideration all the factors ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">The need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity, that\u2019s the best argument really for a sentence of 12 months as opposed to 24.... What can we do is we can provide something to protect the public. I have always been impressed with Mr. Jiles\u2019 basic abilities, that was true the first time, it has not changed; but there\u2019s something fundamentally different now that causes the court to be, based on this record, genuinely concerned about what is going on....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">I really think that there is some significant and somewhat additional period of incarceration is appropriate here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">A district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 625 (6th Cir.2005) \u201cThe revocation of supervised release and imposition of imprisonment should be affirmed if the district court\u2019s decision \u2018shows consideration of the relevant statutory factors\u2019 and if the sentence imposed is not \u2018plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We need not resolve the question of whether our review should be for \u201creasonableness\u201d in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), as applying that standard would not impact our ruling. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 552, 554 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The defendant first argues that the district court erroneously considered an impermissible factor when determining his sentence. The factors a district court may consider when revoking a term of supervised release are found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The factors are cross references to the sentencing factors set out in \u00a7 3553, with one exception. Omitted from the list of permissible factors is the need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">As can be seen from the court\u2019s statements set out above, the court mentioned the seriousness of the offense one time in the midst of considering the permissible factors. Further, the nature and circumstances of the offense are factors the court may consider, and the court\u2019s mention of the seriousness of the offense related only to the violation that was before the court. Nothing the court said related in any way to the underlying offense and its seriousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The defendant\u2019s second argument is that the eighteen-month sentence is unreasonable in light of the advisory guideline range of six to twelve months. Again, referring to the district court\u2019s statements, it is evident that the court carefully analyzed the factors and applied them reasonably and appropriately. The court expressed its concern that the defendant was responding negatively to authority, which resulted in a misdemeanor for assault and the other violations, and found that this behavior justified the sentence imposed. Thus, the defendant\u2019s second argument must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
