Dollson challenges various aspects of his conviction and sentence; the government cross-appeals only Dollson\u2019s sentence. For the reasons explained below, we will affirm Dollson\u2019s conviction but we will vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">I. <em>Background and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural posture, we will provide only a brief synopsis of the events leading up to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">On June 16, 2004, a package containing over one kilogram of cocaine was intercepted in the mails. Investigators obtained an anticipatory search warrant for Dollson\u2019s residence, where they believed the package was directed, and performed a controlled delivery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dollson, who had been at the post office inquiring about a package, was informed of the delivery by his teen-aged son and returned home. A transponder device hidden in the package alerted police when Dollson opened the package. The ensuing search turned up evidence of Dollson\u2019s recent short trips to Los Angeles, the city of origin of the mailing, and of large wire transfers to that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">At trial, a postal carrier testified that a black male\u2014identified as Dollson by a postal inspector who was observing the scene\u2014had inquired about a package with an express mail identification number similar to the one at issue. A Government expert testified that it was not uncommon for drugs to be shipped to a fictitious name or even slightly wrong address to avoid incriminating evidence. Dollson\u2019s defense theory was that he had expected a package from his \u201cgodsister,\u201d with whom, he claimed, he ran a cosmetics mail-order business, and that he had been in Los Angeles to watch the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team compete in the playoffs. Although Dollson\u2019s \u201cgodsister\u201d testified, no records of a cosmetics business were introduced, and the Government showed that the Lakers had played away from Los Angeles during one of Dollson\u2019s short visits. On February 17, 2005, the jury found Dollson guilty of possession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 1), and use of a communication facility in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) (Count 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">The Presentencing Investigation Report calculated the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range as 360 months to life. With minimal explanation and over vehement objection by the Government, the District Court sentenced Dollson to 192 months on the possession count and 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>months, to run concurrently, on Count 2, followed by eight years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Dollson appealed his conviction and sentence on a number of grounds; the Government cross-appealed, arguing the sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">II. <em>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The District Court had jurisdiction over Dollson\u2019s prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction over the appeal from a final decision of a district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and over the appeal from a sentence imposed under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The Court of Appeals reviews a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of proving unreasonableness; review is highly deferential, \u201cthe trial court being in the best position to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">The government argues the sentence imposed by the District Court\u2014192 months on Count 1 and 96 months, to run concurrently, on Count 2\u2014is both procedurally faulty, because insufficiently justified, and substantively unreasonable, because Dollson could not show any noteworthy mitigating circumstances that could justify sentencing him\u2014a career offender twice over\u2014to half of the minimum Guidelines range applicable to him (360 months to life). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (enumerating factors to be considered at sentencing). We agree with the Government that the District Court\u2019s explanation for its reasons was insufficient for meaningful review, and therefore we will remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">The statutory range applicable to Doll-son\u2019s possession conviction was ten years to life. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii), (viii). Because Dollson qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of life in prison, his base offense level was 37; under the applicable 2004 Sentencing Guidelines, that offense level, combined with Dollson\u2019s criminal category of VI, translated into a Guidelines range of 360 months to life.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The government, referring to Dollson\u2019s lengthy criminal record (which included an attempted murder perpetrated by firing six shots at an unarmed man, two of them while the victim lay on the floor, and a number of drug offenses), asked for a sentence substantially above the minimum Guideline range. It argued Dollson\u2019s record documented that he could not be rehabilitated, as Dollson, who was then in his mid-thirties, had proven unable to stay out of jail for more than two or three years at a time, even after being incarcerated over 13 years for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Dollson conceded that the 10-year statutory minimum applied to him but asked the court to impose just that sentence, and to depart significantly from the Guidelines. The argument was based on Dollson\u2019s family ties and responsibilities, his lack of guidance as a youth, his efforts at rehabilitation, and the need to avoid unwarranted disparities caused by the career offender guideline, which has been found to have a disparate impact on minority defendants because of the inclusion of drug trafficking crimes in the calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The District Court found the government had proved the prior convictions that qualified Dollson as a career criminal, and it sentenced Dollson to 192 months on Count I and 96 months, to run concurrently, on Count 2, followed by eight years\u2019 supervised release. By way of explanation, it stated that \u201c[t]he sentence was imposed in consideration of the advisory guideline range, as well as the factors set forth in Section 3553(a),\u201d but did not further articulate its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Dollson argues that the court sufficiently considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; although the court did not summarize its reasoning at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing or fully explain how it had weighed the factors, a number of comments it made during the hearing itself reflect its preoccupation with them. For instance, the court repeatedly noted the relevance of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reacted to the parties\u2019 arguments, reflecting that some of the crimes in Dollson\u2019s criminal history were more than ten years old and that the Guidelines range triggered by Dollson\u2019s status as a career offender was significantly higher than the range that would apply otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">We do not doubt that the District Court gave thoughtful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because it did not fully articulate its reasoning or explain the relevance of its observations, however, we are left with an inadequate record to determine which of the factors predominated in the Court\u2019s decision-making process and why. Meaningful appellate review for abuse of discretion should not be based on an appellate court\u2019s attempt to reconstruct the District Court\u2019s reasoning on the basis of comments made throughout the sentencing hearing. <em>See Rita v. United </em>States, \u2014U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that \u201c[b]y articulating reasons, even if brief, the sentencing judge ... assures reviewing courts ... that the sentencing process is a reasoned process\u201d); <em>United States v. King, </em>454 F.3d 187, 196-7 (3d Cir.2006) (holding that courts \u201cshould observe the requirement to state adequate reasons for a sentence on the record so that this court can engage in meaningful appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">Thus, we believe that \u201c[m]ore elaboration is necessary\u201d and will remand for fuller articulation of the District Court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 571 (2007) (en banc). As we already noted in <em>Grier, </em>a remand under these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>stances does not necessarily suggest that the sentence itself was unreasonable; \u201cwe do ask, however, that the District Court explain its decision on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Because of the insufficiency of the record for review, we do not reach the Government\u2019s contention that the sentence was actually unreasonable in view of Doll-son\u2019s criminal past. This argument raises the difficult and as yet unsettled question of the relative importance of the correctly calculated Guidelines range within the \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. <em>See King, </em>454 F.3d at 195-96 (3d Cir.2006) (a significant divergence from the Guidelines \u201cdoes not make [a sentence] per se unreasonable\u201d; however, <em>\u201cBooker </em>gives little direction as to how closely sentencing courts are to adhere to the formerly mandatory Guidelines\u201d); <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 332 (\u201c[a] sentence that falls within the guidelines range is more likely to be reasonable than one outside the guidelines range\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the District Court, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-12\">. The package was addressed to \u201cKevin Higgs, 9701 Mill Creek Road, # 2905, Levittown, PA\u201d; Dollson inhabited the apartment at 9071 Mill Creek Road, #2905. Initially, the focus on Dollson\u2019s address was the result of the investigators' misreading or miscommunication. The error was not brought to the investigators' attention until months later, when Dollson challenged the validity of the warrant; further investigation at this point revealed that 9701 Mill Creek Road was in fact an empty lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">. On appeal, Dollson contended that (1) the District Court erred in denying Dollson\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found in and around his apartment, because the warrant pursuant to which the search was performed was overbroad and insufficiently particular; (2) there was not sufficient evidence at trial to prove that he knew the package he received contained a controlled substance; and (3) the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct during closing argument by improperly shifting the burden of proof, misstating the law and the evidence, and misstating the facts, improperly referring to Dollson\u2019s children, and vouching for the Government\u2019s case. He also challenged his sentence, arguing the District Court erred in sentencing him for possession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of cocaine; at most, he had possessed 116 grams, the amount left in the package after postal inspectors replaced most of the cocaine with a sham substance. We have carefully considered each of these contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-15\">. Dollson's initial base offense level would have been 26 (at least 500 g. but less than 2 kg. of cocaine) under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7), but was raised to 37 under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Dollson's second count of conviction, Count II (use of a communication facility in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) carries a penalty of up to eight years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine up to $250,000. There is no disagreement regarding the sentence for this less serious violation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>which Dollson was ordered to serve concurrently with the longer sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\">. In the recently issued opinion in <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court has held that courts of appeals may adopt a presumption of reasonableness with respect to within-Guidelines sentences. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462-63. The companion case, <em>Claiborne v. United States, </em>No. 06-5618, was to consider whether sentences outside the Guidelines require special justification but was declared moot due to the death of petitioner Claiborne. The Supreme Court will consider the issue next Term in <em>United States v. Gall, </em>No. 06-7649. The District Court need not hold the sentencing until the issuance of the decision in <em>Gall.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
