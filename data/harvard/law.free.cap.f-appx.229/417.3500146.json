The district court denied his petition. Because Gravitt cannot challenge the imposition of his sentence using \u00a7 2241, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-24\">In 2001 Gravitt pleaded guilty in Missouri state court to child endangerment for giving his son a loaded handgun; he was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>October 2, 2001. About a month later, on October 29, 2001, Gravitt was transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals Service to face felon-in-possession charges in the Western District of Missouri. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); 924(e). Gravitt pleaded guilty to the federal charge, and on December 5, 2002, he was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court judge ordered that Gravitt\u2019s federal sentence run concurrently with his Missouri state sentence. Gravitt did not seek direct review, but he did file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was dismissed with prejudice. He was returned to the custody of Missouri authorities to serve the remainder of his state sentence. In September 2005, after completing his state sentence, Missouri turned him over to federal authorities to finish serving his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Gravitt, who is now incarcerated in the Southern District of Indiana, argued in his \u00a7 2241 petition that the sentencing court should have reduced his federal sentence to account for the time he served on the Missouri conviction before he was sentenced on the federal conviction\u2014by his calculation, the period between September 30, 2001, and December 5, 2002. In denying Gravitt\u2019s petition, the district court construed it as challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (\u201cBOP\u201d) calculation of his time served. The district court explained that Gravitt had already received credit towards his Missouri sentence for the period of time before he received his federal sentence, and the BOP is precluded from giving credit for periods of confinement that have already been applied towards another sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (providing that no period of incarceration can be credited against a federal sentence if it already has \u201cbeen credited against another sentence\u201d); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>219 F.3d 592, 594 (7th Cir.2000) (explaining operation of \u00a7 3585(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">However, as we read Gravitt\u2019s petition, and his brief on appeal, he is not arguing that the BOP should have given him credit under \u00a7 3585(b), but that the federal sentencing court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) when it sentenced Gravitt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section \u00a7 5G1.3(b) requires a sentencing court to impose a shorter sentence to account for incarceration already served on another conviction encompassing the same conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Gravitt argues that the sentencing court did not follow \u00a7 5G1.3(b) when it failed to reduce his 120-month federal sentence by the time he had already served on his Missouri conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">However, Gravitt\u2019s contention that the district court misapplied \u00a7 5G1.3 attacks the imposition, not the execution, of his federal sentence, and ordinarily only challenges to the execution of a sentence are properly brought under \u00a7 2241, <em>see Valona v. United States, </em>138 F.3d 693, 694 (7th Cir.1998); challenges to the imposition of a sentence must generally be raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Kramer v. Olson, </em>347 F.3d 214, 217 (7th Cir.2003). The exception is that \u00a7 2255 contains a \u201csavings clause\u201d which permits a prisoner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 if \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 U 5; <em>Kramer, </em>347 F.3d at 217; <em>United States v. Prevatte, </em>300 F.3d 792, 799 (7th Cir.2002). Section 2255 is inadequate only when the Supreme Court interprets a statute in a way that the prisoner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted because he was convicted for a \u201cnonexis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tent offense.\u201d <em>Prevatte, </em>300 F.3d at 799; <em>see, e.g., Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 143, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (mere possession of a firearm does not violate federal use-of-a-firearm-during-a-drug-offense statute); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 852, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000) (arson of residential home does not violate federal arson statute). Gravitt cannot satisfy this narrow exception because his challenge is to his sentence, not his conviction. <em>See, e.g., Dellinger v. Bowen, </em>301 F.3d 758, 767 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Additionally, Gravitt\u2019s claim would face a serious obstacle in any collateral challenge because claims premised on the sentencing guidelines, absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d can only be raised on direct appeal. <em>Scott v. United States, </em>997 F.2d 340, 343 (7th Cir.1993) (describing as hypothetical example of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d the sentencing court\u2019s refusal to implement a guidelines provision favorable to the defendant coupled with cause for not seeking direct review); <em>see United States v. Wisch, </em>275 F.3d 620, 625 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Allen v. United States, </em>175 F.3d 560, 563 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Soto v. United States, </em>37 F.3d 252, 254 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-5\">. Gravitt explained to the district court that \u201cthe question is not whether the credit petitioner seeks violates \u00a7 3585(b) but rather did the ... sentencing court intend to credit petitioner, under the guidelines, for the time he served on his state offense.\u201d (R. 8 at 1-2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
