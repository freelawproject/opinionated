We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination that an applicant has failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, <em>see Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003), and petitioners do not raise a colorable due process claim, <em>see Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-26\">We note that the Immigration Judge granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padillar-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the 60-day voluntary departure period. Petitioners\u2019 motion to remand is granted in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b509-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
