We have jurisdiction over this appeal and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The exclusion of Leonor McGann\u2019s testimony that McGann\u2019s cousin told her he was wearing the blood-spattered shirt did not violate McGann\u2019s due process right to present a defense. <em>See Tinsley v. Borg, </em>895 F.2d 520, 530 (9th Cir.1990) (setting forth five factor balancing test). McGann admitted pulling out a knife and stabbing Salvador Rodriquez in the shoulder. The evidence was uncontradicted that Rodriquez was stabbed nine times, two times in the stomach, two times in the wrist, and five times in the back. This evidence is sufficient to allow a jury to find premeditation and deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">For the same reason that the exclusion of Leonor McGann\u2019s testimony did not violate due process, the failure of McGann\u2019s trial counsel to present other evidence that McGann\u2019s cousin was wearing the blood-spattered shirt did not prejudice McGann. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of gang evidence was not an error that \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">None of the state courts\u2019 rulings was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the Supreme Court, nor did any ruling constitute an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b552-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
