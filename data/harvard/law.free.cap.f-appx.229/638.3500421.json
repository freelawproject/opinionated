We review de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Barajas contends the IJ -violated due process by not giving Barajas additional time to secure the testimony of his lawful permanent resident parents\u2019 physician because he was not afforded the opportunity to present additional testimony related to the \u25a0 medical condition of his permanent resident parents. Contrary to Barajas\u2019 contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, the doctor\u2019s report was in the record and Barajas failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Barajas failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v.
