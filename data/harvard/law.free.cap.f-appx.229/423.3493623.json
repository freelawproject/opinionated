Upon de novo review, <em>see United States v. Bockes, </em>447 F.3d 1090, 1092 (8th Cir.2006), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-27\">Young pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, to being a felon in possession of a firearm. He had a prior Missouri conviction for the felony offense of tampering in the first degree, in violation of Mo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 569.080.1(2) (2000). At sentencing, the court admitted into evidence the guilty-plea petition for the tampering offense, in which Young admitted that he had knowingly, and in concert with others, operated an automobile without the owner\u2019s consent. The district court imposed the 30-month sentence for the instant felon-in-possession offense based in part on the court\u2019s characterization of Young\u2019s tampering conviction as a \u201ccrime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>lence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 997 (8th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 285, 166 L.Ed.2d 218 (2006), we held that the Missouri offense of tampering by operation of a vehicle, in violation of section 569.080.1(2), is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Johnson </em>governs our analysis in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 996 (statutory definition of violent felony is interchangeable with Guidelines definition of crime of violence). Young seeks to avoid <em>Johnson </em>by arguing that it should be limited to circumstances in which the defendant is shown to have actually operated the vehicle. Young asserts that, because he acted in concert with others, no evidence indicates that he actually drove the car underlying his offense, and his conduct could have been consistent with mere possession. We do not read <em>Johnson </em>as so limiting. The <em>Johnson </em>case drew no distinction between solo and group crimes, and rightly so, because such a distinction would be inconsistent with the general principle that a person convicted as an accomplice is guilty of the same underlying offense as the principal. <em>See United States v. Baca-Valenzuela, </em>118 F.3d 1223, 1232 (8th Cir.1997) (there is no separate offense for accomplice liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Thus, <em>Johnson </em>is dispositive, and although Young contends that <em>Johnson </em>is wrongly decided because it conflicts with <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004), and the decisions of our sister circuits, we are not, sitting as a panel, at liberty to overrule <em>Johnson. See Jackson v. Ault, </em>452 F.3d 734, 736 (8th Cir.2006) (only en banc court can overturn panel decision), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 946, 166 L.Ed.2d 723 (2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-19\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. We note that the majority in <em>Johnson </em>specifically declined to be guided by <em>Leocal, </em>explaining that <em>leocal </em>addressed the definition of crime of violence for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). <em>See Johnson, </em>417 F.3d at 996 n. 4. In addition, given our clear precedent, Young\u2019s reliance on decisions of our sister circuits is misplaced. <em>See United States v. Auginash, </em>266 F.3d 781, 784 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
