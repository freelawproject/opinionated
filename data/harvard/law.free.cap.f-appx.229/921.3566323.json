Cl. 331, dismissing his wrongful termination claim because the statute of limitations has run. We <em>affirm,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">Polk enlisted in the United States Navy on March 3, 1987, and was discharged on May 5, 1987, for failing academic requirements. Polk first challenged his dismissal seventeen years later, on April 23, 2004, when he filed an application with the Board for Correction of Naval Records (\u201cBoard\u201d). The Board found that a document pertaining to a different person, David Ray Polk, had erroneously been included in Polk\u2019s record, and removed the document from Polk\u2019s record, but concluded that other documents in the record supported the Navy\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">Polk then filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims on March 25, 2005, challenging the validity of his 1987 discharge, and seeking damages in the amount of $20,000,000.00. The court held that Polk\u2019s action was barred by the 6-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. The court reasoned that, under our decision in <em>Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295, 1310 (Fed.Cir.2003) <em>(en banc), </em>Polk\u2019s claim accrued in 1987 when he was discharged from service. The Court of Federal Claims also held inapplicable the \u201chalf a loaf\u2019 doctrine, which holds that when the Board grants only partial relief, judicial intervention is warranted to grant the full relief to which the plaintiff is entitled, even if the statute of limitations has lapsed. <em>Id. </em>at 1325 (Plager, J., dissenting); <em>see also DeBow v. United States, </em>193 Ct.Cl. 499, 434 F.2d 1333, 1335 (1970). The Court of Federal Claims held that the doctrine did not apply because Polk\u2019s record still documented his poor academic performance, and thus removal of the document pertaining to David Ray Polk was the sole relief to which Polk was entitled. The court further held that the half a loaf doctrine only applies when \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d exist, and that was not the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>here. <em>See Bonen v. United States, 229 </em>Ct.Cl. 144, 666 F.2d 536, 540 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Polk timely appealed the decision of the Court of Federal Claims to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). We review without deference a dismissal of a complaint by the Court of Federal Claims for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Doe v. United States, </em>463 F.3d 1314, 1320 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">We hold that the Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed Polk\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. We have held that a service member\u2019s wrongful discharge claim for monetary relief in the Court of Federal Claims accrues when he is discharged. <em>Martinez, </em>333 F.3d at 1311. Thus Polk\u2019s cause of action accrued in 1987, and was clearly time-barred when he filed suit in 2005. Polk relies on the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Dougherty v. United States Navy Bd. for Correction of Naval Records, </em>784 F.2d 499 (3d Cir.1986), for the proposition that his cause of action accrued when the Board corrected his record in 2004, but we have held that \u201cthe statute of limitations for Tucker Act claims is not tolled by the claimant\u2019s exercise of his right to seek permissive administrative review,\u201d and we have explicitly distinguished <em>Dougherty </em>on the ground that it did not involve a claim for monetary relief. <em>Martinez, 333 </em>F.3d at 1312-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Finally, even if the half a loaf doctrine survived <em>Martinez, </em>the Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that the half a loaf doctrine could not save Polk\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
