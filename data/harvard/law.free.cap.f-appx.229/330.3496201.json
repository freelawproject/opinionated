The district court dismissed the suit as frivolous due to Reeves\u2019s failure to pay the court costs owed in an identical action he previously filed against the defendants. Reeves fails to brief the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suit. He moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP), and the appellees move for a summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">The district court certified that the appeal is not taken in good faith under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Reeves\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). We deny IFP and dismiss the appeal. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The appellees\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">We caution Reeves that the use of \u201cdisrespectful and impertinent references to the trial judge\u201d will not be permitted in documents filed with this court. Such comments invite the striking of the documents in which they are contained. <em>See Theriault v. Silber, </em>574 F.2d 197, 197 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
