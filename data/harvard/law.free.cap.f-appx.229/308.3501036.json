He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 230 months and 120 months of imprisonment. He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The district court dismissed Morris\u2019s claims, but preserved for further briefing Morris\u2019s claim regarding the drug quantity used to determine his sentence. The record does not indicate that the district court has ruled upon the drug quantity issue. Morris now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s partial dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">In general, courts of appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Similarly, in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, \u201cthe fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>nal order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held\u201d and a COA is to be issued from a \u201cfinal order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a) and (c)(1). Moreover, the district court is required to \u201cdeny a COA as to each issue presented by the applicant.\u201d <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998) (\u00a7 2254 proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Given that the district court did not rule on and ordered further briefing on Morris\u2019s drug quantity claim, the judgment denying Morris\u2019s other \u00a7 2255 claims was not a final order and appellate jurisdiction does not exist. <em>See Young v. Herring, </em>777 F.2d 198, 202 (5th Cir.1985). Accordingly, Morris\u2019s motion for COA is denied, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Morris\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
