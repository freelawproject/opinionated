To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the Petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-25\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to remand because they failed to demonstrate that the evidence submitted concerning their daughter\u2019s Individualized Education Program was previously unavailable, or that the recent birth of their son Daniel materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ally affected their hardship claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material\u201d); <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 865, 867 (9th Cir.1987) (formal requirements for motions to reopen are the same as those for motions to remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the performance by prior counsel did not result in prejudice to the Petitioners, and thus their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
