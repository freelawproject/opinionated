He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a term of imprisonment greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-23\">We review the sentence imposed for reasonableness. Uni<em>ted States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Gareia-Ramirez was sentenced at the low end of the applicable guidelines range, and he identifies no error in the guidelines calculations, we give great deference to the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Contrary to Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s arguments, we find that the district court did not improperly balance the sentencing factors and the sentence imposed was not greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Therefore, we conclude that the 46-month sentence imposed was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-24\">Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia-Ramirez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia-Ramirez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
