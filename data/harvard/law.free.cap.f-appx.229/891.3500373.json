Palomino challenges the BIA\u2019s decision not to reconsider its prior dismissal of his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order of removal. The IJ relied upon <em>In re Blake, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 722 (BIA 2005), <em>petition for review granted sub nom. Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007), to conclude that Palomino was not eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-24\">In <em>In re Blake, </em>the BIA determined that there was no comparable ground for exclusion for the \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d category of aggravated felony offenses. <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 729. While this petition for review was pending before us, the Second Circuit granted the petition for review of <em>Blake. </em>The Court then rejected the BIA\u2019s reasoning, instead holding that \u201cpetitioners\u2019 eligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver must turn on their particular criminal offenses. If the offense that renders a lawful permanent resident deportable would render a similarly situated lawful permanent resident excludable, the deport-able lawful permanent resident is eligible for a waiver of deportation\u201d <em>Blake, </em>489 F.3d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"ATPx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Without expressing any opinion about the issues raised in Palomino\u2019s petition for review or Palomino\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, we GRANT the petition, VACATE the order denying reconsideration, and REMAND this case to the BIA for the purpose of allowing the BIA to consider Palomino\u2019s motion to reconsider in light of <em>Blake v. Carbone.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
