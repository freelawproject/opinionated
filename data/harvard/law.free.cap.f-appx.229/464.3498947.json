While Bell contended that he had paid for the coverage, the evidence supports the Tax Court\u2019s finding that payments made by Bell during that year were for his health plan coverage and not for the disability plan, making the disability benefit income taxable. <em>See Beisler v. Comm\u2019r, </em>814 F.2d 1304,1307 (9th Cir.1987) (en banc) (amounts employee receives from employer-funded benefit plan are included in the employee\u2019s gross income).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b492-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
