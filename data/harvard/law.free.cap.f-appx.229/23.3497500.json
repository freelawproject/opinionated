June 13, 2006), <em>aff\u2019g </em>No. A 97 745 440 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">As a preliminary matter, because ShiLu failed to challenge before the BIA the denial of her claims based upon her alleged illegal departure from China and the possible birth of additional children, we will not address these claims now. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.2007). With respect to Shi-Lu\u2019s claims based on her alleged forced abortion and threats of harm related to this incident, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as affirmed by the BIA, including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335-38 (2d Cir.2006) (agreeing with this principle, but avoiding remand, in spite of deficiencies in an adverse credibility determination, because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the decision were the case remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not evidence. Any alleged ShiLu\u2019s understanding of conception the record nor material to her a forced abortion. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). Similarly, the IJ\u2019s finding that Shi-Lu\u2019s testimony was vague regarding her conversation with her boyfriend was immaterial to her claim and not supported by the record, in that the IJ failed to identify what about the testimony was vague or to probe further in order to draw out additional details. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">It was also impermissibly speculative to find implausible that Shi-Lu, knowing that she was in violation of the family planning laws, would confirm her pregnancy with a doctor rather than taking an at-home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>pregnancy test and that her doctor would not inform her of her due date. <em>See Yuanliang Liu v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>455 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir.2006). Such findings relied upon unsupported assumptions about the Chinese medical system. <em>See id. </em>Implausibilities premised upon speculation cannot support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zhi Wei Pang v. BCIS, </em>448 F.3d 102, 111 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Similarly, in finding it implausible that Shi-Lu would hide in her parents\u2019 home knowing that a family planning official lived nearby, the IJ gave no indication that he considered Shi-Lu\u2019s explanation that she simply did not know where else to go. <em>See Latifi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 103, 105 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 89-90 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ also found it implausible that the family planning official failed to investigate Shi-Lu\u2019s home immediately after he saw her. However, the IJ failed to give Shi-Lu an opportunity to reconcile this non-dramatic implausibility, and, therefore, it cannot support the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zhi Wei Pang, </em>448 F.3d at 109-10. Finally, with respect to the IJ\u2019s finding that it was implausible that Chinese officials would find Shi-Lu at her aunt\u2019s house, we find that it requires no stretch of the imagination to believe that government officials would look for a wanted person at her relative\u2019s home. Because we cannot confidently predict that the agency would adhere to its decision regarding Shi-Lu\u2019s credibility absent the errors discussed, we cannot affirm the agency\u2019s denial of relief on the basis of credibility. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">While the IJ made an alternative finding that Shi-Lu, even if she testified credibly, failed to sustain her burden of proof due to her vague testimony and insufficient corroboration, this determination was also flawed. In order to find that an applicant has failed to sustain her burden of proof due, in part, to the vagueness of her testimony, an IJ must probe for incidental details in order to create a record to support that finding. <em>See Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005). Because the IJ failed to do this, or even cite which details he found absent from Shi-Lu\u2019s testimony, the vagueness finding is not supported by the record. <em>See id. </em>All that remains is the IJ\u2019s determination that Shi-Lu\u2019s claim was undermined by her failure to produce an affidavit from her aunt. This finding, on its own, cannot support the IJ\u2019s determination that Shi-Lu failed to sustain her burden of proof. <em>See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">For the foregoing reasons, to the extent that petitioner\u2019s claims are based on her forced abortion and threat of future harm related to this incident, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED. Petitioner\u2019s pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
