We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that Singh\u2019s untimely motion to reopen was not subject to the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d exception to the filing deadline because the evidence Singh submitted did not establish changed circumstances in India. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945 (requiring circumstances to \u201chave changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution\u201d). Contrary to Singh\u2019s contention, the BIA considered the evidence and adequately explained its decision. <em>Cf. Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>(9th Cir.2005) (remanding where the BIA stated only that petitioner\u2019s motion was denied and provided no further explanation).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Singh\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
