Sandoval, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b525-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">Defendant-Appellant Mag\u00edn LabraMorales pled guilty to being a deported alien found in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The district court sentenced Labra-Morales to forty-six months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. In imposing sentence, the district court applied a sixteen-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because Labra-Morales was previously deported after he was convicted in 1983 of child molestation, a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">Labra-Morales appeals his forty-six month sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">During the guilty-plea hearing, LabraMorales admitted that he was previously deported. However, no specific date of deportation was charged in the indictment or admitted by Labra-Morales. The Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) listed three dates of prior deportations, all of which followed Labra-Morales\u2019s 1983 child molestation conviction. Labra-Morales contends that we must vacate his sentence because the district court erred in relying on the deportation dates listed in the PSR to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">We disagree with Labra-Morales and find that the error, if any, was harmless because Labra-Morales\u2019s substantial rights were not violated. <em>See United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1098-99 (9th Cir.2006) (affirming a sixteen-point sentence enhancement where the defendant failed to raise a reasonable doubt as to the fact of prior deportation).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">Labra-Morales\u2019s <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>challenges are foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 1096-97 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) effectively overruled or limited the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres). </em>His argument that \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>foreclosed. <em>See Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Accordingly, Labra-Morales\u2019s forty-six month sentence for violation of \u00a7 1326 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b525-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-26\">. In 1983, Labra-Morales molested his nine-year old step-daughter and was convicted of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under the age of 14 with force, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 288(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
