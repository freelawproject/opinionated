Hinds, </em>164 Fed.Appx. 934 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished opinion), when we affirmed his conviction, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because we previously affirmed Hinds\u2019s conviction, and because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Hinds\u2019s sentence imposed by the district court on May 12, 2006, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
