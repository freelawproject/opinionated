To the extent we have jurisdiction it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider, and review de novo questions of law and alleged due process violations. <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended, by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">The evidence Soto Onate presented with his motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (holding that if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae bars this court from revisiting the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-22\">Soto Onate contends that the BIA violated his due process rights, but he fails to state how this occurred or to show the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>requisite prejudice. <em>See Lara-Torres, </em>388 F.3d. at 973. He also contends that the BIA did not follow its precedent in that it did not consider the cumulative effect of removal on his children. This contention fails because the BIA explicitly stated that Soto Onate \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the two qualifying United States citizen children would suffer hardships that cumulatively reach the \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>See Fernandez, </em>439 F.3d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In his opening brief, Soto Onate failed to address, and therefore waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b478-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
