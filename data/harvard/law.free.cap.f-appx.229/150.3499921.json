We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">Browder\u2019s complaint names over forty defendants, including her family members, various media corporations, attorneys, judges, doctors, television and radio stations, and numerous law enforcement officials and agencies in Florida and New Jersey. Her allegations are less than coherent, and include that several of the defendants have sexually assaulted her and are conspiring to commit further physical harm and cause her death, that media-related defendants are airing private information about her and her children, and that Defendant Audette is paying various other defendants to participate in these acts against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">The District Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for failing to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>upon which relief can be granted. The District Court noted that, to the extent any of Browder\u2019s claims might not be frivolous, she had alleged \u201conly claims grounded in State law, and ... federal crimes which generally do not convey a private right of action.\u201d Opinion at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Having granted Browder leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, we must now determine whether her appeal should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). After carefully reviewing the complaint, we cannot escape the observation that the complaint consists exclusively of the type of \u201cclearly baseless\u201d facts or \u201cfanciful\u201d allegations that courts need not credit. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). The District Court clearly did not err in dismissing the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Because the appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
