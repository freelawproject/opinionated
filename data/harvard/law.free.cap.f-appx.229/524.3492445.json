The sentencing transcript does not show that the district judge used the wrong legal standard in determining that defendant was ineligible for safety valve relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Ferryman, </em>444 F.3d 1183, 1186 (9th Cir.2006) (discussing the standard). His conclusion that the firearms seized at defendant\u2019s home were used in connection with the crime of conviction was a factual one of the sort we review for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1185. On this record, we cannot say this finding was clearly erroneous. Because we uphold the district court\u2019s determination that defendant was ineligible for safety valve relief under section 5C1.2(a)(2), we need not address whether defendant was also ineligible for failure to cooperate under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">2. Absent a finding that defendant was eligible for safety valve relief, the district court had no authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (noting that the court can disregard the statutory minimum only <em>\u201cif </em>the court finds at sentencing\u201d that defendant is eligible for relief (emphasis added)); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Castro, </em>473 F.3d 1004, 1006-07 (9th Cir.2007) (noting section 3553(f) is still binding post-<em>Booker). </em>Given that defendant was sentenced at the statutory minimum, his \u201creasonableness\u201d claim is thus without merit. <em>See Hernandez-Castro, </em>473 F.3d at 1007 <em>(\u201cBooker </em>did not affect the imposition of statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
