Both courts correctly concluded that the funds held in the debtor\u2019s bank account on the petition date were property of the estate under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 because, at a minimum, legal title to the funds was held by the debtor. The plaintiff-appellant\u2019s assertion that the funds at issue were trust funds under the Texas Trust Fund Statute and therefore excludable from property of the estate is, as the trustee argues, premature. The issue of whether a trust exists and the identity of its beneficiaries remains to be litigated. The plaintiff-appellant will have his day in court on that issue. The other matter that the plaintiff-appellant would like to pursue is whether the funds at issue were held by the debtor \u201cas of the commencement of the case.\u201d That question, which is fact-intensive, was not raised in the bankruptcy court and is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
