Sellan-Mazzini also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s November 21, 2005 order denying his motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We grant Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s petition for review in No. 05-73033, vacate the BIA\u2019s April 21, 2005 order dismissing his appeal on the merits, and remand to the BIA for reconsideration of its determination that Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s 2001 conviction was for a particularly serious crime. We reject Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s other challenges to the April 21, 2005 order. Finally, we deny SellanMazzini\u2019s petition for review in No. 05-77274, which seeks review of the BIA\u2019s November 21, 2005 order denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to consider Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s argument that the IJ applied the wrong legal standard when concluding that Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s 2001 California conviction for second-degree robbery with a deadly or dangerous weapon was for a particularly serious crime. <em>See Afridi v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 1212, 1218 (9th Cir.2006). As the BIA\u2019s April 21, 2005 order appears to adopt the I J\u2019s rationale, we review the I J\u2019s reasoning. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The IJ misapplied the law when it concluded that Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s 2001 conviction was for a particularly serious crime. Although required to do so, the IJ did not engage in a case-specific inquiry into the specific facts underlying Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s conviction. <em>See Afridi, </em>442 F.3d at 1220; <em>see also In re Frentescu, </em>18 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 244, 247 (BIA 1982), <em>superseded in part by statute, </em>Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208 div. C sec. 305(a)(3), \u00a7 241(b)(3)(B), 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-602 (1996). We therefore grant Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s petition for review and remand for the BIA to apply the <em>Frentescu </em>case-specific inquiry to determine whether Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s 2001 robbery conviction was for a particularly serious crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We reject Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s claim that the BIA erred in denying him relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the conditions to which Sellan-Mazzini would likely be subjected do not constitute torture. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 654 (9th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence, however, supports the BIA\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for CAT relief. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Finally, we reject Sellan-Mazzini\u2019s various due process claims. Sellan-Mazzini has not shown prejudice from any mistakes made by his counsel at the removal hearing. <em>See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 857-58 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Sellan-Mazzini also failed to show that the BIA denied him a reasonable opportunity to present his case. <em>Cf. Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW IN NO. 05-73033 GRANTED, BIA ORDER VACATED AND REMANDED. PETITION FOR REVIEW IN NO. 05-77274 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b519-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
