Wood acknowledges that her \u201cchallenge, from the beginning, rests entirely olong-settled [sic] U.S. Supreme Court rulings regarding the origin, nature, and limitations of the federal income taxation scheme that have yet to be reversed.... \u201d She disputes the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground she was not a federal taxpayer for the 2002 tax year. Wood argues the tax court erred by allowing the proceeding to continue without \u201cproving the jurisdictional prerequisite facts\u201d by addressing her constitutional argument \u201cissue-by-issue.\u201d Wood\u2019s argument, essentially, is that the only income that constitutionally is subject to taxation is \u201cgain[ ] and profits in consequence of doing business as a corporation.... \u201d Wood argues the Commissioner failed to establish a nexus between the \u201csettled constitutional facts,\u201d namely her constitutional argument discussed above, and her income for the 2002 tax year. Accordingly, she argues that she was not subject to any provision of the income tax code.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">During a collection due process hearing, a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). A taxpayer, however, may not challenge the amount or existence of the underlying tax liability unless she \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). With regard to sanctions, \u201c[t]he Tax Court may impose sanctions on a taxpayer, if he institutes or maintains proceedings primarily for delay or his position is frivolous or groundless.\u201d <em>Roberts v. C.I.R., </em>329 F.3d 1224, 1229 (11th Cir.2003) (citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(A)-(B)). In <em>Roberts, </em>we affirmed sanctions where the taxpayer was \u201con notice that his claims were frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(C) permits the tax court to impose sanctions in any amount up to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The tax court did not err in granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions on Wood because: (1) the tax court had jurisdiction; (2) Wood was precluded from challenging the underlying tax liability; and (3) Wood was on notice that her claim the tax code only applies to corporations was patently frivolous. <em>See Roberts, </em>329 F.3d at 1227, 1229 (11th Cir.2003) (stating we review <em>de novo </em>the tax court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment and review its imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
