We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we review de novo the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the hearing did not violate due process. <em>See Simeonov v.

INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir.2000). We have examined the transcript of the hearing, and have not found evidence that the translation was incompetent. <em>See id. </em>(evidence of incompetent translation includes direct evidence of incorrectly translated words, unresponsive answers, and the witness\u2019s expression that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>he is having difficulty understanding what is said to him). There was no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We have no jurisdiction over Singh\u2019s claims of error in the IJ\u2019s grant of voluntary departure or the IJ\u2019s advisal of his right to appeal to the BIA, because Singh did not raise these issues in his appeal to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004) (exhaustion of administrative remedies is prerequisite to court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b458-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
