He argues that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, such as his sentence, is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. He concedes that this court held to the contrary in <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). However, because at least one other circuit has declined to adopt a presumption of reasonableness, Lechuga asserts that a circuit split exists and that he is raising this issue to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-24\">This court must follow its own precedent unless it is overruled by this court en banc or by a decision of the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 91 (5th Cir.1994). Therefore, Lechuga\u2019s argument on appeal is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Alonzo. See also United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.)
