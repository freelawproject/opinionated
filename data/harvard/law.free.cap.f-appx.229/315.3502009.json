Kim also appeals his conviction for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.

We decline to entertain Hester\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which he raises for the first time in this appeal, but we do so without prejudice to such rights as Hester may have to raise this issue collaterally in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v.
