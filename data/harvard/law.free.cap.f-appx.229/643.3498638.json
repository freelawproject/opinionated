No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, as amended by Pub.L. No. 105-139, 11 Stat. 2644. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-23\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying as untimely Rivera\u2019s motion to reopen because it was filed nearly six years after the deadline, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.43(e)(1) (providing that motions to reopen to apply for NACARA relief must be filed by September 11, 1998), and Rivera failed to demonstrate that equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tolling is appropriate in her case, <em>cf. Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Rivera\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of her prior motions to reopen because she did not appeal those decisions to the BIA and therefore those orders are not reviewable. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
