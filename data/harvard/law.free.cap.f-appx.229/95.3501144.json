While awaiting trial on charges including first-degree murder, Davis filed a complaint in the District Court asserting a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He alleges in the complaint that the Commonwealth fabricated evidence against him, and he requests monetary and injunctive relief. The District Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, and Davis now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Davis is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we must dismiss the appeal if it lacks an arguable factual or legal basis. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We agree with the District Court that the Commonwealth is not a proper defendant in an action under \u00a7 1983, <em>see Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), and the suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment, <em>see Laskaris v. Thornburgh, </em>661 F.2d 23, 25 (3d Cir.1981). Because Davis does not allege misconduct by any person amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983, the District Court did not need to afford Davis an opportunity to amend his complaint prior to granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that leave to amend may be denied on futility grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The motions for waiver of fees and for oral argument by video conference are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. A jury convicted Davis of the murder charge shortly after he filed this appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v. Davis, </em>Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County, Pennsylvania, docket number CP-45-CR-0000651-2005. To the extent that Davis\u2019 claim implies the invalidity of his conviction, it is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
