See Fed.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss an 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 indictment when the motion alleges due process defects in the underlying deportation proceeding. <em>United States v. Camacho-Lopez, </em>450 F.3d 928, 929 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-24\">We conclude that the district court erred in denying Nungaray-Rubalcaba\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, because the underlying order of deportation was invalid. We therefore reverse the conviction and sentence without addressing Nungaray-Rubalcaba\u2019s additional assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>To challenge the validity of a prior deportation order, a defendant must show: (1) exhaustion of any available administrative remedies; (2) improper deprivation of judicial review in the underlying removal proceedings; and (3) prejudice. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(d); <em>United States v. Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d 1202, 1203-04 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam). However, if the defendant was not informed that he or she was eligible for relief from removal during the prior proceedings, the exhaustion requirement will not bar collateral review. <em>See id. </em>at 1204 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Nungaray-Rubalcaba was improperly deprived of judicial review and denied due process in the underlying deportation proceeding, because his waiver of a hearing through a written stipulation for removal was not considered and intelligent. <em>See United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1048 (9th Cir.2004). When he signed the waiver, the INS Special Agent \u201cfailed to inform him that he was eligible for a fast-track voluntary departure in lieu of removal, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a).\u201d <em>Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d at 1204; <em>see also Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1049-50 (holding that the failure to inform an immigrant of possible eligibility for relief from removal is a denial of due process that invalidates the underlying deportation proceeding); <em>United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1182 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that a waiver of appeal is invalid if the immigrant is not advised of possible eligibility for relief from deportation). The exhaustion and deprivation requirements in \u00a7 1326(d) are therefore satisfied. <em>See Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">To satisfy the final requirement, prejudice, a defendant \u201cmust only show that he had a plausible ground for relief from deportation.\u201d <em>Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1050 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Nungaray-Rubalcaba had a plausible claim for relief: pre-hearing voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a). Immigration Judges have \u201cbroad authority to grant [pre-hearing] voluntary departure,\u201d <em>In re Eloy Arguelles-Campos, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811, 820 (BIA 1999), and only two classes of immigrants are ineligible for such relief, \u201cthose involved in terrorism-related activity (not at issue here), and those ... convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d at 1204 n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s arguments, neither of Nungaray-Rubalcaba\u2019s two Idaho state law convictions for drug possession qualified as an aggravated felony at the time of his prior removal, August 26, 1999. Then and now, a drug conviction must be punishable as a felony under federal law to qualify as an aggravated felony for removal purposes. <em>See Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905, 919 (9th Cir.2004); <em>In re L-G-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 89, 95 (BIA 1995). Although no longer the law in this Circuit, in 1999, a second drug possession conviction could qualify as an aggravated felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a), <em>see United States v. Garcia-Olmedo, </em>112 F.3d 399, 400 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruling recognized by United States v. Ballesteros-Ruiz, </em>319 F.3d 1101, 1105-06 (9th Cir.2003), but only if the first conviction had \u201cbecome final\u201d prior to the second conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a); <em>United States v. Guzman-Colores, </em>959 F.2d 132, 133 (9th Cir.1992). Here, Nungaray\u2019s first conviction had not become final prior to his second conviction because, under Idaho law, his time to file a direct appeal of the first conviction had not expired. <em>See State v. Jensen, </em>138 Idaho 941, 71 P.3d 1088, 1090-91 (2003) (citing Idaho Appellate Rule 14(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Finally, because the Government has not argued that it can rebut Nungaray\u2019s prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>facie showing of prejudice, there is no need to remand for further proceedings. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Valerio, </em>342 F.3d 1051, 1054 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cOnce [the defendant] makes a prima facie showing of prejudice, the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate that the procedural violation could not have changed the proceedings\u2019 outcome.\u201d); <em>cf. Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d at 1205 (remanding for the government to present evidence in support of its argument \u201cthat no IJ would have allowed [the defendant] to depart voluntarily as a discretionary matter under \u00a7 1229e(a), regardless of whether his cocaine possession conviction was an aggravated felony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Because the INS\u2019s failure to inform Nungaray-Rubalcaba of his eligibility for pre-hearing voluntary departure violated his due process rights, and because this violation caused him prejudice, the underlying order of deportation cannot be used as an element of his conviction under \u00a7 1326. We therefore reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b465-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
