Alvarado-Huerta argues that his sentence is contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and unreasonable as a matter of law. He contends that this court\u2019s post-<em>Booker </em>decisions have effectively reinstated the mandatory guideline scheme condemned by <em>Booker </em>and further argues that, <em>post-Booker, </em>a district court should be allowed to disagree with policy decisions of the Sentencing Commission when imposing a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\">Alvarado-Huerta concedes that his argument that his sentence is contrary to <em>Booker </em>is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005), and its progeny, which have outlined this court\u2019s methodology for reviewing sentences for reasonableness. Furthermore, Alvarado-Huerta acknowledges that his assertion that the district court should be allowed to disagree with the policy decisions of the Sentencing Commission is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006), which held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not give sentencing courts the discretion to impose a non-Guideline sentence based upon the courts\u2019 disagreement with Congressional and Sentencing Commission policy.\u201d Alvarado-Huerta raises these issues specifically to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-24\">Alvarado-Huerta also raises constitutional challenges to \u00a7 1326(b), which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Alvarado-Huerta contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298,163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Alvarado-Huerta properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
