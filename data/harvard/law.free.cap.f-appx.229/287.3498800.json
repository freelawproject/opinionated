Davila-Rodriguez contends that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by denying his request, the day before sentencing, for substitution of retained counsel for appointed counsel. We have reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>record and briefs and conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Norris, </em>780 F.2d 1207, 1211 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see also United States v. Silva, </em>611 F.2d 78, 79 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Davila-Rodriguez also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his 46-month term of imprisonment exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense of conviction. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005); <em>Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006). Davila-Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
