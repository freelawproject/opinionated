SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">Robert W. Rosberg, Jr., a <em>pro se </em>state prisoner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought a complaint in the district court asserting a violation of his constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. The district court dismissed his claims for failure to demonstrate exhaustion of administrative remedies. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-18\">Mr. Rosberg, a Colorado state prisoner, filed an action in district court alleging a violation of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The court noted that prisoners must exhaust administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions in federal court. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The court then cited our holding in <em>Steele v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>355 F.3d 1204, 1211 (10th Cir.2003), which requires that prisoners demonstrate exhaustion in their complaint by \u201ceither attaching] copies of administrative proceedings or describing] their disposition with specificity.\u201d The court held Mr. Rosberg \u201cfailed to exhaust the [Colorado Department of Correction]^ grievance procedure,\u201d and dismissed his action on those grounds. Rec., vol. I, doc. 14 at 3. <em>See also id. </em>doc. 16 (denying Mr. Rosberg\u2019s motion to reconsider).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-19\">The Supreme Court recently held failure to exhaust administrative remedies as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>quired by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) is an affirmative defense and not a pleading requirement. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). We have since recognized that <em>Jones </em>overruled the pleading requirement outlined in <em>Steele, </em>the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Rosberg\u2019s complaint. <em>See Aquilar-Avellaveda v. Terrell, </em>478 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir.2007). As we said in <em>Freeman v. Watkins, </em>479 F.3d 1257, 1260 (10th Cir.2007), \u201cit is no longer appropriate for the district court to require an affirmative showing of exhaustion at this stage of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Because Mr. Rosberg has demonstrated the existence of \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and the facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812-13 (10th Cir.1997), we GRANT his request to proceed <em>ifp. </em>In light of the recent rulings discussed above, we VACATE the district court\u2019s order and judgment of dismissal, and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b764-14\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-20\">. Because he is proceeding pro se, we review Mr. Rosberg's filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
