He also appeals the district court\u2019s finding, based on that conviction, that he violated the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-25\">Bochicchio challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress an eyewitness\u2019s identification testimony on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ground that the identification derived from an impermissibly suggestive photographic line-up and resulted in an unreliable identification. We conclude, that the photographic line-up was not impermissibly suggestive. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>988 F.2d 1384, 1389 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Bochicchio also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of bank robbery. We have reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties and hold that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for a reasonable jury to have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Bochicchio committed the instant offense. <em>See United States v. Roberts, </em>481 F.2d 892, 893-94 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Bochicchio\u2019s remaining arguments, that the prosecutor made improper ex parte remarks and that the district court erred in ruling that proffered defense testimony would open the door to evidence regarding his prior criminal history, lack merit. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 414 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>126 F.3d 655, 658-60 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Because we affirm Bochicchio\u2019s conviction for the reasons given above, we similarly uphold the district court\u2019s determination that he violated the terms of his earlier supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The judgments of the district court are, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
