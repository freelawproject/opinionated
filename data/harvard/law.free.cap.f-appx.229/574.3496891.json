We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion, <em>Engquist v. Oregon Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>478 F.3d 985, 1008 (9th Cir.2007), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Aventis to introduce evidence of Hudock\u2019s prior statement regarding whether driving was an essential function of her position. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402 (relevant evidence is generally admissible); <em>Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that a plaintiff in an ADA employment termination action must be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of the job).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">We do not consider Hudock\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions because she has not shown that she objected to the instructions in district court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1) (an objection to a jury instruction must be on the record, and \u201cstat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection\u201d); <em>Larson v. Neimi, </em>9 F.3d 1397, 1399 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that Rule 51 is \u201cstrictly enforced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">We do not consider Hudock\u2019s challenges to the jury\u2019s verdict and the presence of Aventis\u2019s corporate representative at trial because she submitted incomplete trial transcripts. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2) (stating \u201cthe appellant must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant\u201d to a contention that a finding or conclusion was unsupported by the evidence); <em>Jones v. City of Santa Monica, </em>382 F.3d 1052, 1057-58 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that a claim was \u201cunreviewable\u201d on appeal because \u201cwithout a transcript [the court was] unable to determine wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>er the testimony at trial supported] [appellant\u2019s] position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Hudock\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We deny Peter Moss\u2019s request to file an amicus brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
