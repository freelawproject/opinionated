To the extent we have jurisdiction it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss the petition for review in No. 04-76631 and we deny the petition for review in No. 05-72520.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely- unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated their due process rights by disregarding their evidence of hardship is not supported by the record and does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence they submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW in No. 04-76631 is DISMISSED and PETITION FOR REVIEW in No. 05-72520 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
