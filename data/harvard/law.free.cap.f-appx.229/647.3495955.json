Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 365, 382 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cUnder BIA procedure, a motion to remand must meet all the requirements of a motion to reopen and the two are treated the same.\u201d). To the extent we have jurisdiction it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-24\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency deprived them of due process by misapplying the law to the facts of their case does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-25\">Petitioners contend the immigration judge violated his due process rights by not allowing them more time to obtain evidence regarding the psychological and physical health of their U.S. citizen daughter. The BIA considered the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>evidence, however, and found that it did not satisfy the hardship standard. <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge). We are not persuaded that Lopez\u2019s removal results in the deprivation of his children\u2019s cognizable rights. <em>See Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006,1012-13 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Finally, the evidence Petitioners presented with their motion to remand concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (holding that if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from revisiting the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
