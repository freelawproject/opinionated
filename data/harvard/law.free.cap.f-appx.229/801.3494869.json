MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b829-18\">Petitioner, Jose Castro-Quirino seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from this court so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a final order disposing of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because Castro-Quirino has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-19\">After a New Mexico jury trial, CastroQuirino was convicted of intimidation of a witness, aggravated battery against a household member, and criminal sexual penetration in the third degree. On direct appeal, the New Mexico Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, rejecting CastroQuirino\u2019s arguments of insufficient evidence. Castro-Quirino then filed a state habeas corpus petition which was denied by the state district court. His petition for a writ of certiorari was rejected by the New Mexico Supreme Court as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-20\">Castro-Quirino filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas application on June 25, 2003, raising the following allegations: (1) he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel, (2) his double jeopardy rights were violated, and (3) prosecutorial misconduct and numerous errors committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>by the trial court deprived him of a fair trial. Respondent moved to dismiss Castro-Quirino\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The district court granted Respondent\u2019s motion, concluding Castro-Quirino\u2019s claims were procedurally defaulted due to his failure to perfect a timely petition for writ of certiorari in the New Mexico Supreme Court. <em>See Watson v. New Mexico, </em>45 F.3d 385, 387 (10th Cir.1995). The court determined Castro-Quirino failed to show cause for the default and actual prejudice or that the failure to review his claims would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">This court cannot grant Castro-Quirino a COA unless he can demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Castro-Quirino has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Castro-Quirino is not required to demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA. He must, however, \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This court has reviewed Castro-Quirino\u2019s appellate briefs, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes that Castro-Quirino is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Castro-Quirino\u2019s claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Castro-Quirino has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">This court denies Castro-Quirino\u2019s request for a COA, dismisses this appeal, and grants counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
