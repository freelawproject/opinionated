Thereafter, Plaintiff-Appellee Marie Gaston brought this lawsuit on his behalf asserting, inter alia, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim that various Brown County officials were deliberately indifferent to the risk that Mr. Belden would commit suicide. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity; the magistrate judge to whom the case was assigned granted the motion with respect to the \u00a7 1983 claims against County Commissioners Warren Ploeger, Glen Leitch, and Steve Roberts but denied the motion with respect to the \u00a7 1983 claims against Sheriff Lamar Shoemaker, Sergeant Brett Hollister, and Officer Brandon Roberts. Exercising appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we conclude that the evidence cannot establish a constitutional violation. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">The question raised in this appeal is: \u201cTaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show that the [defendants\u2019] conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Thus, the facts recounted below are taken from the record and presented in the light most favorable to Ms. Gaston. <em>See Thomas v. Wichita Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>968 F.2d 1022, 1024 (10th Cir.1992) (noting that, when facts are in dispute, the nonmoving party may not simply rest on the pleadings but must identify \u201csufficient evidence (pertinent to the material issue) ... by reference to an affidavit, a deposition transcript or a specific exhibit incorporated therein\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">I. Mr. Belden\u2019s Suicide</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">On June 26, 2002, Mr. Belden was incarcerated in the Brown County Jail awaiting trial on a charge of possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell. [II Aplt. App. at 335.] For the first six weeks of his incarceration, Mr. Belden was a well-behaved inmate. <em>[Id. </em>at 338.] Then, on or about August 14, Mr. Belden received a letter from his significant other, Jennifer Renz.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>[Id. </em>at 335.] Sergeant Hollister, the jail administrator, was aware that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Belden had received this letter. [I Aplt. App. at 99.] He also became aware that Mr. Belden had altered his cell window to facilitate the receipt of contraband. [II ApltApp. at 335.] Because Mr. Belden had tampered with the window, Sergeant Hollister decided to move him to a different cell, [id]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Mr. Belden made it clear to Sergeant Hollister that he did not want to be moved. First, Mr. Belden complained about his new cellmates. [Aplt. Br. at 5.] Then, when Sergeant Hollister moved Mr. Belden to a single-person cell, he complained that his new cell did not have a working television. <em>[Id. </em>at 6.] When Sergeant Hollister refused to move Mr. Belden from his television-less, single-person cell, Mr. Belden used a piece of fruit to plug the toilet. [II ApltApp. at 336.] Sergeant Hollister then moved him to a different single-person cell. [7d]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">At 4:00 p.m., Officer Roberts came on duty and was told that Mr. Belden was in a single-person cell for disciplinary reasons. [7d] Shortly thereafter, Officer Roberts began serving dinner to the inmates. At about 5:30 p.m., Mr. Belden came out of his cell to get his dinner, threw his iced tea down the hallway, and refused to return to his cell. <em>[Id.] </em>Officer Roberts was the only officer on duty at the jail, so he summoned Brown County Deputy Doug Brammer to assist him in dealing with Mr. Belden. <em>[Id.] </em>When Officer Roberts and Deputy Brammer threatened Mr. Belden with pepper spray, he went back into his cell. [7d]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">At 6:40 p.m., Officer Roberts conducted a routine check of the cells, and he noticed that Mr. Belden had placed paper over his cell window. <em>[Id.] </em>Although the jail\u2019s practice permitted prisoners to obstruct their cell window temporarily (usually to afford them privacy when using the toilet), Officer Roberts told Mr. Belden to remove the paper. <em>[Id.] </em>Mr. Belden refused and threatened to harm Officer Roberts if he entered the cell. [7d] Officer Roberts testified that he considered this behavior to be out of character for Mr. Belden. [7d]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Concerned about Mr. Belden\u2019s insubordination, Officer Roberts telephoned Sergeant Hollister at home. [7d] Sergeant Hollister instructed Officer Roberts to summon a deputy to assist him, enter Mr. Belden\u2019s cell to remove the paper, and move Mr. Belden to Cell 14. <em>[Id.] </em>Cell 14 is the jail\u2019s suicide watch cell, but it is also used to house inmates who need frequent observation for other reasons, such as intoxication or injury. [I Aplt.App. at 99.] Officer Roberts was aware that Cell 14 was used as a suicide watch cell and that jail procedure dictated that inmates in Cell 14 were to be observed more frequently than prisoners in other cells. [II Aplt. App. at 336.]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">After speaking with Sergeant Hollister, Officer Roberts claims that he immediately contacted dispatch to request assistance, but his jail log does not contain a notation that he did so. <em>[Id. </em>at 337.]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deputy Brammer testified that he was on duty at the time and did not recall hearing that Officer Roberts had requested assistance. <em>[Id.] </em>In any case, Officer Roberts spent the next hour supervising the male inmates\u2019 recreation period and one inmate\u2019s family visit. [I ApltApp. at 120.] During this time, he passed by Mr. Belden\u2019s cell frequently and spoke with him on several occasions. <em>[Id.]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">At approximately 7:45 p.m., Officer Roberts conducted another cell check. [II ApltApp. at 337.] Mr. Belden\u2019s window was still obstructed, and Officer Roberts again instructed him to remove the paper. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>[Id] Mr. Belden replied, \u201cFuck off.\u201d [Id] Although the obstruction had been in place for over an hour, Officer Roberts did not follow up with dispatch to inquire about whether any officers were coming to assist him, and he did not telephone Sergeant Hollister with an update on Mr. Belden\u2019s behavior. <em>[Id. </em>at 338.] Likewise, Sergeant Hollister did not phone Officer Roberts to determine whether his instructions had been followed. [Id]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Shortly after 8:00 p.m., Officer Roberts let inmate Anthony Lawson out of his cell to do laundry. [I Aplt.App. at 122.] Frustrated that no deputy had yet arrived to assist him in removing the paper from Mr. Belden\u2019s cell window, Officer Roberts decided to have Mr. Lawson assist him in removing the obstruction from Mr. Belden\u2019s cell window. [Id at 122-24.] Mr. Lawson was an inmate trusty whom Officer Roberts trusted, and he was also friendly with Mr. Belden. [Id at 124.]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">When Mr. Lawson opened Mr. Belden\u2019s cell door, he found Mr. Belden hanging by \u00e1 sheet from the door handle. [Id] Officer Roberts immediately summoned an ambulance. [Id] Deputy Brammer, who had been upstairs in the sheriffs office doing paperwork for approximately fifteen minutes, heard the call and went down to the jail to assist Officer Roberts. [Id] He estimated that Mr. Belden had been dead for about half an hour when he arrived on the scene at 8:18 p.m. [II Aplt.App. at 286.]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">After the suicide, Mr. Belden\u2019s former cellmates informed jail staff that he had spoken of suicide on several occasions. [Id at 335.] In the days leading up to his death, Mr. Belden had given away his food, rocked back and forth on his bed for extended periods of time, and tied his shoelaces together to see whether they would support his body weight. [Id] Apparently, Mr. Belden\u2019s fellow inmates believed that this behavior was simply an effort to get attention. In any case, it is undisputed that they did not report their observations to anyone in the jail before Mr. Belden committed suicide. [Id]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">II. Training and Supervision</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Both Sheriff Shoemaker and Sergeant Hollister have undergone suicide prevention training, which has taught them, among other things, how to identify inmates with suicidal tendencies. [Id; <em>see also </em>Aplee. Br. at 48 (listing the numerous training programs Sheriff Shoemaker has attended).] According to Sergeant Hollister, his training taught him that a sudden change in an inmate\u2019s behavior can indicate an increased risk of suicide. [II Aplt.App. at 336.] However, he considered an inmate covering his cell window to be a disciplinary issue rather than a suicide warning sign. [I Aplt.App. at 96.] Sheriff Shoemaker concurred. [Id at 141.]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">At the time of Mr. Belden\u2019s suicide, Officer Roberts had not received any formal suicide prevention training despite having worked as a corrections officer for the Brown County Sheriffs Department for eighteen months. [Id at 111-13.] Generally, Brown County Jail officers are offered the opportunity to attend a corrections class that includes a suicide prevention component after they have been employed for a year. [Id at 148.] However, Officer Roberts testified that he had only received on-the-job training through his interactions with fellow officers. [Id at 112-13.] He knew that depression was a suicide warning sign, and he testified that he relied on his common sense in detecting and preventing suicide attempts. [Id at 113.]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">III. Brown County Jail Policies and Procedures</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">As noted, jail officials generally allow inmates to cover their cell windows for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>short periods of time. <em>[See </em>Aplt. Br. at 19.] However, Officer Roberts understood that it was important for correctional officers to have an unobstructed view of the inside of the cells in order to monitor the inmates and make sure they did not harm themselves or others. [I Aplt.App. at 120-21.] If an inmate refused to remove a window covering, jail policy dictated that the correctional officers should forcibly remove it. <em>[Id.; see also id. </em>at 96; <em>id. </em>at 141.] The policy mandated that at least two officers would enter a cell to resolve disciplinary issues such as an inmate\u2019s failure to remove an obstruction from the cell window. <em>[Id. </em>at 96.] Nevertheless, the policy recognized that it was often impractical to enter a cell immediately, and Sheriff Shoemaker testified that if an officer is busy, other inmates are out of their cells, and the officer is waiting for assistance, it would not be unreasonable for a window to remain covered for as long as it was covered in this case. [II ApltApp. at 338.]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The jail also had procedures for dealing with known suicide risks. <em>[Id. </em>at 339.] If an inmate demonstrated any indication of an intention to harm himself, officers would immediately summon Kanza Mental Health to the jail, and Kanza would evaluate the inmate. <em>[Id.] </em>Depending on the specific circumstances of the case, the inmate could be segregated and monitored.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>[Id.] </em>As mentioned, Cell 14 was used as a suicide watch cell at the Brown County Jail. <em>[Id. </em>at 337.]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">IV. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">Ms. Gaston brought this lawsuit as the survivor of Mr. Belden and as the administratrix of his estate, alleging claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Kansas state tort law. After the parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by a United States Magistrate Judge, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The magistrate judge granted summary judgment to the County Commissioners and to Sheriff Shoemaker in his official capacity on Ms. Gaston\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim but denied them summary judgment on the state law claims. He further denied summary judgment on all claims to Sheriff Shoemaker in his individual capacity, Sergeant Hollister, and Officer Roberts. Sheriff Shoemaker and Sergeant Hollister filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">This appeal challenges the denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. When a defendant has asserted qualified immunity, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish: (1) that the defendant violated the plaintiffs constitutional right, and (2) that, at the time of the incident, it was clearly established that the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to a constitutional violation. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151; <em>Cortez v. McCauley, </em>478 F.3d 1108, 1114 (10th Cir.2007) (en banc). The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Fuerschbach v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>439 F.3d 1197, 1207 (10th Cir.2006). It then makes two legal determinations: (1) whether the facts state a constitutional violation, and (2) whether it was clearly established that the defendant\u2019s conducted violated the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>stitutional right. <em>See Blossom v. Yarbrough, </em>429 F.3d 963, 966 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Here, the appellants concede that a jailer violates the Fourteenth Amendment if he is deliberately indifferent to a known risk that a pre-trial detainee will commit suicide, <em>see </em>Aplt. Br. at 23-24 (citing <em>Barrie v. Grand County, </em>119 F.3d 862, 866 (10th Cir.1997), and <em>Frohmader v. Wayne, </em>958 F.2d 1024, 1028 (10th Cir.1992)), and they do not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that the law was clearly established at the time of Mr. Belden\u2019s death. However, they contend that the facts of this case, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Gaston, fail to establish a constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 30. We review this legal question de novo. <em>Blossom, </em>429 F.3d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">At the outset, we must evaluate Ms. Gaston\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal. \u201cGenerally, [the] denial of summary judgment is not immediately appealable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 966. As Ms. Gaston concedes, the denial of qualified immunity \u201cis subject to immediate appeal when the defendant is a public official asserting qualified immunity and the issue appealed is one of law.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Martinez v. Carr, </em>479 F.3d 1292, 1294-95 (10th Cir.2007); Aplee. Br. at 1. She argues, however, that this case is not \u201cproper as an interlocutory appeal since Appellants have not postured the issue(s) of appeal as based on qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, she asks us to hold that we lack jurisdiction because the words \u201cqualified immunity\u201d do not appear anywhere in the two issues presented for review in the appellants\u2019 brief. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Ms. Gaston does not point to a single case requiring appellants to use the words \u201cqualified immunity\u201d in their statement of the issues. Moreover, the appellants\u2019 statement of the issues (not to mention their brief as a whole) makes clear that they are pressing a legal question related to the denial of qualified immunity. Additionally, their notice of appeal specifically states that they are appealing \u201ca Memorandum and Order denying [their] claims for qualified immunity____\u201d R. Doc. 42 at I. The appellants contend that, as a matter of law, the facts in the record do not establish a constitutional violation; if this is true, they are necessarily entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Without doubt, then, this appeal raises a legal question related to the denial of qualified immunity, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">II. Officer Roberts\u2019s Attempted Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Having held that we have jurisdiction over the appeal, we must now determine whether Officer Brandon Roberts is rightly before us. The notice of appeal, timely filed on December 1, 2005, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-12\">Notice is hereby given that Defendants Warren Ploeger, Glen Leitch, Steve Roberts, County Commissioners of Brown County, Kansas, Lamar Shoemaker and Brett Hollister (\u201cDefendants\u201d), in the above-referenced matter, hereby appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit from a Memorandum and Order denying Defendants\u2019 claims for qualified immunity entered in this action on the 17th day of November, 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">R. Doc. 42 at 1. Officer Brandon Roberts\u2019s name does not appear at all in the text or the caption of the notice of appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(A), a notice of appeal must \u201cspecify the party or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice .... \u201d In <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he failure to name a party in the notice of appeal is more than excusable \u2018informality\u2019; it constitutes a failure of that party to appeal.\u201d 487 U.S. 312, 314,108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988). Following <em>Torres, </em>the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure were amended to make clear that \u201c[a]n appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(4). Moreover, the amended Rule permits \u201can attorney representing more than one party [to] describe those parties with such terms as \u2018all plaintiffs,\u2019 \u2018the defendants,\u2019 \u2018the plaintiffs A, B, et al.,\u2019 or \u2018all defendants except X.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>R. 3(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In light of these changes, the dispositive question is whether the notice of appeal has provided fair notice of the parties that intend to appeal the lower court\u2019s decision. <em>See Dodger\u2019s Bar &amp; Grill, Inc. v. Johnson County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>32 F.3d 1436, 1440-41 (10th Cir.1994). We have held that the jurisdictional nature of Rule 3(c) prevents us from considering an appeal by a party whose intent to appeal is not clear from the notice even when the omission of the party is inadvertent and the opposing party has suffered no prejudice. <em>See Twenty Mile Joint Venture, PND, Ltd. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>200 F.3d 1268, 1274 (10th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we have concluded that the omission of one party where others are mentioned by name is insufficient to indicate that the omitted party intended to appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">Here, both the caption and the body of the notice listed five of the original six defendants by name. Nothing in the notice even suggested that Officer Roberts intended to appeal the denial of summary judgment. In these circumstances, we have little difficulty concluding that the notice of appeal did not provide fair notice that Officer Roberts intended to appeal. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider whether Officer Roberts was entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">III. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">Although \u201cneither prison officials nor municipalities can absolutely guarantee the safety of their prisoners[,t]hey are, ... responsible for taking reasonable measures to [e]nsure the safety of inmates.\u201d <em>Lopez v. LeMaster, </em>172 F.3d 756, 759 (10th Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted). Accordingly, a jailer violates the Eighth Amendment if he shows deliberate indifference to a convicted inmate\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); see <em>also Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). \u201cUnder the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, pretrial detainees ... are entitled to the same degree of protection regarding medical attention as that afforded convicted inmates under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Frohmader, </em>958 F.2d at 1028; <em>see also Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Claims arising from a failure to prevent prisoner suicide \u201care considered and treated as claims based on the failure of jail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>officials to provide medical care for those in their custody.\u201d <em>Barrie, </em>119 F.3d at 866. Thus, a plaintiff bringing such a claim must prove that his jailer was \u201cdeliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of suicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cDeliberate indifference has objective and subjective components.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Poppell, </em>471 F.3d 1155, 1159 (10th Cir.2006). The objective component of the test is met if the harm suffered was sufficiently serious. <em>Id. </em>Obviously, suicide satisfies this requirement. <em>See Collins v. Seeman, </em>462 F.3d 757, 760 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201c[I]t goes without saying that suicide is a serious harm.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The subjective component of the test requires a showing that the defendant acted with a culpable state of mind. In <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>the Supreme Court observed that the required mens rea lies \u201csomewhere between the poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other....\u201d 511 U.S. at 836,114 S.Ct. 1970. The Court then held that \u201ca prison official cannot be found liable ... unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837,114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The Court made clear that the defendant\u2019s knowledge of a substantial risk may be proven by circumstantial evidence, including evidence \u201cthat the risk was obvious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970. However, the threshold for obviousness is very high. <em>See, e.g., Perez v. Oakland County, </em>466 F.3d 416, 435-36 (6th Cir.2006) (Griffin, J., concurring) (\u201cAdmittedly, it may have been unwise to credit Perez\u2019s characterization of his state of mind and his explanation for discontinuing his medication, particularly in light of his history and his unmedicated state itself____[However, i]f one fails to perceive a strong likelihood, one cannot then be <em>deliberately </em>indifferent to it.\u201d); <em>Collins, </em>462 F.3d at 761 (\u201c[A] request to see a crisis counselor ... is not sufficient to put a defendant on notice that an inmate poses a substantial and imminent risk of suicide.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">A. <em>Sergeant Hollister</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The magistrate judge denied Sergeant Hollister\u2019s motion for summary judgment because \u201cthe evidence presented raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff can establish ... (1) whether Defendant Hollister ... had knowledge of the specific risk that Belden would attempt to commit suicide; or (2) whether the evidence demonstrates that the risk of Belden committing suicide was so substantial or pervasive that knowledge by [Sergeant Hollister] can be inferred.\u201d II Aplt.App. at 346. He contends that the evidence in the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. Gaston, cannot establish that he was deliberately indifferent to the risk that Mr. Belden would kill himself. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The magistrate judge relied on the following evidence in reaching the conclusion that Sergeant Hollister was not entitled to qualified immunity: (1) Mr. Belden\u2019s cellmates observed suicidal behavior and heard him discussing suicide; (2) Mr. Belden was not a disciplinary problem until the day of his death; (3) Mr. Belden received a letter from Ms. Renz on the day of his death and Sergeant Hollister was aware of the receipt and contents of the letter; (4) Sergeant Hollister had training in detecting suicidal inmates; (5) Sergeant Hollister placed Mr. Belden in a single-person cell; (6) Mr. Belden plugged the toilet in his new cell; (7) Officer Roberts told Sergeant Hollister about Mr. Belden\u2019s continued insubordination between 4:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>and 6:40 p.m.; (8) Sergeant Hollister instructed Officer Roberts to remove the paper from Mr. Belden\u2019s cell window and transfer him to Cell 14; (9) Cell 14 was the suicide watch cell; and (10) Sergeant Hollister never followed-up with Officer Roberts to check on the situation with Mr. Belden. <em>Id. </em>at 346-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Much of this evidence has no bearing on whether Sergeant Hollister knew that Mr. Belden was suicidal. For example, the magistrate judge noted that there was no evidence that Sergeant Hollister was aware of the suicidal behavior observed by Mr. Belden\u2019s cellmates. Indeed, the inmates uniformly stated that they had not told any jail officials about their observations because they did not believe Mr. Belden was suicidal. Nevertheless, the magistrate judge believed that a jury could find that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">[I]f the jailers had been properly monitoring the inmates, the jailers would have heard Belden talk about suicide, would have observed Belden give away his food, would have watched Belden repeatedly rock back and forth on his bed, and would have noticed Belden tying his shoelaces together to test the ability of the shoelaces to hold his body weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 350. This is hardly a proper inference to be drawn from the evidence because it presumes that jailers have a constitutional duty to monitor inmates constantly. However, jailers are neither obligated nor able to watch every inmate at every minute of every day. The record is clear that Sergeant Hollister and his colleagues were not aware of the strange behavior described by Mr. Belden\u2019s cellmates. Under these circumstances, we would not permit a jury to infer that their failure to notice contributed to the \u201chigher degree of fault than negligence\u201d required for deliberate indifference. <em>Berry v. City of Muskogee, </em>900 F.2d 1489, 1495 (10th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">With respect to the letter from Ms. Renz, Sergeant Hollister testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">A. He received a letter through the mail. It had been logged in by the jailers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\">Q. That letter, did anyone at the jail look at that before they gave it to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">A. Apparently so because the other dayshift jailer had mentioned it to me that ... [Ms. Renz] wanted to know why he wouldn\u2019t come to the window when she honked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">Q. Did you ever observe that letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">A. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">I Aplt.App. at 99; <em>see also </em>II Aplt.App. at 269. The letter is not in the record, and nothing in the record further illuminates its contents. Nevertheless, the magistrate judge seemingly presumed that it was a \u201cDear John\u201d letter. This is pure speculation that finds no support in the record. According to Deputy Brammer, Ms. Renz arrived at the hospital soon after Mr. Belden was taken there. II Aplt.App. at 290. She told the emergency room physician that she had spoken with Mr. Belden the day before and that \u201c[h]e told her that he loved her but did not make any suggestion that he might be particularly depressed or suicidal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320. From this evidence, a jury would have no basis for inferring that there was anything amiss in Mr. Belden\u2019s relationship with Ms. Renz, let alone that the defendants were aware of it and deliberately indifferent to its effect on his mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">Sergeant Hollister admitted that Mr. Belden was generally a well-behaved inmate prior to August 14, 2002, and he agreed that a sudden shift in behavior can be a harbinger of suicide. I Aplt.App. at 98. However, he testified unequivocally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>that Mr. Belden\u2019s behavior did not dramatically change on the day he ended his life, and he viewed Mr. Belden\u2019s conduct as a disciplinary issue only. <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 106. He explained: \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was suicidal____[H]e was just being uncooperative because he didn\u2019t want to be removed from that cell because I believe that that [sic] window had been altered to get contraband into the facility, so he didn\u2019t want to move because of possibly getting contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. Sergeant Hollister further testified that, in light of his drug history, Mr. Belden could be expected to be angry about being moved into a cell in which he would not be able to receive contraband. <em>Id. </em>Still, \u201c[h]e wasn\u2019t that upset when I moved him. He argued the point. He said well I don\u2019t want to move---- He was never out of control. He did not yell or scream.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Nevertheless, Sergeant Hollister later ordered Officer Roberts to move Mr. Belden to Cell 14, the suicide watch cell. <em>Id. </em>at 110. He also chose not to call Officer Roberts to verify that his orders had been carried out because \u201cI didn\u2019t believe there would be a problem with him later. If he had a second jailer or an officer [with Officer Roberts] I didn\u2019t feel there was going to be a problem. He had already complied when two people were there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Certainly, a jury would be entitled to disbelieve Sergeant Hollister\u2019s testimony. However, the rigorous deliberate indifference standard requires knowledge that an inmate is suicidal or a risk that is so obvious and substantial that knowledge can be inferred. We would not permit a jury to infer knowledge simply from the fact that Sergeant Hollister instructed Officer Roberts to move Mr. Belden to Cell 14 because it is undisputed that Cell 14 was not solely used as a suicide watch cell. Moreover, the record contains no evidence that Mr. Belden\u2019s behavior was unusual for an inmate, especially an inmate who had been deprived of his access to contraband and moved to an isolated cell without a working television. Sergeant Hollister\u2019s suicide prevention training left him sensitive to clues of possible suicide, but there is no evidence that Mr. Belden exhibited any of these tendencies. He simply was not an obvious suicide risk. Because there is no evidence that Sergeant Hollister considered Mr. Belden suicidal, he could not have been deliberately indifferent to the risk of suicide. Accordingly, we conclude that he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">B. <em>Sheriff Shoemaker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">\u201cA supervisor is not liable under section 1983 unless an affirmative link exists between the constitutional deprivation and either the supervisor\u2019s personal participation, his exercise of control or direction, or his failure to supervise.\u201d <em>Meade v. Grubbs, </em>841 F.2d 1512, 1527 (10th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Additionally, \u201c[liability of a supervisor under \u00a7 1983 must be predicated on the supervisor\u2019s deliberate indifference, rather than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Green v. Branson, </em>108 F.3d 1296, 1302 (10th Cir.1997). Although Sheriff Shoemaker did not personally participate in the events leading up to Mr. Belden\u2019s suicide, the magistrate judge ruled that he could be liable for inadequately supervising and training Sergeant Hollister and Officer Roberts. II ApltiApp. at 344-46. On appeal, he argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity because he was, at most, negligent. Aplt. Br. at 32. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">As the Sheriff of Brown County, Sheriff Shoemaker is ultimately responsible for the operation of the Brown County Jail and the conduct of its employees. Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 19-811 (2005). Thus, he is responsible for the policy decision that jail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>ers typically are not even offered a basic corrections class until they have been employed for a year. He is likewise accountable for the fact that Officer Roberts was employed for eighteen months without undergoing any formal training\u2014let alone any suicide prevention training. Furthermore, Sheriff Shoemaker is responsible for leaving 23 inmates in the charge of one jailer for an entire eight-hour shift, such that any disturbance would require the jailer to summon a road deputy who could take an hour or more to respond. Although we are sensitive to the constraints on budget and manpower faced by a small sheriffs department, these policies are troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Yet, as the sheriff emphasizes, mere negligence is not enough; he must have been deliberately indifferent to the risk of prisoner suicide if he is to be liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>Green, </em>108 F.3d at 1302. Thus, the record must contain evidence from which a jury could infer that Sheriff Shoemaker knew that his policies were insufficient to protect inmates from the risk of suicide. We have reviewed the record, and we find no such evidence. Sheriff Shoemaker has undergone extensive suicide prevention training by Kanza and other mental health and correctional agencies. <em>See </em>I Aplt.App. at 139-40. During his eight-year tenure, Mr. Belden was the first inmate to have taken his own life despite more than seventy-five prior suicide attempts. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41. Nothing in the sheriffs training or experience put him on notice that his policy of notifying Kanza at the first sign that an inmate was considering harming himself was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">While, in hindsight, it is clear that Sheriff Shoemaker could have better trained and supervised his subordinates, there is no evidence that he was deliberately indifferent to the risk of inmate suicide. Moreover, there is no evidence that Officer Roberts would have prevented Mr. Belden\u2019s suicide if he had been better trained; after all, Sergeant Hollister underwent several Kanza training courses and testified that he did not believe that Mr. Belden was a suicide risk. <em>Id. </em>at 106. Accordingly, Sheriff Shoemaker is entitled to qualified immunity in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
