The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut sentenced Goodwin principally to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the 188-235 month range set forth in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Goodwin contends that his sentence is \u201cunreasonable in view of [his] history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the need for the sentence imposed, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities.\u201d We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision. In reviewing challenged sentences for unreasonableness, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the sentencing judge; rather, our review is akin to that for an excess of discretion. <em>See United States v. </em>Fernandez, 443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, we consider whether the sentencing judge \u201cexceeded the bounds of allowable discretion[,] ... committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005) (internal citations omitted). We have declined to establish a presumption that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Fairclough, </em>439 F.3d 76, 80 (2d Cir.2006). However, we also have recognized that \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27. This reflects the fact that \u201cby the time an appeals court is considering a within-Guidelines sentence on review, <em>both </em>the sentencing judge and the Sentencing Commission will have reached the <em>same </em>conclusion as to the proper sentence in the particular case.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">We have considered each of Goodwin\u2019s arguments in support of his claim that his sentence is unreasonable and find them to be without merit. First, the District Court reasonably concluded that Goodwin\u2019s unusually high level of education did not necessarily weigh in favor of leniency, since Goodwin \u201chad greater opportunities than many did and [he] still chose to sell drugs rather than to work legitimately for a living.\u201d Second, because Goodwin\u2019s lack of a prior criminal record is reflected in the Guidelines range, the District Court did not act unreasonably in declining to use his lack of a prior record as the basis for a non-Guidelines sentence. Third, it was not unreasonable for the District Court to conclude that Goodwin\u2019s voluntary surrender of cocaine did not support a non-Guidelines sentence because that act corroborated the government\u2019s assertion that Goodwin was a major participant in the drug operation. Finally, Goodwin relies substantially upon <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>451 F.Supp.2d 553 (S.D.N.Y.2005) to support his assertion that the District Court\u2019s 188-month sentence creates an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>warranted disparity among similarly situated defendants. However, \u00a7 3553(a) is concerned with nationwide sentencing disparities, not disparities between any two discrete defendants. <em>See United States v. Joyner, </em>924 F.2d 454, 460 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We conclude that the District Court carefully considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that the sentence was well within the broad range of reasonable sentences that the District Court could have imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
