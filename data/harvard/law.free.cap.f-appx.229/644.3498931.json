To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review in No. OS-76249 and we deny the petition for review in No. 06-70900.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chugh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s final decision and no exceptions to the time limitation apply. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (c)(3). Further, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u00a7 1008.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying Chugh\u2019s motion to reconsider because, despite Chugh\u2019s due process contention, the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying Chugh\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW in No. OS-76249 DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW in No. 06-70900 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
