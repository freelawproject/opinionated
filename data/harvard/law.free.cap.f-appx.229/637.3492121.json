We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>See Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that it properly refused to apply equitable tolling where Nunez Barreras failed to provide evidence that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that equitable tolling applies \u201cduring periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order denying Nunez Barreras\u2019 motion to reopen because the petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v.
