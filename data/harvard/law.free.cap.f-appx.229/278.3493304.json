Curioso argues that he should have been granted cancellation of removal, because the factors favorable to his remaining in this country outweigh the adverse factors. Because Curioso was found to be removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2), we lack jurisdiction to consider this argument. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Curioso also contends that when, after hearing testimony from Curioso and his wife, the IJ refused to hear from any other witnesses, the IJ (1) violated <em>In re C-VT-, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998), by not allowing evidence attesting to Curio-so\u2019s good character and (2) violated Curio-so\u2019s due process rights. We review questions of law and due process challenges <em>de novo. Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 164 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Curioso has not demonstrated that, by limiting unnecessary testimony after the IJ had already determined that Curioso lacked good moral character, the IJ disregarded <em>C-V-T- </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 11. Curioso also has failed to make an initial showing of substantial prejudice with respect to his due process claim. <em>See An-war, </em>116 F.3d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
