We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2004). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum because the record as a whole indicates that Toussaint\u2019s attackers were motivated entirely by pecuniary interests, and we therefore conclude that the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Toussaint was persecuted on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). In addition, Toussaint failed to establish that the Haitian government was either unwilling or unable to control his assailants. <em>Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1071-72 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Because Toussaint failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b567-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
