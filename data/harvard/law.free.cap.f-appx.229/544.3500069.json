We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Orozco Sanchez failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, <em>see Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003), and Orozco Sanchez does not raise a colorable constitutional claim, <em>see Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">Orozco Sanchez contends the IJ was biased and violated due process by limiting witness testimony. Contrary to Orozco Sanchez\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [she] was prevented from reasonably presenting [her] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Orozco Sanchez failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
