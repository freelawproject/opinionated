For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On November 10, 2005, Harrier was charged by the grand jury for the Eastern District of Texas with two counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). On March 10, 2006, Harrier and his counsel signed a factual resume stipulating that Harrier had robbed two banks: Bank One in Denton, Texas, on September 12, 2005 (the offense specified in count one of the indictment), and Chase Bank in Denton, Texas, on September 20, 2005 (the offense specified in count two of the indictment). Prior to the admission of the second bank robbery, the factual resume states, \u201cPursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, Relevant Conduct, the following facts are admitted by the Defendant and may be used in calculating his sentencing guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On March 13, 2006, without a written plea agreement, Harrier pleaded guilty to count one. In the judgment entered on March 29, 2006, count two was dismissed on the motion of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">At Harrier\u2019s June 29, 2006 sentencing hearing, the district court accepted the Presentence Report\u2019s determination that two points should be added to Harrier\u2019s offense level on the basis of Harrier\u2019s commission of the second bank robbery. The court concluded that, although Harrier had not pleaded guilty to nor been convicted of this second bank robbery, the offenses admitted in Harrier\u2019s factual statement could be included in Harrier\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Counsel for Harrier objected to the two-level increase at the hearing, arguing that \u00a7 lB1.2(c) was inapplicable. Counsel first claimed that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s not a plea agreement, there\u2019s just a factual statement.\u201d Counsel further argued that, in accordance \u2022with the statement in his factual resume, Harrier admitted the second bank robbery solely for \u201crelevant conduct\u201d analysis under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The district court overruled Harrier\u2019s objection. The court stated, \u201cIf he\u2019s admitting the second bank robbery and stipulating to it in the factual statement, then under lB1.2(c) that additional offense shall be treated as if he had been convicted of that offense.\u201d The court cited <em>United States v. Moore, </em>6 F.3d 715 (11th Cir.1993), in support of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Harrier now timely appeals his sentence. Harrier\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that \u00a7 lB1.2(e) does not apply in his case because he had no plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">This is an appeal from a final judgment of a district court in a criminal case. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Creech, </em>408 F.3d 264, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Section lB1.2(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-16\">A plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) containing a stipulation that specifically establishes the commission of additional offense(s) shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted of additional count(s) charging those offense(s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">The plain language of \u00a7 lB1.2(c) makes clear that this provision does not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>where there is no plea agreement \u201cwritten or made orally on the record.\u201d Harrier argues that there was no such plea agreement in his case. Harrier is correct that there was no written plea agreement in his case. However, after thoroughly reviewing the transcripts of Harrier\u2019s plea hearing and sentencing hearing, we conclude that there was a plea agreement \u201cmade orally on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As Harrier points out, evidence against the existence of a plea agreement can be found in the district court\u2019s statements that \u201cI have no plea agreement,\u201d \u201cthere is no plea agreement,\u201d or \u201cyou have no plea agreement.\u201d A review of the full record, however, makes clear that the court was referring on these occasions to the absence of a <em>mitten </em>plea agreement. The existence of an <em>oral </em>agreement between Harrier and the government can be inferred from the facts that Harrier pleaded guilty to count one of the indictment and the government dismissed count two. This inference receives support from the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[Defense counsel] is telling me that Mr. Harrier is going to enter a plea of guilty to count 1. Is that the government\u2019s agreement, to dispose of this case by receiving a plea of guilty to one of the two counts?\u201d and the government counsel\u2019s indication of assent. It receives further support from the court\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">Mr. Harrier, based upon the factual statement that you have signed and based upon the agreement by the government that your plea of guilty to count 1 of the indictment here, with the understanding that count 2 would constitute relevant conduct, that your plea to that one count would dispose of this entire case-and that\u2019s my understanding here</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">and from Harrier\u2019s expression of assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">These statements by the court and expressions of assent by the government and defendant also indicate that the plea agreement was \u201cmade orally on the record,\u201d since the terms of the agreement were stated and assented to on the record. We therefore conclude that Harrier\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Harrier\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
