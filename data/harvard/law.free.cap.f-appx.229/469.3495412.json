We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Sherg\u00fcl\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because he filed it more than a year after the BIA\u2019s June 29, 2004 order, and Shergill failed to demonstrate that he qualified for any exception to the ninety-day time limit. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Shergill did not provide sufficient evidence that conditions in India have changed so that he now has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that the critical question is \u201cwhether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b497-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
