We deny in part, dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Garcia\u2019s contention that the BIA erred by summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination that an applicant has failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, <em>see Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003), and Garcia does not raise a colorable due process claim, <em>see Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-18\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA .to reinstate the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b549-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
