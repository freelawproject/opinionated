Petitioners do not contest the agency\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture, and cancellation of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.2007). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and remand on the issue of voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Petitioners contend the notices to appear were defective because the issuing official did not state her title, and the government therefore did not meet its burden to show that jurisdiction vested with the immigration court. This contention is foreclosed by our recent opinion, <em>Kohli v. Gonzales. See id. </em>at 1066-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 59-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the previous voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
