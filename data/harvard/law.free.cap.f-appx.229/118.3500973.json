The IJ found that Silalahi did not timely file for asylum and did not establish his eligibility for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. Silalahi only seeks review of the withholding of removal claim, and we limit our discussion to that claim. We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">Silalahi is a citizen of Indonesia and a Christian. He arrived in the United States in 1997, and later married his wife, also an Indonesian Christian. The couple has two American-born children. Silalahi concedes that he did not experience any persecution in Indonesia because of his religion and, indeed, did not experience <em>any </em>problem being a Christian. He claims, however, that religious violence since 1998 and the rise of radical Islamic groups have made him fearful of returning to Indonesia. He points to State Department reports noting religious tension and violence in various regions of Indonesia and, in particular, relies upon a 2004 State Department Travel Warning describing the potential for attacks against United States citizens throughout Indonesia, documents with which we have not been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">We have jurisdiction over the order of the BIA under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(b)(2) and 1252(d). When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>See Ayuk Ako Obale v. Attorney Gen. of the United States, </em>453 F.3d 151, 161 (3d Cir.2006). We will conclude that the IJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 379, 381 (3d Cir.2005)). We exercise plenary review over questions of law. <em>Jeune v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the United States, </em>476 F.3d 199, 201 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Withholding of removal is granted where a \u201cclear probability\u201d exists that the petitioner\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d upon removal to a particular country. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir.2005). Silalahi claims that the IJ erred in determining that he would not be persecuted by the Indonesian government on the basis of his faith or because he was the parent of United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">With respect to Silalahi\u2019s claim that he would be persecuted on the basis of his faith, the IJ found that Silalahi was a \u201cmere member\u201d of a congregation and would not be persecuted simply because he attended church on Sunday. His only evidence supporting a fear of persecution was his testimony that a bombing in Bali in 2002 and a bombing of a Marriott hotel were targeted at Christians which, the IJ found, they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The IJ also concluded that there was no evidence that the Indonesian government was involved in any religious conflict between Christians and Muslims in Indonesia, much less that it targeted Christians for persecution. Rather, the IJ found, the government was actively protecting the Christian minority, and prosecuted Islamic fundamentalists responsible for attacks on Christians. The IJ noted that Silalahi\u2019s fear that conditions could worsen was \u201cpurely speculative.\u201d There is nothing in the record that would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude, contrary to the conclusion reached by the IJ, that a \u201cclear probability\u201d exists that Silalahi would be persecuted because of his faith upon his return to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Neither is there anything in the record to suggest that the IJ erred when she determined that parents of United States citizens did not constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d and that, even if they did, Silalahi would not face persecution as a member of that group. Indeed, there is no evidence whatsoever that parents of United States citizen\u2014children have been or will be persecuted in Indonesia or that the children themselves will be persecuted simply because they happened to have been born in the United States. Any fear in these regards, the IJ found, was again \u201cpurely speculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Because Silalahi has not shown a clear probability that his life or his freedom, or the life or freedom of his children, will be threatened upon removal to Indonesia, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
