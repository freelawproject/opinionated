Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part, deny in part, and remand in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary hardship determination, as well as petitioner\u2019s non-colorable claim that the agency failed to consider adequately all the hardship factors in his case. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Although we retain jurisdiction to review colorable legal and constitutional challenges, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), petitioner\u2019s equal protection and due process challenges to the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (\u201cNACARA\u201d) are foreclosed, see <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 602-03 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cCongress\u2019s decision to afford more favorable treatment to certain aliens \u2018stems from a rational diplomatic decision to encourage such aliens to remain in the United States\u2019 \u201d); <em>Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting a due process challenge because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was deprived of a qualifying liberty interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s streamlined decision fails to provide the minimal review necessary to comport with due process is also foreclosed. <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir.2003) (rejecting constitutional challenge to streamlining regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the [Board] issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d Because the Board erred when it issued a streamlined decision and reduced the voluntary departure period from 60 to 30 days, we grant the petition for review in part and remand for reinstatement of the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part, GRANTED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b499-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
