In his complaint dated December 18, 2006, Daniels alleged that in August 1995, he was prescribed Prozac by Dr. Deleon. He claimed that on March 25, 1996, while still taking Prozac, he attacked another prisoner with a hot iron causing serious injuries. Daniels stated that in January 2005 he learned that Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, concealed reports from physicians who had described instances of Prozac causing users to become violent. Daniels named as defendants Dr. Deleon, Eli Lilly, the Food and Drug Administration, and the FDA\u2019s chairpersons. The District Court dismissed the complaint before service for failure to state a claim. Daniels filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-22\">Daniels alleged that the defendants violated his constitutional rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments by committing negligence, fraud, and medical malpractice. We agree with the District Court that Eli Lilly was not a state actor and that the alleged negligence of the FDA, its members, and Dr. Deleon did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (\u201c[Liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process\u201d). Moreover, Daniels admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>that his tort claim was rejected as untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-15\">. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state law claims. Moreover, we note that while Daniels stated that he learned of the possible side effects of Prozac in January 2005, several lawsuits concerning such side effects were consolidated in 1992. <em>See Winkler v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>101 F.3d 1196 (7th Cir.1996). Thus, his claims were discoverable long before January 2005 and appear to have been filed beyond the two-year statute of limitations for such actions. <em>See </em>42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5524.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
