Castillo-Palafox contends, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred by applying a 16-level increase to his offense level, based on its finding that his 2002 state felony conviction for assault was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Castillo-Palafox\u2019s assault offense was committed under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) and (b)(2) (Vernon 2003), which does not set forth a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)) (reflecting that simple assault is not an enumerated offense constituting a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d); <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 882 (5th Cir.2006)(determining that use of force is not an element of \u00a7 22.01(a)(1)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1351, 167 L.Ed.2d 144 (2007). Given this prejudicial error, Castillo-Palafox\u2019s sentence is vacated and this matter remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion. <em>See Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d at 885; <em>United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 313 (5th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-23\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-19\">. The government argues that section 22.01(a)(1) had use of force as an element and is thus a crime of violence under section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), citing <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>325 F.3d 553 (5th Cir.2003). However, <em>Shelton </em>was decided before this Court\u2019s en banc opinions in <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc), and <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 257 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc). As explained in <em>Villegas-Hemandez, </em>we clarified in those cases that an offense is a crime of violence under section 2L1.2 only if the use of force was both intentional and an element of the offense. 468 F.3d at 880-82.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
