He argues that, although his sentence was at the bottom of the guidelines range, it is unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a term of imprisonment greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s objectives. He also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326 offense charged in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">The record reflects that the district court considered factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) when it determined that a 41-month term of imprisonment was a fair and reasonable sentence in Ortega\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Ortega has not shown that this sentence was unreasonable or that this court should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">Ortega\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>fencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ortega contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Ortega properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
