Stakes, Philadelphia, PA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">BEFORE: RENDELL, SMITH and JORDAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"AO\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Appellant Blayney Stakes appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous. Because we agree with the District Court and conclude that this appeal lacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">On January 17, 2007, Stakes filed a confused and convoluted complaint alleging that 72 defendants violated his civil and human rights. In particular, Stakes claims that: (1) Mathew and Tina Knowles \u201csabotaged\u201d his relationship with their daughter, musician Beyonce Knowles, and have, among other things, harassed him, assaulted him, and ruined his reputation; (2) numerous record company executives and musicians used \u201cghostwriters to produce songs\u201d about his life story without his permission; and (3) the Philadelphia Police Department failed to respond to his niece\u2019s 911 call due to the influence of Mathew and Tina Knowles. The District Court dismissed the complaint as frivolous because it was \u201cunable to extract from its ramblings a legal claim.\u201d Stakes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Stakes is proceeding in forma pauperis, so we review this appeal to determine whether \u201cit lacks an arguable basis in law or in fact\u201d and thus should be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Stukes\u2019s complaint, which we review in the most generous light possible, clearly lacks an arguable legal basis. Preliminarily, he maintains that the defendants violated his human rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (\u201cthe Declaration\u201d). However, the Declaration is not a treaty or international agreement and \u201cdoes not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.\u201d <em>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 734-35, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004). Thus, the Declaration cannot support Stukes\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">If Stakes\u2019s complaint is viewed as alleging civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he must show that the defendants deprived him of a federal constitutional or statutory right while acting under color of state law. <em>Kaucher v. County of Bucks, </em>455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir.2006). This he cannot do. First, even if we accepted Stukes\u2019s complaint as true, he does not state claims for the violation of any federally protected right. Although certain allegations\u2014such as those for assault, harassment, and defamation (injury to reputation)\u2014may be actionable under state law, they do not implicate any federal constitutional or statutory right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stukes\u2019s complaint thus lacks legal merit on this basis alone. Second, it is beyond question that neither the Knowles family nor the record company executives and musicians are state actors or acted under color of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 620-22, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991) (explaining state actor and state action standards). As such, Stukes\u2019s claims have no arguable legal merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\">. Stakes does assert that the Philadelphia Police Department discriminated against his niece when they failed to respond to her 911 telephone call. However, even if the police did in some way violate his niece's civil rights, Stakes \"cannot sue for the deprivation of another\u2019s civil rights.\u201d <em>O\u2019Malley </em>v. <em>Brierley, </em>477 F.2d 785, 789 (3d Cir.1973). <em>See Archuleta v. McShan, </em>897 F.2d 495, 497 (10th Cir.1990) (\"[RJegardless of what happened to plaintiff's father, this case turns upon whether plaintiff personally suffered any deprivation of a constitutional right possessed by him individually.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-16\">. Stakes also alleges that he had \u201cproblems\u201d and a \"run in\u201d with a public library security guard. Private security guards can, in some circumstances, act under color of state law. <em>See Griffin v. </em>Maryland, 378 U.S. 130, 135, 84 S.Ct. 1770, 12 L.Ed.2d 754 (1964). However, in this case, apart from failing to allege that the security guard deprived him of his civil rights, Stakes provides no information that could lead to the inference that the security guard was \"possessed of state authority and purported] to act under that authority,\u201d as is required to show state action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
