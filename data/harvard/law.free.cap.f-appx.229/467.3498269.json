We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the evidence was not material because it related to the health of Lizardi\u2019s mother, who was neither a lawful permanent resident nor a United States citizen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) (requiring that to be eligible for cancellation of removal, an alien who has not been admitted lawfully for permanent residence must establish, among other factors, \u201cthat removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d). We are therefore unable to conclude that the denial of the motion was \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>295 F.3d at 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
