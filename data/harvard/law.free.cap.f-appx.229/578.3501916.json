To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001), and review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review in No. 05-74793, and deny the petition for review in No. 06-71277.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that SalazarManzano failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003). SalazarManzano\u2019s contentions that the IJ\u2019s order violated his constitutional guarantees under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses are unpersuasive. <em>See Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 517; <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). We therefore dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review in No. 05-74793.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the performance by prior counsel did not result in prejudice to Salazar-Manzano, and thus his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice). We therefore deny the petition for review in No. 06-71277.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">In No. 05-74793, PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">In No. 06-71277, PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
