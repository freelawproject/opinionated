Ndi requested relief from removal in the forms of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. After a hearing, the IJ concluded that Ndi\u2019s allegations were not credible and denied relief. The BIA affirmed without opinion. Ndi now petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">When the BIA does not render its own opinion, but instead adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). Legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 817. Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [ ] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18. \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We also review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 401 F.3d </em>1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">On appeal, Ndi argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by cogent reasons, and that the IJ failed to give the testimony at the hearing and his supporting evidence sufficient weight. He contends that the inconsistencies and omissions do not go to the heart of his claim, and thus would not form the basis of an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">To establish eligibility for asylum, the petitioner has the burden of proving that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6d\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1), 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286. The testimony of an applicant, if found to be credible, is alone sufficient to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishment as the applicant repeatedly recounts his story. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Dailide v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2004). Credible testimony may be sufficient to sustain an applicant\u2019s burden of proving eligibility for asylum, but \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Conversely, \u201can adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant,\u201d and the IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for her credibility finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Nevertheless, when the IJ enumerates an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and is supported by the record, \u201cwe will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>DMuhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">This court has not explained whether adverse credibility findings must go to the heart of the claim rather than being based on minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, or admissions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, we need not decide this issue here because the inconsistencies were relevant and material to whether Ndi was in fact persecuted. The IJ found that the record contained \u201csubstantial and material evidentiary gaps\u201d which reflected adversely on Ndi\u2019s credibility, that Ndi presented false testimony, and \u201cexaggerated and embellished\u201d his claim and the underlying facts. Among the material inconsistencies cited by the IJ were the conflicting testimony and documentary evidence with regard to when Ndi joined the Southern Cameroon Leadership Council (\u201cSCNC\u201d), whether he had ever been arrested-a question that Ndi answered 3 different ways in the airport interview, asylum application, and during direct testimony- and Ndi never mentioned to the immigration inspector that he was beaten. Also, the IJ was not able to authenticate Ndi\u2019s documentary evidence, such as his alleged SCNC card and supporting affidavits, and the IJ indicated more than once that supporting documentary evidence contained indicia of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Because of all of the inconsistencies noted by the IJ, the IJ did not err in finding that Ndi was not credible. <em>See Dailide, </em>387 F.3d at 1343. Moreover, the IJ specifically enumerated the inconsistencies and considered all of the evidence, and there was no reliable corroborating documentation available. We have previously found that substantial evidence supports an adverse credibility finding where the asylum seeker adds new facts or incidents of abuse to his story at the hearing. See <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Ndi also argues that the IJ relied too heavily on statements he made to the immigration officer at the airport and the asylum officer during the credible fear interview. Regardless of the weight to be given such interviews, in this case it is clear that the IJ based her decision on the record as a whole and not just the arrival and credible fear interviews. Because the IJ weighed the whole record, enumerated numerous material inconsistencies and irregularities, and found that the supporting evidence contained indicia of possible fraud, the IJ did not err in making the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Ndi\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">.
