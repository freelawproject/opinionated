We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Oliver v. Keller, </em>289 F.3d 623, 626 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-23\">The district court properly granted summary judgment because Young failed to raise a triable issue as to whether defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996). Young\u2019s disagreement with the medical defendants\u2019 chosen course of treatment is not sufficient. <em>See id. </em>(holding a difference in opinion between the physician and the prisoner concerning the appropriate course of treatment does not amount to deliberate indifference to serious medical needs). Moreover, Young failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the alleged delay in treatment caused by the non-medical defendants resulted in further harm. <em>See McGuckin v. Smith, </em>974 F.2d 1050, 1060 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-24\">Contrary to Young\u2019s contention, the district court did not abuse its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>modifying the pre-trial scheduling order to permit defendants to file a motion for summary judgment, because the request to modify the schedule was made following defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s surgery and review of Young\u2019s pretrial statement, and the court noted that modification was in the interest of judicial economy. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b); <em>cf. Byrd v. Guess, </em>137 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir.1998). Moreover, the record reflects Young was served with the motion to modify the scheduling order on which the court based its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in determining that Young\u2019s documents submitted in opposition to summary judgment were not sufficiently authenticated. <em>See Beyene v. Coleman Sec. Servs., Inc., </em>854 F.2d 1179, 1181-82 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
