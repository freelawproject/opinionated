We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-21\">The new evidence Bolanos-Garzon presented with his motion to remand concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-603 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (holding that if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae bars this court from revisiting the merits); <em>see also Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 365, 382 (9th Cir.2003) (motions to remand are treated like motions to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">Bolanos-Garzon\u2019s contention that the BIA violated his due process rights by disregarding his evidence of hardship does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Traditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-23\">We do not consider Bolanos-Garzon\u2019s contention regarding moral character because his failure to establish hardship is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b696-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
