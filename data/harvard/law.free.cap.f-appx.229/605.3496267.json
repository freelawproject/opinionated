R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Israel Palacios Munoz and his family appeal from the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order upholding the Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying cancellation of removal, as well as the BIA\u2019s order denying their motion to reconsider. To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>See Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition in No. 06-72324, and deny the petition in No. 06-73079.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">On appeal to the BIA, Petitioners claimed that the proceedings were tainted because the Notice to Appear was issued after a notary filed fraudulent asylum applications on their behalf. The BIA correctly determined that this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005) (order) (\u201cRemoval proceedings do not become constitutionally unfair simply because they are precipitated in part by an attorney\u2019s advice\u201d). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Petitioners Israel Palacios Munoz, Ricarda Castaneda de Palacios, and Yanet Palacios Castaneda failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir.2003). We therefore deny in part and dismiss in part the petition in No. 06-72324.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-16\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). We therefore deny the petition in 06-73079.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">In No. 06-72324, PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">In No. 06-73079, PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b634-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
