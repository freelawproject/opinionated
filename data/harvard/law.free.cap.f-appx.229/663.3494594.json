We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">The district court found that Bautista was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because both of Bautista\u2019s previous convictions were crimes of violence. Bautista argues that his sentence should be vacated because his 1996 conviction for Unlawful Use of a Weapon, in violation of Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 166.220(l)(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not a crime of violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review this de novo. <em>See United States v. Piccolo, </em>441 F.3d 1084, 1086 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-17\">Relevant to Bautista\u2019s appeal, a conviction is a crime of violence if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). We use a two-step process to determine if a prior conviction satisfies this definition. <em>See United States v. Sandoval-Venegas, </em>292 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2002). First, we apply the categorical approach from <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 588-89, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) to analyze the statutory definition of the crime. <em>Sandoval-Venegas, </em>292 F.3d at 1106.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, if needed, we use the modified categorical approach to examine documentation or judicially noticeable facts. <em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court recently instructed that to conclude that a statute applies to conduct \u201coutside the generic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>definition of a listed crime ... requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u201d <em>See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 815, 822, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007); <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (emphasizing that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>categorical approach does not require that a statute cover \u201cevery conceivable factual offense\u201d but \u201c[r]ather, the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">We hold that, in light of <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>and <em>James, </em>a conviction under Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 166.220(l)(b) is categorically a crime of violence. Any violation of that statute that the government would realistically prosecute in our view \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-11\">. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount it in detail here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b692-12\">. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 166.220(l)(b) applies to a person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">Intentionally discharges a firearm, blowgun, bow and arrow, crossbow or explosive device within the city limits of any city or within residential areas within urban growth boundaries at or in the direction of any person, building, structure or vehicle within the range of the weapon without having legal authority for such discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARfm\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-19\">. Bautista\u2019s other prior conviction was Armed Bank Robbery in 1998, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b692-20\">. Only \u201cif the full range of conduct proscribed\u201d by the relevant statute \u201cfalls within the Guidelines\u2019 definition of\" a crime of violence does a prior conviction satisfy the categorical approach. <em>United States v. Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>472 F.3d 1087, 1095 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-14\">. Alternatively, we would affirm under a modified categorical approach. Bautista\u2019s plea petition stated, \"on 2/3/96 I intentionally shot a gun in the direction of a vehicle.\u201d Again in light of <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>and <em>James, </em>we hold that any realistic probability of prosecution by the government for firing a gun in the direction of a vehicle would involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
