We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo both questions of law, <em>see Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-23\">The IJ did not err by determining that Flores was removable because her conduct amounted to alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). <em>Cf. Altamira-no, </em>427 F.3d at 595 (finding petitioner did not violate alien smuggling statute where she knew there was an illegal alien in the car, but she was only a passenger and provided no affirmative act of assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-24\">Contrary to Flores\u2019 contention, the IJ properly concluded that Flores was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because she was unable to establish the requisite seven years continuous physical presence after being \u201cadmitted in any status.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(B) (providing that an \u201calien who is paroled ... shall not be considered to have been admitted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-25\">Flores\u2019 contention that the IJ violated due process by failing to inquire further into whether Flores was eligible for relief is unavailing. Contrary to Flores\u2019 contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Flores failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ing prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b573-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
