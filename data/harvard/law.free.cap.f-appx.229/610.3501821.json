He also appeals his 240-month sentence. As the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we recount them only as necessary to support the court\u2019s decisions. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The district court did not err by refusing to accept Cokonis\u2019s proffered guilty plea in which he admitted the offense conduct charged in both counts but refused to admit the alleged drug quantities. We recognize that a defendant may generally plead to the elements of a drug offense without admitting the drug quantity, <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>381 F.3d 859, 866 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>355 F.3d 1191, 1198 (9th Cir.2004), and that the sentencing court in such a case shall either empanel a jury to determine the quantity of the drugs, or, if the defendant has waived the right to a jury trial, the court shall make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Thomas, </em>355 F.3d at 1202 (citing <em>United States v. Banuelos, </em>322 F.3d 700, 702, 705-06, 706 n. 2 (9th Cir.2003)). However, Cokonis objected to the district court empaneling a jury to determine the quantity of drugs (as the government had suggested) <em>and </em>he refused to waive his right to a jury determination, which would have allowed the court to make a finding as to drug quantity. Cokonis objected to a jury determination <em>and </em>barred any determination by the court. Cokonis\u2019s position, in conjunction with his plea to the offense but not to the quantity, left no feasible option for the district court, and thus the court did not err in refusing to accept the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The government timely filed its sentencing enhancement information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. The government filed the information \u201cbefore trial\u201d and Cokonis had reasonable notice of the government\u2019s basis for seeking an enhanced sentence as well as ample opportunity to challenge the prior conviction on which the \u00a7 851 information relied. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1); <em>see United States v. Mayfield, </em>418 F.3d 1017, 1020 (9th Cir.2005). Therefore, the government was not required to refile the \u00a7 851 information following the superceding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Applying the modified categorical approach of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the district court properly determined that Cokonis\u2019s prior Arizona conviction for second-degree burglary (coupled with his unchallenged drug conviction in Colorado) qualified him as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the sentencing guidelines. The indictment, plea agreement, and transcript of the plea colloquy contain the factual basis for the plea as admitted by Cokonis. Those documents unequivocally establish that Cokonis\u2019s Arizona burglary conviction constituted burglary of an occupied home, which qualifies as \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </em>468 F.3d 604, 613-14 (9th Cir.2006). Therefore, Cokonis\u2019s Arizona conviction constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines and the career offender enhancement was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court erred in applying the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the guidelines, that error was harmless because the district court sentenced Cokonis to the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
