We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In his opening brief, Tan fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Despite Tan\u2019s allegations of torture in 1980 and 1981, he failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon removal to Taiwan. <em>See Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931, 939 (9th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c). Further, the record does not support Tan\u2019s contention that the IJ used an incorrect legal standard in concluding that Tan was ineligible for relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
