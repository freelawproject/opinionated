Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review in No. 06-71802, and deny the petition for review in No. 06-73196.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">The evidence the petitioners presented with their motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (holding that if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from revisiting the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-23\">Our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners did not make out a prima facie case of hardship forecloses their argument that the BIA denied their due process by failing to consider and address the entirety of the evidence they submitted with the motion to reopen. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603-04 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-24\">The petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions concerning the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-25\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying reopening. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW in No. 06-71802 DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW in No. 06-73196 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
