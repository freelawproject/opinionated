Perez argues that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement to his sentence because his 1994 conviction of delivery of a controlled substance did not qualify as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He contends that the statute under which he was convicted, Tex. Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.112 (Vernon 1993), punished an offer to sell a controlled substance, conduct beyond the ambit of \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d He asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>state-court documents presented in support of the enhancement failed to show that he had pleaded guilty to delivery of a controlled substance by actual or constructive transfer, rather than by offering to sell a controlled substance. Perez concludes that, absent specifics as to his plea, the Government had failed to prove that his prior conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d that merited a 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">At the time Perez was charged, \u00a7 481.112(a) provided that: \u201ca person commits an offense if the person knowingly or intentionally manufactures, delivers, or possesses with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance listed in Penalty Group 1.\u201d \u201cDeliver\u201d was defined to include the \u201ctransfer, actually or constructively, to another a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia\u201d and \u201coffering to sell a controlled substance, counterfeit substance, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d \u00a7 481.002(8). Perez\u2019s indictment charged him with delivery of a controlled substance by actual transfer, constructive transfer, and offering to sell. As Perez points out, the contents of his indictment are not dispositive because, under Texas law, the State may \u201cplead alternative \u2018manner or means\u2019 in the conjunctive when proof of any one \u2018manner or means\u2019 will support a guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>187 S.W.3d 591, 604 (Tex.App.2006). Perez\u2019s judgment reflected only that Perez had pleaded guilty to the delivery of a controlled substance, without specifying the means by which he committed the offense. Consequently, the district court could not properly have relied on the language of \u00a7 481.112, Perez\u2019s indictment, or his judgment to determine that Perez had committed a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as they are overbroad. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274-75 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). The record does not include a transcript of the guilty plea hearing or any other appropriate documentary evidence that would establish whether Perez admitted to actually or constructively transferring a controlled substance, rather than merely offering to sell a controlled substance. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Accordingly, the district court erred by applying a 16-lev-el enhancement to Perez\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-16 (5th Cir.2007). The Government does not contend that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Perez\u2019s sentence is vacated and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Perez appeals his guilty-plea conviction of, and sentence for, violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 by being found in the United States without permission after deportation. He argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 57-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Perez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Perez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
