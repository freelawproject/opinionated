We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>see Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part, deny in part, and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying cancellation of removal because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">The BIA considered the evidence petitioners submitted with their motion to reopen and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated their due process rights by disregarding their evidence of hardship is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-24\">Lastly, the IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d As in <em>Padilla-Padilla, </em>we are not sure if petitioner can still have the benefit of the voluntary departure order. <em>See id. </em>at 982. We therefore remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>to allow the BIA to determine that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part, and GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
