Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requesting this court review the reasonableness of Conklin\u2019s revocation sentence. Conklin did not file a pro se supplemental brief, despite being notified of her right to do so. The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). While the district court must consider the policy statements contained in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) Ch. 7 (2004) and the statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Under <em>Crudup, </em>we must first consider whether the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release falls within the applicable statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. Although Conklin\u2019s sentence was substantially above the advisory guideline range of six to twelve months, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2004), it was within the applicable statutory maximum of three years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">Next, we must determine whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. Only if the sentence is found unreasonable will we decide whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 437. A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered the advisory sentencing guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that it is permitted to consider in a supervised release revocation case. <em>Id. </em>at 440. Further, a sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court stated a proper basis for concluding that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed (up to the statutory maximum). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">A thorough review of the sentencing transcript indicates the district court sufficiently considered the advisory sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>guidelines range and several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. These factors included providing Conklin with appropriate medical care<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and other correctional treatment in the most effective manner as well as the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). Although the district court did not explicitly refer to these or any other factors, a sentencing court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). In light of this record, and the \u201csubstantial latitude\u201d and \u201cbroad discretion\u201d accorded district courts in devising appropriate revocation sentences, <em>Crudwp, </em>461 F.3d at 439, we are confident the court properly took all relevant factors into account in devising its revocation sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (consideration of issues fully presented for determination is implicit in court\u2019s ruling). Furthermore, we find the district court stated a proper basis for concluding Conklin should receive the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Conklin\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform Conklin, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Conklin requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Conklin. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-16\">. Counsel\u2019s brief reflects the Appellant\u2019s current last name of Williams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">. Conklin suffers from bipolar disorder, anxiety, and panic attacks. An examiner concluded Conklin's mental illness did not interfere with her ability to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of her actions, as well as the consequences of her wrongful acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">. The probation officer\u2019s violation report alleged Conklin committed welfare fraud, submitted untruthful and incomplete financial reports, provided false responses to the probation officer\u2019s inquiries, failed to report her shoplifting arrest, and failed to satisfy her monthly restitution payments. Conklin admitted to this conduct at the revocation hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-21\">. Additionally, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying motions for a downward departure and for a rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
