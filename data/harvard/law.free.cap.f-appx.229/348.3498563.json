Ratcliff sought removal to the United States District court for the Eastern District of Texas. The district court determined there had been no showing of federal jurisdiction and therefore ordered the case to be remanded back to the state court. Ratcliff appeals the order to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">In its ruling, the district court determined that Ratcliff had not established diverse citizenship of the parties, nor had he established the requisite amount in controversy. In addition, the district court noted, \u201c[t]he pleadings in this case ... do not reveal any federal law conferring jurisdiction upon this Court to consider the asserted claims. [UPLC] seeks relief exclusively pursuant to a State law and no counterclaim has been filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">We do not have jurisdiction to review an order to remand based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction unless the case was removed under the civil rights statute 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. <em>Charter Sch. of Pine Grove, Inc. v. St. Helena Parish Sch. Bd., </em>417 F.3d 444, 446 (5th Cir.2005); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Ratcliff has not made the requisite showing that this case was properly removed pursuant to \u00a7 1443. <em>See Johnson v. Mississippi </em>421 U.S. 213, 219-220, 95 S.Ct. 1591, 44 L.Ed.2d 121 (1975) (discussing the two-prong test under \u00a7 1443(1)); <em>see also City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 824, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966) (determining \u00a7 1443(2) gives a privilege of removal only to federal officers and agents).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 1447(d), we lack jurisdiction to review the order to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">The appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
