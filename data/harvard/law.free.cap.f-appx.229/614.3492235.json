The district court did not violate Solorzano-Calderon\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by limiting his cross-examination of the government\u2019s A-file custodian where no proper foundation was laid. <em>See City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>46 F.3d 929, 937 (9th Cir.1995). Additionally, Solorzano-Calderon was not prevented from presenting \u201crelevant testimony])]\u201d <em>United States v. Lo, </em>231 F.3d 471, 482-83 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-22\">2. Any error in the district court\u2019s decision to permit the government\u2019s expert witness to testify, and declining to grant a continuance, is not grounds for reversal because Solorzano-Calderon was not prejudiced. <em>See United States v. Figueroa-Lopez, </em>125 F.3d 1241, 1247 (9th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, </em>36 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.1994) (acknowledging no prejudice where no evidence was presented regarding expert testimony that would have been obtained).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-23\">3. The district court did not err in instructing the jury regarding the elements of \u00a7 1326. <em>See United States v. Cervantes-Flores, </em>421 F.3d 825, 834 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 668 (2006) (approving a similar instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-26\">4. Because only one deportation date was submitted to the jury, \u201cthe jury necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that [Solorzano-Calderon\u2019s] prior removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>United States v. Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>472 F.3d 1087, 1092 (9th Cir.2007), <em>as amended </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-27\">5.

Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir.2006) (permitting enhancement for a prior conviction), as is his challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b), <em>see id. </em>at 1096-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
