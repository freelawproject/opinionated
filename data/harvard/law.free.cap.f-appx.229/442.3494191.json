We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u201cWhere ... the BIA has reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision and incorporated portions of it as its own, we treat the incorporated parts of the IJ\u2019s decision as the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Marcos v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 1112, 1119 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Assuming credibility, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Acuna suffered no past persecution, because Acuna was never directly confronted by anyone from the New People\u2019s Army (\u201cNPA\u201d), in conjunction with threats issued by the NPA. <em>See id. </em>at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding regarding a lack of a well-founded fear in that harm from the NPA\u2019s recent threats is \u201ctoo speculative to be credited as a basis for fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003); <em>cf. Canales-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>441 F.3d 739, 746 (9th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201cthe age of the threats that [petitioner] received are relevant to our evaluation of the reasonableness of [petitioner\u2019s] fear\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Because Acuna failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b471-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
