To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review in No. 05-73211 and dismiss the petition for review in No. 05-76660.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s first motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than two years after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of final order of removal), and Singh has not demonstrated that he qualified for any exception to the ninety-day time limit, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">Singh concedes that his second motion to reopen was numerically barred, and contends that the BIA should have reopened his proceedings <em>sua sponte </em>to correct an alleged miscarriage of justice. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \u201cthe decision of the BIA whether to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority is committed to its unfettered discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED (No. 05-73211).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED (No. 05-76660).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b528-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
