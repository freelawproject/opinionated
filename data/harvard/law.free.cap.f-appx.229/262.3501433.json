For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We have thoroughly reviewed the briefs and joint appendix, including the transcript of the summary judgment hearing, and find no reversible error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated on the record by the district court. <em>See Wagaman v. England, </em>No. 8:05-cv-02258-PJM (D.Md. May 17, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-15\"> Wagaman also challenges the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion for a continuance to conduct discovery. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Wagaman\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
