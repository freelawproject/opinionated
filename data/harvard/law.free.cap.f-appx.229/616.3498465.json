We dismiss in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA improperly denied their motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel because petitioners failed to timely petition this court for review of that decision. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
