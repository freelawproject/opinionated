The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">The government asserts that this Court lacks jurisdiction to address any arguments made by petitioners because they have abandoned their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, [this Court] will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning to the extent that the IJ found that Cassiato had neither satisfied the filing requirements for asylum nor established eligibility for withholding of removal. Accordingly, we will review the IJ\u2019s opinion to the extent it addresses these issues, and the BIA\u2019s opinion on all other issues. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-23\">\u201cThe BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>test, and this Court must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d, 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">An, alien can apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may also be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified....\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Nevertheless, section 1158(a)(3) provides, \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have held that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determinations that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application and failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Here, the petitioners raise only arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum on the merits and do not address the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal or CAT claims. However, the IJ also determined that the petitioners\u2019 application for asylum was untimely. We do not have jurisdiction to review that decision and, accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">PETITION DENIED, MOTION GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
