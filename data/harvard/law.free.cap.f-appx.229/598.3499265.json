The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) found Petitioner removable and ineligible for any relief from deportation after having been convicted of an aggravated felony for \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a). Petitioner now appeals on the grounds that: 1) violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a) is not an aggravated felony in light of California\u2019s aiding and abetting laws; 2) the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) violated his due process rights; and 3) the BIA abused its discretion in denying his Motion to Remand for changed circumstances under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We have held a conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a) categorically constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1145 (9th Cir.1999). However, if Petitioner shows that a conviction under California\u2019s aiding and abetting laws as applied to \u00a7 288(a) criminalizes conduct that falls outside the generic definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d the conviction is not categorically an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as applied to him. <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 815, 821, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>makes clear that it is Petitioner\u2019s burden to provide this Court with cases showing that California\u2019s aiding and abetting laws apply too broadly under \u00a7 288(a). <em>Id. </em>at 822 (\u201c[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute\u2019s language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime. To show that realistic possibility, an offender, of course, may show that the statute was so applied in his own case. But he must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.\u201d). We hold that, in light of the cases Petitioner has provided, he does not make the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We also hold that there was no due process violation during Petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings. Although the IJ did not read the amended charge to Petitioner in non-technical language, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.10(a)(6), (e), this omission did not substantially prejudice Petitioner\u2019s ability to prepare a defense. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). The IJ thoroughly questioned Petitioner as to whether he was prepared given the amended charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s CAT claim because he is an aggravated felon who is not alleging a constitutional claim or question of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
