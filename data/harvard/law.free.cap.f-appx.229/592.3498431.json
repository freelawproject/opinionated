We reject appellant\u2019s arguments (1) that the out-of-court statements of her co-defendant Norma Gomez-Cantu (\u201cGomez\u201d) were improperly admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E); (2) that admission of the statements violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause of the sixth amendment; and (3) that the district court erroneously admitted a witness\u2019s testimony as to what she believed Gomez meant by the phrase \u201cbringing people.\u201d Therefore, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">To establish the admissibility of out-of-court statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), an offering party is required to prove that (1) there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the non-offering party; (2) the statements were made during the pendency of the conspiracy; and (3) the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 175, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987). Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not required. Rather, the offering party need only demonstrate the existence of the relevant conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 176, 107 S.Ct. 2775. A district court need not explicitly find on the record that the offer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ing party met its burden. <em>United States v. Lutz, </em>621 F.2d 940, 947 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The proffered statements themselves may be probative, and therefore may be considered in determining whether a proper foundation was laid. <em>Bourjaily, </em>483 U.S. at 181, 107 S.Ct. 2775; Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There must, however, be some additional evidence of the conspiracy\u2019s existence and the involvement of the defendant and the declarant. <em>Bourjaily, </em>483 U.S. at 177, 107 S.Ct. 2775; <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>844 F.2d 1397, 1402 (9th Cir.1988); Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to admit coconspirators\u2019 statements for an abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s underlying factual determinations that a conspiracy existed and that the statements were made in furtherance of that conspiracy for clear error. <em>United States v. Moran, </em>482 F.3d 1101, 1107-08 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 981 (9th Cir.2003)). We find a wealth of evidence which, viewed along side the challenged statements, strongly supports the district court\u2019s implicit finding that Gomez and appellant were involved in a conspiracy to harbor undocumented aliens. For example, the evidence demonstrated that Gomez was the manager of the Glendale Groves apartment complex and controlled the pricing of its rental units. Although all of the units were identical and a standard rent was established, an assistant manager testified that several apartments used for h\u00e1rboring aliens were subject to extra rent at Gomez\u2019s direction. Appellant either rented or provided the funds to rent several units in the complex\u2014each of which was charged an inflated rent. Indeed, when Gomez became aware that appellant was involved in renting unit 110 at the standard rate, she asked her assistant manager to raise the rent because appellant was \u201cbringing people.\u201d Evidence was introduced from which the district court could find that appellant <em>personally admitted </em>\u201cbringing people\u201d and agreed to pay the inflated rent. In addition, the evidence showed that appellant was instrumental in leasing unit 112 mere days before law enforcement agents discovered thirty-five undocumented aliens\u2014several of whom were successfully prosecuted as alien smugglers\u2014inside. The evidence demonstrated that appellant rented unit 112 for her nephew\u2014later prosecuted as an alien smuggler\u2014under an assumed name for a large sum of cash after discussing the details of the transaction with Gomez. We conclude that the government met its burden of presenting prima facie evidence of a conspiracy involving Gomez and appellant. Appellant does not specifically argue that the statements were not made during the pendency or \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Alleged violations of the Confrontation Clause are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>215 F.3d 951, 960 (9th Cir.2000). Appellant concedes that the admission of Gomez\u2019s non-testimonial statements was permissible under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). We need not decide whether we are still required to apply the test articulated in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), to non-testimonial hearsay statements in the wake of Craw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>ford. See United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1076 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1114, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006) (noting uncertainty as to whether <em>Roberts </em>survives <em>Crawford). </em>Under the <em>Roberts </em>framework, the admission of co-conspirator statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) does not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>Bourjaily, </em>483 U.S. at 183-84, 107 S.Ct. 2775; <em>United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1536 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201c[T]he requirements of 801(d)(2)(E) and the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment are identical.\u201d) (citations omitted). Since the district court properly admitted Gomez\u2019s statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), appellant\u2019s constitutional claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Admission of lay opinion testimony is a matter within the broad discretion of the trial judge not to be disturbed unless it is manifestly erroneous. <em>United States v. Fleishman, </em>684 F.2d 1329, 1335 (9th Cir.1982). An assistant manager of the Glendale Groves, Ruiz-Cota, testified that she interpreted Gomez\u2019s statement that appellant was \u201cbringing people\u201d to mean that appellant was \u201cbringing people from Mexico.\u201d Franco-Beltran argues that admission of this testimony violated Rule 602 because Ruiz-Cota lacked personal knowledge of Gomez\u2019s \u201cthought processes.\u201d We agree that Ruiz-Cota necessarily engaged in conjecture as to what Gomez intended to convey by using the phrase \u201cbringing people\u201d\u2014indeed, it is trivially true that no person can know the contents of another\u2019s mind. However, the testimony was admissible under Rule 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">A lay witness may offer opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on her perceptions, (2) helpful to the finder of fact, and (3) not based on scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge. Fed. R.Evid. 701. Given her perceptions (1) that alien smuggling was occurring at the Glendale Groves, (2) that Gomez was involved in charging premium rents for apartments used for undocumented aliens, it was certainly rational for Ruiz-Cota to infer that Gomez intended to convey that appellant was smuggling aliens when she explained that appellant was \u201cbringing people\u201d as the basis for a rent increase. The opinion was helpful to the jury because Ruiz-Cota\u2019s experiences at the Glendale Groves and her personal relationship with Gomez meant that she was in \u201ca better position than the trier of fact to form the opinion or to draw the inference.\u201d <em>See </em>4 Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 701.03[3] (2d ed. 1997 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). There is no question that Ruiz-Cota\u2019s opinion was not based on scientific or other specialized knowledge. The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this lay opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
