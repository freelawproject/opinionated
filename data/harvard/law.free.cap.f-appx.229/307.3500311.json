Galbert argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence discovered incident to his warrantless arrest. He claims that police officers lacked reasonable suspicion to justify a stop of his vehicle and lacked probable cause for his subsequent arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-25\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress following five testimony by accepting the trial court\u2019s factual findings \u201cunless clearly erroneous or influenced by an incorrect view of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 704 (5th Cir.2003). The clearly erroneous standard is particularly strong in such cases because the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir.2005). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and will not second-guess the district court\u2019s findings as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>118 F.3d 278, 282-83 (5th Cir.1997). Questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>as are the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>of Fourth Amendment reasonableness. <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>298 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.2002)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The totality of facts and circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge at the moment of Galbert\u2019s arrest were sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that Galbert had committed or was committing an offense. <em>See United States v. Wadley, </em>59 F.3d 510, 512 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, there was probable cause for Galbert\u2019s arrest. It is well established that an arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment and that a search incident to such an arrest is therefore valid and requires no additional justification. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>825 F.2d 846, 852 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Consequently, the district court did not clearly err in denying the motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of his arrest. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
