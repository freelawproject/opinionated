We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The evidence Petitioners presented with their motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that they failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600 (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is whether [the] new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard.\u201d) (Internal quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Our conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioners did not make out a prima facie case of hardship forecloses their argument that the BIA denied them due process by failing to consider and address the entirety of the evidence they submitted with the motion to reopen. <em>See Fernandez, </em>439 F.3d at 603-04 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
