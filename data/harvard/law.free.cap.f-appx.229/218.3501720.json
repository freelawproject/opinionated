Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851, the district court sentenced Appellant to life imprisonment for Count One-the statutory maximum punishment for this Count under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841-and to a concurrent term of 360 months imprisonment for Count Two. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-21\">Appellant makes three arguments, which we consider in turn. Appellant first contends that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a new trial-based on effectiveness of counsel-by applying the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), without regard to the recent decision <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). In <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that \u201cerroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice\u201d is a \u201cstructural error\u201d not subject to harmless-error analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 2564-65. In essence, Appellant argues that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>denied his choice of counsel, and that such denial creates an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">However, as <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>makes clear, while the right to counsel of choice and the right to effective assistance of counsel are both found in the Sixth Amendment, they are distinct rights. <em>Id. </em>at 2562-68. The purpose of the right to effective assistance of counsel is to ensure a fair trial, <em>id., </em>whereas the right to counsel of choice is \u201cthe root meaning of the constitutional clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2563. Appellant\u2019s argument fails as a threshold matter because he was represented by court-appointed counsel. \u201c[T] he right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2565. Defendant does not make an independent ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and such a claim does not inhere in his challenge regarding choice of counsel. Moreover, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is only cognizable on direct appeal if the record conclusively shows ineffective representation. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the district court erroneously applied a career offender enhancement to his sentence without submitting proof of disputed facts of the prior offenses to a jury. However, <em>United States v. Booker </em>explicitly holds such earlier convictions exempt from its ruling that \u201cany fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)(emphasis added). As we have since made clear, \u201cthe Supreme Court continues to hold that the Sixth Amendment (as well as due process) does not demand that the mere fact of a prior conviction used as a basis for a sentencing enhancement be pleaded in an indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Nonetheless, Appellant claims that <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), decided just two months after <em>Booker, </em>implies that disputed facts of a prior conviction are no longer excepted from <em>Booker\u2019s </em>holding. To the contrary, <em>Shepard\u2019s </em>holding simply limited the factual record that a judge may consult when determining whether a criminal defendant pleaded guilty to generic burglary when burglary was defined by a nongeneric criminal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Moreover, the dispute in Appellant\u2019s case is whether a prior conviction was properly categorized as a misdemean- or or a felony. Not only did Appellant concede at trial that the offense in question was properly categorized as a felony under federal law, such a legal question is not a question for the jury. Finally, the district court did not use facts of prior convictions to exceed the maximum sentence authorized by law, but rather to increase the minimum sentence. Increasing the minimum sentence does not implicate the Fifth and Sixth Amendment concerns on which <em>Booker </em>and its forebears are based. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 558, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002)(\u201cJudicial factfinding in the course of selecting a sentence within the authorized range does not implicate the indictment, jury-trial, and reasonable-doubt components of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Finally, Appellant argues that the district court erred by relying on the United States Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory direction rather than as advisory. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>pellant further contends that because the district court took the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, it could not take into account a key factor in determining Appellant\u2019s proper sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a): sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine. Appellant\u2019s argument is flawed on two levels. First, the district court followed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851\u2014not the advisory Sentencing Guidelines\u2014when it sentenced Appellant to life imprisonment. Even if that were not the case, we have previously rejected any notion that a court may, in the exercise of its discretion, vary from the sentencing range under the Guidelines to compensate for crack cocaine/powder disparity. <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 633 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[Sentencing courts should not be in the business of making legislative judgments concerning crack cocaine and powder cocaine.... [I]t simply would go against two explicit Congressional directives to allow sentencing courts to treat crack cocaine dealers on the same, or some different judicially-imposed, plane as powder cocaine dealers. Moreover, allowing sentencing courts to subvert Congress\u2019 clearly expressed will certainly does not promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense of conviction, or result in a sentence reflective of the offense\u2019s seriousness as deemed by Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Cornelius Williams, Jr.\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
