We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-22\">Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider did not allege any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), and the BIA declined to revisit the arguments Petitioners had previously made on appeal. Petitioners fail to raise any argument relating to the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration, and thereby waived any challenge to that decision. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Petitioners\u2019 appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b629-25\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
