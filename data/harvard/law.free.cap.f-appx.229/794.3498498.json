Pursuant to the plea agreement, Ms. Hernandez waived her right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with her prosecution, conviction, and sentence. The agreement further provided that Ms. Hernandez waived her right \u201cto appeal the sentence imposed in this case except to the extent, if any, the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range.\u201d Plea Agreement at 8, H 12. The maximum sentence was a term of imprisonment of three years. Ms. Hernandez was sentenced to twenty-one months imprisonment. She then filed a pro se notice of appeal. The government has moved to enforce defendant\u2019s appeal waiver under the procedure set forth in <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-21\">Ms. Hernandez\u2019s attorney filed a response to the government\u2019s motion stating his belief that there was no legitimate basis for the appeal. This court gave Ms. Hernandez the opportunity to file a pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>opposition to the enforcement motion, but she failed to file any response within the specified time period, including several extensions of time. Under <em>Hahn, </em>we consider \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Having reviewed the materials submitted by the parties, we conclude that the <em>Hahn </em>factors favor the government. Accordingly, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion to enforce the plea agreement and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-14\">This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
