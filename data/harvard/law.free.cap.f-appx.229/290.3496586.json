The district court denied Campbell\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Campbell is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Campbell does not challenge the district court\u2019s analysis, nor does he argue that the district court erred in determining that he failed to present an arguable or non-frivolous issue for appeal. Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Campbell has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Campbell\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Campbell\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Campbell has also accumulated a third strike in <em>Campbell v. Bear, </em>No. 06-10196, 229 Fed.Appx. 291, 2007 WL 1493881 (5th Cir.2007), which this court has dismissed as frivolous on this date. Accordingly, because Campbell has accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal brought while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Campbell is further cautioned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions as will the failure to withdraw any pending matters that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
