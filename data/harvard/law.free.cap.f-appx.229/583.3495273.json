Because Ertur was removed during the pendency of his appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), the appeal was withdrawn by operation of law, and the decision of the IJ is reviewed as the final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.4. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), amended by 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">To the extent Ertur challenges the IJ\u2019s decision declining to exercise his <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to consider his claim. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order denying a motion for a stay of removal. <em>See Dhangu v. INS, </em>812 F.2d 455, 458-59 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Ertur\u2019s motion to reconsider, because Ertur\u2019s motion did not identify an error of fact or law in the IJ\u2019s prior decision that Ertur failed to demonstrate the statutory elements for a late-filed motion to reopen requesting VAWA relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6) (a motion to reconsider shall specify errors of law or fact in the previous order and be supported by pertinent authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
