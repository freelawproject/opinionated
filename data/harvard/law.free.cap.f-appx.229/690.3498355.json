RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-21\">Michael Lamb, an OMahoma state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in order to challenge the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Mr. Lamb has failed to satisfy the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny his request and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Mr. Lamb was convicted on two counts of shooting with intent to kill under Oklahoma law. He appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d), asserting five claims: 1) the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to sustain his convictions; 2) the trial court allowed the introduction of improper testimony and photographs; 3) the prosecution made misstatements of law and fact; 4) his sentence is excessive; and 5) these trial errors amount to cumulative error. In a summary opinion, the OCCA affirmed the convictions, addressing each of Mr. Lamb\u2019s claims on the merits. Mr. Lamb then filed a petition for habeas relief in federal district court, requesting a reversal of his convictions or a modification of his sentence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In a thorough report and recommendation, the magistrate judge reviewed each of Mr. Lamb\u2019s claims on the merits and recommended that the District Court deny his petition. After a de novo review of the record, the court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and denied the petition. In a subsequent order, the court also rejected Mr. Lamb\u2019s request for a COA under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 22(b)(1). Mr. Lamb now petitions this Court for a COA in order to challenge the District Court\u2019s order denying his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Before a state prisoner may appeal from a final order in a \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus proceeding, he must obtain a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make that showing, Mr. Lamb must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), state court decisions resolving federal constitutional claims on the merits are entitled to deference. <em>See Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 938 (10th Cir.2004) (holding that AEDPA\u2019s \u201cdeferential treatment of state court decisions [under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) ] must be incorporated into our consideration of a habeas petitioner\u2019s request for a COA\u201d). Specifically, when a state court has decided a petitioner\u2019s claims on the merits, we may grant relief only if the decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)-(2). Moreover, we may not hold that a state court has unreasonably applied federal law \u201csimply because we conclude in our independent judgment that the state court applied the law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Welch v. Sirmons, </em>451 F.3d 675, 682 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Rather, \u201cwe must be convinced that the [state court\u2019s] application [of federal law] was also objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). When a state court issues a summary opinion, as in the case before us, we \u201cfocus on its result rather than any reasoning.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Ortiz, </em>465 F.3d 1229, 1235 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Although the OCCA did not refer to federal law in resolving each of Mr. Lamb\u2019s claims, it applied to each claim a state standard \u201cequally or more favorable to [Mr. Lamb] relative to the federal stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>dard.\u201d <em>Harris v. Poppell, </em>411 F.3d 1189, 1196 (10th Cir.2005). As a result, we treat the state court\u2019s adjudication of Mr. Lamb\u2019s federal constitutional claims as an adjudication on the merits and accord its decision AEDPA deference. <em>See id. </em>Mr. Lamb must therefore show that reasonable jurists could debate the District Court\u2019s application of AEDPA deference. In other words, he must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate whether the Oklahoma court\u2019s resolution of these claims was unreasonable or contrary to clearly established federal law. <em>See Dockins, </em>374 F.3d at 937-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Mr. Lamb argues that the state presented insufficient evidence to establish his \u201cintent to kill\u201d the two victims under Oklahoma law, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 652(A),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a violation of his due process rights. In a habeas proceeding, we review the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution\u201d and ask whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). We have recognized that \u201c[t]his standard of review respects the jury\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences from the testimony presented at trial.\u201d <em>Dockins, </em>374 F.3d at 939 (citing <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781). In other words, it \u201cimpinges upon \u2018jury\u2019 discretion only to the extent necessary to guarantee the fundamental protection of due process of law.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Applying this standard, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the requisite \u201cintent to kill\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. Although Mr. Lamb testified that he shot the gun to \u201cscare\u201d men threatening both him and his son, the record contains sufficient evidence to satisfy the intent-to-kill element. In fact, Mr. Lamb admitted at trial that he intended to kill if necessary to defend himself or his son. Furthermore, to the extent Mr. Lamb is arguing that the state failed to prove he did not act in self-defense (or in defense of his son),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this argument also fails. The record contains testimony by several individuals that supports the jury\u2019s finding that Mr. Lamb was not acting in defense of himself or his son. Witnesses testified, for example, that Mr. Lamb shot one of the victims in the back, that one of the victims ran away once he heard Mr. Lamb had a gun, and that neither victim had been involved in any altercation with Mr. Lamb or his son. In short, based on our review of the record, a rational fact-finder could have found Mr. Lamb guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both counts of shooting with intent to kill. We therefore conclude that the OCCA\u2019s resolution of Mr. Lamb\u2019s evidentiary challenge was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or an unreasonable determination of the facts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). <em>See Doc-kins, </em>374 F.3d at 939 (recognizing that this Court has yet to decide whether sufficiency of the evidence on habeas review presents a question of law or fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\n<em>B. Admission of Photographs and Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Mr. Lamb also contends that the admission of certain photographs and parts of the victims\u2019 testimony was more prejudicial than probative, improperly influencing the jury and resulting in an excessive sentence. Specifically, he asserts that his constitutional rights were violated by the admission of two photographs (showing one of the victims in a hospital bed) and testimony from both victims regarding medical complications. Because he does not allege a violation of a specific constitutional right, he is entitled to habeas relief \u201conly if the alleged error was so grossly prejudicial that it fatally infected the trial and denied the fundamental fairness that is the essence of due process.\u201d <em>Willingham v. Mullin, </em>296 F.3d 917, 928 (10th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). Furthermore, we are mindful that \u201c[fjederal habeas review is not available to correct state law evidentiary errors; rather it is limited to violations of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Thornburg v. Mullin, </em>422 F.3d 1113, 1128-29 (10th Cir.2005). We therefore review the OCCA\u2019s determination of this claim to determine whether its decision is a reasonable application of federal due process principles. In this context, this Court has held that federal due process \u201cwill be satisfied only if the probative value of [the challenged] evidence is ... greatly outweighed by the prejudice flowing from its admission.\u201d <em>Welch, </em>451 F.3d at 688 (quotation omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The OCCA determined that the photographs were relevant to proving the charged offense of shooting with intent to kill. In particular, the court noted that the photographs were relevant to showing the nature, extent, and location of the victim\u2019s gunshot wound and that they did not show any complications arising from the wound. Consequently, their probative value was not outweighed by their prejudicial effect. The District Court agreed that the photographs were not so grossly prejudicial as to infect the trial with unfairness. And we agree. As the District Court noted, we have denied habeas relief in a factually similar case. <em>See Willingham, </em>296 F.3d at 928-29 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that victim\u2019s photographs entitled him to habeas relief when the OCCA had held that the photographs were relevant to the intent-to-kill element of the offense); <em>see also Thornburg, </em>422 F.3d at 1128-29 (holding that OCCA\u2019s decision affirming trial court\u2019s admission of \u201cdisturbing\u201d photographs of the victim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law); <em>Smallwood v. Gibson, </em>191 F.3d 1257, 1274-75 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that photographs did not render proceedings fundamentally unfair in light of their probative nature, the nature of the crime, and evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Similarly, the admission of testimony by both victims regarding their medical complications did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. Again, the OCCA concluded that the probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by the danger of prejudice, noting the testimony\u2019s relevance in proving that Mr. Lamb shot the victims with the requisite intent to kill. After reviewing this testimony, which included the victims\u2019 accounts of complications resulting from the gunshot wounds (namely, a \u201cnear coma\u201d and paralysis), the District Court concluded that the admission of the testimony was not fundamentally unfair and the OCCA\u2019s determination was reasonable. Because the probative value of the testimony was not greatly outweighed by any prejudicial effect, we agree that the OCCA\u2019s resolution of this claim was reasonable and in accordance with federal law. <em>See Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 819, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (\u201c[T]he assessment of harm caused by the defendant as a result of the crime charged has understandably been an important concern of the criminal law, both in determining the elements of the offense and in determining the appropriate punishment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Finally, to the extent Mr. Lamb argues that admission of this testimony violates Oklahoma law prohibiting the admission of \u201cvictim impact evidence\u201d in \u201cunenhanced, non-capital crimes,\u201d see <em>Perryman v. State, </em>990 P.2d 900, 905 (Okla.Crim.App.1999), his argument fails. The OCCA considered this argument and determined that the testimony did not constitute victim impact evidence under state law. Because this is a state law question, we may not consider it or question the OCCA\u2019s decision. <em>Manlove v. Tansy, </em>981 F.2d 473, 478 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>C. Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Mr. Lamb also seeks to challenge his convictions on the ground that the prosecutor made misstatements regarding the law and the evidence during closing arguments. In particular, he identifies: 1) a statement that the jury should subject his credibility to more scrutiny than other witnesses because of his interest in the outcome of the trial; 2) factual misstatements regarding his conduct and his testimony; and 3) a statement implying that certain evidence had been withheld from the jury. The OCCA considered each of these statements and concluded that, although the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper in some instances, they did not affect the outcome of the trial. The District Court held that the OCCA\u2019s determination was a reasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Like the evidentiary claims discussed above, Mr. Lamb\u2019s claim concerning prosecutorial misconduct is properly characterized as a due process claim: \u201cWhere prosecutorial misconduct does not implicate a specific constitutional right, improper remarks require reversal of a state conviction only if the remarks so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Bland v. Sirmons, </em>459 F.3d 999, 1024 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). In applying this demanding standard, \u201cnot every improper or unfair remark made by a prosecutor will amount to a federal constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Tillman v. Cook, </em>215 F.3d 1116, 1129 (10th Cir.2000); <em>see also Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (\u201c[I]t is not enough that the prosecutors\u2019 remarks were undesirable or even universally condemned.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Bland, </em>459 F.3d at 1024 (\u201cThe ultimate question is whether the jury was able to fairly judge the evidence in light of the prosecutors\u2019 conduct.\u201d). To determine whether a prosecutor\u2019s improper statements violate a petitioner\u2019s due process rights, \u201cwe examine the entire proceeding, \u2018including the strength of the evidence against the petitioner, both as to guilt at that stage of the trial and as to moral culpability at the sentencing phase\u2019 as well as \u2018[a]ny cautionary steps\u2014such as instructions to the jury\u2014offered by the court to counteract improper remarks.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Le v. Mullin, </em>311 F.3d 1002, 1013 (10th Cir.2002)) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Although our review of the record confirms that the prosecutor made improper remarks, the remarks do not rise to the level of a due process violation. The trial court immediately corrected any misstatements regarding Mr. Lamb\u2019s credibility and evidence not before the jury. <em>See Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 384, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990) (\u201cArguments of counsel which misstate the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>are subject to objection and to correction by the court.\u201d). Moreover, the evidence of Mr. Lamb\u2019s guilt was substantial, and the jury was instructed to consider only witness testimony, attorneys\u2019 stipulations, and exhibits as evidence. <em>See Bland, </em>459 F.3d at 1015 (\u201cThe jury is presumed to follow its instructions, even when there has been misleading argument.\u201d (internal citation omitted)). In light of the substantial evidence and the jury instructions, the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements concerning the evidence did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>See Malicoat v. Mullin, </em>426 F.3d 1241, 1256 (10th Cir.2005) (concluding that improper statements by prosecutor did not violate defendant\u2019s due process rights in light of \u201cthe strength of the state\u2019s case and the fact that the majority of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was based upon evidence in the record\u201d); <em>Hooper v. Mullin, </em>314 F.3d 1162, 1173 (10th Cir.2002) (concluding that prosecutor\u2019s improper comments regarding the evidence did not violate due process when the evidence was substantial and the trial court instructed the jury to base its decision only on the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Considering the prosecutor\u2019s statements in the context of the entire proceeding, we therefore conclude that they did not compromise the jury\u2019s ability \u201cto fairly judge the evidence in light of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Bland, </em>459 F.3d at 1024. Reasonable jurists could not debate that the OCCA\u2019s determination that none of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks could have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict was a reasonable application of federal law. <em>Smallwood, </em>191 F.3d at 1276 (holding that state court\u2019s decision was reasonable when \u201cnone of the prosecutor\u2019s comments were of sufficient magnitude to influence the jury\u2019s decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\n<em>D. Excessive Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Mr. Lamb also claims his concurrent sentences of 18 and 22 years are excessive and therefore violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. To determine whether a sentence violates the Eighth Amendment, we must determine whether the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime committed. <em>See United States v. Gurule, </em>461 F.3d 1238, 1247 (10th Cir.2006). In making this determination, we consider various factors, including the seriousness of the crime, the fit between the sentence and the crime, and the legislative determination of the appropriate sentence range. <em>Hawkins v. Hargett, </em>200 F.3d 1279, 1284-85 (10th Cir.1999). The OCCA determined that Mr. Lamb\u2019s sentence is well within the state statutory range for a single conviction of shooting with intent to kill. Given this determination and the seriousness of Mr. Lamb\u2019s crimes, the concurrent sentences are clearly proportionate to his crimes. We therefore conclude that the OCCA\u2019s resolution of this claim was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">\n<em>E. Cumulative Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Lastly, Mr. Lamb claims he is entitled to habeas relief on the basis of cumulative error. Mr. Lamb notes that both the OCCA and the District Court identified specific \u201cerrors\u201d made by the prosecutor at trial. As we explain above, although the prosecutor made improper remarks, these remarks do not rise to the level of constitutional errors. Consequently, because Mr. Lamb has not established a single constitutional error, he cannot logically argue that the aggregate of two or more constitutional errors entitles him to relief. <em>See Parker v. Scott, </em>394 F.3d 1302, 1327 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cBecause we find no single constitutional error, we also must reject [the petitioner\u2019s] argument that cumulative error resulted.\u201d); <em>Clayton v. Gibson, </em>199 F.3d 1162, 1180 (10th Cir.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>(noting that a cumulative error argument \u201cdoes not merit review given the lack of any discernible constitutional error\u201d). Hence, we conclude that the OCCA\u2019s resolution of this claim was reasonable as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Because we conclude that reasonable jurists would agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this matter, we deny Mr. Lamb\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss his appeal. In addition, because Mr. Lamb has not advanced \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997), we likewise deny Mr. Lamb\u2019s request for permission to proceed on appeal <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
