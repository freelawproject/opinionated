In the instant appeal, Hintz, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order prohibiting him from filing additional motions in the district court without leave of court, since his direct appeal remained pending in this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-25\">Hintz originally pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement with an appeal-waiver provision, and was sentenced to a 57-month term of imprisonment for bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. We dismissed his direct appeal based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>the appeal-waiver provision, as well as his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw for a lack of meritorious issues. <em>See United States v. Hintz, </em>No. 04-10704 (11th Cir. Jul. 18, 2006) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cHintz I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">While <em>Hintz I </em>was pending, Hintz continued to file numerous motions, affidavits, notices and supporting briefs in the district court. Based on the district court\u2019s rulings on these filings, Hintz proceeded to file three more direct appeals in this Court, all while <em>Hintz I </em>remained pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the issuance of <em>Hintz I, </em>in a consolidated opinion, we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Hintz\u2019s motion to recuse the magistrate judge and to appoint substitute counsel. <em>See United States v. Hintz, </em>193 Fed.Appx. 841 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cHintz II\u201d). </em>We also affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling regarding the manner in which mail is to be marked and delivered to Hintz. <em>See United States v. Hintz, </em>210 Fed.Appx. 883 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cHintz III\u201d). </em>In the meantime, while these appeals were pending, the district court \u201cordered [Hintz] not to file additional motions ... without first seeking leave of court.\u201d It is this order than Hintz challenges in the instant appeal, \u201cHintz IV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">We grant \u201c[considerable discretion\u201d to a district court\u2019s decision regarding how to best protect itself against abusive litigants that \u201cimpair [the court\u2019s] ability to carry out Article III functions.\u201d <em>Procup v. Strickland, </em>792 F.2d 1069, 1073-74 (11th Cir.1986). Discretion afforded to the district court is necessary to allow \u201cthe judiciary [to] respond with imaginative new techniques,\u201d and countermeasures to combat abusive litigants after \u201cnew ideas develop and old devices prove ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1073. \u201cThe court has a responsibility to prevent single litigants from unnecessarily encroaching on the judicial machinery needed by others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1074. Amongst the tactics that we have approved includes \u201climitation of further pleadings without order of court, after the complaint has been filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">Here, we <em>readily </em>find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s order barring Hintz from filing additional motions without leave of court. This is the very remedy that we have approved, when dealing with an abusive litigant. <em>Id. </em>Notably, the district court did not completely preclude Hintz from filing additional motions, it only required that Hintz seek leave of the court before filing to ensure that judicial resources were not occupied by one individual. In short, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. Hintz also has petitioned this Court two times for mandamus relief, which we have denied. <em>See </em>No. 06-15559 (11th Cir. Nov. 30, 2006); No. 06-12956 (11th Cir. Jun. 23, 2006). We dismissed, as frivolous, his appeal from the denial of his motion for bond pending appeal. <em>See </em>No. 06-13864 (11th Cir. Sep. 12, 2006). He currently has three more appeals pending in our Court. <em>See </em>Nos. 06-15922, 07-10047, 07-10128.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
