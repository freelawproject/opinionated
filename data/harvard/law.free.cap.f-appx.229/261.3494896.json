He contends, however, that the regulation in question should be invalidated as contrary to the statute, which he asserts is employment based and should be read in the light most favorable to the alien. Because Balbuena Torres did not raise these specific claims before the Board on appeal from the decision of the IJ, we find that we are without jurisdiction to review them due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-21\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-22\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
