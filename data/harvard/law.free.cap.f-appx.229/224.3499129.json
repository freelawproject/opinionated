The district court sentenced Jenkins to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, within the sentencing guidelines range. Jenkins appealed, and counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there exist no meritorious issues for appeal but seeking review of Jenkins\u2019 sentence. Jenkins filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government declined to file a responding brief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Counsel seeks review of the district court\u2019s decision not to grant Jenkins a downward departure below the guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, counsel concedes the court was never asked to depart and no evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing justified a departure. The district court did not mistakenly believe it lacked jurisdiction to depart; therefore, its decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines is not subject to appellate review. <em>See United States v. Quinn, </em>359 F.3d 666, 682 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990)); <em>see also United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases adopting this rule after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Jenkins raises a related issue, contending the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to move for a downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This issue was not raised before the district court and therefore is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The plea agreement did not include an obligation to file a departure motion but reserved the discretion to file the motion with the Government. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>22 F.3d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 341-13 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>2000) (holding departure on ground of substantial assistance to Government first requires Government to file motion for court to depart). Therefore, we conclude this issue is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Next, Jenkins contends the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(c) (2000) when the court increased the sentence because of his failure to appear pursuant to the court\u2019s order. Section 3146(c) provides an affirmative defense in a failure to appear prosecution; however, as counsel notes, Jenkins was not charged with a failure to appear. Instead, the district court correctly found that an offense-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility became inappropriate when Jenkins failed to appear pursuant to the court\u2019s order. Accordingly, this contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In his pro se brief, Jenkins contends his sentence was unreasonable. At sentencing, the district court considered the properly calculated advisory sentencing guideline range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). The sentence imposed is within the guideline range and well below the statutory maximum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000). We find there is no sentencing error and conclude Jenkins\u2019 sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Finally, Jenkins contends in his pro se brief that the district court accepted his guilty plea without an adequate factual basis. Because Jenkins did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no such error in the proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Jenkins\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dismiss the portion of the appeal contesting the district court\u2019s decision not to depart. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">. The plea agreement provided Jenkins' sentencing range would be 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment provided the district court deemed he accepted responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. Additionally, if Jenkins complied with the agreement's terms, he could request the Government to move for a downward departure for substantial assistance pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. At his guilty plea hearing, the district court granted Jenkins\u2019 request for a temporary delay in the revocation of his pre-trial bond, so that Jenkins could resolve a personal matter prior to entering the Government\u2019s custody. Jenkins did not appear on the date ordered and was arrested over a month later. At sentencing, Jenkins was not credited with acceptance of responsibility, and the Government did not move for a downward departure. Jenkins asserts the Government\u2019s alleged breach was occasioned by its failure to place him and his family in the witness protection program; he claims he was threatened by a co-defendant while attending to personal business after the guilty plea hearing, which caused him to flee. The Attorney General may provide for the relocation and protection of a witness or potential witness as well as that witness\u2019 family, if the Attorney General determines a crime of violence directed at the witness is likely to be committed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3521(a)(1) (2000). In affidavits submitted prior to sentencing, Jenkins claimed he conveyed the threats to the authorities, who were unresponsive. The district court found Jenkins\u2019 claims were not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">. We also reject Jenkins\u2019 contention that the district court erred under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and 32 because Jenkins allegedly was not aware of what sentence he would receive. At the guilty plea hearing, Jenkins indicated he understood his sentence could not be determined until the completion of the presentence report and the sentence could differ from any estimate provided by his counsel or the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
