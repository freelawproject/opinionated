On April 10, 2007, the court directed the government to file a response to the appellant\u2019s combined motion for reconsideration, petition for rehearing by panel, and petition for rehearing en banc. We further directed the government to respond only to appellant\u2019s argument that because the sentencing guidelines range was based in part on victim loss (an upward adjustment of four levels), the panel\u2019s conclusion requires that appellant\u2019s sentence be vacated as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-21\">After reviewing the appellant\u2019s combined motion for reconsideration, petition for rehearing by panel, petition for rehearing en banc, the government\u2019s response thereto, and for good cause shown, we GRANT appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing and amend our opinion filed on February 7, 2007, to the extent that we vacate the appellant\u2019s sentence, remand this case for the district court to determine the amount of loss and victim impact, and then resentence the appellant. In all other respects, our opinion filed on February 7, 2007, shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-22\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
