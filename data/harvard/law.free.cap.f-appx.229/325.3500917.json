Hernandez-Azua argues that his sentence \u201cis contrary to <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] and unreasonable as a matter of law.\u201d He contends that this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>decisions have effectively reinstated the mandatory guideline scheme condemned by <em>Booker </em>and further argues that, post-<em>Booker, </em>a district court in imposing sentence should be allowed to disagree with policy decisions of the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-25\"><em>Post-jBooker, </em>appellate courts are to review sentences for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261-63, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIf the sentencing judge exercises her discretion to impose a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tence within a properly calculated Guideline range, in our reasonableness review we will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. \u201cGiven the deference due the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion under <em>[Booker </em>], it will be rare for a reviewing court to say such a sentence is \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Hernandez-Azua identifies no error in the guidelines calculations, and he was sentenced at the low end of the applicable guidelines range. We conclude that Hernandez-Azua\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Hernandez-Azua\u2019s constitutional and non-constitutional challenges to \u00a7 1326(b) are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez-Azua contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez-Azua properly concedes that his arguments are foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises them here to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
