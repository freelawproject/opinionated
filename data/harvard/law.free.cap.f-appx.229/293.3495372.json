California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Sullivan has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Sullivan\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-26\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Sullivan\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal, except that the district court\u2019s written judgment fails to reflect the dismissal of Count Five and Count Six of the indictment against Sullivan. These counts were dismissed by the district court on the Government\u2019s motion. A simple remand to correct such an omission or oversight is proper. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 372 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-27\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw, AFFIRM Sullivan\u2019s conviction and sentences, and REMAND to the district court with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>instruction to correct the judgment to reflect dismissal of Count Five and Count Six against Sullivan.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
