The district court denied Steele\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Steele is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In district court, Steele contended that the defendants had violated his First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to provide proper and effective medical treatment consistent with his religious beliefs. Steele\u2019s medical records, together with his own allegations, show that Steele received medical treatment for his skin condition. Steele\u2019s disagreement with the course of that medical treatment does not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Steele has not addressed the district court\u2019s determination that defendants Morris, Shabaaz, Smith, and Valenzuela could not be held liable as supervisory officials. Therefore, these claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Steele has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Steele\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The dismissal of Steele\u2019s appeal as frivolous by this court counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Steele previously accumulated two \u00a7 1915(g) strikes. <em>See Steele v. Glenn, </em>No. 04-51277 (5th Cir. May 26, 2006) (unpublished) (dismissing appeal as fiivolous after district court dismissed complaint for failure to state a claim). Accordingly, Steele is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal brought while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
