We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s physical presence determination for substantial evidence, <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004), and review due process challenges de novo, <em>Munoz v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir.2003). We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-18\">The BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners did not demonstrate continuous physical presence was not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners testified that they resided in the United States continuously for over ten years prior to service of their Notices to Appear, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d), and explained their residences and occupations between 1991 and 1993 coherently and consistently. In the absence of an adverse credibility finding, we treat petitioners as having testified credibly and conclude that substantial evidence supports their claim of ten years continuous physical presence. <em>See Lopez-Alvarado, </em>381 F.3d at 851 (\u201cAbsent an explicit adverse credibility finding, a witness\u2019s testimony must be accepted as true.\u201d); <em>Vero-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>Villegas v.

Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA to remand to the IJ to consider whether petitioners have good moral character and have qualifying relatives who would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if petitioners were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
