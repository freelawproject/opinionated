After we affirmed, Dillon embarked on a lengthy series of unsuccessful post-conviction attacks on his sentence, including a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582, a \u00a7 2255 motion, applications to file another \u00a7 2255 motion, a motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), an \u201cIndependent Action Under Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d and another \u00a7 2255 motion. We denied his various related requests for certificates of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">In December 2006 Dillon filed, in the same criminal action, a document titled \u201cMotion filed under LR 37.1, and LR 37.2 pursuant to Rule 37(c)(1) of Fed.R.Civ.P.\u201d Although Dillon insists that his motion \u201cdoes not affect the AEDPA and does not constitute a second or successive petition and cannot be construed as such,\u201d his motion seeks the production of certain documents which form the basis for his allegations concerning \u201cperjurious statements to the court dealing with a material element of impeachment value.\u201d In particular, he alleges that the government\u2019s failure to disclose voucher payments violates the Jenks Act, that the voucher forms \u201care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>proof that [witness] Williams perjured himself,\u201d and that he should get a new trial as a result. The District Court summarily denied the motion; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">By seeking a new trial, Dillon is challenging his conviction. However, as we have previously explained, motions pursuant to \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can do so. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117 (3d Cir.2002). Because Dillon has previously filed \u00a7 2255 motions, he may not file another without first obtaining permission from this Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244 &amp; 2255. Nor may he avoid this process by resorting to Federal Rules of Procedure. The District Court had no choice but to deny Dillon\u2019s motion and, as a result, the appeal does not present a substantial issue. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court denying Dillon\u2019s motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
