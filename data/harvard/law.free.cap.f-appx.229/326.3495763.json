Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir.2006). The Act also precludes judicial review of any removal order against an alien who is removable based on commission of an aggravated felony. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>see Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 40, 166 L.Ed.2d 18 (2006). However, none of these provisions \u201cshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review....\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">This court also retains jurisdiction to determine whether the underlying facts deprive this court of jurisdiction. <em>See Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2001). Asrar acknowledges that he was convicted of unlawful possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) and 924(a)(2), but denies that this constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes of the INA. Thus, the jurisdictional facts that must be reviewed in this case are whether Asrar is an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an offense covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">This court conducts a de novo review to determine whether the particular statute that the prior conviction is under falls within the relevant INA definition. <em>Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir.2005). This \u201ccategorical approach\u201d requires that this court look to the statute under which the petitioner was convicted, rather than the facts underlying the conviction, and compare the statutory elements to the definition of an aggravated felony in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 463 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Asrar was convicted for unlawful possession of ammunition in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A). Section 1101(a)(43), includes in its definition of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d an offense described in \u00a7 922(g)(5). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii). Because the statute of conviction falls within the relevant INA definition, and because Asi'ar\u2019s petition fails to raise either a constitutional claim or a question of law, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Asrar\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief and withholding of removal under the INA and CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
