For the reasons below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Fonseca was convicted in 1992 of conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine in a federal court in Virginia. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal. The trial court denied on the merits Fonseca\u2019s motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In January 2001, Fonseca filed an application with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion attacking his conviction and sentence under the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Court of Appeals denied permission to file the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Subsequently, Fonseca filed two \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, his district of confinement. The District Court dismissed both petitions, agreeing with the Magistrate Judge that Fonseca could not show that his remedy by \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d such that he could bring his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition. On appeal, we granted the government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance, finding that Fonseca\u2019s petitions were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">In November 2005, Fonseca filed another \u00a7 2241 petition, alleging that his \u201cindictment was constructively amended, allowing the jury to convict him of 13 (thirteen) uncharged offenses in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.\u201d The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the \u00a7 2241 petition, concluding that Fonseca had not complied with the AEDPA gatekeeping requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. By order entered January 4, 2006, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">On February 7, 2006, Fonseca then filed a mandamus petition in which he requested that we direct the District Court to \u201cdetermine the merits of [his] claims,\u201d grant the habeas writ, or vacate the order dismissing his habeas petition. We construed his mandamus petition as a notice of appeal and affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment, agreeing with the Magistrate Judge that Fonseca could not pursue collateral attack upon his conviction by way of a \u00a7 2241 petition unless he could show that \u201cthe remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ty of his detention,\u201d and that Fonseca\u2019s claim that his indictment was \u201cconstructively amended\u201d was not properly raised in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, as he could not show that his remedy by way of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d In a judgment entered May 31, 2006, we affirmed the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On October 18, 2006, Fonseca filed a document entitled \u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc., Rules 60(b)(3) and 60(b)(4).\u201d Although it is titled as arising under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and includes assertions that the District Court\u2019s judgment was based on \u201cfraud\u201d under Rule 60(b)(3) and was \u201cvoid\u201d under Rule 60(b)(4), the motion primarily reiterated Fonseca\u2019s arguments that \u00a7 2241 is an appropriate vehicle for his claims. As it raised no new arguments and its purpose was clearly to \u201crelitigate the original issue,\u201d Fonseca\u2019s motion is properly construed as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e). <em>See Smith v. Evans, </em>853 F.2d 155, 158-159 (3d Cir.1988); <em>Turner v. Evers, </em>726 F.2d 112, 114 (3d Cir.1984) (the function of the motion, rather than the caption, dictates which Rule applies). Since we have already previously held that Fonseca cannot use \u00a7 2241 to raise his claims, we clearly agree with the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Fonseca\u2019s motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Even if it were construed as arising under Rule 60(b), Fonseca\u2019s motion would have been properly denied, because it presents no viable basis for Rule 60(b) relief. Fonseca\u2019s motion contains no arguments which could not have been raised on appeal, making Rule 60(b) inappropriate. <em>See Martinez-McBean v. Government of Virgin Islands, </em>562 F.2d 908, 911 (3d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-12\">. Fonseca\u2019s notice of appeal references only the October 17, 2006 order. Following that order, Fonseca filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on October 25, 2006, before Fonseca filed his notice of appeal. Liberally construing his notice of appeal, we will assume that Fonseca wishes to appeal that order as well. As we find that the District Court properly denied Fonseca\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, we similarly affirm the denial of the motion for reconsideration of that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. The District Court also appropriately denied Fonseca's second motion for reconsideration, as such motions for \"re-reconsideration\u201d are improper. <em>See, e.g., Turner, </em>726 F.2d at 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-26\">. Fonseca\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
