We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">In their opening brief, Petitioners fail to address, and therefore have waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence they submitted with the motion to reopen was not new or previously unavailable. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the performance by former appellate counsel did not result in prejudice to Petitioners, and thus their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
