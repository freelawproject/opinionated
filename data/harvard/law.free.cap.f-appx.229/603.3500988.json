We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>See Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Petitioners\u2019 motion before the IJ was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) (a motion to reconsider must be filed no later than 30 days after the final administrative decision; a motion to reopen proceedings must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-26\">We lack jurisdiction to review Petitioners\u2019 contention that the administrative record is inadequate because they failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted). We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>authority to reopen. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-27\">With regard to Petitioners\u2019 other Due Process contentions, they failed to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>strate their testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
