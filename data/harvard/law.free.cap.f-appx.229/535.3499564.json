To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The IJ made an adverse credibility finding against Lin, which we review for substantial evidence. <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss the petition for review in part, grant it in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-17\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Lin\u2019s due process contention, as he did not raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that exhaustion is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-18\">Substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s conclusion that Lin\u2019s inconsistent representations about whether he was arrested justify an adverse credibility determination. We have held that \u201c[a]n adverse credibility finding is improper when an IJ fails to address a petitioner\u2019s explanation for a discrepancy or inconsistency.\u201d <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 887 (9th Cir.2004). In this case, Lin provided an explanation for his answers on the asylum application, but his explanation was not addressed by the IJ. We note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>also that the BIA may have overlooked Lin\u2019s answers to the first question on his asylum application in concluding that he indicated \u201cthat neither he nor his family members were ever ... mistreated in China.\u201d We therefore remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We do not have the authority to order that Lin be released from detention. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b564-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
