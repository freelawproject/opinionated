We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">We conclude that we have jurisdiction over this petition for review because petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen presented new evidence directed at a different basis for relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The Board provided a sufficiently reasoned basis for its decision and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence petitioners submitted concerning their U.S. citizen\u2019s son\u2019s superior intelligence was insufficient to support reopening because it did not demonstrate that their son has compelling special needs in school. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a) and (c); <em>Franco-Rosendo v.
