R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In this third appeal arising from appellant\u2019s convictions for various drug trafficking crimes, we must determine whether the district court erred during the limited <em>\u201cAmeline </em>remand\u201d ordered by this court in <em>United States v. Johns, </em>154 Fed.Appx. 646 (9th Cir.2005). Because we conclude that (1) the district judge was not required to recuse himself, and (2) Johns\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Given the district judge\u2019s well-supported explanation that his recusal in <em>Johns v. D Antonio </em>\u201chad nothing to do with Mr. Johns, but ... had to do with ... whether it would be wise ... to preside over a case involving Mr. D\u2019Antonio,\u201d it is self-evident that no \u201creasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably [have been] questioned.\u201d <em>Clemens v. United States Dist. Court for the Cent. Dist. of Ca., </em>428 F.3d 1175, 1178 (9th Cir.2005). Indeed, a judge has a \u201cduty ... to sit when there is no legitimate reason to recuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Our review of a district court\u2019s <em>\u201cAmeline </em>remand\u201d decision not to re-sentence is confined to determining whether the judge \u201cproperly understood the full scope of his discretion in a <em>post-Booker </em>world.\u201d <em>United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir.2006). The district judge\u2019s written explanation shows that he fully considered the relevant factors and comprehended his <em>post-Booker </em>freedom to impose a non-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b554-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
