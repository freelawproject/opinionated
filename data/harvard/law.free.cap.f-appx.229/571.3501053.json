We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 contention that they were deprived of a full and fair hearing, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [they were] prevented from reasonably presenting [their] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">We do not consider the petitioners\u2019 contentions regarding physical presence and moral character because the petitioners\u2019 failure to establish hardship is dispositive. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 889 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that an applicant must establish continuous physical presence, good moral character and hardship to a qualifying relative to be eligible for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the petitioners\u2019 contention regarding voluntary departure because they failed to raise that issue before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-26\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
