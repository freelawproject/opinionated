Rubio argues that his sentence must be vacated because the evidence does not support the district court\u2019s finding that Rubio possessed the firearm at issue during the commission of an aggravated robbery. Rubio also argues that the district court erred in concluding that a prior California conviction was a crime of violence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; however, he acknowledges that this issue will be irrelevant to his sentence and need not be resolved if the record supports the aggravated robbery finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Our review of the record shows that the evidence supports the district court\u2019s determination that Rubio used the weapon involved in his offense to commit an aggravated robbery. <em>United States v. Harper, </em>448 F.3d 732, 735 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1240 (5th Cir.1994). We find no error in the district court\u2019s computation of Rubio\u2019s advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). As these findings show that there is no error in Rubio\u2019s sentence, we find it unnecessary to address the issue whether his prior offense was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"AiA\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
