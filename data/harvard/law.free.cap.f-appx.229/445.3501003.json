Ashcroft, 358 </em>F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to review the remaining claims. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Ayala-Euceda contends he fears persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. We disagree that young adult males who resisted recruitment by an El Salvadoran gang constitute a particular social group, and thus conclude that the BIA properly found that Ayala-Euceda failed to show a nexus to a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1170-71 (holding that a social group defined as \u201cbusiness owners who resist pressure from narco-traffickers to participate in illegal activity\u201d was \u201ctoo broad\u201d). Ayala-Euceda also failed to show that the threats against him were made by forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Accordingly, Ayala-Euceda has failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Ochoa, </em>406 F.3d at 1171-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
