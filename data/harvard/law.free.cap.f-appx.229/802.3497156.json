MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b830-20\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Jerald Shouse seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) from this court so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>(providing that no appeal may be taken from a final order disposing of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because Shouse has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">An Oklahoma jury convicted Shouse of trafficking in illegal drugs. Shouse appealed his conviction, raising the following arguments: (1) his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the warrantless search of his residence; (2) the trial court committed numerous errors including improperly admitting evidence, improperly instructing the jury, failing to permit surrebuttal testimony, and failing to record bench conferences; (3) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction; (4) the wording of the Information did not give him fair notice of the charge against him; (5) prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial; and (6) cumulative error deprived him of a fair trial. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) considered Shouse\u2019s arguments but affirmed his conviction. Shouse then filed a state application for post-conviction relief, arguing ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Shouse\u2019s post-conviction application was denied and the OCCA affirmed the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Shouse filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition on September 19, 2006. In his petition, Shouse raised all the issues he presented in his direct appeal and in his state post-conviction application. The district court addressed each of Shouse\u2019s claims in turn, applying the standard set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and concluding the state court\u2019s adjudication of the claims was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law or based on an unreasonable factual determination. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">This court cannot grant Shouse a COA unless he can demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Shouse has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Shouse is not required to demonstrate that his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA. He must, however, \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">This court has reviewed Shouse\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>MillerEl </em>and concludes that Shouse is not entitled to a COA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s resolution of Shouse\u2019s claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Shouse has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">This court denies Shouse\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\">. In the reply brief Shouse filed with the district court, he argued the OCCA\u2019s application of a new standard of review to his sufficiency of the evidence claim was an ex post facto violation. <em>But see Warner v. Oklahoma, </em>144 P.3d 838, 862-63 (Okla.Crim.App.2006) (concluding application of new standard of review did not violate the Due Process Clause or ex post facto principles). We do not consider Shouse\u2019s arguments relating to this claim because it was not asserted in the state post-conviction proceedings but was raised for the first time in the reply brief. Thus, Respondent had no opportunity to either address it on the merits or argue it is subject to application of an anticipatory procedural bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
