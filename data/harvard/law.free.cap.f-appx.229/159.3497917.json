We will dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-27\">As we write only for the parties, we do not set out the facts in great detail. Muljono, an ethnically Chinese Christian, is a citizen and native of Indonesia. On or about July 11, 2000, Muljono entered the United States pursuant to a non-immigrant visa, which permitted him to remain in this country until December 11, 2000. Muljono overstayed his visa, and the Government initiated removal proceedings on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>March 10, 2003. Thereafter, Muljono sought asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds that he feared persecution on the basis of his ethnicity and religion. Following a hearing on Muljono\u2019s application for relief, the IJ declined to grant Muljono relief, and the BIA affirmed this denial without opinion. Muljono thereafter filed the present petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final orders of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Where, as here, the BIA affirms without opinion, \u201cwe review the IJ\u2019s opinion and scrutinize its reasoning.\u201d <em>Smriko v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 279, 282 (3d Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). We must defer to the IJ\u2019s factual findings\u2014 including his determinations as to past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution\u2014as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483-84 (3d Cir.2001). \u201cIf a reasonable fact finder could make a particular finding on the administrative record, then the finding is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 249 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As the Government correctly points out, Muljono did not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and CAT relief to the BIA. Muljono also failed to raise either issue in his opening brief, and moreover explicitly waived his asylum claim. <em>See </em>Muljono Br. at 4, n. 1. Accordingly, we will dismiss this aspect of his petition. <em>See Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that judicial review of final orders of removal is available \u201conly if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The sole issue that Muljono has preserved is his challenge to the IJ\u2019s finding that he was not entitled to withholding of removal pursuant to the INA. The INA mandates the withholding of a removal that would threaten an alien\u2019s life or freedom on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To obtain mandatory withholding of removal under the INA, Muljono must \u201cestablish by a \u2018clear probability\u2019 that his/her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of deportation.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 469 (3d Cir.2003). \u201c \u2018Clear probability\u2019 means that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that an alien would be subject to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, to qualify for relief under the INA, a petitioner must show that the persecution would be \u201ccommitted by the government or forces the government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Vente v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Muljono concedes that he has not suffered any past treatment that would rise to the level of persecution, <em>see </em>Muljono Br. at 5, but claims that he nonetheless fears future persecution if deported to Indonesia. Muljono cites no evidence, however, to support this claim save that which he concedes is insufficient to show past persecution. Moreover, Muljono does not contest the IJ\u2019s conclusion that although \u201cattacks on Chinese Christians in Indonesia have not been totally eliminated by the government,\u201d the Indonesian government continues to take steps to reduce violence against Chinese Christians. 22A-23A. Given the concededly insufficient evidence Muljono has offered to demonstrate the likelihood of future persecution, and given the Indonesian government\u2019s ongoing efforts to eliminate persecution of Chinese Christians, we are constrained to deny this aspect of Muljono\u2019s petition in light of the deferential standard of review we apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the petition for review in part, and deny it in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
