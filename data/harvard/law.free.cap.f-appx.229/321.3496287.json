The earlier order affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Ortiz was not eligible for cancellation of removal, and it granted Ortiz a 60-day voluntary departure period, which expired during the pendency of the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Ortiz argues that the voluntary departure period was automatically tolled upon the filing of his motion to reconsider. He requests that his case be remanded to the BIA, that the voluntary departure period be reinstated, and that he be allowed to depart under an order of voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Ortiz\u2019s argument that his motion for reconsideration automatically tolled his voluntary-departure period is without merit. <em>See Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387, 389-91 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1874, 167 L.Ed.2d 363 (2007). Ortiz acknowledges the decision in <em>Banda-Ortiz, </em>but he argues that it was incorrect as matter of law, seeking to preserve the issue for further review. However, a panel of this court may not overrule precedent set by another panel, absent an intervening en banc decision of this court or a Supreme Court decision. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">Ortiz\u2019s brief contains no argument directed to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s prior decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Ortiz was ineligible for cancellation of removal. That issue is therefore waived. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-15\">Accordingly, Ortiz\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. The respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, or alternatively, to extend the time to file a.brief, is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
