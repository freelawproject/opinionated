Boyd was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiracy to possess ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000); and one count of being a felon in possession of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000), and was sentenced to a total of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Boyd raises two issues. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">First, Boyd argues that the district court erroneously denied his innocent and transitory possession jury instruction. We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Boyd\u2019s request as we have previously rejected this instruction in \u00a7 922(g) cases. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>430 F.3d 215, 218-20 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">Second, Boyd asserts that his sentence is unreasonable. This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. However, in imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-25\">Here, the district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Boyd only after considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Although the district court did not recite facts to support each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. We thus conclude that Boyd\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">We therefore affirm Boyd\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
