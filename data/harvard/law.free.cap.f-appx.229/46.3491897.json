Vitaliano, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b75-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">Defendant-appellant Juan Francisco Urena Cruz appeals a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Jed S. Rakoff, Judge), entered on May 31, 2005, sentencing him principally to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment upon his plea of guilty to one count of illegally reentering the United States after the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2), and one count of bail jumping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the balance of facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-19\">Cruz asserts only that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. We disagree. The District Court analyzed the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including those favoring Cruz, and concluded that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines range was appropriate in light of Cruz\u2019s recidivism. Cruz indeed has a substantial criminal history, including two felony narcotics offenses, an illegal reentry offense, an identity theft offense, and a bail jumping offense. Further, Cruz\u2019s bail jumping enabled him to escape prosecution for an additional charge of passport fraud. After jumping bail on that charge, Cruz remained a fugitive for four years, during which time the government failed to preserve the evidence against him and could no longer pursue its case. Given Cruz\u2019s repeated transgressions, the District Court acted within its allowable discretion in determining that a bottom-end Guidelines sentence was necessary to promote general and specific deterrence and respect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006) (recognizing that \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>(noting that in conducting our reasonableness review, we ask only whether the district court exceeded its discretion).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The fact that Cruz may have committed some of his crimes in order to remain with his girlfriend and children and secure employment does not render the sentence unreasonable. The District Court fully considered Cruz\u2019s proffered motivations and concluded that the need for deterrence outweighed them. Given Cruz\u2019s criminal history, the District Court\u2019s conclusion was within reason. <em>See id. </em>at 32 (\u201cThe weight to be afforded any given argument made pursuant to one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge and is beyond our review, as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d). Ultimately, Cruz asks us to substitute our own judgment for that of the District Court, which we cannot do. <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Finally, we note that the District Court expressly considered the command of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s parsimony clause, taking care not to \u201cimpose one day more than necessary.\u201d In light of the District Court\u2019s express consideration of the parsimony clause and our conclusion that the sentence is substantively reasonable, there is no cause for remand. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 476-77 (2d Cir.2007) (affirming sentence where there was \u201cno indication that the District Court actually failed to consider the requirements of the parsimony clause,\u201d and noting that in any event, the standard of appellate review is reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">For those reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-5\">. To the extent that Cruz implicitly challenges the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant <em>him </em>a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category over-represents his criminal past, we cannot review that refusal where, as here, the court understood its authority to depart and the sentence is otherwise legal. <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>465 F.3d 113, 114 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
