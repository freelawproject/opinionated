To the extent we have jurisdiction it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Soltero Salcedo\u2019s motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence he submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">To the extent Soltero Salcedo contends that the BIA failed to consider some or all of the evidence he submitted with the motion to reopen, he has not overcome the presumption that the BIA did review the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review Soltero Salcedo\u2019s contention that the BIA should have reinstated his voluntary departure period because he failed to raise that issue before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
