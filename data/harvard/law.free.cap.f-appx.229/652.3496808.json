To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-21\">We review the agency\u2019s denial of an asylum application for substantial evidence. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Castro did not prove that she has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of the five protected grounds. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination that Castro failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v.
