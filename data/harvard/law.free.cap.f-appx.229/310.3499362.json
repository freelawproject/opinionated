He claims the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based upon its determination that his 2003 conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a) for indecency with a child was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">The \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). In <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601 (5th Cir. 2000), we held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) is \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d Although <em>Zavalar-Sustaita </em>involved an enhancement imposed under a previous version of \u00a7 2L1.2, its reasoning remains sound law and is applicable here. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 273-75 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d at 604, <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 905, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005)). Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Galindo\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-22\">Galindo challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2). That challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Galindo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Galindo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
