Quinones asks this court to issue an order directing the district court to order the Respondent to answer his petition. The district court\u2019s docket report reveals that after Quinones filed his writ of mandamus, the Respondent answered Quinones\u2019s petition. Because Quinones has received the relief he sought, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis but deny Quinones\u2019s mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
