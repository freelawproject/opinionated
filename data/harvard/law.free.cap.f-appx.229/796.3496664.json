McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">This pro se 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 federal prisoner appeal is the fourth in a series of pleadings brought by Petitioner to challenge his conviction and sentence. After a careful review of Petitioner\u2019s brief, the record on appeal, and the district court\u2019s disposition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Although Petitioner\u2019s pleading purported to seek relief under \u00a7 2241, the district court correctly noted that, \u201c[djespite his protests to the contrary, Mr. Lehi is challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence.\u201d (Order and Judgment of Dismissal at 2.) \u201cThe exclusive remedy for testing the validity of a judgment and sentence, unless it is inadequate or ineffective, is that provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Taylor, </em>347 F.2d 365, 366 (10th Cir.1965).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u00a7 2255 remedy will be inadequate or ineffective only in \u201cextremely limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir.1999). The fact that Petitioner has been denied relief under \u00a7 2255 and may be barred from filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition does not demonstrate that the remedy provided in \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id.-, see also Williams v. United States, </em>323 F.2d 672, 673 (10th Cir.1963). Because Petitioner challenges the validity of his judgment and sentence and has not demonstrated that he lacks an adequate and effective remedy under \u00a7 2255, his \u00a7 2241 petition is inappropriate. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action. Petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-21\">. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Boyce v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 911, 917-18, <em>vacated as moot, </em>268 F.3d 953 (10th Cir.2001), is misplaced. <em>Boyce </em>dealt only with the distinction between habeas petitions and <em>Bivens </em>actions, <em>see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and did not purport to alter the well-established distinction between \u00a7 2241 and \u00a7 2255 habeas petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\"><em> </em>This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">After examining Petitioner\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
