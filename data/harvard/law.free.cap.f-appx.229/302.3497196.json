He argues for the first time on appeal that \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He also argues for the first time that his prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>misdemeanor assault convictions were not crimes of violence for purposes of enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Landeros\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Landeros contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Landeros properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Landeros\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (2005). The four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(E) is appropriate where the defendant has three or more misdemeanor convictions for crimes of violence. The district court relied on Landeros\u2019s misdemeanor convictions for assault under Texas law to justify the enhancement. Subsequent to sentencing, this court held that the crime of misdemeanor assault under Texas law, even when committed by causing bodily injury, is not a crime of violence under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 882 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 326 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, as the Government concedes, the district court plainly erred by applying the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Vega, </em>471 F.3d 559, 561 (5th Cir.2006). Contrary to the Government\u2019s view, this error affected Landeros\u2019s substantial rights and affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 275; <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 716-17 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Landeros\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
