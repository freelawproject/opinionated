Garcia argues that the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional, but this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Garcia argues that the district court erred by characterizing his prior state felony convictions for possession of a controlled substance as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), thereby enhancing his sentence by eight-levels. Garcia has filed an unopposed motion to remand his case for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). The motion is GRANTED. See <em>United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 261 (5th Cir.2007). Garcia\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED, the sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
