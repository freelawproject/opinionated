To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-23\">The evidence petitioners presented with their motion concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to establish that this evidence would likely alter the prior discretionary determination that they failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600 (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>whether [the] new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard.\u201d) (Internal quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Further, petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated their due process rights by disregarding new evidence of hardship is not supported by the record because the BIA stated that it did review petitioners\u2019 contentions. This does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b490-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
