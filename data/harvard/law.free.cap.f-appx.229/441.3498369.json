We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Thind showed a general lack of knowledge regarding the political party of which he is allegedly a member and which forms the basis of his claimed persecution. <em>See Singh, v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.2004). In addition, Thind did not know the basic tenets of the Sikh religion. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723-24 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Because Thind failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Thind waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that he is ineligible for relief under CAT because he failed to raise any argument in his opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b470-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
