Dehghani alleged violations of his constitutional rights arising out of his placement in solitary confinement and the institution of disciplinary proceedings against him. We review a dismissal of a prisoner complaint as frivolous for abuse of discretion, <em>see Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999), and for failure to state a claim de novo. <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-23\">With respect to placement in solitary confinement, it is settled law that disciplinary segregation does not present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the type of \u201catypical, significant deprivation -in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Dehghani\u2019s eight days in solitary confinement do not give rise to a constitutional claim. <em>See id. </em>Dehghani\u2019s contention that there was no probable cause for bringing a disciplinary proceeding effectively alleges a claim of malicious prosecution. <em>See Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 945 (5th Cir.2003)(en banc). As the district court properly held, a freestanding assertion of malicious prosecution does not give rise to a constitutional claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Finally, Dehghani has failed to show any error in the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for appointment of counsel. The motion was ordered unfiled for noncompliance with a general order, and Dehghani took no steps to bring the motion into compliance. In addition, Dehghani has not established any circumstances warranting appointment of counsel. <em>See Castro Romero v. Becken, </em>256 F.3d 349, 354 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">As this appeal lacks any arguable merit, we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). The dismissal by the district court of Dehghani\u2019s suit and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88. In addition, Dehghani has accumulated two strikes in <em>Dehghani v. Vogelgesang, </em>Case No. 06-10547, decided on this same date. As Dehghani has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
