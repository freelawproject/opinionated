We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-19\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that their current attorney\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal entitles them to a \u201cper se\u201d finding of prejudice is incorrect. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (counsel\u2019s failure to perfect appeal deprives petitioner of the appellate process and creates a rebuttable presumption of prejudice). We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the presumption of prejudice was rebutted because petitioners did not identify any errors in the IJ\u2019s decision, or allege that the outcome of their case might have been different had counsel filed a timely notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>(presumption of prejudice is rebutted if a petitioner cannot demonstrate plausible grounds for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
