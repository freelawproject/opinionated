We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-20\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Huang\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than four years after the <em>in absentia </em>removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (requiring motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances to be filed within 180 days of order of removal <em>in absentia). </em>Huang\u2019s assertion that he did not know he could file a motion to reopen until he consulted with an attorney does not excuse his untimely filing because he has not alleged a basis for equitable tolling, nor has he shown that he acted with due diligence. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-21\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Huang\u2019s motion to reconsider as untimely. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B) (motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the final administrative order). To the extent the motion sought the IJ\u2019s consideration of new evidence, it was a time and number barred second motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(A) and (c)(7)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
