We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and remand on the issue of voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the performance by prior counsel did not result in prejudice to Mendoza-Sanchez, and thus his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d As in <em>Padilla-Padilla, </em>we are not sure if petitioner can still have the benefit of the voluntary departure order. <em>See id. </em>at 982. We therefore remand to allow the BIA to determine that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
