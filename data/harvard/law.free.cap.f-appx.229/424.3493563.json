We grant the petition, vacate the BIA\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-21\">The petitioners are natives and citizens of Peru. On April 9,' 1998, they entered the United States as non-immigrant visitors for pleasure with authorization to remain in the United States until October 7, 1998. Luear Flores and his daughter never departed from the United States, but his wife returned to Peru in October 1998. She then reentered the United States on December 4, 1998, and, although she was required to leave by June 4, 1999, she remained in the United States thereafter. The petitioners acknowledged that they were removable, and they petitioned for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the CAT, and, alternatively, voluntary departure. The petitioners alleged that they suffered past persecution in Peru because of their political opinions and they fear future persecution and torture if they return.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-22\">While in Peru, Lucar Flores owned and maintained a business that sold and delivered kerosene to other businesses in Peru. According to Lucar Flores, Sendero Luminoso (\u201cSL\u201d), a terrorist group seeking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>overthrow the Peruvian government, threatened and attacked him and his family on several occasions because of his refusal to collaborate with the SL and his support for the Peruvian government, as demonstrated by his assistance with the rebuilding of government buildings and his monetary donations to hospitals, health centers and orphan centers. Lucar Flores testified that the SL beat him when he refused to support its agenda. The SL then attacked him and took his car to distribute flyers in connection with its agenda. Lucar Flores did not report this incident to the police because the SL threatened to kill him if he did so. Lucar Flores also testified that the SL killed one of his brothers because his brother refused to support the SL\u2019s mission, assaulted another brother and shot a third brother. In another incident, the SL broke into Lucar Flores\u2019s home and stole money and electronic appliances. Lucar Flores reported this incident to the police, but he did not specify who robbed his house for fear that the SL would harm him and his family. The SL also stole his truck and kerosene before returning the truck without the kerosene. Finally, the SL threatened his mother. These actions forced the petitioners to leave Peru, and they believe that the SL will torture and kill them if they return. They also claim that police would be unable to protect them from attacks by the SL.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The IJ heard evidence that the leader of the SL had been captured in 1992, the SL was in substantial decline after its leader\u2019s capture, and the SL conducted most of its activity in the Peruvian jungle near Ecuador, far from the petitioners home in Lima. The IJ ultimately held that Lucar Flores was not credible because most of his claims of persecution occurred after file leader of the SL was captured and the SL was in \u201csubstantial decline\u201d; that the petitioners had not established that they suffered past persecution; and that they had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution or likelihood of torture if returned to Peru. The IJ then denied the petitioners\u2019 application and granted the privilege of voluntary departure. The BIA issued a three-page opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s holding, without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s reasoning, without adding its own reasoning- and without addressing Lucar Flores\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination of an alien\u2019s eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation for substantial evidence. <em>Krasnopivtsev v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 832, 837 (8th Cir.2004). \u201c[W]e may not overturn the BIA\u2019s determination unless the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear or persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). \u201cOnly the BIA order is subject to our review, including the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning to the extent they were expressly adopted by the BIA.\u201d <em>Fofanah v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1037, 1040 (8th Cir.2006). If the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and adds its own reasoning, then we will review both decisions together. <em>Lengkong v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 859, 862 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">An alien is eligible for asylum when he is a refugee \u201cwho is unwilling or unable to return to his or her home country \u2018because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Celaj v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1094, 1097 (8th Cir.2006) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). The well-founded fear must be both \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>able.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if an alien can demonstrate he suffered past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he would suffer future persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The petitioners argue that the IJ and BIA incorrectly determined that they did not suffer past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of persecution \u201con account of\u2019 their political opinions. Without incorporating the IJ\u2019s reasoning or adding any of its own, the BIA merely agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe record fail[ed] to establish that the Sendero Luminoso was interested in anything more than [Lucar Flores\u2019s] business, client contacts, and his possession of a saleable commodity, which the Sendero Luminoso could steal to further their cause ... [and] the record is devoid of objective evidence providing a nexus between the Sendero Luminoso\u2019s interest in the [petitioners] and a protected ground.\u201d BIA Decision at 2. While the IJ based his finding that there was no past persecution or well-founded fear of persecution \u201con account of\u2019 the petitioners\u2019 political opinions primarily on his determination that Lucar Flores was not credible, the BIA reached its decision without any reference to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding regarding Lucar Flores\u2019s testimony. Without the BIA\u2019s express adoption of the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, as well as the fact that the BIA did not add any of its own reasoning supporting its decision, we are unable to review the IJ\u2019s credibility findings. <em>See Vonhm v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 825, 828 n. 2 (8th Cir.2006); <em>Lengkong, </em>478 F.3d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Since we cannot review the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, we review the BIA\u2019s decision that the record failed to establish that the SL sought to persecute the petitioners \u201con account of\u2019 their political opinions. The BIA\u2019s statement that the \u201crecord is devoid of objective evidence\u201d of the necessary connection to a protected ground suggests that it believed that the petitioners failed to provide evidence corroborating their claim of persecution. However, if the BIA denies a petition because of an absence of corroborative evidence, it must: \u201c(1) rule explicitly on the credibility of [the applicant\u2019s] testimony; (2) explain why it was reasonable in this case to expect additional corroboration; or (3) assess the sufficiency of [the applicant\u2019s] explanations for the absence of corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>El-Sheikh v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 643, 647 (8th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). As already mentioned, the BIA did not rule explicitly on the credibility of Lucar Flores\u2019s testimony that the SL persecuted him in part because of his political opinion. <em>See De Brenner v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 629, 636 (8th Cir.2004) (stating that an alien can be persecuted because of a protected ground even when the persecution is also motivated by other nonprotected grounds). Also, the BIA neither explained why corroborative evidence was necessary nor assessed whether Lucar Flores provided a sufficient explanation for the lack of corroborative evidence. Without any of the necessary explanation or reasoning, we are unable to review the BIA\u2019s actual reasoning. <em>See EV-Sheikh, </em>388 F.3d at 648 (\u201cLacking a BIA finding as to [petitioner\u2019s] credibility and an analysis of what material facts central to his claim of past persecution should have reasonably corroborated, we have no way of reviewing the Board\u2019s actual reasoning.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (stating that a court of appeals does not have the power to review de novo an agency\u2019s decision and instead must remand a case to the agency when \u201cadditional investigation or explanation\u201d is necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Therefore, we grant the petition for review, vacate the BIA\u2019s order and remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the BIA should explain clearly its reasoning for its findings and conclusions. Due to our decision on the asylum appeal, we also remand the denial of the withholding of removal and the relief under the CAT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-5\">. The BIA also denied the petitioners\u2019 due process argument concerning the trial proceedings, which the petitioners do not appeal to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
