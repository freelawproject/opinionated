Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>In making the finding of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, the district court may consider any information that has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy. <em>Id. </em>at 247; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). Furthermore, as a general rule, information in the presentence report is \u201cpresumed reliable and may be adopted by the district court without further inquiry if the defendant fails to demonstrate by competent rebuttal evidence that the information is materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 287 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Parker was individually accountable for at least 500 grams of methamphetamine. After applying a conservative estimate to Parker\u2019s post-arrest admissions, the district court found that Parker had acknowledged responsibility for 483 grams. The district court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the other reports about Parker provided by the PSR and Officer Frank Saldivar\u2019s testimony justified attributing at least 17 more grams to him. <em>Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246. Parker did not adduce any evidence to show that the district court clearly erred in determining drug quantity for sentencing purposes or to undermine the material truth of the information in the PSR. <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 878 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 164 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Parker also argues that the district court erred in failing to apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the sentencing evidence. As Parker was sentenced under an advisory guidelines scheme following the issuance of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he has not shown plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005) <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006); <em>United States v. Scheer, </em>168 Fed.Appx. 628, 629 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
