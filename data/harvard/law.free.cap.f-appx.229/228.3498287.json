The district court sentenced Council to concurrent forty-one-month terms of imprisonment on Counts 1 and 3 and a consecutive eighty-four-month term on Count 2. Council appeals his sentence on Counts 1 and 3, contending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him under a de facto mandatory guidelines scheme and that the court failed to consider adequately the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3558(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Because Council did not challenge in the district court his sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547-48, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing standard). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Here, the district court sentenced Council <em>post-Booker </em>and appropriately treated the properly calculated guidelines range as advisory. The district court then considered that range along with the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), taking into account the violence involved in the robbery and Council\u2019s arguments about his employment history, family circumstances, and prior marijuana abuse. The district court ultimately imposed a sentence at the low end of the advisory guideline range on Counts 1 and 3. Nothing in the record demonstrates that Council has rebutted the presumption of reasonableness. We therefore find that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Council\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
