DANIEL BREEN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Plaintiff-Appellant James D. Hood, II, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants-Appellees Ronald T. Keller, Richard H. Finan, and Kenneth Morckel. Hood contends that the Defendants violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion by arresting him pursuant to Ohio statutory authority on Ohio state grounds for publicly preaching his faith without a permit, for which he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. The district court held that Hood\u2019s claims were rendered moot by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks v. Finan, </em>385 F.3d 694 (6th Cir.2004). Hood contends the district court erred in this conclusion. We AFFIRM IN PART, REVERSE IN PART AND REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">James D. Hood, II is a Christian minister. As part of his faith, Hood preaches his \u201cbeliefs and convictions in public.\u201d Since approximately 1982, he has used the public areas on the Ohio Statehouse grounds in Columbus, Ohio to engage in \u201creligious expressive activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The Capitol Square in Columbus is a ten-acre area containing state buildings and surrounding grounds. The Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board (\u201cCSRAB\u201d) is appointed by state statute to manage the Ohio Statehouse grounds by promulgating rules and regulations. Based on this authority, CSRAB passed a rule requiring that anyone wanting to use the Statehouse grounds must first obtain a permit. The rule provides in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsP\">Capitol buildings or grounds are available for use by the public for the purpose of governmental business, public meetings for free discussion of public questions, or for activities of broad public purpose, provided the authorized procedure has been followed and appropriate approvals have been received....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzK\">Ohio Adm.Code \u00a7 128-4-02. A person seeking a permit must submit a written request \u201cno less than fifteen and no more than one hundred eighty days prior to the event.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code \u00a7 128-4-03(A), (B). Upon approval, CSRAB imposes a twenty dollar charge for the permit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">On May 18, 2000, Hood began to preach and hand out religious literature on the Statehouse grounds, but he did not have, nor had he sought to obtain, a permit. Lieutenant Spinner of the Ohio State Highway Patrol stopped Hood\u2019s activities and warned him under threat of arrest to cease and desist preaching and handing out literature without a permit. Hood did not comply with Lieutenant Spinner\u2019s directive, prompting the officer to charge him with criminal trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">Hood thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the criminal complaint, arguing, inter alia, that the CSRAB rules violated his constitutionally protected rights to due process, free speech, and free exercise of religion. The Franklin County, Ohio Municipal Court denied the motion, following which a jury found Hood guilty of criminal trespass. The court imposed a fine of $100. Hood appealed his conviction but later abandoned his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>B. Prior Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On May 16, 2001, Hood filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against officials from the CSRAB and a supervisory colonel in the Ohio State Highway Patrol alleging that the CSRAB permit requirements were unconstitutional restrictions on his rights to free speech and free exercise of religion. He further contended that the permit requirements were overbroad, vague, and discriminatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hood sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court dismissed Hood\u2019s Complaint after finding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, this court reversed the trial judge\u2019s ruling, concluding that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine was inapplicable because it did \u201cnot prohibit federal district courts from exercising jurisdiction where the plaintiffs claim [was] merely \u2018a general challenge to the constitutionality of the state law <em>applied in the state </em>action,\u2019 rather than a challenge to the law\u2019s application in a particular state case.\u201d <em>Hood v. Keller, </em>341 F.3d 593, 597 (6th Cir.2003) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Tropf v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>289 F.3d 929, 936 (6th Cir.2002)); <em>see also Edwards v. Il. Bd. of Admissions to Bar, </em>261 F.3d 723, 729 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201cWhen the litigant is challenging the constitutionality of a rule that was applied to him, but is not asking to correct or revise the determination that he violated the rule, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>is no obstacle to the maintenance of the suit.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). Because Hood was not seeking to have his conviction set aside, this court concluded that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Hood, </em>341 F.3d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">On remand, the district court entered an agreed order to stay the case pending the outcome of <em>Parks v. Finan, </em>a related case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> presenting a facial challenge to the CSRAB permit requirements. In <em>Parks, </em>this court held that the CSRAB requirements were unconstitutional with respect to individuals and let stand a district court injunction against CSRAB, which this court determined was \u201climited to relief against enforcement of the permitting scheme against individuals....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 385 F.3d at 698-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">Based upon <em>Parks, </em>Hood filed a motion for summary judgment on December 20, 2004, claiming he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law under the doctrine of stare decisis. The Appellees filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the same day, arguing that they were entitled to judgment because <em>Parks </em>rendered the Appellant\u2019s claims moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>On September 29, 2005, the district court granted the Appellees\u2019 motion, finding this court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks </em>rendered the Appellant\u2019s challenge to the CSRAB regulation moot. In its order, the district court analyzed Hood\u2019s claim for injunctive relief and stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">[w]here a party has voluntarily ceased conduct because of a court order, as Defendants have done here, the underlying case will not be rendered moot unless \u201csubsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201d <em>Am. Canoe Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of Louisa Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>389 F.3d 536, 543 (6th Cir.2004). This rule \u201cis meant to protect a party from an opponent who seeks to defeat judicial review by temporarily altering its behavior.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Hood v. Keller, </em>No. 01-CV-454, 2005 WL 2405995, at *3, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21704, at *10 (S.D.Ohio Sept. 29, 2005) (some internal citations omitted). The district court then found that the \u201cDefendants, through their written assurances and recent actions, have adequately assured this Court that the State\u2019s enforcement of the permit scheme cannot \u2018reasonably be expected to recur.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *4, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21704, at *12.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Concerning the Appellant\u2019s claim for declaratory relief, the district court also found that Hood was not entitled to such relief because the threat of continued enforcement of the statute in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks </em>was not of \u201c \u2018sufficient immediacy and reality\u2019 to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21704, at *16 (quoting <em>Super Tire Eng\u2019g Co. v. McCorkle, </em>416 U.S. 115, 122, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974)). In its order, however, the district court did not address Hood\u2019s claim for compensatory damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or his request for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">This court reviews de novo the decision of a district court to grant summary judgment. <em>See Int\u2019l Union v. Cummins, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 478, 483 (6th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper only where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Finally, this court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a case for mootness. <em>Ammex, Inc. v. Cox, </em>351 F.3d 697, 704 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">The Appellant contends the trial court erred in finding his case moot because \u201che is still in need of effectual relief, <em>ie. </em>declaratory judgment, injunction, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d He argues that the doctrine of stare decisis required the district court to apply the holding of <em>Parks </em>to the facts of his case and grant him judgment as a matter of law. Finally, Hood asserts that even if his claim for injunctive relief is moot, this court should consider separately his remaining claims for declaratory judgment, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">The Appellees respond that this court should affirm the judgment of the district court and conclude that no case or controversy remains between the parties. The state officials argue that the doctrine of stare decisis does not alter the test for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>mootness. They contend that the relief sought by Hood is the same as that awarded the plaintiff in <em>Parks, </em>thereby alleviating his need for individualized injunctive or declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">As the district court recognized, federal courts have \u201cno authority to render a decision upon moot questions or to declare rules of law that cannot affect the matter at issue.\u201d <em>NAACP v. City of Parma, </em>263 F.3d 513, 530 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992)). \u201cSimply stated, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u201clive\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>County of Los Angeles v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 1383, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979) (quoting <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1951, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969)); <em>see also Carras v. Williams, </em>807 F.2d 1286, 1289 (6th Cir.1986) (\u201cMootness results when events occur during the pendency of a litigation which render the court unable to grant the requested relief.\u201d). This court determines mootness \u201cby examining whether an actual controversy between the parties exists in light of intervening circumstances.\u201d <em>Fleet Aerospace Corp. v. Holderman, </em>848 F.2d 720, 723 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Appellant cites <em>Gregory Construction Co. v. Blanchard, </em>879 F.2d 864 (Table), 1989 WL 78201 (6th Cir.1989), in support of his argument that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks </em>must be applied to the facts of his case and that his case is not moot. In <em>Gregory Construction Co., </em>the plaintiff filed suit challenging the constitutionality of Michigan\u2019s Minority Owned and Woman Owned Business Act (\u201cAct\u201d). 1989 WL 78201 at *1. During the pendency of <em>Gregory Construction Co., </em>this court decided <em>Michigan Road Builders Ass\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>834 F.2d 583 (6th Cir. 1987). In <em>Michigan Road Builders, </em>this court struck down the Act as unconstitutional, and the Supreme Court affirmed. 834 F.2d at 595, <em>aff'd, </em>489 U.S. 1061, 109 S.Ct. 1333, 103 L.Ed.2d 804 (1989). Thereafter, the state of Michigan moved to dismiss the plaintiffs suit in <em>Gregory Construction Co. </em>contending, inter aha, that it was moot based upon the decision in <em>Michigan Road Builders. Gregory Constr. Co., </em>1989 WL 78201 at *2. Relevant to the instant case, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFc\">The district court here recognized our decision in <em>Michigan Road Builders </em>as an event transpiring during the pendency of this action that was determinative of the issues posed by Gregory. Nevertheless, the court determined that our decision did not render Gregory\u2019s action moot because, although it precluded readjudication of the constitutionality of the Act, it did not preclude the court from granting requested relief. Rather, the court indicated that principles of stare decisis and collateral estoppel compelled it to grant the requested declaratory and injunctive relief without readjudicating the constitutionality of the Act. We agree that, under principles of stare decisis, our decision in <em>Michigan Road Builders </em>established binding precedent for the district court in resolving the legal question posed by Gregory. We also agree that principles of collateral estoppel dictated the district court\u2019s ruling because the Act\u2019s constitutionality actually and necessarily had been determined in <em>Michigan Road Builders. </em>Our Michigan Road Builders decision was binding in Gregory\u2019s pending suit against the State given that the State was a party to the prior <em>Michigan Road Builders </em>litigation. <em>See Montana [v. United States], </em>440 U.S. [147] at 153 [99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979) ]. Finally, we agree that although our decision in <em>Michigan Road Builders </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>determinative of the constitutionality issue posed by Gregory, Gregory\u2019s case did not become moot because there remained a case or controversy between the parties and the court still was able to grant Gregory prospective injunctive and declaratory relief and attorney\u2019s fees. We are in accord with the district court\u2019s analysis and resolution of the mootness issue and find no error in the court\u2019s proceeding to judgment in this case or in its award of attorney\u2019s fees as part of Gregory\u2019s recoverable costs. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s ruling is AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><em>Id. </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Appellees argue that <em>Gregory Construction Co. </em>is distinguishable because it \u201cinvolved lost profits and contracts.\u201d Appellees contend that notwithstanding the constitutional question in <em>Gregory Construction Co., </em>a case or controversy existed between the parties because \u201cthe district court was still able to award Gregory prospective relief\u2014specifically lost profits and an order directing the State to award Gregory a particular contract.\u201d However, the Appellees\u2019 contention is not supported by the facts of <em>Gregory Construction Co. </em>First, as this court noted, although Gregory initially sought \u201can order directing the State to award Gregory the Camp Grayling contradi,] ... [b]y December 1986, the Camp Grayling project had been completed [by another construction company] and was paid for in full by the State.\u201d <em>Gregory Constr. Co., </em>1989 WL at *1. Second, this court noted that in \u201cAugust 1987, the district court ... dismissed Gregory\u2019s due process claim because of Gregory\u2019s lack of a legitimate claim of entitlement to the contract award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2. Third, with respect to the district court\u2019s ruling in <em>Gregory Construction Co., </em>this court noted that the district court\u2019s order declared that \u201cthe [Eleventh [A]mendment bars Gregory\u2019s constitutional and statutory claims with the exception of any declaratory and prospective injunctive relief sought against individual state officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Appellees are mistaken by their assertion of distinguishing factors in <em>Gregory Construction Co. </em>Indeed, <em>Gregory Construction Co. </em>is directly on point<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the only relief awarded by the district court and reviewed by this court was declaratory relief, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees based upon Gregory\u2019s facial challenge to the Act notwithstanding the intervening decision in <em>Michigan Road </em>Builders,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Notwithstanding the holding in <em>Gregory Construction Co., </em>we conclude this court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks </em>moots the Appellant\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Here, the state officials prohibited Hood from exercising his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. In response, the Appellant filed suit seeking (1) a declaratory judgment that the Appellees\u2019 actions violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, (2) an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>junction prohibiting the state officials from enforcing the CSRAB regulations against him in the future, (3) compensatory damages, and (4) costs and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). This court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks </em>alleviated the need for the district court to again declare the unconstitutionality of the CSRAB regulations, thereby rendering Hood\u2019s request for declaratory judgment moot. We further conclude that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Parks </em>enjoining the state from enforcing the CSRAB regulations against individual speakers provides Hood the injunctive relief he sought in his complaint. <em>See Parks, 885 F.3d </em>at <em>698-700. In so </em>holding, <em>we </em>are not persuaded by the conclusion in <em>Gregory Construction Co. </em>that the trial court herein should again consider Hood\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief; rather, we conclude Hood\u2019s claims for such relief \u201care no longer \u2018live\u2019 \u201d in light of the <em>Parks </em>decision. <em>See Davis, </em>440 U.S. at 631, 99 S.Ct. at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Although we find that Hood\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were disposed of by <em>Parks, </em>his claims for damages and attorney\u2019s fees were not. In <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water v. Craft, </em>the Crafts and other customers of Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water (\u201cMLGW\u201d), sued MLGW for overbilling them. 436 U.S. 1, 4-5, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1558, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978). The district court refused to certify the plaintiffs as a class and dismissed their claims, and this court affirmed that decision. <em>Craft v. Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div., </em>534 F.2d 684 (6th Cir.1976). Before turning to the merits of the case, the Supreme Court at the outset considered the question of mootness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">As the case comes to us, the only remaining plaintiffs are respondents Willie S. and Mary Craft. Since the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s refusal to certify a class, the existence of a continuing \u201ccase or controversy\u201d depends entirely on the claims of respondents. It appears that respondents no longer desire a hearing to resolve a continuing dispute over their bills, as the double-meter problem has been clarified during this litigation. Nor do respondents aver that there is a present threat of termination of service. \u201cAn injunction can issue only after the plaintiff has established that the conduct sought to be enjoined is illegal and that the defendant, if not enjoined, will engage in such conduct.\u201d <em>United Transportation Union v. Michigan Bar, </em>401 U.S. 576, 584, 91 S.Ct. 1076, 1081, 28 L.Ed.2d 339 (1971). Respondents insist, however, that the case is not moot because they seek damages and declaratory relief, and because the dispute that occasioned this suit is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">We need not decide whether this case falls within the special rule developed in <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911); <em>see Moore v. Ogilvie, </em>394 U.S. 814, 816, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 1494, 23 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969); <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 712, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), to permit consideration of questions which, by their very nature, are not likely to survive the course of a normal litigation. <em>Respondents\u2019 claim for actual and punitive damages arising from MLG &amp; W\u2019s terminations of service saves this cause from the bar of mootness. Cf. Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496-500, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1950-1952, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). <em>Although we express no opinion as to the validity of respondents claim for damages, that claim is not so insubstantial or so clearly foreclosed by prior decisions that this case may not proceed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Craft, </em>436 U.S. at 8-9, 98 S.Ct. at 1559-60 (some internal citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis added); <em>see also Flagg Bros., Inc. v.

Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure Jurisdiction 2d, </em>\u00a7 3533.3, at 262 (\u201cClaims for damages or other monetary relief automatically avoid mootness.... \u201d). In <em>Murray v. Board of Trustees, University of Louisville, </em>659 F.2d 77 (6th Cir.1981), we considered a similar question. The plaintiff in <em>Murray </em>filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking injunctive relief, money damages, and attorney\u2019s fees based on the university defendant firing him as editor of the school newspaper for expressing speech in his job as editor with which it disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 78. Relevant to the instant case, this court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">Our review of this record indicates that the District Judge was correct in dismissing on grounds of mootness that portion of the complaint which sought injunctive relief. But we do not feel his dismissal of the entire cause of action as moot was justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">In the present posture of this case, we do not consider it ripe for appellate decision and we therefore do not reach the District Judge\u2019s finding of constitutional violations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. While we accept as not clearly erroneous his finding that plaintiff failed to prove actual damages, the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Carey v.

Even though we express no opinion as to their validity, our decision in <em>Parks </em>did not render Hood\u2019s claim for money damages or attorney\u2019s fees moot. <em>See Murray, </em>659 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>78-79. While the Appellant may have withdrawn his claim for compensatory damages, <em>see supra </em>n. 7, the trial court on remand must consider in the first instance whether the Appellant has any viable claim for damages, nominal or otherwise, remaining and whether he is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Based upon the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and the case is remanded to the district court for its consideration of the Appellant\u2019s claim for damages and request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\">. In addition to the federal claims, the Complaint alleged violations of the Ohio Constitution, malicious prosecution, and false arrest. Hood withdrew his malicious prosecution claim, and the district court dismissed his false arrest claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides that federal district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to review state court judgments. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.

In its order granting summary judgment, the district court indicated in a footnote that the Appellant had withdrawn his claim for compensatory damages in his memorandum in opposition to the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. That document has not been included in the record on appeal. We note, however, that the issue presented in the motion to dismiss was based on <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>grounds, which this court held did not prevent the Appellant from challenging the state\u2019s violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. <em>See supra </em>at 395. In any event, because the record does not reflect that the Appellant reasserted his claim for compensatory damages in the wake of our prior decision in this case, we conclude Hood has apparently abandoned this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">However, on remand, the trial court should consider if our prior decision in this case had any effect on Hood's abandonment of his claim for compensatory damages. Further, in light of our pronouncement in <em>Murray, </em>the trial court should consider whether the Appellant has any viable claim for damages remaining before turning to the question of whether Hood is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a prevailing party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) provides that \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981a, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title, ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">In <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a plaintiff is a prevailing party entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees if he has succeeded on \u201cany significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). \"Respect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.\" <em>Hewitt v. Helms, 482 </em>U.S. 755, 760, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 2675, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987). In order \"to be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of \u00a7 1988, the plaintiff must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant.\u201d <em>Tex.
