The gravamen of Watson\u2019s Title VII action are his allegations that he failed to receive two separate promotions and was downgraded one rating level on his performance evaluation for the rating period February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2003, all in retaliation for his engaging in protected activity under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">On July 23, 2004, the district court granted Mobley\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), leaving the Secretary as the sole defendant. Thereafter, on March 20, 2006, the district court disposed of the remainder of the action by granting the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Mobley timely noticed the present appeal in which he only challenges the district court\u2019s grant of the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">Having thoroughly reviewed the district court\u2019s opinion and the parties\u2019 briefs and submissions on appeal, and having heard oral argument in this case, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Secretary. With one exception, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court as stated in its March 20, 2006 Memorandum Opinion, 2006 WL 753185. The one exception pertains to Watson\u2019s claim that Mobley downgraded him one rating-level from the previous year in his overall performance rating for the annual rating period February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2003. A careful reading of the record indisputably shows that IRS employee Mary Howerton, not Mobley as alleged by Watson, was the \u201cRater\u201d with respect to Watson\u2019s performance evaluation for the annual rating period February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2003.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Because there is no evidence in the record that Mary Howerton had any knowledge of Watson\u2019s protected activity when she rated his performance for this period, Watson has not proffered sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his Title VII retaliation claim based upon his down-graded performance rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In conclusion, the judgment below with respect to Watson\u2019s claims against the Secretary is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-12\"> The district court misspoke when it stated in its Memorandum Opinion that \"[o]n February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>2, 2003, Mobley downgraded Watson\u2019s performance evaluation from 'Fully Exceeds Expectations\u2019 to 'Meets Expectations.\u2019 \u201d (J.A. 321).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
