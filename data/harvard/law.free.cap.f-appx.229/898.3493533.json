Because Hall\u2019s positive test for marijuana use is a factor that the district court correctly considered in denying Hall the reduction, the court did not clearly err in denying Hall an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">Derrick Dajuan Hall was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered short-barreled firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). He subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">According to the undisputed facts in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Hall was involved in an argument with another individual inside the Blues Palace Club in Birmingham, Alabama. An off-duty police officer working at the club broke up the argument and ejected Hall from the club. However, Hall did not leave the premises; rather he walked around the parking lot and then returned to the club. The off-duty officer observed Hall walking in a manner that indicated there may be something concealed in his pant leg and, based upon this observation, one of the police officers at the club frisked Hall. During this pat down, the officer felt a hard object on Hall\u2019s right hip. Officers escorted Hall outside the club, where they lifted his shirt and saw part of a shotgun protruding from Hall\u2019s pants. The gun was an Iver Johnson single-barrel, 12 gauge shotgun with a crudely cut off barrel 13 7/8 inches in length and one loaded round of ammunition. The gun was not registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">The probation officer found that Hall had a total adjusted base offense level of 18 and a criminal history category of II, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>which produced a sentencing range of 30 to 37 months. In calculating the total adjusted base offense level, the officer did not recommend an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, based upon Hall\u2019s \u201cpositive drug screen results for marijuana and his failure to comply with drug court conditions.\u201d Hall objected to the PSI not including a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">At his sentencing hearing, Hall renewed his objection to the PSI, although he admitted that he failed three drug tests. The district court overruled the objection, stating: \u201cIt does not show acceptance of responsibility if you keep violating the law, and positive drug screenings for illegal drugs is a violation of the law. It\u2019s not just one time. It\u2019s three times.\u201d R4 at 4. The district court accepted the PSI\u2019s recommended guideline calculations and, noting that the guideline sentencing range was advisory, sentenced Hall to 30 months\u2019 incarceration and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Hall argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Admitting that he tested positive for marijuana during two drug screenings between his indictment and his sentencing hearing, Hall contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the positive drug tests are insufficient to deny him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. In support, he notes that \u201che admitted his guilt timely, entered a plea early in the case and did not commit any further crimes after his plea.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. He also relies upon dicta in the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Woods, </em>927 F.2d 735, 736 (2d Cir.1991), in which that circuit expressed doubt whether the defendant\u2019s failure of three drug tests after pleading guilty \u201cwould, standing alone, provide an adequate ground for denying Woods a sentence reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir.2005). The defendant bears the burden of showing entitlement to the reduction, and, under the clear error standard, the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level decrease in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if \u201cthe defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). An additional one-level reduction is permitted for acceptance of responsibility \u201c[i]f the defendant qualifies for a reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a), the offense level determined prior to the application of the two-level decrease is level 16 or greater,\u201d and the government submits a motion \u201cstating that the defendant assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">\u201cA defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 3; <em>see also Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756-57 (holding that the district court did not clearly err when it denied defendant an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction because defendant\u2019s guilty plea was not sufficient to show his acceptance of responsibility where he had testified falsely at plea proceeding and sentencing). Although a guilty plea \u201cwill constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility[,] ... this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>sponsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 3. An appropriate consideration is whether the defendant truthfully admits conduct comprising the offense conduct and any additional relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Moreover, we held in <em>United States v. Pace, </em>17 F.3d 341, 344 (11th Cir.1994), that the district court did not err in declining to grant an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility based upon the defendant\u2019s drug use alone. <em>See Pace, </em>17 F.3d at 344. In <em>Pace, </em>the defendant tested positive for marijuana on the day of his guilty plea and admitted that he had used marijuana a few days earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 342. His marijuana use constituted a violation of a condition of his release on bail. <em>Id. </em>The probation officer declined to recommend a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id. </em>Over Pace\u2019s objection, the district court denied the adjustment, and we affirmed. We reasoned that a \u201cdistrict court is authorized to consider [a defendant\u2019s] subsequent criminal conduct, even if it is unrelated to the offense of conviction, in determining whether a decrease for acceptance of responsibility is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Hall an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1. Although Hall pleaded guilty, that fact alone did not automatically entitle him to the reduction. <em>See Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756-57. During his release pending sentencing, Hall tested positive for marijuana use, which is a factor the court correctly considered in denying Hall the reduction. <em>See Pace, </em>17 F.3d at 344. We accord great deference to a district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction, and, based on the record here, we cannot find that the district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction constituted \u201cclear error.\u201d <em>See Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756-57. The Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Woods </em>does not change this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The district court did not err in considering Hall\u2019s admitted drug use during his probation in the time period prior to the offense of conviction and in denying Hall\u2019s request for a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
