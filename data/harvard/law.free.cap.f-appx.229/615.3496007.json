R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b644-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Benita Hernandez-Leon seeks review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying Hernandez-Leon\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. We dismiss in part and grant in part the petition for review, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Hernandez-Leon failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Hernandez-Leon\u2019s contention that the agency deprived her of due process by misapplying the law to the facts of her case does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed). Hernandez-Leon\u2019s remaining contentions that we have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding as to exceptional and extremely unusual hardship are also unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the 60-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
