On appeal, Foster argues that the district court erred at sentencing by applying the cross-reference of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) to his base offense level because the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he used or possessed the shotgun \u201cin connection with\u201d an attempted kidnaping, rather than in a manner that was incidental to the attempted kidnaping. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-24\">We review a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review ... [and] its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The Court will not find clear error unless it is \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number><em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005)(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The relevant facts are these. On February 24, 2005, Foster was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He pled guilty and proceeded to sentencing. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), on September 23, 2004, officers from the Daphne, Alabama Sheriffs Office responded to an emergency call regarding an attempted kidnaping. The officers arrived at Cynthia Chapman\u2019s home and found the door open. Upon entering, the officers encountered Foster dragging Chapman down a hallway. Foster was arrested and three rounds of 20-gauge shotgun ammunition were found in his pants pocket. A subsequent search of Foster\u2019s truck resulted in the discovery of a 20-gauge, semi-automatic, loaded shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The PSI recommended that because Foster possessed the shotgun \u201cin connection with\u201d the commission or attempted commission of another offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)\u2019s cross-reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(a) applied and Foster\u2019s base offense level of 32 was calculated based on the applicable guideline for the underlying substantive offense of attempted kidnaping, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(a). After adjustments for use of a dangerous weapon during the course of the attempted kidnaping and for acceptance of responsibility, Foster\u2019s total offense level was 31. With a criminal history category III, the recommended Guidelines range was 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) was 120 months, Foster\u2019s Guidelines range was 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Foster objected, <em>inter alia, </em>to the application of the cross-reference to \u00a7 2X1.1 in \u00a7 2K2.1(c), arguing that because the shotgun was in his vehicle, it was not used in connection with the kidnaping attempt. He urged that although he could have taken the firearm into the house and forced Chapman to leave at gunpoint, he purposefully left the firearm in his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The government responded that given the continuing nature of the crime of kidnaping, it was reasonable to conclude that the shotgun was possessed in connection with the attempted kidnaping. At the sentencing hearing, the government presented Chapman\u2019s testimony. She testified that Foster had been stalking her since November 2001. Local law enforcement officials had informed her in September 2004 that Foster was in Daphne, Alabama, and he had recently stolen a gun. When Foster broke into her home, he told her that she \u201chad been a bad, bad girl\u201d and told her to pack a bag, claiming that \u201che had almost killed one motherfucker to get to [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">The district court rejected Foster\u2019s argument concerning application of the sentencing cross-reference, finding that Foster was in the process of kidnaping Chapman with ammunition in his pocket and a loaded gun in his waiting vehicle. The court also found that it was reasonable to assume that Foster intended to take Chapman away in his vehicle, which made the loaded shotgun \u201cintegrally interwoven with the offense.\u201d The district court then indicated that it was adopting the PSI\u2019s sentencing calculations and invited any further argument to which Foster responded, \u201cNo additional objections.\u201d Following Foster\u2019s request for a sentence below the statutory maximum, the district court sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release. In imposing sentence, the district court observed that Foster posed a severe danger to the public, and that the help Foster needed was not \u201clessening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>the sentence to some substantially lesser time ... but to impose the statutory sentence and have the Bureau of Prisons deal with your mental and emotional problems as best they can.\u201d After imposition of the sentence, Foster did not make any additional objections when given the opportunity to do so by the district court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">If a defendant used or possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense,\u201d then the Sentencing Guidelines direct that the guideline for attempt should be applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l)(A). The Guideline for attempt states that the district court should apply the base offense level for the substantive offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(a). The phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c). However, we have interpreted the phrase expansively, finding that it reflects the context of the defendant\u2019s possession. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (interpreting the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in the context of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)). In addition, we have held that a firearm does not have to facilitate the underlying offense. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Rhind, </em>we determined that two unloaded guns, found in the backseat of a vehicle with counterfeit money, were possessed in connection with the counterfeiting scheme. 289 F.3d at 695-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Here, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that the shotgun was possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d the attempted kidnaping and to apply \u00a7 2K2.1(c)\u2019s cross-reference. Foster had shotgun ammunition in his pocket when he was arrested and there was a loaded shotgun in his vehicle, which was parked just outside of Chapman\u2019s house. Moreover, the government presented Chapman\u2019s testimony that Foster had been stalking her for a number of years, had recently stolen a gun, and told Chapman that he had almost killed someone to get to her. The shotgun was easily retrievable if Foster had any difficulty in forcing Chapman to leave with him. <em>Cf. United States v. Flennory, </em>145 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that a firearm found in the defendant\u2019s vehicle was possessed in connection with a felony drug offense when the defendant was selling drugs across the street; reasoning that the defendant could easily retrieve the firearm if it became necessary), <em>superseded on other grounds, United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Indeed, the only reason that the shotgun was not directly in Chapman\u2019s presence was due to the interruption of the kidnaping attempt by law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">On this record, we readily conclude it was not clear error for the district court to apply the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c), finding that Foster\u2019s possession was in connection with the attempted kidnaping. Accordingly, we affirm Foster\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
