We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>see Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005) and the denial of a motion to reconsider, <em>see Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that the Gomezes failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003). The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the Gomezes\u2019 motion to remand, because the BIA considered the evidence they submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the Gomezes\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision affirming the IJ\u2019s order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
