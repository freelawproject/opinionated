We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">In order to provide for representation of social security claimants, Congress authorized payment of \u201ca reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of past due benefits\u201d won through that representation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A). The statutory and regulatory regime is unusual in allowing only contingency fees. In other words, where benefits are denied, no fees are allowed. <em>See Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. 789, 795, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002). In fact, it is a criminal offense for an attorney to charge a noncontingent fee or a fee in excess of the 25 percent statutory ceiling. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(2); 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1740(c)(2); <em>Gisbrecht, </em>535 U.S. at 795-96,122 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-19\">Under <em>Gisbrecht, </em>a district court is required to conduct an independent review of a fee request for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Gisbrecht, </em>535 U.S. at 807-08, 122 S.Ct. 1817. Resolving a circuit split on the issue, <em>Gisbrecht </em>held that \u00a7 406(b) was designed to control contingency fee agreements, not to displace them. <em>Id. </em>at 807, 122 S.Ct. 1817. The Supreme Court rejected the reliance on lodestar calculations that do not give primary effect to lawful attorney-client fee agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 806-07,122 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-20\">In this case, despite citing <em>Gisbrecht, </em>the magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> focused on a lodestar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>type calculation rather than crediting the contingency fee agreement and then performing a reasonableness check. In particular, the court noted that the requested fee would result in \u201ca de facto hourly rate that would be the envy of practitioners in almost any field,\u201d signaling the court\u2019s overwhelming focus on the effective hourly rate. The court did not consider most of the reasonableness factors noted in <em>Gisbrecht, </em>including the attorney\u2019s risk of loss, the nature and character of the representation, future benefits accruing to the petitioner from counsel\u2019s work, delays caused by counsel and other uncertainties. <em>Id. </em>at 805, 808, 122 S.Ct. 1817. Nor did the court explicitly consider that the petitioner in this case did not object to the fee award or counsel\u2019s own reduction of the fees from the amount due under the contingency fee agreement. Rather, the district court merely noted that the issues were not complex and not a lot of time was required to resolve them. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 808, 122 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Because the magistrate judge did not fully incorporate the <em>Gisbrecht </em>framework, the reduction of the fees constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Allen v. Shalala, </em>48 F.3d 456, 457 (9th Cir.1995) (review is for abuse of discretion), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gisbrecht, </em>535 U.S. 789, 122 S.Ct. 1817. On remand, the district court should reconsider the reasonableness of the fees sought, in light of the contingency fee agreement and the factors bearing upon reasonableness but without primary focus on a lodestar calculation of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b544-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-21\">. The parties agreed that the case may be handled by the magistrate judge acting for the district court, and the appeal is taken directly from the magistrate judge\u2019s order awarding fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b545-7\">WHYTE, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Anq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">I would affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. The magistrate judge conducted an independent review of the fee request and awarded a not-unreasonable amount in fees. <em>See Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. 789, 807-08, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002). Because the magistrate judge applied the correct law and did not make any clearly erroneous factual findings, the reduction of the requested contingency fee did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Allen v. Shalala, 48 F.3d 456, </em>457 (9th Cir.1995), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gisbrecht, </em>535 U.S. 789, 122 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the amount requested was reasonable on the grounds that the request was based on a contingency fee agreement and that counsel had unilaterally reduced his fee request overlooks <em>Gisbrecht\u2019s </em>mandate of \u201ccourt review\u201d to operate as \u201can independent check\u201d on the reasonableness of a contingency fee agreement in a Social Security benefits case. <em>Id. </em>at 807, 122 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Appellant\u2019s second argument\u2014that the magistrate judge\u2019s discussion of hourly rates indicates a failure to follow <em>Gis</em>brecht\u2014is not persuasive. The magistrate judge referred to <em>Gisbrecht, </em>acknowledged the contingency agreement, and conducted the reasonableness analysis that <em>Gisbrecht </em>requires. <em>See id. </em>at 807-08,122 S.Ct. 1817 (noting that a district court may require counsel to submit a record of the hours spent and the lawyer\u2019s normal hourly billing rate for non-contingent fee cases to aid the court\u2019s reasonableness assessment). The magistrate judge\u2019s use of hourly rates as a comparison basis for finding a reasonable fee amount resulted in a not-unreasonable award. I do not infer from his comparison that the magistrate judge unreasonably focused on the effective hourly rate as opposed to crediting the contingency fee agreement and then performing a reasonableness check. The generous lodestar rate applied gave significant weight to the contingency fee agreement and implicitly accounted for the uncertainties, delays, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>and risks inherent in contingency fee agreements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
