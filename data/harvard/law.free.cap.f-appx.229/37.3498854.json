Horn denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Wengin Chen, </em>No. A96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>336 048 (B.I.A. Sept. 14, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 336 048 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 12, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>475 F.3d 135, 137 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Chen, an unmarried young man who has no children and who has not alleged any personal contact with Chinese family planning officials in the past, asserts that he has a well-founded fear of persecution under the family planning policy. We identify no error in the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen failed to meet his burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal. As Chen acknowledges in his brief, he is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based on his mother\u2019s sterilization, <em>see Shao Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 305 (2d Cir.2005), nor does the fact that his mother was sterilized, by itself, suggest that he\u2014or anyone he might marry\u2014faces a heightened risk of sterilization. Moreover, the IJ reasonably found that Chen\u2019s general fears relating to future enforcement of the family planning policy were too speculative to be considered well-founded, absent any evidence in the record to suggest that someone in his particular situation was likely to face forced sterilization or comparable punishment. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s CAT claim, given his failure to present evidence that would compel the conclusion that someone in his \u201cparticular alleged circumstances\u201d was more likely than not to be tortured, solely because he departed China illegally. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003). Chen also failed to submit any background evidence to support his statement that he might be beaten by loan sharks, or that the government would fail to protect him. The IJ reasonably found that his unsupported assertions were insufficient to establish the Chinese government\u2019s awareness of or willful blindness to such abuses by the loan sharks. <em>Cf. Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
