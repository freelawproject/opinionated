On appeal, Ortiz argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court imposed sentence based on his prior felony conviction for attempted lewd and lascivious molestation of a child less than 12, where the facts underlying the felony were neither alleged in the indictment nor admitted at the plea colloquy, contrary to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Because Ortiz asserted his <em>Booker </em>claim at sentencing, he raised a timely constitutional objection and is entitled to preserved error review. <em>See United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). We review preserved constitutional errors <em>de novo, </em>but \u201cwill reverse only for harmful error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1272 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Section 1326(b)(2) of Title 8 of the United States Code provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for illegal reentry if a defendant was deported subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony. On the other hand, a defendant who was not deported subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony, and who does not satisfy any of the other requirements justifying an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 1326(b), is subject to a maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">As Ortiz recognizes, the Supreme Court has held that the government need not allege in the indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that a defendant had prior convictions in order for a district court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based on those convictions. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Notably, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>involved a challenge to the exact penalty provision at issue in the instant case\u20148 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). More recently, in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Court reiterated its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres: </em>\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 244,125 S.Ct. 738 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">We have observed that the <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>decision \u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely [v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)], and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). And we have consistently rejected the argument that a district court errs by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>basing a sentencing enhancement on a pri- or conviction that is neither proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury nor admitted by the defendant. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006) (collecting cases); <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 951, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005); <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 885, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005). We reject Ortiz\u2019s invitation to revisit this issue yet again. Pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and our uniform line of cases applying it, the district court did not err in sentencing Ortiz based on his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. To the extent Ortiz suggests the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence also violated <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), we are unpersuaded. In <em>Shepard, </em>the district court had been asked to review police documents concerning the nature of the underlying offense. Here, by contrast, the district court did not look beyond the fact of Ortiz\u2019s prior conviction in enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Accordingly, <em>Shepard </em>was not implicated. <em>See United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.) (distinguishing <em>Shepard </em>and noting that the defendant did not contend and the record did not reveal that the district court had resolved disputed facts relating to the prior conviction supporting enhancement for prior crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 885, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
