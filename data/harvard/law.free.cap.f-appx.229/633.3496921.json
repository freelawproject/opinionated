R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Elfego Lopez Garz\u00f3n, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for cancellation of removal, and the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider. We dismiss the petition for review in No. 05-72986 in part and grant in part, and we deny the petition for review in No. 05-74865.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Lopez Garz\u00f3n failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, <em>see Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003), and Lopez Garzon\u2019s contention that the IJ and BIA misapplied the law to the facts of his case does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying Lopez Garzon\u2019s motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision affirming the IJ\u2019s order denying cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">In the underlying proceedings the IJ granted voluntary departure for a 60 day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the agency for further proceedings regarding voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW No. OS-72986 GRANTED in part and DISMISSED in part; REMANDED; PETITION FOR REVIEW No. 05-74865 DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
