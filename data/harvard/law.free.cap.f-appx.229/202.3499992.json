Thomas appeals the order from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Thomas filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging the method that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) uses to calculate Good Conduct Time (\u201cGCT\u201d). The BOP calculates GCT based upon the amount of time an inmate actually serves, not the amount of time to which the prisoner has been sentenced. Thomas maintains that this method is contrary to what Congress intended when it enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We will summarily affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Thomas\u2019 petition. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Summary action is appropriate where there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. In this appeal, there is no substantial question presented. The district court was entirely correct that our Court has squarely rejected Thomas\u2019 argument before. <em>See O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 174 (3d Cir.2005). In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>the petitioner also argued that he was entitled to earn up to 54 days of GCT per year of the term of sentence imposed, rather than just on the amount of time actually served. We held that the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the statute, whereby it permits GCT to be earned only on time actually served, is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 174. Accordingly, we find that there is no substantial question presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We will affirm the district court\u2019s order. Thomas\u2019 \u201cMotion\u201d filed on January 4, 2007, is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
