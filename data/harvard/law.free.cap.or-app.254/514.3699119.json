In addition, that judgment \u201c[a]llowed\u201d criminal forfeiture (Count 9).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for self-representation. Defendant further contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a warranted search of his residence and vehicle because the affidavit in support of the warrant was insufficient in certain respects. As amplified below, we conclude that the trial court erred with respect to the preclusion of self-representation, which requires an omnibus reversal and remand as to all counts, except Count 1 on which defendant was acquitted. Further, for purposes of guidance on remand, we conclude that the trial court erred, in part, in denying suppression\u2014 and, specifically, erred in denying suppression of evidence obtained from defendant\u2019s residence, but did not so err with respect to evidence obtained from defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">As we explained in <em>State v. Duarte / Knull-Dunagan, </em>237 Or App 13, 21-22, 238 P3d 411, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 370 (2010), \u201cwhen a defendant seeks to suppress evidence from a search authorized by warrant, contending that the information in the predicate warrant did not establish probable cause,\u201d our review \u201cfunction is limited to determining whether, given the uncontroverted facts in the affidavit and reasonably derived inferences, the issuing magistrate reasonably \u2018could have concluded that the affidavit (excluding the excised parts) established probable cause to search * * \u201d (Omission in <em>Duarte / Knull-Dunagan) </em>(quoting <em>State v. Castilleja, </em>345 Or 255, 265, 192 P3d 1283, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>345 Or 473, 198 P3d 937 (2008)). In exercising that function, we view the predicate affidavit \u201cin a commonsense, nontechnical and realistic fashion\u201d with \u201cdoubtful cases * * * to be resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>by deferring to an issuing magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>178 Or App 163, 167, 35 P3d 1111 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Consistently with those principles, we state the content of the affidavit on which the search warrant was predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">On November 6, 2008, Medford Police Department Detective Hatten executed an affidavit in support of a warrant to search defendant, his 2001 Hyundai sedan, and his residence for \u201cevidence of the possession, manufacture, and delivery of the controlled substance methamphetamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Hatten began by averring that defendant\u2019s \u201cresidence\u201d was \u201cat 1844 West 8th Street #3.\u201d He noted that defendant had been convicted in 1977, 1999, and 2000 of drug-related offenses and referenced out-of-state arrests as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Hatten then recounted the facts surrounding three controlled drug buys. The first two controlled buys occurred on separate occasions, within the two weeks preceding the request for the warrant, at an undisclosed location in Jackson County. Specifically, a confidential reliable informant (CRI) purchased \u201ca small amount of methamphetamine from [defendant] through an [unnamed] unwitting informant [(UI)].\u201d According to Hatten, before both controlled buys, he and two other detectives gave the CRI \u201cmoney with recorded serial numbers and a radio transmitter\u201d and searched \u201cthe CRI\u2019s person and vehicle for controlled substances and unaccounted for money\u201d but found none. The detectives observed the CRI pick up and eventually drop off the UI at another location. At that point, the detectives maintained surveillance on both the UI and CRI. They observed defendant \u2014 who they identified \u201cthrough a booking photo\u201d\u2014 arrive \u201cin his black 2001 Hyundai * * * and contact the [UI] .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the UI returned to the CRTs location and gave the CRI \u201cthe purchased methamphetamine.\u201d The detectives then observed the CRI drop off the UI and followed the CRI to a designated meeting site. There, they retrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the purchased substance, which field-tested positive for methamphetamine. The officers again searched \u201cthe CRTs person and vehicle for additional controlled substances and unaccounted for money\u201d but found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The third controlled buy occurred within 72 hours before Hatten\u2019s request for the warrant. Again, the CRI \u201cpurchased a small amount of methamphetamine from [defendant] through an unwitting informant\u201d at an undisclosed location. In general, the circumstances of the third controlled buy were similar to those of the first two. However, there were two significant distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">First, before the controlled buy, two officers \u201cset up surveillance on [defendant\u2019s] residence at 1844 West 8th Street #3\u201d and \u201cobserved [defendant\u2019s] black Hyundai sedan * * * parked in the apartment complex driveway in front of the 1844 section.\u201d The officers observed defendant \u2014 whom they identified through a booking photo \u2014 leave \u201capartment #3\u201d and \u201cwalk directly to his black Hyundai sedan.\u201d The officers followed defendant to the location where he met with the UI. After the controlled buy, the officers followed defendant \u201cback to his residence at 1844 West 8th Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Second, Hatten indicated that the CRI recounted two specific statements that the UI had made to him, attendant to the controlled buy, that are pertinent to the issues on appeal. Specifically, Hatten averred that the CRI</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201ctold us that he/she asked the [UI] after the controlled buy if the CRI could purchase at least one-quarter ounce of methamphetamine from the same drug source that the [UI] had just got the methamphetamine from within the next couple of days. The CRI stated to me that the [UI] told the CRI <em>that would be no problem. </em>The CRI stated to me that the [UI] told the CRI that <em>they could purchase anything they wanted through the drug source identified as being [defendant].\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">(Emphasis added.) Based on his \u201ctraining and experience,\u201d Hatten explained that \u201cone-quarter ounce of methamphetamine is more than a person would consume in a seventy-two hour period\u201d and that \u201cone-quarter ounce of methamphetamine is [a] dealer amount of methamphetamine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that is commonly broken down into smaller amount [s] of methamphetamine to be sold [to] customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Finally, in the balance of his affidavit, Hatten included other averments based on his training and experience in drug-enforcement efforts. In general, Hatten referred to his 21 years of experience in law enforcement, his work with the \u201cJackson County Narcotics Enforcement Team (JACNET),\u201d and his \u201cspecial training in controlled substance investigations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">However, his averments primarily pertained to common practices of those who possess and sell controlled substances. In particular, Hatten stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cI also know that, based upon my training and experience, persons who possess cocaine [sic], possess it both for their own use and to sell. Persons who sell cocaine [sic] will often keep records so they can keep track of their profits and whom they sell to. These records are often hand written by the suspect or suspects, persons who possess and sell cocaine [sic] will also have packaging material, cutting agents and scales used to package controlled substances. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\"><em>((% </em>ij: \u2021 ifc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\u201cI know from my training and experience that people often keep controlled substances, scales, packaging material, cutting agents and currency from drug sales in a safe or other type locking container.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Hatten further described how vehicles are used by those involved in drug transactions. Specifically, he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">\u201cItems of value including drugs, currency, records of sales, or purchase of drugs are often kept in automobiles by persons trafficking in controlled] substances. This enables the trafficker to quickly depart a residence and ensure that the necessary tools are readily accessible for the purpose of selling or purchasing drugs. I have often seized such items from vehicles seized at the scene of a residence being searched for drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">As noted, based on Hatten\u2019s affidavit, the court issued a search warrant on November 6, which was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>later the same day, yielding inculpatory evidence in both defendant\u2019s residence and the vehicle. Defendant was charged with a variety of drug-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Thereafter, he filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the warranted search, as well as derivative evidence, on the ground that the affidavit in support of the warrant \u201clacked probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In support of that contention, and as pertinent to the issues on appeal, defendant pointed to two deficiencies in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">First, defendant pointed to two of the UI\u2019s statements that were included in the <em>affidavit </em>\u2014 viz., (1) that it \u201cwould be no problem\u201d to obtain at least one-quarter ounce of methamphetamine from defendant within a couple of days after the third controlled buy; and (2) that the CRI and UI \u201ccould purchase anything they wanted through the drug source identified as being [defendant].\u201d Defendant contended that the affidavit did not demonstrate that those two statements were credible or reliable or the UI\u2019s basis of knowledge for them and, for that reason, the statements could not be \u201crelied upon when reviewing the Affidavit for probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Second, defendant asserted that the affidavit was insufficient to \u201cestablish!] probable cause to believe that controlled substances, particularly methamphetamine and related paraphernalia would be found in [defendant\u2019s] residence.\u201d In particular, defendant contended that \u201cthere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>are no references to any illegal drug activity taking place at [defendant\u2019s] residence located at 1844 W. 8th Street, #3, yet this was the focal point of the search pursuant to a warrant.\u201d (Underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, reasoning that the affidavit established the knowledge and reliability of the UI and probable cause to search. Approximately seven months later, after a couple of continuances, the case was scheduled for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As noted, the threshold issue on appeal pertains to the purported denial of self-representation. The circumstances pertaining to that issue are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">At a hearing the afternoon before the trial was scheduled to begin, defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court that defendant sought to hire another attorney, Roloff, who, according to defendant, was unavailable for trial the next day. The court expressed concern about the length of time that the case had been pending as well as the numerous set-overs and told defendant, \u201cSo you either go with Mr. Roloff and he is ready tomorrow, or you stick with [current defense counsel] and she goes, or you represent yourself?\u201d At that point, the court reiterated its concerns about the need to resolve the case, and defendant explained the reasons that he had sought to hire Roloff. Ultimately, the hearing concluded with the following exchange between the court and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Trial tomorrow. Be back here at [9]:00 a.m. either with Mr. Roloff, [current defense counsel], or yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The following morning, defendant placed on the record his objections to his current attorney, who then moved to withdraw. At that point, the following colloquy ensued between the court and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, thank you Counsel. [Counsel] was appointed almost a year-and-a-half ago. This matter has been set \u2014 this is the seventh setting of this trial. I have absolutely no intention of continuing the matter again. [Counsel] is an attorney with great experience and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>has handled a great many of these matters. The motion to suppress has been already dealt with by Counsel and the Court has already ruled on that motion. The fact that a moment ago you blurted out that you objected to the State asking the Court to strike enhancement factors shows me how little you know about these matters and that you\u2019re better in the hands of an experienced attorney. So, initial withdrawal is denied, and any effort you are making by way of this argument for either a continuance or to represent yourself are both denied in your own best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: <em>I can\u2019t represent myself?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, I\u2019m going to keep [current counsel] on the case to represent you and that\u2019s in your best interest. So we\u2019re going to proceed as soon as we have a jury here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Ultimately, a jury convicted defendant of the drug offenses previously noted. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error. First, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for self-representation on the morning of trial. Specifically, defendant asserts that the trial court violated his rights to self-representation under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by summarily denying his request because he had \u201cmade an objection.during a pre-trial matter that was adverse to his interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Second, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the affidavit in support of the warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause for the warrant to issue. In support of that contention, he reprises the contentions that he raised in the trial court concerning the deficiencies in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">We begin with defendant\u2019s contention that the court erred in denying his request for self-representation. As we explained in <em>State v. Blanchard, </em>236 Or App 472, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>475, 236 P3d 845 (2010), under both the state and federal constitutions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u201c[a] defendant\u2019s right to counsel includes a right to self-representation. <em>State v. Verna, </em>9 Or App 620, 624, 498 P2d 793 (1972) (A defendant in a criminal case has the constitutional right not only to be represented by counsel, but also, if he so elects, to represent himself.\u2019); <em>see also Faretta v. California, </em>422 US 806, 819, 95 S Ct 2525, 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975) (\u2018The Sixth Amendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right to make his defense.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">That right, however, is not absolute. \u201cWhen a defendant asks to represent himself, the court must determine, on the record, whether his decision is an intelligent and understanding <em>one.\u201d State v. Davis, </em>110 Or App 358, 360, 822 P2d 736 (1991). Further, the court must \u201cdetermine whether granting the defendant\u2019s request would disrupt the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Verna, </em>9 Or App at 627).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Here, during the hearing the afternoon before defendant\u2019s trial was scheduled to begin, the trial court clearly alerted defendant that the trial would occur the following morning and that defendant had to make one of three choices \u2014 that is, (1) proceed with current defense counsel, (2) proceed with his putative substitute counsel, Roloff, or (3) represent himself. On the morning of trial, defendant arrived without Roloff and expressed his concerns about proceeding with his current defense counsel, who then moved to withdraw. The court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion and told defendant, \u201c[A]ny effort you are making by way of this argument for either a continuance or to represent yourself are both denied in your own best interest.\u201d In response, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: <em>I can\u2019t represent myself?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, I\u2019m going to keep [current counsel] on the case to represent you and <em>that\u2019s in your best interest. </em>So we\u2019re going to proceed as soon as we have a jury here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>That exchange demonstrates that \u2014 notwithstanding the state\u2019s appellate contentions to the contrary \u2014 the trial court understood that defendant sought to invoke his right of self-representation. Faced with that invocation, the trial court, rather than establishing that defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent, summarily denied defendant\u2019s request <em>solely </em>because it was in his \u201cbest interest\u201d to continue to be represented by his current defense counsel. Significantly, the court in precluding self-representation, did not refer to, or purport to do so based on, any anticipated \u201cdisruption of] the judicial process.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>110 Or App at 360. That was error. Accordingly, we must reverse and remand for a new trial as to Counts 2 through 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">However, our disposition in that regard does not obviate the need to address defendant\u2019s other assignment of error pertaining to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized during a warranted search of his residence and vehicle. Obviously, the admissibility of that inculpatory evidence will be central to any proceedings on remand. Accordingly, we turn to defendant\u2019s contentions concerning the sufficiency of the affidavit in support of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We begin with defendant\u2019s contention that the affidavit failed to establish the basis of knowledge for two of the UI\u2019s statements. ORS 133.545(4) provides, in part, that, \u201c[i]f an affidavit is based in whole or in part on hearsay, the affiant shall set forth facts bearing on any unnamed informant\u2019s reliability and shall disclose, as far as possible, the means by which the information was obtained.\u201d As we explained in <em>State v. Keerins, </em>197 Or App 428, 433-34, 106 P3d 166, <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 681 (2005), \u201c[w]ithout establishing the basis for the informant\u2019s knowledge, the issuing magistrate has no basis for assigning any weight to it. As a result, if the affidavit provides no facts for evaluating the basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge, then the informant\u2019s statements must be stricken from the affidavit.\u201d (Brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Here, Hatten\u2019s affidavit is based on double hearsay, in that it recounts (a) what the CRI told Hatten about (b) what the UI had said to the CRI. Under such circumstances, \u201ceach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>level of hearsay must be examined to determine if the basis of knowledge\u201d requirement is satisfied. <em>State v. Kreutzer, </em>138 Or App 306, 314, 909 P2d 175 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">At most, the affidavit in this case establishes that the UI purchased \u201ca small amount\u201d of methamphetamine from defendant during each of three controlled drug buys.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even if the UI had an ongoing business relationship with defendant, as the state asserts, the affidavit demonstrates nothing other than a relationship in which the UI purchased small amounts of methamphetamine \u2014 as opposed to larger amounts, such as a quarter of an ounce, or substances other than methamphetamine. Thus, there is simply nothing in the affidavit to indicate \u2014 or from which to infer \u2014 that the UI\u2019s statements that he could obtain at least one-quarter ounce of methamphetamine from defendant or could obtain substances other than methamphetamine from him were based on the UI\u2019s <em>personal knowledge, </em>as opposed to speculation on the UI\u2019s part. Accordingly, as defendant asserts, those statements cannot substantiate probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contention is that the affidavit failed to establish a nexus between drug activity and his residence. In general terms, defendant contends that the facts as shown in the affidavit did not establish that it was more likely than not that the items specified in the warrant would be found in his residence. <em>See Wilson, </em>178 Or App at 166-67 (\u201cTo be sufficient, an affidavit in support of a warrant must permit a conclusion by a neutral and detached magistrate that the items specified in the warrant will probably be found in a specified place to be searched.\u201d); <em>State v. Castro, </em>194 Or App 109, 115, 93 P3d 815 (2004) (explaining that the probability standard requires that the information in the affidavit \u201cmust be such that a reasonable person could conclude that it is more likely than not that the objects of the search will be found <em>at the specified location\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)). Further, defendant notes that, although Hatten \u201creiterated his training and experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and further concluded that[,] based on that expertise, drug-related evidence would be found in defendant\u2019s car,\u201d he \u201cnever specifically connects his training and experience to defendant\u2019s home.\u201d <em>See State v. Goodman, </em>328 Or 318, 328, 975 P2d 458 (1999) (\u201cFacts derived from training and experience may contribute [the] necessary factual nexus in a determination of probable cause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Two cases inform our analysis of that issue\u2014 <em>Wilson, </em>178 Or App 163, and <em>Keerins, </em>197 Or App 428. In <em>Wilson, </em>we held that the trial court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress on the ground that the warrant authorizing the search of their residence was not supported by probable cause. 178 Or App at 165. In so holding, we rejected the state\u2019s argument that the trial court had \u201cunduly discounted\u201d the officer\u2019s \u201cgeneral training and experience and his knowledge that people involved in drug activity generally have evidence of that activity on their property and in their residences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171. Noting that \u201cthe weight to be given to [training and experience] representations depends on the totality of the facts contained in the affidavit[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>we agreed with the trial court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cthe facts in the affidavit in this case, as controverted, were simply too weak to be shored up by the officer\u2019s general training and experience. Again, the affidavit described a single sale of an unknown quantity of methamphetamine that occurred at some undisclosed time at a location other than defendants\u2019 residence. Nothing corroborated [one of the] defendant [\u2019s] * * * vague statement about having \u2018lots\u2019 of methamphetamine to sell. The officer\u2019s expertise was simply too unconnected to objective facts derived from other sources to provide probable cause to search defendants\u2019 residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 171-72 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">By contrast, in <em>Keerins, </em>we held that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained from the search of his residence. 197 Or App at 430. There, the defendant contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe officer\u2019s statements about his training and experience [were] too vague to provide the requisite nexus to defendant\u2019s house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>In rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention, we explained that the officer\u2019s training and experience averments were not \u201cas specific\u201d as they could have been and that \u201c[t]he affidavit says nothing about keeping drugs at home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435. Nevertheless, we ultimately stated that \u201c[i]t is not unreasonable to assume that the officer, in saying that people who deal in drugs \u2018store and keep\u2019 certain items, do so at their homes, particularly in light of the fact that the only place the warrant seeks authority to search is [the] defendant\u2019s and [his brother\u2019s] home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, we reasoned that the officer\u2019s averment that people who deal in drugs store items, in conjunction with his request to search only the defendant\u2019s home, permitted a reasonable inference that the evidence sought in the warrant would be found in the defendant\u2019s home. Further, in distinguishing <em>Wilson, </em>we explained that \u201cthe officer\u2019s expertise [was] connected with objective facts establishing that drug activity occurred at [the] defendant\u2019s house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Ultimately, our conclusion in <em>Keerins </em>that the affidavit established probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s residence was predicated on the conjunction of two propositions. First, \u201c[the officer\u2019s] affidavit established] that drug activity of some sort had occurred <em>at the house </em>months earlier and as recently as the day before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435 (emphasis in original). Second, \u201c[the officer\u2019s] affidavit established] that drug dealers keep evidence of their crimes at their homes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Here, at most, Hatten\u2019s affidavit established that (1) defendant sold a small amount of methamphetamine to the UI during each of three controlled drug buys that occurred within two weeks of the issuance of the warrant at an undisclosed location; (2) defendant lived at the residence \u2014 that is, \u201c1844 West 8th Street #3\u201d; and (3) defendant drove directly from that residence to the third controlled buy and returned thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In addition, Hatten indicated that, based on his training and experience, \u201cpeople often keep controlled substances, scales, packaging material, cutting agents and currency from drug sales in a safe or other type locking container\u201d and \u201c[i] terns of value including drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>currency, records of sales, or purchase of drugs are often kept in automobiles by persons trafficking in controlled] substances\u201d because that \u201cenables the trafficker to quickly depart a residence and ensure that the necessary tools are readily accessible for the purpose of selling or purchasing drugs.\u201d None of those generic averments, however, establishes that, where a person is using a <em>vehicle </em>to engage in drug transactions, evidence of possession, manufacturing, or distribution is likely to be located in his or her <em>residence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">To be sure, this case differs from <em>Wilson </em>in that there was more than one controlled buy and defendant drove directly from his residence to the last of the three controlled buys and returned thereafter. Nevertheless, the circumstances here are similar to those in <em>Wilson </em>\u2014 and distinguishable from those in <em>Keerins </em>\u2014 in one fundamental, and ultimately dispositive, respect: The drug activity in this case did not occur at defendant\u2019s residence. Instead, each of the three controlled buys occurred at an undisclosed location other than defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Further, contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, Hatten\u2019s training and experience averments do not contribute the necessary factual nexus in this case. The gravamen of the state\u2019s contention is that, because Hatten stated that \u201cdrug dealers \u2018often keep records\u2019 and \u2018people often keep controlled substances, scales, packaging material, cutting agents and currency from drug sales in a safe or other type locking container[,]\u2019 \u201d it is reasonable to infer \u201cthat the most probable place to find a safe containing those listed items is in a house.\u201d However, again, unlike the circumstances in <em>Keerins, </em>there is nothing in the affidavit, generally \u2014 or in Hatten\u2019s training and experience averments, specifically\u2014 permitting and supporting a nonspeculative inference to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In sum, the affidavit is insufficient to permit a magistrate reasonably to conclude that it is more likely than not that the evidence sought in the warrant would be found at defendant\u2019s residence. That conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>As noted, in addition to authorizing the search of defendant\u2019s residence, the warrant also authorized the search of his vehicle. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention\u2014 and in contrast to the insufficiency with respect to defendant\u2019s residence \u2014 the affidavit was legally sufficient to permit a reasonable magistrate to determine that there was probable cause to search the vehicle. <em>See Duarte /Knull-Dunagan, </em>237 Or App at 21-22 (stating standard). Specifically, in that regard, the affidavit sufficiently substantiates that defendant drove his black Hyundai sedan to each of the controlled drug buys and that, based on Hatten\u2019s training and experience, \u201c[i] terns of value including drugs, currency, records of sales, or purchase of drugs are often kept in automobiles by persons trafficking in control [led] substances,\u201d which \u201cenables the trafficker to quickly depart a residence and ensure that the necessary tools are readily accessible for the purpose of selling or purchasing drugs.\u201d The nexus to the vehicle is patent. Accordingly, the warranted search of the vehicle was lawful, and the fruits of that search were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Convictions on Counts 2 through 8 and allowance of forfeiture in Count 9 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\"> Defendant was acquitted of a single count of unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine (Count 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\"> Hatten stated that \u201ca computer registration check\u201d on the Hyundai sedan \u201creturn[ed] to [defendant].\u201d Further, Hatten stated that, within the week before the warrant issued, he had \u201cobserved [defendant\u2019s] Hyundai parked in the apartment complex in front of the 1844 section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\"> In his motion, defendant, relying on ORS 133.693(2), also sought to controvert the affidavit, contending that \u201cHatten omitted at least three pieces of material information that directly impact the sufficiency of the remaining evidence that * * * Hatten relies upon to establish probable cause for the search warrant.\u201d However, contrary to the requirements of ORS 133.693(2), defendant did not submit an affidavit to substantiate his contention. ORS 133.693(2) (\u201cIf the evidence sought to be suppressed was seized by authority of a search warrant, the moving party shall he allowed to contest the good faith, accuracy and truthfulness of the affiant as to the evidence presented before the issuing authority only upon supplementary motion, <em>supported by affidavit, setting forth substantial basis for questioning such good faith, accuracy and truthfulness.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court did not expressly address defendant\u2019s controverting contentions concerning the purported omissions from the affidavit. Nevertheless, because defendant failed to provide evidentiary support for those contentions as prescribed by ORS 133.693(2), they fail as a matter of law. Consequently, for purposes of our review, the facts recited in Hatten\u2019s affidavit are uncontroverted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-12\"> Article I, section 11, provides, in part, that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to be heard by himself and counself.]\u201d The Sixth Amendment provides, in part, that, \u201cfi]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall * * * have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\"> The affidavit is less than clear as to whether the UI who was involved in the first two controlled buys was the same UI involved in the third buy.
