We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We begin by describing the legal framework that provides the necessary context for understanding DLCD\u2019s orders and the parties\u2019 contentions in these cases. In 2004, Ballot Measure 37 was enacted through the initiative process. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>351 Or 219, 224-25, 264 P3d 1265 (2011),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201c[t]hat measure provided landowners with \u2018just compensation\u2019 for land use regulations, enacted after they had acquired their property, that restricted the use of the property and, as a result, diminished its value. <em>See State ex rel English v. Multnomah County, </em>348 Or 417, 420-22, 238 P3d 980 (2010) (describing Measure 37). When faced with a claim for \u2018just compensation\u2019 under Measure 37, a government could choose: (1) to pay the landowner compensation for the diminished value of the property and enforce the regulation or (2) to waive the regulation and permit the owner to use the property for a use permitted at the time the owner acquired the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cMeasure 37 * * * was not without controversy. Some believed that the measure went farther than many voters had intended in that it not only permitted landowners to build a small number of additional homes on their property, unrelated to the resource use of the land, but it also authorized the large-scale development of formerly protected lands. <em>See </em>Official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, Special Election, Nov 6, 2007, 20 (Legislative Argument in Support of Measure 49). In response to those concerns, the 2007 Legislative Assembly considered several draft bills intended to reform Measure 37. After several public hearings, those draft hills were consolidated into a single bill, House Bill 3540 (2007). <em>See </em>Tape Recording, Joint Special Committee on Land Use Fairness, HB 3540, Apr 26, 2007, Tape 50, Side A (statement of Sen Greg Macpherson). The legislature did not enact HB 3540 directly; instead, it referred the proposed legislation to the voters on June 15,2007, as Ballot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Measure 49. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 750, \u00a7 2 (referring HB 3540 to the voters). In a special election held on November 6, 2007, the voters approved Measure 49 and, on December 6, 2007, the measure became effective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201cAmong other things, Measure 49 retroactively extinguished previously issued Measure 37 waivers of land use regulations. <em>See Corey v. DLCD, </em>344 Or 457, 466-67, 184 P3d 1109 (2008) (\u2018Measure 49 by its terms deprives Measure 37 waivers \u2014 and <em>all </em>orders disposing of Measure 37 claims \u2014 of any continuing viability\u2019; emphasis in original). As a result, landowners who had begun developing their property under authorization granted by Measure 37 waivers could no longer automatically continue to do so. Instead, those landowners had to choose one of three alternative \u2018pathways\u2019 moving forward: an \u2018express pathway,\u2019 a \u2018conditional pathway,\u2019 and \u2018a third pathway for claimants that have vested rights to carry out claims that have already been approved.\u2019 Tape Recording, Joint Special Committee on Land Use Fairness, SB 1019, Apr 19, 2007, Tape 43, Side A (statement of Richard Whitman, Oregon Department of Justice, summarizing the proposed \u2018framework\u2019 for amending Measure 37); <em>see </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 424, \u00a7 5 (setting out those three alternatives).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cThe express pathway entitles a landowner to obtain development approval for up to three additional homes on his or her property. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2007, ch 424, \u00a7 5(1) (identifying express pathway). Under the conditional pathway, a landowner can obtain approval for four to 10 homes if, among other conditions, the land use regulations prohibiting the construction of those homes resulted in a specified reduction of the fair market value of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\"><em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 (setting out conditional pathway and describing conditions). Finally, the vested rights pathway permits a landowner who had obtained a Measure 37 waiver to \u2018complete and continue the use described in the waiver,\u2019 provided that the landowner could also demonstrate a \u2018common law vested right\u2019 to complete that use. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">(Some citations and internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">As described by the Supreme Court, these cases concern the \u201cexpress pathway,\u201d which is set out in section 6 of Measure 49. Pursuant to section 6(1), if a claimant establishes certain qualifying prerequisites, the claimant is \u201celigible for three home site approvals on the property\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>described in a Measure 37 claim. At issue in these cases is whether the department correctly determined which parcels composed the relevant \u201cproperty\u201d for the purpose of determining the number of home site authorizations available under Measure 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In Case Number 1000209CC, petitioner submitted election forms seeking supplemental review under Measure 49 of his Measure 37 claims, in which he asked DLCD to authorize development of three building sites on each of two lots for a total of six building sites. In that case, DLCD considered all four of the parcels in petitioner\u2019s Measure 37 claim as \u201cproperty\u201d forming a contiguous whole, because there was no property owned by another person that separated those parcels. The DLCD issued a final order granting petitioner authority to develop three home sites on the four lots under Section 6 of Measure 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In Case Number 1000245CC, petitioner submitted election forms pursuant to Measure 49 in which he sought approval to develop a total of six dwellings on three lots. In that case, DLCD also considered parcels that petitioner owned as \u201cproperty\u201d forming a contiguous whole, including parcels that were not part of his underlying Measure 37 claim and which he did not describe in his request for supplemental review under Measure 49. In that case, DLCD issued a final order granting petitioner authority to develop two additional dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Petitioner sought review of each order in circuit court pursuant to ORS 195.318. The cases were consolidated for argument in that court. The court issued an opinion and judgments affirming DLCD\u2019s orders. Petitioner challenges both of those judgments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">On review of an order in other than a contested case, the circuit court determines (a) whether the agency erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action; and (b) whether the order is supported by substantial evidence in the record. ORS 183.484(5). On appeal, this court reviews the circuit court\u2019s judgment to determine whether it correctly assessed the agency\u2019s decisions under the standards of ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>183.484(5). Thus, \u201cin practical effect,\u201d we directly review the agency\u2019s order under the standards set out in ORS 183.484(5). <em>G.A.S.P. v. Environmental Quality Commission, </em>198 Or App 182, 187, 108 P3d 95, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We begin with Case Number 1000209CC, which concerns four tax lots owned by petitioner. Petitioner had filed a Measure 37 claim as to each of the four lots. Those lots are configured as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Petitioner filed two Measure 49 election forms in which, as noted, he sought authorization to develop a total of six building sites. Petitioner explained that one of the election forms concerned only \u201cthe lot designated as Tax Lot 200 as the subject parcel\u201d and the other concerned only \u201cTax Lot 1400 as the subject parcel.\u201d Petitioner separately sought three home sites for tax lot 200 and three home sites for tax lot 1400. In a nutshell, petitioner attempted to obtain six home site approvals by identifying for supplemental review only the two lots furthest from each other, while disregarding the parcels located between those two that he also owned and for which he had sought Measure 37 relief. However, DLCD concluded that the four tax lots for which petitioner had sought Measure 37 relief \u2014 100, 200, 900 and 1400 \u2014 were all \u201ccontiguous\u201d and that \u201cclaimant is only eligible for up to three home site approvals on the entirety of the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On appeal, petitioner asserts that he was entitled to identify specific parcels for Measure 49 review and that DLCD was required to treat as the \u201cproperty\u201d only parcels directly sharing a common border with each parcel that he had selected. As explained below, that assertion suffers from two faulty premises. First, petitioner mistakenly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>assumes that he was entitled to exclude part of the property for which he sought Measure 37 relief, namely tax lots 900 and 100, from his election of supplemental review under Measure 49. Second, petitioner espouses an unduly narrow view of the meaning of \u201ccontiguous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">\u201cProperty\u201d is defined in Measure 49 as \u201cthe private real property described in a claim and contiguous private real property that is owned by the same owner whether or not the contiguous property is described in another claim [.]\u201d ORS 195.300(20). \u201cClaim,\u201d in turn, means \u201ca written demand for compensation filed under [Measure 37].\u201d ORS 195.300(2). Thus, \u201cproperty described in a claim\u201d means property described in the owner\u2019s Measure 37 claim. Further, the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d requires that contiguous property must be considered to determine the number of home site authorizations that a claimant may receive, \u201cwhether or not\u201d the property was the subject of a Measure 37 claim. Thus, the definition of property under Measure 49 expands, not contracts, the property at issue on supplemental review beyond the property described in a Measure 37 claim. Petitioner\u2019s contrary position that he can selectively exclude property from consideration on supplemental review cannot be squared with the text of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Next, petitioner proposes an interpretation of \u201ccontiguous\u201d under which two parcels are not considered to be part of the same \u201cproperty\u201d unless they share a common border. Petitioner relies on a portion of the dictionary definition of \u201ccontiguous\u201d that refers to \u201ctouching along boundaries * * <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>492 (unabridged ed 2002). He asserts that DLCD \u201cattempts to invent a new principle of logic by arguing essentially that if 200 is contiguous to 100 and 100 is contiguous to 900; and 900 is contiguous to 1400; then 200 is contiguous to 1400.\u201d We disagree. The ordinary meaning of \u201ccontiguous\u201d also includes: \u201cNEARBY, CLOSE\u201d and \u201cCONTINUOUS, UNBROKEN, UNINTERRUPTED : touching or connected throughout &lt;the houses ... ~ contiguous all along from end to end of the town \u2014 Nathaniel Hawthorne&gt;[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The illustration of the houses is analogous to the array of the lots in the subject claim: the first house need not border the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>last house in the line in order for the line of houses to be contiguous from end to end of the town. Similarly, here, lot 200 need not border lot 1400 for those lots to form part of a contiguous whole. Because lots 200, 900, 100, and 1400 together form a contiguous whole, DLCD correctly concluded that they compose the \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of Measure 49 review in Case Number 1000209CC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Case Number 1000245CC concerns supplemental review under Measure 49 of Measure 37 claims with respect to three tax lots. Petitioner filed two Measure 49 election forms, explaining that he was submitting \u201cone with the lot designated as IN 11E Section 25 Tax Lot 700 as the subject parcel and the other with the lots designated as IN 11E Section 36 Tax Lots 200 and 300 as the subject parcels.\u201d Petitioner requested authorization for three dwellings on lot 700 and three dwellings on lots 200 and 300 together, stating that \u201cthe two lots 200 and 300 are not contiguous to Lot 700, because they touch at a point.\u201d However, on review, DLCD determined from county tax records that petitioner also owned three additional lots for which he had not made Measure 37 claims \u2014 lots 100, 600, and 700, in section 36\u2014 that DLCD concluded were contiguous to the claim property. Thus, the entire array of property that DLCD considered is shown as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>As in the companion case, petitioner attempted to identify for supplemental review under Measure 49 lots that he asserted were not \u201ccontiguous\u201d in an effort to maximize his relief. DLCD, however, determined that the contiguous property in the same ownership together included six lots. Applying the regulations in place when petitioner acquired the property, DLCD determined that, at that time, dwellings were permitted on 40-acre lots. All six of petitioner\u2019s parcels constituted 118 acres and thus would have supported two dwellings. Accordingly, DLCD concluded that petitioner was authorized to establish no additional lots or parcels and up to two dwellings on the Measure 37 claim property.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Petitioner contends that DLCD should not have considered the three parcels identified in his Measure 49 submission as \u201ccontiguous\u201d because lot 200, section 36 and lot 700, section 25, only touch at a corner. Petitioner urges that a contrary interpretation of \u201cproperty\u2019 would have an anomalous effect because he would be unable to travel from one part of his property to the other without encroaching on another owner\u2019s property. Therefore, according to petitioner, DLCD should have considered lots 200 and 300, section 36, separately from lot 700, section 25. The result of petitioner\u2019s theory would be one home site authorization for lots 200 and 300 and, to reach a total of three, two home sites for lot 700, section 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The merit of petitioner\u2019s argument is questionable. <em>See Kane v. Paulus, </em>41 Or App 455, 459, 599 P2d 1154, <em>rev den, </em>288 Or 113 (1979) (\u201cContiguity requires only that two parcels share a common boundary at some point. It does not require any particular shape.\u201d). Regardless of the merit of that argument, however, DLCD did not, in fact, conclude that lot 200, section 36, and lot 700, section 25, were contiguous because they touch at a corner. Rather, as discussed, DLCD considered all of the contiguous property that petitioner owned, including lots 100, 600, and 700, in section 36. DLCD then applied the same definition of \u201ccontiguous\u201d that it used in the companion case. As in the companion case, petitioner would require DLCD to allow him to selectively identify parcels for Measure 49 review in order to maximize his relief. But separate review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of petitioner\u2019s non-claim lots from the three additional contiguous lots in common ownership would be inconsistent with the text and context of Measure 49. Accordingly, DLCD correctly considered as the relevant \u201cproperty\u201d all six of the contiguous parcels that petitioner owned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-11\"> We note in passing that, in <em>Costco Wholesale Corp. v. City of </em>Beaverton, 343 Or 18, 161 P3d 926 (2007), the court addressed the issue of contiguity in the context of so-called \u201cisland annexation\u201d involving territory surrounded by the corporate boundaries of a city. In that case, the court construed ORS 222.750, which, we explained, provides that \u201cthe territory to he annexed must be completely enclosed by and contiguous with the corporate boundaries of the annexing city or the corporate boundaries of the annexing city and a body of water.\u201d <em>Costco Wholesale Corp. v. City of Beaverton, </em>206 Or App 380, 398, 136 P3d 1219 (2006), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>343 Or 18, 161 P3d (2007). Because of contextual differences, the statutory construction analysis in that case provides little guidance to our resolution of the issue at hand in these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b652-5\"> In this case, authorization for two home sites on lot 700, section 25, further depends on petitioner\u2019s argument in a separate assignment of error that, when he acquired the property, he was lawfully permitted to divide lot 700 into two lots, one on either side of a county road, based on the local law in effect on his date of acquisition. We reject that assignment of error without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
