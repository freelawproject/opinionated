J.</author>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">This appeal arises from a jury verdict in favor of Maureena Schmaing on her counterclaim for wrongful discharge against her employers, Daniel G. Koller, D.V.M., dba Companion Pet Clinic, NE 82nd Ave. (Koller), and Companion Pet Clinic of NE Portland, LLC (Pet Clinic).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the procedural posture on appeal is, as we shall describe, convoluted, the parties\u2019 dispute centers on issues which, as amplified below, we ultimately resolve as follows: (1) The only operative judgment, for purposes of our jurisdiction and review, is the original judgment, and not the third corrected general judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) The trial court erred in failing to name Koller, in addition to Pet Clinic, in that judgment as a judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim. (3) The trial court correctly denied the motion for directed verdict against the wrongful discharge counterclaim. (4) Koller has failed to establish that any erroneous denial of his asserted right to self-representation requires a new trial as to the counterclaim against him individually. Consistently with those conclusions, we remand to the trial court with direction to designate Koller as an additional judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim, but otherwise affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">A. <em>The parties\u2019 relationship, pleadings, and trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">From February 2002 to June 2, 2004, Schmaing worked as a .receptionist at Pet Clinic, which Roller owned and operated as a practicing licensed veterinarian. Schmaing\u2019s duties generally consisted of administrative tasks such as answering phones, greeting clients, and managing client information. While she was working at Pet Clinic, Schmaing obtained services, medications, and pet food from the clinic. During the second year of her employment, Schmaing witnessed Roller treat animals in a manner that she believed was abusive and unprofessional. According to Schmaing, Roller would sometimes get frustrated and become violent, angry, and threatening toward an animal that he was treating.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Eventually, Schmaing decided to report Roller to the proper authorities. To that end, on May 3,2004, accompanied by Miller, a former Pet Clinic employee, Schmaing met with an attorney, Burns. Burns agreed to assist Schmaing in preparing a complaint against Roller to submit to the Oregon State Veterinary Medical Examining Board (veterinary board), which is responsible for investigating complaints against veterinarians \u201calleged to be practicing in violation of law.\u201d ORS 676.160(19); ORS 676.165(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Later that month, Miller informed Roller about the meeting with Burns and Schmaing\u2019s assertions that Roller had been \u201cconducting [himself] in an unprofessional and unethical manner\u201d and that he had \u201ceuthanized an animal without the client\u2019s consent.\u201d On May 27, 2004, Roller confronted Schmaing about the meeting and the negative remarks that Miller had attributed to her. Schmaing responded that she \u201cdidn\u2019t really know what he was talking about.\u201d Roller then told Schmaing that he believed that Miller was \u201cblackmailing him\u201d and that Roller intended to create a document that Schmaing would need to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>When Schmaing returned to work the next day, Roller instructed her to sign a document that he had prepared and titled \u201cDECLARATION OF MAUREEN A SCHMAING.\u201d which consisted of 14 declarations including, as pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">\u201c9. I have never met nor provided client records from Companion Pet Clinic, NE 82d Ave. to a Ms. Susan Ford Burns, an Oregon attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201c10. I have never taken Gary Miller to Ms. Burns\u2019 office in my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201c11. To my knowledge and belief Dr. Roller has never euthanized an animal without the client\u2019s consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201c12. Gary Miller contacted me after his discharge and wanted me to participate in his plans to \u2018get Roller\u2019s license.\u2019 I declined because I have not seen Dr. Roller conduct himself in an unethical or unprofessional manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">\u00abH\u00ed Hi &amp; Hi \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">\u201cI declare under penalty of perjury, under the laws of the State of Oregon that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">(Capitalization and underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Schmaing told Roller that she did not have time to sign the declaration, but that she would take it home and \u201clook it over\u201d \u2014 which Schmaing did \u2014 but she did not sign it. On June 2, 2004, Schmaing returned to work, and Roller insisted that she sign the declaration. Schmaing refused because, among other things, the statements quoted directly above were false and, with respect to declaration number 12, Schmaing informed Roller that she had, in fact, \u201cseen him conduct himself in an unprofessional and unethical manner.\u201d Roller again instructed Schmaing to sign the declaration, and, when she refused, he immediately fired her.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">In July 2004, Schmaing submitted a complaint against Roller to the veterinary board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On January 14, 2005, Roller filed a complaint, <em>pro se, </em>against Schmaing alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>conversion and shoplifting with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to services and pet products that Schmaing had obtained and for which she had not paid. Schmaing counterclaimed against both Roller and Pet Clinic for wrongful discharge, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and failure to pay wages. Roller answered the counterclaims, again <em>pro se, </em>asserting as an affirmative defense that he was the real party in interest because Pet Clinic was defunct and \u201cha[d] been such for the majority of time\u201d that Schmaing had worked at the clinic. Pet Clinic did not separately answer the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">As noted in the opening paragraph of this opinion, one of the critical issues presented for our review pertains to Roller\u2019s asserted entitlement to represent himself. On the first day of trial, August 17, 2006, at a hearing on the parties\u2019 respective <em>in limine </em>motions, Roller informed the court during the following exchange that he intended to represent himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: I am going to be my own attorney\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Dr. Roller, you\u2019re not going to be your own attorney. The entity that is named here is Companion Pet Clinic. Dr. Roller doing business as Companion Pet Clinic, the Oregon statutes do not allow you to represent yourself in the capacity of Companion Pet Clinic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: And that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: But I\u2019m Daniel Roller being sued by them and I can represent myself, Your Honor. I\u2019m sorry\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Would you like to brief that matter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: \u2014that\u2019s been in the constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014for the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: I don\u2019t need a brief. It\u2019s constitutional. And I\u2019ll brief it, and it\u2019ll be no problem, by tomorrow you\u2019ll have a brief on it. Don\u2019t you deny me my right to defend myself. They\u2019re suing me. And you are denying me my right to defend myself * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Roller never filed the promised brief,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the trial proceeded before a jury with Ms. Roller (Roller\u2019s wife) jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>representing Roller and Pet Clinic. For the first eight days of trial, Roller never referred to, or reiterated, any request to proceed by representing himself. Then, on August 29, 2006, during the cross-examination of Schmaing, Roller sought to discharge Ms. Roller as his attorney and to represent himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: Your Honor, I\u2019m discharging my attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Then you have no one to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">I\u2019m not going to allow you to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: Yes, I \u2014 you\u2019re not allowing me to represent myself? Are you saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: We went over that at the beginning of trial, Dr. Roller. You\u2019re not qualified in this state to represent Companion Pet Clinic\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u201482nd Street, LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: That\u2019s correct. I said that if you read the pleadings\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: It does say, [\u2018]Dr. Roller doing business as Companion Pet Clinicf]; that\u2019s an issue that came up at the beginning of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: No, no, no. They\u2019re suing separately. The \u2014 [Ms. Roller is] representing the LLC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Dr. Roller, you are excused until noon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-15\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: No, Your Honor, this is \u2014 you have it wrong. I can represent myself as an individual. And the LLC has to be represented by a licensed attorney in the State of Oregon. As an individual, and I am being sued as an individual, I have a right to represent myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Dr. Roller, please step outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-17\">\u201cDR. ROLLER: Well, Your Honor, I move for a mistrial if I\u2019m not present during my defense. That\u2019s it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">The court excluded Roller from the courtroom, and Ms. Roller continued her cross-examination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Later the same day, Roller again addressed the court directly regarding an evidentiary dispute. The court admonished Roller that \u201cyou are to address the Court through counsel as we have discussed many times.\u201d Ms. Roller responded, \u201cYour Honor, I need my client to assist me in this trial. I do not have the staff here, as [Schmaing\u2019s counsel] does, and I count on my client to assist me during this trial.\u201d Roller continued to interject and to address the court directly. The court then excluded Roller \u201cfor a moment\u201d \u201cas a sanction\u201d for being \u201cdisrespectful to the Court.\u201d The court addressed Ms. Roller:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: *** I want to make clear, Ms. Roller, that you need to control your client. Your client is not the lawyer trying the case. You are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cMS. ROLLER: I understand that, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Ms. Roller continued to jointly represent Roller and Pet Clinic for the remaining three days of the trial until its conclusion on September 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">B. <em>Judgment and subsequent developments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">As noted, the threshold issue in this appeal pertains to identifying the proper object of our review. Because the trial court entered several successive judgments, including \u201ccorrected judgments,\u201d it is essential to recount that procedural sequence in inescapably arcane detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">At the conclusion of trial, a special verdict form was submitted to the jury. That form bore the caption \u201cDaniel G. Roller, DVM, dba, Companion Pet Clinic NE 82nd Ave[,] Plaintiff\u201d \u2014 that is Roller, individually \u2014 \u201cv. Maureena Schmaing, Defendant.\u201d It inexplicably did not refer to Pet Clinic as a counterclaim defendant. The jury returned a verdict for \u201cplaintiff\u201d \u2014 that is Roller, individually \u2014 on his claims for conversion and shoplifting, with damages and penalties totaling $1,026. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of \u201cdefendant\u201d (Schmaing) on her counterclaim for wrongful discharge, with damages of $64,360.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Subsequently, on June 6, 2007, the trial court entered a general judgment that included two money awards. The first money award pertained to the verdict in Roller\u2019s favor on his claims for conversion and shoplifting. That award designated Roller as the judgment creditor with Schmaing as the judgment debtor. The second money award pertained to the verdict in Schmaing\u2019s favor on her counterclaim for wrongful discharge. That award designated Schmaing as a judgment creditor with Pet Clinic as the sole judgment debtor \u2014 omitting Roller as a judgment debtor on the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In response to Schmaing\u2019s objection to that omission, the trial court, in a letter to counsel, explained that Schmaing had failed to (1) \u201cfil[e] a motion to join Dr. Roller individually as a party to the lawsuit\u201d and (2) \u201cserv[e] Dr. Roller in his individual capacity with a Summons and Counterclaims.\u201d Consequently, the court determined that Roller was not a party to the lawsuit. The court added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201c[t]he ruling denying Dr. Roller to proceed <em>pro se </em>by this Court was premised on the fact that only Companion Pet Clinic, NE 82nd Ave., and Companion Pet Clinic of NE Portland, LLC were parties in the case. Had Dr. Roller been individually joined as a party, the Court\u2019s decision would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On June 18, 2007, Pet Clinic filed a combined motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and an alternative motion for a new trial. That motion was deemed denied on July 31, 2007. On August 24, 2007, Pet Clinic filed a notice of appeal from the general judgment entered on June 6, 2007 (original general judgment).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On August 30, 2007, Schmaing filed a notice of cross-appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Meanwhile, on August 27 \u2014 that is, three days after Pet Clinic had filed its appeal from the original general judgment \u2014 the trial court filed a \u201ccorrected general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>judgment and money award,\u201d which purported to include both \u201cDaniel Koller, D.V.M., dba Companion Pet Clinic of NE Portland, LLC\u201d and \u201cCompanion Pet Clinic of NE Portland, LLC\u201d as judgment debtors. On August 30, the trial court filed a \u201csecond corrected general judgment and money award,\u201d which corrected the trial court\u2019s error in the first corrected judgment in naming \u201cDaniel Koller, D.V.M., dba Companion Pet Clinic of NE Portland, LLC\u201d as a judgment debtor instead of \u201cDaniel Koller, D.V.M., dba Companion Pet Clinic, NE 82nd Ave.\u201d Both of those judgments were entered on August 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">On September 26, 2007, Koller and Pet Clinic filed a notice of appeal and an amended notice of appeal, respectively, from those modified judgments. Schmaing also filed an amended notice of cross-appeal from those modified judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On October 31, 2007, Pet Clinic and Koller filed a joint motion for a summary determination of appealability. This court determined that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter both the first and second corrected judgments under ORCP 71 A, because the modification in both of those <em>judgments </em>\u2014 viz., to add Koller as a judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim \u2014 was substantive, rather than merely a correction of a \u201cclerical mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacated those judgments and dismissed the corresponding appeals and cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In April 2008 \u2014 with the appeal from the original judgment still pending \u2014 Schmaing filed a motion for relief from the original judgment, pursuant to ORCP 71 B(l) and ORCP 71 C. Koller opposed those motions. The trial court granted Schmaing\u2019s ORCP 71 C motion and ordered that Koller be included as a judgment debtor in the judgment in Schmaing\u2019s favor for wrongful discharge. The court determined that, notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal, ORCP 71 C<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provided jurisdiction for the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to exercise its \u201cinherent authority\u201d to correct the general judgment, so long as it did so for \u201cgood and sufficient reasons within a reasonable period of time.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">By way of further explanation of its allowance of relief under ORCP 71 C, the trial court stated that it had \u201cmistakenly omitted Koller from that portion of the judgment resolving Schmaing\u2019s counterclaims\u201d because it had \u201coverlooked\u201d Schmaing\u2019s proof of service of her responsive pleading, including the wrongful discharge counterclaim, on Koller. In addition, after expressing its \u201cconcern\u201d that its denial of Koller\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>could result in a remand for a new trial, because the expressed basis of that <em>denial </em>\u2014 viz., that Koller individually was not a party to the litigation \u2014 was inaccurate, the court posited additional rationales for, and justifications of, that ruling. In particular, the court asserted that \u201cKoller\u2019s demeanor in the courtroom * * * suggested that his participation in the role of counsel could be disruptive to the proceedings,\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201cMs. Koller represented the plaintiff and both counterclaim defendants throughout the trial. The interests of the two counterclaim defendants were aligned for all purposes with respect to all claims, defenses and counterclaims. Koller assisted in the defense of Schmaing\u2019s counterclaims and in the prosecution of his theft claim against Schmaing by providing questions to his counsel for direct and cross examination of witnesses and by suggesting factual and legal arguments to her during the proceedings. From time to time, the court also allowed Koller to address the court directly. Koller\u2019s counsel, Ms. Koller, more than adequately protected the interests of both of her clients throughout the trial. A complete review of the trial record shows that Koller was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s order denying his motion to represent his own interests and to defend his professional reputation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Consistently with its allowance of relief under ORCP 71 C, the trial court entered the third corrected general judgment \u2014 the last of the succession of \u201ccorrected judgments\u201d \u2014 naming Koller, as well as Pet Clinic, as a judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim. The parties filed timely amended notices of appeal from that third corrected general judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Notwithstanding its procedurally contorted posture, the disposition of this appeal depends on the resolution of four interrelated questions: <em>First, </em>did the trial court lack jurisdiction to enter the third corrected judgment naming Koller as a judgment debtor? <em>Second, </em>if so, did the court err in failing to name Koller as a judgment debtor in the original judgment? <em>Third, </em>did the court err in denying Pet Clinic and Koller\u2019s motion for directed verdict against the wrongful discharge counterclaim? <em>Fourth, </em>if the court did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict, is Koller nevertheless entitled to a new trial as to the wrongful discharge counterclaim against him individually because the trial court erroneously precluded him from representing himself?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In particular, Koller and Pet Clinic jointly contend that the trial court erred in granting Schmaing\u2019s ORCP 71 C motion, and, consequently, entering the third corrected general judgment, because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to substantively modify the original judgment while an appeal from that judgment was pending. They further jointly contend that the court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict against Schmaing\u2019s wrongful discharge claim, because Schmaing\u2019s actions did not involve an \u201cimportant public duty.\u201d Finally, in addition to those joint contentions, Koller asserts individually that the court erred in precluding him from representing himself after he expressed his determination to discharge his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Schmaing remonstrates that Koller is properly a judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim either because the trial court correctly entered the third corrected judgment so naming him<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or because the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>erred by failing to include Roller as a judgment debtor in the original judgment (the subject of her cross-appeal). Schmaing further contends that the directed verdict was properly denied because good faith reporting of professional misconduct is an \u201cimportant public duty.\u201d Finally, with respect to Roller\u2019s asserted entitlement to self-representation, Schmaing contends that the trial court properly exercised its discretion to deny Roller\u2019s request and that, even if the denial was erroneous, it does not constitute reversible error because Roller failed to demonstrate cognizable prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">As amplified below, we first conclude that the trial court lacked \u201cinherent authority\u201d under ORCP 71 C to enter the third corrected judgment while the appeal from the original judgment was pending before this court. Accordingly, we vacate the third \u201ccorrected general judgment\u201d and address the challenges pertaining to the original general judgment. With respect to the original judgment, we conclude that: (1) The trial court erred in failing to designate Roller as a judgment debtor on Schmaing\u2019s wrongful discharge counterclaim. (2) The trial court did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict on Schmaing\u2019s wrongful discharge counterclaim, because good faith reporting of professional misconduct is an \u201cimportant public duty.\u201d And (3) the trial court\u2019s denial of Roller\u2019s requests to discharge his attorney and proceed <em>pro se </em>was not reversible error because, regardless of whether the court erred, Roller has failed to identify any cognizable prejudice with respect to the defense of the counterclaim warranting reversal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">A. <em>Roller\u2019s status as judgment debtor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We begin with the propriety of the third corrected general judgment because that is, legally and practically, the necessary point of departure. Once entered, that judgment remains the \u201cstatement of the court\u2019s decision in the case and governs the rights and obligations of the parties that are subject to the judgment\u201d unless and until it is set aside. ORS 18.082.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>For his part, Roller does not dispute that he was properly named and served as a counterclaim defendant on the wrongful discharge counterclaim or that the jury\u2019s special verdict on that counterclaim did not include him individually. Rather, Roller contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction under ORCP 71 C to enter the third corrected judgment while the appeal from the original judgment was pending.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">ORS 19.270 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c(1) The Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of the cause when the notice of appeal has been served and filed as provided in ORS 19.240, 19.250 and 19.255. The trial court may exercise those powers in connection with the appeal as are conferred by law, and retains jurisdiction in the matter for the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c(a) Deciding requests for attorney fees, costs and disbursements or expenses pursuant to ORCP 68 or other provision of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201c(b) Enforcing the judgment, subject to any stay of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201c(c) Deciding a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under ORCP 63.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">\u201c(d) Deciding a motion for new trial under ORCP 64.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">\u201c(e) <em>Deciding a motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 B.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201c(5) Notwithstanding the filing of a notice of appeal, the trial court has jurisdiction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">\u201c(a) <em>To enter an order or supplemental judgment under </em>ORCP71U\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Thus, under ORS 19.270, upon the filing of a notice of appeal, jurisdiction of the cause rests in the appellate court, with the trial court retaining limited jurisdiction with respect to precisely identified matters. As pertinent here, the trial court \u201cretains\u201d limited jurisdiction to decide \u201ca motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 B,\u201d ORS 19.270(l)(e),and jurisdiction \u201c[t]o enter an order or supplemental judgment under ORCP 71,\u201d ORS 19.270(5)(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Within the \u201cretained\u201d jurisdiction described in ORS 19.270, ORCP 71, in turn, narrowly circumscribes a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to vacate or correct a judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal. ORCP 71 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cA Clerical mistakes. <em>Clerical mistakes </em>in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record and errors therein <em>arising from oversight or omission </em>may be corrected by the court at any time on its own motion or on the motion of any party and after such notice to all parties who have appeared, if any, as the court orders. <em>During the pendency of an appeal, a judgment may be corrected as provided in subsection (2) of section B of this rule.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201cB Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly discovered evidence, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201cB(l) By motion. On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or such party\u2019s legal representative from a judgment for the following reasons: (a) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ***.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cB(2) When appeal pending. <em>A motion under sections A or B may be filed with and decided by the trial court during the time an appeal from a judgment is pending before an appellate court. </em>The moving party shall serve a copy of the motion on the appellate court. The moving party shall file a copy of the trial court\u2019s order in the appellate court within seven days of the date of the trial court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Any necessary modification of the appeal required by the court order shall be pursuant to rule of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">\u201cC Relief from judgment by other means. This rule does not limit the inherent power of a court to modify a judgment within a reasonable time, or the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, or the power of a court to grant relief to a defendant under Rule 7 D(6)(f), or the power of a court to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">(Boldface in original; emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In sum, once a notice of appeal is filed, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to set aside or \u201ccorrect\u201d a general judgment is extremely limited. In particular, only ORCP 71 B \u2014 and ORCP 71 A, by derivative reference to ORCP 71 B\u2014 confer such authority and, concomitantly, jurisdiction. Critically, unlike ORCP 71A and ORCP 71 B(2), ORCP 71 C includes no reference to \u201ccorrection\u201d or modification of a judgment during the pendency of an appeal. We must conclude that that difference is not a matter of legislative inadvertence, but rather one of design. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (instructing that, in construing a statute, the court is \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted\u201d); <em>see also PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 614, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (\u201cThe legislature knows how to include qualifying language in a statute when it wants to do so.\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Because \u201ccorrection\u201d of a judgment pursuant to ORCP 71 C during the pendency of an appeal is not encompassed within a trial court\u2019s retained jurisdiction under ORCP 19.270, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the third corrected general judgment pursuant to ORCP 71 C. Accordingly, we vacate the third corrected general judgment, which names Roller as a judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Nevertheless, the original judgment remains\u2014 and, with it, Schmaing\u2019s cross-appeal from that judgment, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s failure to name Roller in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that judgment as a judgment debtor. Roller responds that Schmaing invited the asserted error \u201cby remaining silent rather than correcting the trial court\u2019s misunderstanding when the issue arose in the context of Dr. Roller\u2019s assertion of his right of self-representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We reject out of hand Roller\u2019s invocation of \u201cinvited error.\u201d As Schmaing emphasizes, her pleadings explicitly identified Roller, individually, as a counterclaim defendant, and her counsel never disputed Roller\u2019s statements to the court that he, individually, was a counterclaim defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">With respect to the merits of the trial court\u2019s omission of Roller as a judgment debtor, that failure was predicated on what the court later acknowledged was an erroneous understanding that Roller was not properly joined as a party to the action \u2014 when, in fact, Roller was indisputably a party to the action below, both as plaintiff and counterclaim defendant. Indeed, Roller repeatedly acknowledged that fact at trial. <em>See </em>254 Or App at 121, 122 (\u201cI\u2019m Daniel Roller being sued by them.\u201d *** \u201cI am being sued as an individual.\u201d). Consequently, the trial court erred in failing to name Roller as a judgment debtor in the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Nevertheless, whether that error was harmless depends on the disposition of both defendants\u2019 contention that the court erred in denying the motion for directed verdict against the wrongful discharge claim. Further, even if the motion for directed verdict was properly denied, if Roller is correct that the trial court committed reversible error in precluding him from representing himself, he would be entitled to a new trial with respect to the counterclaim against him individually. Accordingly, we proceed to each of those matters in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">B. <em>Denial of the directed verdict: \u201cImportant public duty \u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Roller and Pet Clinic assert that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict against [Schmaing\u2019s] wrongful discharge [counter] claim because Schmaing\u2019s actions did not involve fulfilling any important public duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Absent a contrary agreement, an employer may discharge an employee \u201cat any time for any reason.\u201d <em>Patton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>v. J. C. Penney Co., </em>301 Or 117, 120, 719 P2d 854 (1986). Notwithstanding that general rule, a discharged employee may recover under the common-law tort of wrongful discharge under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201c(1) [W]hen the discharge is for exercising a job-related right that reflects an important public policy, <em>see, e.g., Brown v. Transcon Lines, </em>284 Or 597,588 P2d 1087 (1978) (employee unlawfully discharged for filing workers\u2019 compensation claim); or (2) when the discharge is for fulfilling some important public duty, <em>see, e.g., Delaney v. Taco Time Int\u2019l, </em>297 Or 10, 681 P2d 114 (1984) (employee discharged for refusing to defame another employee); <em>Nees v. Hocks, </em>272 Or 210, 536 P2d 512 (1975) (employee discharged for serving on jury).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Babick v. Oregon Arena Corp., </em>333 Or 401, 407, 40 P3d 1059 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In determining whether an employee was discharged for fulfilling an important public duty, we must <em>\u201cfind </em>a public duty, not create one, using constitutional and statutory provisions and case law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407-08 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). The legal source of the purported public duty must either \u201c(1) specifically encourage or require a particular action or (2) otherwise demonstrate that such action enjoys high social value.\u201d <em>Love v. Polk County Fire District, </em>209 Or App 474, 486, 149 P3d 199 (2006) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">We have previously recognized that, when an employee reports, or prepares to report, his or her employer to the proper authorities for purported violations, the employee fulfills an important public duty by such \u201cwhistleblowing.\u201d For example, in <em>McQuary v. Bel Air Convalescent Home, Inc., </em>69 Or App 107, 109-11, 684 P2d 21, <em>rev den, </em>298 Or 37 (1984), we concluded that the plaintiff had a legally sufficient \u201cpotential wrongful discharge claim\u201d where she had been discharged after she had threatened to report to the Health Division what she believed to be an instance of staff abuse of a patient in the defendant\u2019s nursing home. In finding an important public duty, we explained that \u201c[t]he Health Division is charged with protecting patients\u2019 rights\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>under statute and that \u201ca report to it would be a societal obligation of a person who knows of violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110; <em>see also id. </em>at 111 n 5 (noting that \u201c[t]here is no reason that an employe\u2019s protection should depend on whether the employer acts before or after the employe is able to file a complaint\u201d); <em>Huber v. Dept. of Education, </em>235 Or App 230, 244, 244 n 5, 230 P3d 937 (2010) (concluding that \u201creporting of potentially dangerous substandard nursing practices to the [Oregon State Board of Nursing] is an important public duty\u201d and the fact that the employee was terminated before he filed a complaint did not affect our analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">More recently, in <em>Love, </em>the plaintiff appealed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against her wrongful discharge claim. 209 Or App 474. We reversed and remanded, holding that the plaintiff employee had raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff was discharged for whistleblowing about the defendant fire district\u2019s alleged cover-up during a federal investigation following a fatal accident. <em>Id. </em>at 496. In that context, we explained that \u201cexposing certain statutory or regulatory violations, including health and safety violations, is sufficiently \u2018important\u2019 that, under certain conditions, an employee who does so is protected from being discharged for that conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Conversely, where the law does not specifically encourage reporting, or demonstrate its high social value, no important public duty to report exists. For example, in <em>Handam v. Wilsonville Holiday Partners, LLC, </em>the plaintiff hotel employee was discharged after reporting to his supervisor that he believed that certain hotel employees had violated Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) rules by drinking on shift and that the same coworkers might also have been in violation of immigration laws. 225 Or App 442, 201 P3d 920 (2009), <em>vac\u2019d and rent\u2019d, </em>347 Or 533, 225 P3d 43, <em>adh\u2019d to on remand, </em>235 Or App 688, 234 P3d 133, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 171 (2010). We determined that the plaintiff\u2019s actions did not fulfill an important public duty because the OLCC statutes \u201csay nothing about reporting OLCC violations by coworkers,\u201d much less encourage such reporting. 225 Or App at 451. We then distinguished the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d line of wrongful discharge cases, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Love, </em>because there was no evidence that the purported OLCC violations that the plaintiff reported \u201cpresented a significant concern to public health and safety.\u201d <em>Handam, </em>225 Or App at 451-52. We reached the same conclusion with respect to the report of possible immigration violations. <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The Supreme Court applied a similar analysis, and came to a similar result, in a subsequent case, <em>Lamson v. Crater Lake Motors, Inc., </em>346 Or 628, 630, 216 P3d 852 (2009).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There, the defendant car dealership had hired an outside sales firm to conduct a special sales event, during which the plaintiff car sales manager observed what he believed to be unethical sales tactics by the outside firm. <em>Id. </em>at 631. He subsequently complained to the defendant\u2019s general manager about the purported misconduct. <em>Id. </em>When the defendant later brought the same firm back to run another sales event, the plaintiff refused to participate and was subsequently fired. <em>Id. </em>at 633. The plaintiff filed a wrongful discharge claim, asserting that his actions had served the public interest in preventing deceptive sales practices. <em>Id. </em>at 638. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that he had fulfilled an important public duty and had been fired for (1) \u201crefusing a directive to violate state [unlawful business and trade practices statutes and regulations]\u201d and (2) <em>\u201ccomplaining to management </em>about what he reasonably believed to be * * * illegal and unethical sales tactics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">After the jury returned a verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the trial court entered a judgment, and the employer appealed. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed, rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s whistleblowing contention. In so holding, the Court emphasized that (a) the plaintiff \u201cdid not report to [the] defendant\u2019s management *** that [the] defendant corporation was itself engaged in such practices,\u201d and (b) the plaintiff \u201cdid not report the unlawful trade practices of [the outside firm] to any <em>entity with authority to take </em>action\u201d to enforce trade practice laws and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 640 (emphasis added). Thus, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Love, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>plaintiff in <em>Lamson </em>had not threatened to blow the whistle on the <em>employer </em>\u2014 and, unlike the plaintiff in <em>McQuary, </em>had not threatened to report purported violations to the <em>appropriate regulatory authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We apply those principles to this case. Schmaing contends that she was discharged for fulfilling two different important public duties: (1) refusing to defame Miller by refusing to the sign the false declaration and (2) preparing to report to the veterinary board her good-faith belief that Roller had violated veterinary professional standards. Roller and Pet Clinic dispute that Schmaing\u2019s conduct in <em>either </em>respect fulfilled an important public duty \u2014 but acknowledge that, to prevail on appeal, they must demonstrate that <em>neither </em>did so. Thus, if we agree with Schmaing as to the latter, we need not address the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Roller and Pet Clinic concede that reporting animal abuse is an important public duty; however, they argue that that duty is restricted to veterinary professionals, because the statutes that require such reporting expressly apply exclusively to veterinarians and veterinary technicians. <em>See </em>ORS 686.445; ORS 686.555.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Roller and Pet Clinic argue that those statutes reflect a legislative decision that only persons trained in treating animals bear a duty to report animal abuse. Roller and Pet Clinic assert that, as a member of the public, \u201cthe only statutes relevant to Schmaing\u2019s actions were the general criminal prohibitions against animal abuse,\u201d and those statutes do not mention public reporting. <em>See </em>ORS 167.310 - 167.390 (criminal offenses against animals).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">For her part, while recognizing that reporting animal abuse is an important public duty, Schmaing relies primarily on a different important public <em>duty </em>\u2014 viz., reporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>purported professional misconduct to the veterinary board. Schmaing asserts that professional licensing and regulatory statutes manifest legislative concern that veterinarians be held to common professional and ethical standards and \u2014 of particular significance here \u2014 legislative recognition of the role the public plays in detecting and reporting professional misconduct. Specifically, ORS 676.165 provides that the veterinary board shall investigate complaints made against a licensed veterinarian. ORS 676.170 provides civil immunity for reporters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">\u201cA <em>person </em>who reports or supplies information in <em>good faith </em>to a health professional regulatory board or to a committee reporting to a health professional regulatory board shall be immune from an action for civil damages as a result thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See also </em>ORS 676.160(19) (defining \u201chealth professional regulatory board\u201d to include the Oregon State Veterinary Medical Examining Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">As Schmaing points out, civil immunity under ORS 676.170 broadly applies to <em>any person </em>who makes a <em>good faith </em>report to a health professional regulatory board. <em>Cf. Love, </em>209 Or App at 491-92 (observing that the public employee whistleblowing statute, ORS 659A.203(b), protects only public employees whose disclosures are based on reasonable belief of misconduct). That broad statutory grant of immunity demonstrates that the legislature specifically intended to encourage good-faith public reporting of healthcare professional misconduct to the appropriate regulatory board, in this case the veterinary board. <em>See Love, </em>209 Or App at 492 (\u201c[T]he \u2018important public duty\u2019 doctrine is innately intertwined with the legislative expression of policy choices in statutes.\u201d); <em>see also Huber, </em>235 Or App at 242-43 (\u201cIn the absence of a mandatory reporting requirement, an employee can demonstrate that an important public duty exists by citing statutes or other authority indicating legislative policies to promote the reporting of violations and prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report such violations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We conclude that directly applicable statutes unambiguously manifest a \u201clegislative *** policy choice\u201d of promoting, and protecting, good-faith public reporting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>health professional misconduct to the appropriate health professional regulatory board. Thus, this case is akin to <em>Love </em>and <em>McQuary </em>\u2014 and materially distinguishable from <em>Handam </em>and <em>Lamson. </em>Specifically, here, Schmaing adduced evidence from which the jury could have found that she was discharged for preparing to report to the veterinary board her good-faith allegations of her employer\u2019s mistreatment of animals in his care. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Handam </em>and <em>Lansom, </em>Schmaing did not complain only to Roller (her employer) about what she considered to be his \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cunprofessional\u201d conduct; rather, she also spoke with an attorney to prepare a complaint about her employer to the appropriate regulatory authority, the veterinary board. We conclude that Schmaing adduced sufficient proof from which the jury could find that she was discharged for fulfilling an important public duty. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">C. <em>Roller\u2019s asserted right of self-representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Roller contends that, if we sustain Schmaing\u2019s cross-appeal, then we must also reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial on the wrongful discharge counterclaim as to Roller individually, because \u201c[i]t would be utterly inconsistent to deny Dr. Roller his right to self-representation but also make him a judgment debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We pause to slice the Gordian knot of one final procedural complication.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Our preceding disposition of the parties\u2019 arguments regarding whether and how Roller is properly a judgment debtor on the counterclaim judgment in Schmaing\u2019s favor places this issue in an unusual posture. The only judgment from which Roller has appealed and raised assignments of error (including the assignment pertaining to preclusion of self-representation) is the third corrected general judgment \u2014 which we have vacated. Roller, quite reasonably, did not appeal from the original judgment, because he was not named as a judgment debtor in that judgment \u2014 though, as we have now concluded, he should have been so named.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Given that juxtaposition, we could reason that Roller\u2019s assignment of error pertaining to preclusion of self-representation is not cognizable in this posture and, consequently, simply remand for entry of a judgment naming Roller as a judgment debtor \u2014 a judgment from which Roller could then appeal, assigning as error the trial court\u2019s preclusion of self-representation. Such a disposition would be \u201ctechnically\u201d defensible \u2014 and, perhaps, even \u201ctechnically\u201d correct \u2014 but it would be practically absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Whenever possible, application of procedural rules should not thwart the practical and prudential purposes underlying those rules. Form should not trump function. Here, there is no question that the parties have a concrete and continuing dispute as to whether Roller individually is entitled to a new trial on the wrongful discharge counterclaim. Further, to defer determination of that dispute \u2014 which, certainly would be revived by way of yet another appeal following entry of judgment on remand\u2014 would pointlessly prolong already protracted litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The best, pragmatic approach is to treat Roller\u2019s \u201cpreclusion of self-representation\u201d assignment of error raised in the context of his appeal from the third corrected general judgment as functionally a cross-assignment of error proffered in response to Schmaing\u2019s cross-appeal from the original judgment. That characterization is appropriate in that Roller\u2019s assignment of error embodies a contention that, if Schmaing is correct (as she is) that Roller is a judgment debtor on the counterclaim, the proper appellate disposition is not to remand with instructions to enter a judgment naming Roller as a judgment debtor but, instead, to remand for a new trial as to Roller individually on the wrongful discharge counterclaim. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.57(2)(b) (\u201cA cross-assignment of error is appropriate *** [i]f the relief sought by the appellant were to be granted, respondent would desire reversal or modification of an intermediate ruling of the trial court.\u201d). We so proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Roller, referring to his colloquy with the trial court on both August 17 and August 29, 2006, <em>see </em>254 Or App at 121-23, contends that the court erroneously precluded him from representing himself. Roller\u2019s argument in that regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>is, frankly, conclusory. The sole source he invokes for his asserted entitlement of self-representation is ORS 9.320, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\u201cAny action, suit, or proceeding may be prosecuted or defended by a party in person, or by attorney, except that the state or a corporation appears by attorney in all cases, unless otherwise specifically provided by law. Where a party appears by attorney, the written proceedings must be in the name of the attorney, who is the sole representative of the client of the attorney as between the client and the adverse party, except as provided in ORS 9.310.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Beyond that, Roller acknowledges that, because he continued, in fact, to be represented by counsel throughout the trial, he cannot demonstrate actual, discrete prejudice from the court\u2019s action. He does not, for example, identify any manner in which his <em>pro se </em>defense of the wrongful discharge counterclaim would have <em>differed </em>\u2014 e.g., any evidence he would have proffered, any line of examination or cross- examination he would have pursued, any theory of defense he would have developed, or any argument he would have presented \u2014 from that presented by Ms. Roller on behalf of both Roller and Pet Clinic. Nor does he point to any differentiation between his interests and those of Pet Clinic with respect to that defense. Rather, he posits that requiring a showing of identifiable prejudice \u201cwould not make sense\u201d because it would \u201ceffectively eviscerate\u201d the right of self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Schmaing contends that Roller\u2019s argument regarding the court\u2019s denial of his first, August 17, request to represent himself is not preserved because, on that occasion, the trial court offered Roller \u201cthe opportunity to file a brief in aid of further consideration of the issue,\u201d to which Roller responded that he would file a brief by the next day \u2014 but never did and, indeed, did not pursue the matter further until August 29. <em>See </em>254 Or App at 121-23. Schmaing contends that the trial court could reasonably have understood Roller\u2019s conduct (or inaction) in that regard to evince an abandonment of his initial request and, thus, a waiver of \u201cany claim of error\u201d based on the August 17 colloquy. Be that as it may, it is apparent \u2014 as Schmaing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>concedes \u2014 that Roller <em>did </em>preserve error with respect to the denial of his request on August 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">On the merits, Schmaing does not dispute that ORS 9.320 confers at least an abstract entitlement to self-representation. However, Schmaing contends that that entitlement is not absolute and is qualified by practical and prudential considerations, including the timing of the party\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>and potential disruption of the judicial process. In that regard, Schmaing asserts that the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas based on appropriate considerations and was entirely correct,\u201d because \u201cRoller\u2019s request was too little and too late,\u201d and \u201cthe trial court was well within its discretion to prevent the kind of disruption that would flow from Roller\u2019s late demand\u201d to represent himself. In any event, Schmaing argues, ORS 19.415(2) requires a showing that the alleged error was prejudicial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We conclude that, in the August 29 colloquy, the trial court did erroneously preclude Roller from representing himself. The sole justification the court expressed at that time was that Roller personally was not a party to the litigation (specifically, with respect to the counterclaims) \u2014 a rationale that was incorrect. Further, to the extent that the trial court subsequently \u2014 indeed, nearly two years later, in the context of its order allowing ORCP 71 C relief\u2014 proffered additional reasons for its ruling, <em>e.g., </em>potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>disruption of proceedings, those concerns are, with respect, not substantiated in the appellate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">But not all error is reversible error. Rather, ORS 19.415(2) provides that \u201c[n]o judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\u201d See <em>Shoup v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>335 Or 164, 174, 61 P3d 928 (2003) (\u201cIn every case, the appellate courts must adhere to the limitation of ORS 19.415(2) and reverse or modify a judgment only if it can be determined from the record that the error \u2018substantially affect [ed] the rights of a party.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 173-74 (explaining that ORS 19.415(2) \u201cplaces the burden to make a record that demonstrates prejudicial error on whichever party loses in the trial court and then seeks reversal or modification of the judgment on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We agree with Roller that the statutory right of self-representation is an important right. But we cannot (at least in civil litigation) endorse his proposition that, \u201c[a] party who is erroneously forced to use a retained attorney should not then have to show prejudice in order to obtain a reversal of the resulting judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">It is tempting, to be sure, to embrace that proposition. But however attractive, and however phrased, it reduces to structural error, a construct that is inapposite under Oregon law. <em>See Ryan v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 278, 295, 108 P3d 1127, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 874 (2005) (\u201c[Structural error is a doctrine that originated in federal criminal cases and * * * has not been adopted by this court as an aspect of Oregon law[.]\u201d); <em>State v. Arreola, </em>250 Or App 496, 501, 281 P3d 634 (2012) (\u201cOregon courts do not recognize structural error, so the erroneous admission of a medical diagnosis does not necessarily require reversal in every case.\u201d); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>216 Or App 226, 232, 173 P3d 150 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 391 (2008), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>228 Or App 365, 208 P3d 523 (2009) (\u201c[T]he Oregon Supreme Court has repeatedly admonished that the concept of \u2018structural error\u2019 is inapposite to Oregon law.\u201d); <em>see also Hayward v. Belleque, </em>248 Or App 141, 165, 273 P3d 926 (2012) (\u201cThe court will not presume prejudice in the absence of proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Because Roller failed to establish cognizable prejudice resulting from the trial court\u2019s ruling, that ruling does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>not warrant a remand for a new trial on the wrongful discharge counterclaim against Koller individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The trial court lacked jurisdiction under ORCP 71 C to enter the third corrected general judgment during the pendency of the appeal from the original judgment. The trial court erred in failing to designate Koller as a judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim in the original judgment. The trial court correctly denied the motion for a directed verdict against Schmaing\u2019s wrongful discharge counterclaim. The trial court\u2019s denial of Roller's request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In A139232, affirmed. In A136633, on appeal of third corrected general judgment, vacated; on appeal and cross-appeal of original general judgment, affirmed on appeal and remanded on cross-appeal with instructions to designate Koller as an additional judgment debtor on the wrongful discharge counterclaim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-5\"> Pet Clinic was dissolved in 2005, and, at that point, Koller continued to operate the clinic as a sole proprietorship. For reasons that will become apparent, it is important that we distinguish between Koller as a sole proprietor and Pet Clinic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\"> On June 6, 2007, the trial court entered a general judgment and money award, and we will refer to that judgment throughout this opinion as the \u201coriginal general judgment.\u201d The trial court subsequently entered a \u201cCorrected General Judgment\u201d and a \u201cSecond Corrected General Judgment,\u201d which have been vacated and are not at issue on this appeal. On September 11,2008, the trial court entered a \u201cCorrected* General Judgment,\u201d which we will refer to as the \u201cthird corrected general judgment\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> Koller and Pet Clinic have jointly raised other matters as assignments of error, which we have considered and reject without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Koller filed an additional appeal from an order of garnishment, A139232, which has been consolidated with the principal appeal, A136633. In briefing and argument, Koller has raised no contentions pertaining to that matter. Thus, we deem his appeal in A139232 to have been abandoned and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\"> The description of historical facts in the following summary is stated consistently with our review of the trial court\u2019s denial of the directed verdict motion against the wrongful discharge counterclaim. <em>See Schoen v.

To be sure, there is an abundance of authority in the criminal realm, including, most prominently, the \u201cMeyrick\u201d genre of cases, predicated on <em>State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 831 P2d 666 (1992), pertaining to advising criminal defendants regarding waiver of the constitutional right of representation by counsel in criminal proceedings. Only one of those cases, <em>State v. Davis, </em>110 Or App 358, 822 P2d 736 (1991) \u2014 which was predicated, in part, on our decision in <em>Meyrick, </em>106 Or App 682, 809 P2d 710 (1991), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>313 Or 125, 831 P2d 666 (1992) \u2014 appears to address a denial of a represented criminal defendant\u2019s request (failing the appointment of substituted counsel) to represent himself. In <em>Davis, </em>we observed that \u201c[a] criminal defendant has a constitutional right to waive counsel and to represent himself[,]\u201d but noted that \u201cthat right is not absolute\u201d and could be qualified by, <em>inter alia, </em>concerns about disruption of the judicial process. 110 Or App at 360.
