Defendant asserts that we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to ORS 138.050(l)(a). The state asserts that we do not. As explained below, we conclude that the state is correct; accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The pertinent facts are procedural and not in dispute. Defendant was charged with DUII in January of 2006 and petitioned to enter diversion. On March 1,2006, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s petition, pursuant to which defendant made a plea of no contest to the DUII charge. The diversion and plea agreement provided that defendant understood that, if he fully complied with the conditions of the diversion agreement, the court would dismiss the charge with prejudice pursuant to ORS 813.250, but that, if defendant failed to comply with the agreement within the diversion period, the court would enter a judgment of conviction based on defendant\u2019s plea. Conditions of the diversion agreement required defendant to participate in treatment and prohibited him from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In March 2007, the court extended the diversion period for 180 days to allow defendant to complete his required treatment. On August 22, 2007, defense counsel filed a motion to terminate diversion, asserting that defendant had successfully completed the diversion requirements. The state did not oppose that motion, so the trial court granted it on September 11, 2007, and the court entered an order dismissing the charge. Shortly thereafter, however, the state discovered that defendant had, in fact, driven under the influence of intoxicants on August 17,2007, approximately a week before he had filed his motion to terminate diversion. The state moved to set aside the judgment dismissing the DUII charge and to terminate defendant\u2019s diversion based on his violation of the diversion agreement. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion on November 19,2007, indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>that it was vacating the judgment due to \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cmisrepresentation by defendant.\u201d On December 15, 2007, the court issued a bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. Defendant was apprehended on the warrant in April 2010 and, at that point, moved to set aside the November 2007 order vacating the September 2007 judgment of dismissal. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, entered a judgment of conviction based on defendant\u2019s original no contest plea, and imposed a sentence of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Defendant appeals that judgment pursuant to ORS 138.050. Defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to set aside the November 2007 order vacating the prior judgment, and he asks this court to \u201creverse his conviction and sentence and remand for entry of an order dismissing the DUII charge.\u201d Defendant recognizes, however, that in order to do so, we must first address whether this appeal is cognizable under ORS 138.050, which limits a defendant\u2019s appeal in situations where a defendant has entered a plea of guilty or no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">ORS 138.050 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 135.335,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] a defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may take an appeal from a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053 only when the defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">\u201c(3) On appeal under subsection (1) of this section, the appellate court shall consider only whether the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Defendant argues that the \u201cjudgment contains two dispositions that exceed the maximum allowable by law\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the DUII conviction and the sentence \u2014 because the trial court had no authority to impose either after the case had been dismissed.\u201d Thus, defendant posits that ORS 138.050 allows him to appeal, and allows this court to review a challenge to, his conviction. As explained below, neither the text of the pertinent statutes when read in context, nor the prior opinions of the appellate courts, ultimately support defendant\u2019s reading of ORS 138.050.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Defendant\u2019s position rests on the assumption that his conviction is a \u201cdisposition,\u201d as that term is used in ORS 138.050(1), and the related assumption that a conviction that is legally flawed necessarily is one that \u201cexceeds the maximum allowable by law.\u201d The term \u201cdisposition,\u201d as used in this context, is a legal term of art that can mean, broadly speaking, \u201c[a] final settlement or determination &lt;the court\u2019s disposition of the case&gt;.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>505 (8th ed 2004). Under that broad definition, defendant\u2019s proposition \u2014 that a conviction is a disposition \u2014 could be correct. However, ORS 138.050(1) refers to \u201cdisposition\u201d in the context of orders or judgments \u201cdescribed in ORS 138.053.\u201d ORS 138.053, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201c(1) A judgment, or order of a court, if the order is imposed after judgment, is subject to the appeal provisions and limitations on review under ORS 138.040 and 138.050 if the <em>disposition </em>includes any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201c(a) Imposition of a sentence on conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201c(b) Suspension of imposition or execution of any part of a sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201c(c) Extension of a period of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201c(d) Imposition or modification of a condition of probation or of sentence suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">\u201c(e) Imposition or execution of a sentence upon revocation of probation or sentence suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">\u201c(2) A disposition described under subsection (1) of this section is not subject to appeal after the expiration of the time specified in ORS 138.071 for appealing from the judgment or order imposing it, except as may be provided in ORS 138.510 to 138.680.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201c(3) Notwithstanding ORS 138.040 and 138.050, upon an appeal from a judgment or order described in subsection (l)(c) to (e) of this section, the appellate court may review the order that extended the period of the defendant\u2019s probation, imposed or modified a condition of the defendant\u2019s probation or sentence suspension or revoked the defendant\u2019s probation or sentence suspension if the defendant shows a colorable claim of error in the proceeding from which the appeal is taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">(Emphasis added.) That statute, in short, provides that a disposition \u201cincludes\u201d various matters pertaining to a sentence or probation. It refers to the disposition in conjunction with \u201cthe appeal provisions and limitations on review under ORS 138.040 and 138.050.\u201d As noted, ORS 138.050 allows appeal and review if the \u201cdisposition\u201d is one that exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is cruel and unusual. ORS 138.040, by contrast, authorizes the appellate court not only to review dispositions that exceed the maximum allowable by law or are cruel and unusual, ORS 138.040(l)(b), but also to review \u201c[a]ny <em>decision </em>of the court in an intermediate order or proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, were the present case proceeding under ORS 138.040, there is no doubt that the \u201cdecision of the court\u201d in the \u201cintermediate order\u201d from November 2007 that defendant seeks to challenge here would be reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Put another way, if defendant\u2019s understanding of \u201cdisposition\u201d is correct, and \u201cdisposition\u201d includes the conviction itself and any error in the proceeding that potentially affects the validity of that conviction, then ORS 138.040 and ORS 138.050 both offer an equally broad scope of review. As a purely textual matter, that seems unlikely. Where a statute contains \u201cseveral provisions or particulars,\u201d we attempt to construe it to \u201cgive effect to all.\u201d ORS 174.010. Generally, \u201cwe assume that the legislature did not intend any portions of its enactments to be meaningless surplusage.\u201d <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 417, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005). If defendant were correct that ORS 138.050 allows appellate review in the same manner as ORS 138.040, it is difficult to perceive why the legislature would have enacted both statutes, much less have included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>additional text in ORS 138.040 that specifically allows appellate review of intermediate orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In sum, from a purely textual view of ORS 138.050 and related statutes, defendant\u2019s proposed construction is problematic. Prior case law, and the legislative history of ORS 138.050 described therein, however, definitively demonstrates that defendant\u2019s broad interpretation of ORS 138.050 is not what the legislature intended. <em>See generally State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (in interpreting a statute, we look primarily to the text in context, in light of any pertinent legislative history); <em>SAIF v. Walker, </em>330 Or 102, 108-09, 996 P2d 979 (2000) (prior case law forms part of a statute\u2019s context).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 261 P3d 1234 (2011), the court reviewed at length the history of ORS 138.050, including each version of its predecessor enactments dating from the original in the early 1900s through the present version of the statute, the court\u2019s case law interpreting it, and the legislative history of various changes. <em>Id. </em>at 77-104. The text at issue here traces back to a version of the statute providing that \u201cimprisonment shall not in any event exceed the maximum term provided by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77 (quoting Lord\u2019s Oregon Laws, title XVIII, ch XI, \u00a7 1592 (1910)). The court\u2019s earliest interpretation of the statute was that \u201cthe effect of a guilty plea is to admit the facts as charged in the indictment; but that does not preclude a defendant who has so pleaded from advancing purely legal challenges to the lawfulness of the conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 77 (citing <em>State v. Lewis, </em>113 Or 359, 361-62, 230 P 543 (1924), <em>on reh\u2019g, </em>232 P 1013 (1925)). Thereafter, the legislature enacted a restriction providing that, when a defendant had pleaded guilty, the appellate court was only to consider whether an excessive fine had been imposed or a cruel, unusual, or disproportionate sentence had been inflicted. <em>Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 78 (citations omitted). Subsequently, the court decided <em>State v. Jairl, </em>229 Or 533, 368 P2d 323 (1962), where a defendant who had pleaded guilty argued on appeal that the trial court had erred in failing to dismiss the charge. The court held that <em>Lewis </em>had been legislatively overruled; accordingly, the court held that the issue that the defendant sought to raise was not cognizable under ORS 138.050 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ORS 138.040 was the only statute \u201cwith language broad enough to justify an appeal of the grounds submitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539. The court further observed that the defendant\u2019s remedy was not through direct appeal but, rather, through the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In <em>Cloutier, </em>the court reviewed the alterations of ORS 138.050 that were enacted during the 1970s and 1980s, including a version of the statute that allowed a defendant who had entered a plea to appeal a judgment that imposed a \u201csentence\u201d that was cruel, unusual, or \u201cexcessive in light of the nature and background of the offender or the facts and circumstances of the offense.\u201d 351 Or at 80 (quoting ORS 138.050 (1977)). Under that version of the statute, the court decided <em>State v. Clevenger, </em>297 Or 234, 683 P2d 1360 (1984). In <em>Clevenger, </em>the defendant had entered a plea of no contest, and sought to argue on appeal that the trial court had erred in entering a conviction based on his plea because the factual basis for the plea was insufficient. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the issue was reviewable and adhered to its prior interpretation of the statute in <em>Jairl.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Because of the earlier statutory change that had introduced the issue of whether a sentence was \u201cexcessive in light of the nature and background of the offender or the facts and circumstances of the offense,\u201d this court became inundated with appeals challenging sentences under that provision. <em>See Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 84 (so noting). In 1985, the legislature amended ORS 138.050, at the request of the Judicial Department, to remove that language and, in essence, return the statute to its prior form. In <em>State v. Loyer, </em>303 Or 612, 740 P2d 177 (1987), a defendant who had pleaded guilty attempted to raise on appeal an issue concerning the cross-examination of a state\u2019s witness at a sentencing proceeding. Noting that the recent amendment of the statute had considerably narrowed its scope, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument on the ground that he had not established that a \u201cprocedural flaw prevents us from determining upon appellate review whether the sentence \u2018exceeds the maximum sentence allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617 (quoting ORS 138.050 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Most pertinent to the issue in this case, ORS 138.050 was amended in 1989, and the word \u201cdisposition\u201d was substituted for the word \u201csentence.\u201d As the court explained in <em>Cloutier.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">\u201cThe amendments were prompted by uncertainty about whether a term of probation was within the meaning of the \u2018sentence\u2019 that a defendant could challenge on appeal under ORS 138.040. In <em>State v. Carmickle, </em>307 Or 1, 6-7, 762 P2d 290 (1988), this court concluded that, although an order of probation was appealable on other grounds, it was not a \u2018sentence\u2019 within the meaning of ORS 138.050.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cHouse Bill (HB) 2470 (1989) was introduced in direct response to <em>Carmickle </em>to make clear that probation is among the categories of sentencing decisions that are subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the courts. Among other things, the bill proposed to amend both ORS 138.040 and ORS 138.050 by replacing the word \u2018sentence\u2019 with the word \u2018disposition.\u2019 A new provision then specified that an appealable disposition includes [those specified in ORS 138.053(1)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">351 Or at 91. The court further noted, in reviewing the legislative history of the 1989 amendments, that the legislature had declined to adopt an amendment proposed by the American Civil Liberties Union that would have broadened the scope of review under ORS 138.050 to allow the court to review constitutional issues beyond whether a disposition was \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">With the stage so set, before returning to <em>Cloutier, </em>we turn briefly to our own case law interpreting the post-1989 versions of ORS 138.050.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>113 Or App 416, 418, 833 P2d 321 (1992), we held that a challenge to the amount of restitution imposed after entry of a guilty plea was reviewable under ORS 138.050; we suggested that, by replacing the word \u201csentence\u201d with \u201cdisposition,\u201d the legislature intended to broaden our review, indicating that a disposition exceeds that allowable by law if it is imposed inconsistently with statutory requirements. In <em>State v. Summerlin, </em>139 Or App 579, 913 P2d 340 (1996), the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to numerous charges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>argued on appeal that the trial court had erred in failing to merge several of his convictions. We held that that issue was properly before us pursuant to ORS 138.050(1), because <em>\u201ca </em>disposition exceeds the maximum allowed by law if it is not imposed consistently with statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582; <em>see also State v. Bowers, </em>234 Or App 301, 227 P3d 822, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 621 (2010) (adhering to <em>Summerlin </em>and holding that failure to merge convictions was appealable under ORS 138.050(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Stubbs, </em>193 Or App 595, 91 P3d 774 (2004), we took an expansive view of \u201cdisposition\u201d that \u201c[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law\u201d as used in ORS 138.050. There, the defendant had pleaded guilty and a judgment was entered pursuant to his plea and stipulated sentencing agreement. Thereafter, the defendant began serving his sentence under the judgment, which provided in part that certain sentences would be served concurrently. <em>Id. </em>at 597. The state sought to have the trial court enter an amended judgment that imposed those sentences consecutively rather than concurrently, and the court did so. The defendant appealed from the amended judgment, arguing that the trial court lacked authority to amend the judgment because the sentences had been executed. <em>Id. </em>at 598. The state argued that ORS 138.050 only permitted appeals that challenged the length of a sentence, citing <em>Clevenger </em>and our decision in <em>State v. Woodard, </em>121 Or App 483, 855 P2d 1139, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 26 (1993). In <em>Woodard, </em>we held that a defendant who had pleaded guilty to first-degree sodomy could not raise an issue under ORS 138.050 as to whether the conviction should instead have been for incest, stating that a defendant \u201cmay not, on direct appeal, take issue with a conviction to which he agreed to plead no contest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. In <em>Stubbs, </em>we noted that <em>Woodard </em>and <em>Clevenger </em>had concerned situations where \u201cthe purported error concerned the conviction itself, not the sentence.\u201d 193 Or App at 605. By contrast, we explained, in cases such as <em>Summerlin </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>the challenges were not to the convictions, but, in fact, concerned \u201cdispositions\u201d of the sort specified in ORS 138.053 \u2014 that is, matters that, in effect, related to sentencing \u2014 and thus could be reviewed to determine whether they exceeded the maximum allowable by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>under ORS 138.050(1). <em>Id.; see also State v. Nave, </em>214 Or App 324, 164 P2d 1219, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007) (holding that a \u201cdisposition\u201d encompassed revocation of driving privileges). We concluded that the defendant\u2019s challenge in <em>Stubbs </em>was essentially the same, because it concerned whether \u201cthe sentence imposed in this case was not imposed consistently with statutory requirements, because the trial court lacked authority to modify a sentence that had already been \u2018executed.\u2019\u201d 193 Or App at 607. <em>See also State v. Easton, </em>204 Or App 1, 126 P3d 1256, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (similarly concluding that a defendant could appeal from an amended judgment modifying his sentence based on an argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In sum, our case law construing ORS 138.050 after the 1989 amendments does, in one sense, support defendant\u2019s assertion that \u201cdisposition\u201d has been viewed broadly to include whether single or multiple convictions should have been entered, whether a court had jurisdiction to enter an amended judgment that affected a sentence, or whether driving privileges were properly revoked as the result of a conviction. On the other hand, the case law following <em>Clevenger </em>did not go so far as to allow a challenge to the underlying convictions. <em>See Stubbs, </em>193 Or App at 605 (citing cases); <em>see also State v. Brown, </em>225 Or App 207, 199 P3d 890 (2009) (defendant could not challenge voluntariness of guilty plea on appeal under ORS 138.050); <em>State v. Anderson, </em>215 Or App 643, 171 P3d 972 (2007) (defendant could not challenge conviction pursuant to ORS 138.050 on the ground that the trial court failed to abide by terms of a plea agreement); <em>State v. Balukovic, </em>153 Or App 253, 258, 956 P2d 250 (1998) (order revoking for deferred sentencing program was not appealable under ORS 138.050 because it did not contain a disposition as defined in ORS 138.053: ORS 138.050 \u201cdoes not encompass review of orders that occur before the judgment of conviction\u201d); <em>State v. Zell, </em>89 Or App 394, 749 P2d 1196 (1988) (reaching same conclusion concerning challenge to conviction under earlier version of the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Were it not for <em>Cloutier, </em>in this case, we probably would need to confront the tension in our own case law concerning ORS 138.050 and decide whether the present case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>more like <em>Stubbs </em>and <em>Eaton, </em>which permitted challenges to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter the judgment being appealed (although those cases, unlike this one, concerned the lawfulness of sentences rather than convictions), or more like the line of cases beginning with <em>Clevenger, </em>which, as noted, do not allow a defendant to challenge the conviction itself after a plea of guilty or no contest. As explained below, however, the court in <em>Cloutier </em>has provided a definitive answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">In <em>Cloutier, </em>after reviewing the history of the statute described above, the court went on to address whether it had jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s appeal under ORS 138.050(l)(a). In that case, as in the present case, the defendant had executed a plea agreement in order to enter a diversion program. 351 Or at 70. Thereafter, the defendant failed to complete his diversion and, in sentencing the defendant for DUII, the court imposed a fine in excess of the mandatory minimum but within the statutory limits, noting that it was doing so because he had pleaded \u201cno contest at the time of entering diversion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant sought to challenge the lawfulness of the fine on constitutional grounds, arguing that imposition of the fine violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus, the court addressed the question whether the defendant\u2019s due process challenge was cognizable on the ground that it concerned a disposition that exceeded the maximum allowable by law. In holding that it did not, after reviewing the enactment history and legislative history of ORS 138.050, as well as its prior cases, the court provided the following analysis of the pertinent text in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201cORS 138.050 authorize[s] a defendant to appeal a \u2018disposition\u2019 instead of a \u2018sentence.\u2019 ORS 138.053(1) then specifies the five types of\u2018dispositions\u2019 that are appealable. The first two of the five types of appealable dispositions are the imposition of a sentence, ORS 138.053(l)(a), and the suspension of the imposition of any part of a sentence, ORS 138.053(l)(b). The latter three types of appealable dispositions concern imposing conditions of probation, ORS 138.053(l)(c), extending a period of probation, ORS 138.053(l)(d), or imposing a sentence upon revocation of probation, ORS 138.053(l)(e). On an appeal of a disposition of the first two types, the scope of the appellate court\u2019s review authority is limited to whether the disposition \u2018[e]xceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the maximum allowable by law\u2019 or \u2018[i]s unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u2019 ORS 138.050(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">\u201cBut, on an appeal of a disposition of the latter three types, <em>\u2018[notwithstanding ORS 138.040 and [ORS] 138.050,\u2019 </em>the appellate court may review more broadly for any \u2018colorable claim of error in the proceeding from which the appeal is taken.\u2019 ORS 138.053(3) (emphasis added). If defendant were correct that a disposition \u2018exceeds the maximum allowable by law\u2019 because of any error in the proceeding in which the disposition was imposed, then the expanded review authority that is specified in ORS 138.053(3) becomes surplusage, as the appellate court would already possess such authority under ORS 138.050. Indeed, defendant\u2019s proposed reading of the statute makes the' introductory phrase, \u2018[n]otwithstanding ORS 138.040 and [ORS] 138.050\u2019 meaningless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">351 Or at 99-100 (emphasis and brackets in <em>Cloutier). </em>Ultimately, in <em>Cloutier, </em>the court concluded that the defendant\u2019s challenge was not cognizable under ORS 138.050 because the defendant had not asserted that the disposition exceeded a \u201cmaximum expressed by means of legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">That analysis in <em>Cloutier </em>provides a direct answer to the initial question posed in this case: Is a conviction a \u201cdisposition\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.050? As analyzed in <em>Cloutier, </em>it is not. A \u201cdisposition\u201d is one of the five things listed in ORS 138.053(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, although the judgment being appealed in the present case does contain a disposition\u2014 it imposes probation \u2014 the question whether <em>that </em>disposition \u201c[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law,\u201d as that term has been interpreted in <em>Cloutier, </em>has not been raised in the present case. That is, defendant does not argue that the probationary sentence imposed in this case \u201cexceeds a maximum expressed by means of legislation [.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 104. Defendant\u2019s sole argument is that no \u201cdisposition\u201d at all was appropriate in the present case, because no conviction should have been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We recognize that our analysis in this case, following <em>Cloutier, </em>may call into question the analyses in some, although not all, of our prior cases discussed above. In particular, we note that <em>Cloutier </em>is consistent with our cases such as <em>Brown, </em>225 Or App at 208, <em>Anderson, </em>215 Or App at 647, and <em>Woodard, </em>121 Or App at 485, indicating that a defendant who appeals pursuant to ORS 138.050 may not challenge the validity of the conviction to which he or she pleaded. We need not, at this juncture, attempt to determine which, if any, of our other prior cases are consistent with various aspects of Cloutier.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that, in light of the legislative history and the statutory analysis set out in <em>Cloutier, </em>we are convinced that our prior cases holding that the validity of a conviction may not be challenged in an appeal pursuant to ORS 138.050 are sound and that this case is not materially distinguishable from those cases. Because the gravamen of defendant\u2019s argument here concerns whether any conviction should have been entered, his appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\"> ORS 135.335 allows a defendant in some circumstances to enter a plea while reserving the right to appeal from an adverse determination. That statute is not at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> As the court noted in <em>Cloutier, </em>there have been minor amendments to the statute since 1989.351 Or at 94 n 2. Those changes did not affect the text at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\"> ORS 138.053(1) contains the following five specifics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">\u201c(a) Imposition of a sentence on conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">\u201c(b) Suspension of imposition or execution of any part of a sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">\u201c(c) Extension of a period of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">\u201c(d) Imposition or modification of a condition of probation or of sentence suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-13\">\u201c(e) Imposition or execution of a sentence upon revocation of probation or sentence suspension.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\"> In particular, we note that the court in <em>Cloutier, </em>a misdemeanor case, opined that review of sentences for felonies is \u201cgoverned by ORS 138.222. ORS 138.040 and ORS 138.050 now apply only to appeal and review of sentences for misdemeanor offenses.\u201d <em>Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 91. The present case, like <em>Cloutier, </em>involves a misdemeanor. A number of our prior cases interpreting ORS 138.050, however, involved felonies. An examination of each of those cases in light of what the <em>Cloutier </em>court had to say about ORS 138.222 is beyond the scope of what we need to decide in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
