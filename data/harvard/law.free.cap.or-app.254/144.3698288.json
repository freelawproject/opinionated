J.</author>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Plaintiff Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) appeals a general judgment, declaring that over 100 exhibits that Pfizer had produced during the course of an investigation by defendant Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) concerning Pfizer\u2019s marketing of the medications Bextra and Celebrex, as well as an annotated complaint predicated on those exhibits, are not exempt from disclosure under the parties\u2019 confidentiality agreements. On appeal, Pfizer contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment and granting DOJ\u2019s cross-motion because the exhibits and annotated complaint are exempt from disclosure as \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d \u201cconfidential submissions,\u201d or \u201cattorney work product\u201d under the Oregon Public Records Law (OPRL), ORS 192.410 to 192.505,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, for that reason, DOJ is obligated not to disclose them to third parties under the terms of the confidentiality agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As amplified below, we conclude that the confidentiality agreements obligate DOJ to withhold the Pfizer- produced exhibits to the extent that they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL. Proceeding from that premise, we further conclude as follows: One, the trial court erred in denying Pfizer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in granting DOJ\u2019s cross-motion as to Exhibits 1-4, 7-9, 11, 13-16, 18-19, 21-40, 44-73, 75-94, 96-101, and 103. As to those documents, Pfizer was entitled to summary judgment because the declaration of its director, Gibney, established, without contradiction, that, as a matter of law, those exhibits are exempt as trade secrets pursuant to ORS 192.502(9)(a) of the OPRL in that their disclosure is \u201cprohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential or privileged under Oregon law,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, ORS 646.461 to 646.475. And two, to the extent that the annotated complaint discloses information contained in those exhibits, it too is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>concomitantly exempt from disclosure. As to the remaining <em>exhibits </em>\u2014 viz., Exhibits 10, 12, 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109 \u2014 we conclude that the trial court properly denied Pfizer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted DOJ\u2019s cross-motion because the \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d exemption of the OPRL, ORS 192.502(4), is inapplicable as a matter of law. Finally, we conclude that, because DOJ is not contractually obligated to protect its own work product in the event that it is subject to a public records request, the annotated complaint and the compilation of exhibits in its entirety is not exempt from disclosure as \u201cattorney work product.\u201d Accordingly, those parts of the annotated complaint that do not disclose the content of exhibits exempt from disclosure are not themselves exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">To provide context, we begin with a general overview of the undisputed procedural facts. To the extent that resolution of issues on appeal requires that we augment those facts, we do so in the context of addressing the parties\u2019 particular contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In 2003, DOJ led a multistate investigation to determine whether Pfizer Inc. and Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia), another drug company that Pfizer Inc. acquired in April of that year, were marketing the medications Bextra and Celebrex in violation of consumer protection laws, including Oregon\u2019s Unlawful Trade Practices Act (UTPA), ORS 646.605 to 646.652. One aspect of that investigation concerned whether Pfizer was marketing Bextra for off-label uses \u2014 that is, uses that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Initially, DOJ did not issue an investigative demand for the exhibits at issue on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, in June 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>DOJ (on behalf of the Attorneys General of several states, including Oregon) entered into a detailed confidentiality agreement with Pharmacia that limited the disclosure of the exhibits that Pharmacia produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In November 2004, David Hart, the Oregon Senior Assistant Attorney General who led the investigation, notified Pfizer that the issuance of an investigative demand would occur \u201cshortly,\u201d and he provided Pfizer with an unsigned copy of the demand that DOJ intended to issue. However, after Pfizer agreed to enter settlement negotiations and produce the requested documentation, DOJ agreed not to formally issue the investigative demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Then, in January 2005, the 2003 confidentiality agreement was amended to refer to Pfizer in addition to Pharmacia, but the substance of the agreement remained the same.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Generally, the agreements governed the disclosure of documents or written material that Pfizer designated as \u201cconfidential\u201d \u2014 that is, documents or materials that \u201cin Pfizer [\u2019s] * * * good faith view, [contained] proprietary or trade secret information.\u201d Specifically, the agreements provided that \u201cany documents or other written material marked or designated by Pfizer * * * as containing \u2018Confidential\u2019 information, or summaries thereof, shall not be disclosed by the Attorneys\u2019 General offices to anyone other than\u201d particular employees, consultants, and state and federal agencies under specified conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">With regard to disclosures to third parties, the agreements provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cNothing in the foregoing shall limit the ability of the Attorneys General to disclose \u2018Confidential\u2019 documents, materials, or written summaries thereof, to any third party, including without limitation a federal or state agency, pursuant to a subpoena or court order, and <em>the obligations of each Attorney General listed above under this confidentiality agreement are further subject to the provisions of each State\u2019s </em>respective data practices act, <em>public record act, </em>freedom of information act or similar state law regarding the maintenance and disclosure of documents and information supplied to such State\u2019s Attorney General.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">(Emphasis added.) Further, the agreements provided that, if a state received a third-party request, it would \u201cnotify Pfizer * * * of the [request] as soon as is reasonably possible so that Pfizer * * * may seek a protective order\u201d and would, generally, \u201cprovide Pfizer * * * with at least ten (10) business days\u2019 advance notice before complying with any Third Party Request for documents or material designated or marked as containing \u2018Confidential\u2019 information^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The agreements did not prohibit the Attorneys General from using the produced information in litigation against Pfizer. However, they did require that the produced documents and materials be kept confidential so that Pfizer could attempt to obtain a protective order. For example, the agreements state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cNothing herein shall prevent any Attorney General from using, including in a filing with a court, such documents, so long as the documents are kept confidential until either the court rules on Pfizer\u2019s * * * request for a protective order, or the period of time which the Attorney General provided to Pfizer * * * for them to seek such order has expired, which shall be at least ten (10) business days unless a shorter period of time is required by state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Finally, the agreements provided that DOJ\u2019s obligations survive the conclusion of the investigation. Specifically, the agreements provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201c[T]he obligations of confidentiality imposed by this agreement shall survive the conclusion of this investigation, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including any State\u2019s data practices, freedom of information, civil investigative demand act, or similar laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Pursuant to those confidentiality agreements, Pfizer produced, among other documents, the vast majority of the exhibits that are at issue here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Ultimately, on October 22, 2008, DOJ filed a complaint against Pfizer, alleging that, despite significant safety concerns, Pfizer had used a variety of practices to market and promote Bextra for the off-label uses of treating acute and surgical pain in violation of the UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On the same day that the complaint was filed, the trial court accepted the parties\u2019 stipulated general judgment, which was \u201cmade without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law or finding of liability of any kind.\u201d According to the terms of the judgment, Pfizer agreed to pay $60 million and to abide by injunctive terms that prohibited and required particular prospective conduct addressing the concerns raised during the investigation (e.g., \u201cPfizer shall not make any written or oral claim that is false, misleading or deceptive regarding any FDA-approved Pfizer Product.\u201d). However, the stipulated judgment also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\u201cPfizer is entering into this Judgment solely for the purpose of settlement, <em>and nothing contained herein may be taken as or construed to be an admission or concession of any violation of law, rule, or regulation, or of any other matter of fact or law, or of any liability or wrongdoing, all of which Pfizer expressly denies. </em>Pfizer does not admit any violation of the State Consumer Protection Laws set forth in footnote 1[, including the UTPA], and does not admit any wrongdoing that was or could have been alleged by any Attorney General before the date of the Judgment under those laws. No part of this Judgment, including its statements and commitments, shall constitute evidence of any liability, fault, or wrongdoing by Pfizer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">A few days after the stipulated judgment was accepted and DOJ issued a press release about the terms of its settlement with Pfizer, a California attorney, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>represented a private plaintiff in unrelated litigation against Pfizer, requested disclosure under the OPRL of all documents produced by Pfizer during DOJ\u2019s investigation. Hart responded by e-mail. He suggested that the scope of the request be limited to (1) an \u201cannotated complaint\u201d that he had drafted before DOJ settled with Pfizer \u2014 a complaint that was qualitatively different from the complaint that DOJ had actually filed on October 22, 2008 \u2014 and (2) the supporting exhibits for the annotated complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hart explained that much of the material covered in the annotated complaint and most of the supporting exhibits were \u201ccovered by the Confidentiality Agreements\u201d and that he \u201ccould probably determine in short order which of these [exhibits] are not subject to a public records request.\u201d The California attorney agreed to limit the request to the annotated complaint and supporting exhibits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Consistently with the confidentiality agreements, DOJ informed Pfizer that the public records request had been made. Thereafter, Pfizer initiated this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the release of the annotated complaint and the supporting exhibits (with DOJ\u2019s proposed redactions) would be in violation of the confidentiality agreements because the annotated complaint and related exhibits (even as redacted by DOJ) were exempt from disclosure under the OPRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Their competing contentions essentially centered on two overarching issues: <em>First, </em>do the confidentiality agreements obligate DOJ to withhold the annotated complaint and the exhibits to the extent that they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL? And <em>second, </em>if they do, are the exhibits and annotated complaint exempt under the OPRL either as \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d \u201cconfidential submissions,\u201d or \u201cattorney work product\u201d as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The second of those questions implicated, in turn, four subsidiary questions concerning the applicability of particular exemptions under the OPRL to the exhibits and annotated complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">(1) Are the exhibits exempt as \u201ctrade secrets\u201d under ORS 192.502(9)(a) because their disclosure is \u201cprohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential or privileged under Oregon law,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the Uniform Trade Secrets Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">(2) Are the exhibits exempt as \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d under ORS 192.502(4), which exempts from disclosure \u201c[i]nformation submitted to a public body in confidence and not otherwise required by law to be submitted, where such information should reasonably be considered confidential, the public body has obliged itself in good faith not to disclose the information, and when the public interest would suffer by the disclosure\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">(3) Is the annotated complaint exempt from disclosure to the extent that it is predicated on particular exhibits that are themselves exempt under the OPRL?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">(4) Are the annotated complaint and the compilation of exhibits on which it is predicated exempt from disclosure under ORS 192.502(9)(a), which incorporates ORCP 36 B(3)\u2019s limitations on the disclosure of \u201cattorney work product\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In moving for summary judgment, Pfizer submitted the declaration of its director, Gibney. In that declaration, Gibney explained the reasons that the exhibits qualified as trade secrets. DOJ, however, proffered no evidentiary submissions controverting the Gibney declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Ultimately, the trial court concluded that, although the confidentiality agreements obligated DOJ to withhold the exhibits that are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL, the vast majority of the exhibits are not exempt. In detailed letter opinions, the court began by adopting the premise of Pfizer\u2019s position, that is, that \u201cDOJ, in entering the Confidentiality Agreements, obliged itself to keep the disclosed information confidential, to the extent of the applicable <em>law\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., the OPRL. Specifically, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">\u201c[D]isclosure of any [exhibits] would not per se violate the Agreements, as the Agreements are subject to [the OPRL].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>If any [exhibits] are subject to disclosure under [the OPRL], there is no obligation of confidentiality. * * * If any [exhibit] would be exempt from disclosure, such exemption would be provided <em>under [the OPRL], </em>not the [c]onfidentiality agreement [s].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In sum, the court concluded that, if the exhibits are not exempt from disclosure under the OPRL, DOJ is obligated to disclose them. Conversely, however, the court concluded that, if any exhibits are exempt under the OPRL, DOJ is obliged not to disclose them. Accordingly, the court\u2019s analysis turned to whether the exhibits and annotated complaint are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The court concluded that the exhibits are not exempt under the OPRL as \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d relying on the two relevant statutory definitions of that term.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court explained that, with the exception of two exhibits that are not at issue on appeal, 254 Or App at 155-56 n 9, the remaining exhibits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201cdo not contain lists, formulas, procedures, and the like that may be protected as a trade secret. Pfizer has not shown that such [exhibits] have only been circulated among a small number of employees, or that the information was little known outside Pfizer\u2019s business, or that competitors would gain a market advantage by disclosure. Pfizer simply offers broad allegations of harm without providing] specific examples of injury. Pfizer has not met its burden to show good cause why the [exhibits] should not be disclosed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">As to the \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d exemption, the trial court noted that (1) \u201cthe information and documents produced by Pfizer, including strategic documents, internal emails, call notes, and other internal documents, were \u2018of a nature which reasonably should be confidential\u2019\u201d; (2) \u201cDOJ has obliged itself in good faith, not to disclose such documents\u201d; and (3) \u201cPfizer submitted such information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the DOJ in confidence, as evidenced by the Confidentiality Agreements.\u201d Nevertheless, the court concluded that the \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d exemption in ORS 192.502(4) is inapplicable for either of two independently sufficient reasons. First, the court determined that Pfizer\u2019s submissions did not satisfy the statutory requirement that, to qualify as an exempt \u201cconfidential submission,\u201d the information must \u201cnot otherwise [have been] required by law to be submitted.\u201d ORS 192.502(4). Rather, in the court\u2019s view, Pfizer\u2019s submissions were \u201crequired by law.\u201d That was so, the court reasoned, because \u201cthe informal [investigative demand], as well as the settlement negotiations, * * * coerced Pfizer into handing over the [exhibits]\u201d and, for that reason, \u201cPfizer did not voluntarily provide the DOJ with the [exhibits].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">As a further, and alternative, basis for deeming the \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d exemption inapposite, the court determined that, contrary to the statutory requisite that \u201cthe public interest * * * suffer by the disclosure,\u201d ORS 192.502(4), disclosure of the exhibits would not harm the public. In that regard, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cWith respect to Pfizer\u2019s contention that disclosure would impede future investigations and that voluntary production would be deterred, the court finds this argument unpersuasive. It is not a burden for the DOJ to obtain a court order to compel discovery. Such court orders occur in the normal course of litigation. Moreover, there are many reasons that a business would cooperate with a government investigation for violations of the state\u2019s consumer protection laws, and disclosure here would not deter cooperation in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cIn this case, public interest favors disclosure of these documents. The public has a substantial interest in learning about drug companies that market drugs for unapproved uses, for the main reason so that it can protect itself from such misconduct. Pfizer asserts that the DOJ has satisfied any public interest by filing its final complaint, posting the complaint on its website, distributing a press release announcing the filing, and holding a press conference announcing the settlement. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cOregon\u2019s public records law favor[s] disclosure. The public has a substantial interest in protecting itself from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>illegal marketing practices of drug companies. The public also has an interest in assessing how the Attorney General is investigating and prosecuting drug companies for violations of consumer protection laws. As such, disclosure of such [exhibits] would not harm the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Having concluded that the \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d exemption is inapplicable and that the exhibits are not exempt as \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d the court turned its attention to the annotated complaint. In particular, the court determined that the annotated complaint is not exempt as a trade secret because (1) \u201c[t]he general content of the information ha[d] already been published and [was] widely available to the public\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]he footnotes cite or quote material that is published, or that the court has found not to be exempt under the trade secret exemption\u201d; and (3) the complaint was prepared by DOJ for its use in the Pfizer litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Finally, the trial court rejected Pfizer\u2019s contention that the annotated complaint and the compilation of exhibits are exempt from disclosure as \u201cattorney work product\u201d under ORS 192.502(9)(a), which incorporates the restriction concerning the discovery of \u201cattorney work product\u201d in ORCP 36 B(3). The court noted that ORCP 36 B(3) provides, in part, that \u201cthe court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\u201d Nevertheless, the court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWY\">\u201c[t]he work product doctrine under ORCP 36 B(3) is limited to the <em>discovery </em>of documents. Thus, ORCP 36 B(3) is inapplicable as neither party is seeking discovery of the Annotated Complaint. Moreover, [Pfizer] may not invoke the work product doctrine. Such an invocation can only be made by [DOJ], as the Annotated Complaint is derived from the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions and legal theories of the [DOJ] attorneys, not [Pfizer].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">For all of those reasons, the trial court denied Pfizer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and allowed DOJ\u2019s cross-motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Before the entry of judgment, DOJ filed two motions that relate to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>First, relying on <em>AFSCME v. DAS, </em>150 Or App 87, 945 P2d 102 (1997), DOJ moved to dismiss the action, contending that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the three individuals who had made the public records requests were necessary parties who had not been joined.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, explaining that, unlike in <em>AFSCME, </em>in which the plaintiffs sought a declaration of rights <em>under the OPRL, </em>Pfizer sought a declaration of its rights <em>under the confidentiality agreements </em>\u2014 that is, contracts between Pfizer and DOJ to which the individuals who made the public records requests were neither parties nor third-party beneficiaries \u2014 and, for that reason, the individuals who made those requests need not be joined as parties.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Second, DOJ moved to supplement the summary judgment record with \u201cnewly discovered <em>evidence\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., five documents obtained from the website of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts. In general terms, those documents demonstrated that, in 2009, the federal government, Pfizer Inc., and one of Pfizer Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., had resolved criminal and civil claims arising from, among other things, the marketing of Bextra. Because those five documents pertain to, and provide context for, certain of the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we summarize their content at this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">(1) a federal criminal information alleging in a single count that Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., introduced into interstate commerce a misbranded drug \u2014 Bextra;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(2) a federal plea agreement in which Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., agreed to plead guilty to the crime alleged in the information and to pay a fine of $1,195 billion dollars and to a criminal forfeiture of $105 million;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">(3) a settlement agreement between the United States and Pfizer Inc. resolving, without admission of liability or wrongdoing, various civil and administrative claims concerning, among other things, Pfizer Inc.\u2019s promotion of Bextra for off-label uses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">(4) a \u201cside letter agreement\u201d between the United States and Pfizer Inc. providing as pertinent that \u201c[t]he United States hereby declines prosecution of Pfizer Inc or any of its subsidiaries (other than Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Inc as set forth in the Information [described above]) for conduct by or attributable to Pfizer Inc or any of its subsidiaries that[,]\u201d among other things, \u201cfalls within the scope of the Information to which Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., is pleading guilty\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">(5) a press release from the United States Department of Justice announcing \u201cthe largest health care fraud settlement in [its] history *** to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from the illegal promotion of certain pharmaceutical products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The trial court granted DOJ\u2019s motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Ultimately, the trial court entered a general judgment declaring, as pertinent, that \u201c[t]he Annotated Complaint prepared by the DOJ, and [Pfizer\u2019s] Exhibit[s] 1 to 4 and 7 to 109 are not exempt from disclosure under the Confidentiality Agreements between the parties or under ORS 192.501(2), 192.502(4), or 192.502(9) of the [OPRL].\u201d Pfizer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">On appeal, Pfizer assigns error both to the trial court\u2019s denial of its summary judgment motion and to the allowance of DOJ\u2019s cross-motion. In <em>Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&amp;L Excavating &amp; Trucking, Inc., </em>178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002), we described the operative standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">\u201c[Where] both the granting of one motion and the denial of the other are assigned as error, then both are subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>to review.

We review the record for each motion in the light most favorable to the party opposing it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In support of their respective positions on appeal, the parties raise the same contentions that they raised in the trial court concerning (1) whether the confidentiality agreements obligate DOJ to withhold the annotated complaint and the exhibits to the extent that they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL; and (2) if they do, whether, as a matter of law, the exhibits and annotated complaint are exempt under the OPRL. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">A. <em>Obligation Imposed by Confidentiality Agreements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We conclude, as did the trial court, that the confidentiality agreements obligate DOJ to withhold the Pfizer- produced exhibits to the extent that they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL. That conclusion necessarily follows from the text of the agreements. <em>See Shogun\u2019s Gallery, Inc. v. Merrill, </em>229 Or App 137, 145, 210 P3d 920 (2009) (in interpreting <em>\u201ca </em>contractual provision, we first examine the text of the disputed provision in context; if the text is clear, the analysis ends there\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">As noted above, 254 Or App at 148, the agreements provide that \u201cany documents or other written material marked or designated by Pfizer * * * as containing \u2018Confidential\u2019 information, or summaries thereof, shall not be disclosed by [DOJ] to anyone other than\u201d particular employees, consultants, and state and federal agencies under specified conditions. Significantly, although the agreements allow DOJ to disclose the Pfizer-produced documents or materials \u201cpursuant to a subpoena or court order,\u201d the agreements specify that DOJ\u2019s obligations to withhold the materials that Pfizer produced \u201care further subject to the provisions of each State\u2019s * * * public record act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">In sum, the confidentiality agreements limit DOJ\u2019s ability to disclose the exhibits that Pfizer had produced. Except for certain individuals and entities, the agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>prohibit DOJ from disclosing those exhibits \u201cto anyone\u201d in the absence of a subpoena or court order. Nevertheless, that obligation is \u201cfurther subject to\u201d the OPRL. In other words, if the exhibits are not exempt from disclosure under the OPRL, DOJ is obligated to disclose them; however, if any exhibits are exempt under the OPRL, DOJ is obligated not to disclose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">DOJ remonstrates, nevertheless, that such an understanding of the agreements is too broad and that it did not agree to apply exemptions in the OPRL other than those pertaining to trade secrets. That contention is predicated on DOJ\u2019s understanding that \u201cthe agreements expressly provide that the only documents that were to be designated as \u2018confidential\u2019 by Pfizer were trade secrets.\u201d However, contrary to DOJ\u2019s understanding, the agreements provide that confidential documents are those that contained <em>\u201cproprietary or </em>trade secret information.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That is, the agreements provide for protection of \u201cproprietary\u201d information beyond \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d Thus, DOJ\u2019s contention that the agreements obligate it to apply only the OPRL exemptions related to trade secrets is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">B. <em>Exemption of Exhibits and Annotated Complaint Under the OPRL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Having concluded that the confidentiality agreements obligate DOJ to withhold the Pfizer-produced exhibits to the extent that they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL, we turn to the remaining overarching issue in this case. In particular, we must determine whether, as a matter of law, the exhibits and annotated complaint are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Three principles inform our analysis of that issue. <em>First, </em>because the parties\u2019 contractual obligations in this case depend on the effect of incorporated statutes (e.g., the exemptions in the OPRL), we apply to those statutes, where necessary, the rules of statutory interpretation set out in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), as amplified in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). <em>See Lenon v. PERB, </em>228 Or App 20, 25, 206 P3d 1165, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 365 (2009) (so stating).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Second, </em>although, ordinarily, it is the public body that \u201chas the burden of sustaining an asserted exemption from disclosure\u201d under the OPRL, <em>In Defense of Animals v. OHSU, </em>199 Or App 160, 172, 112 P3d 336 (2005), that construct is inapplicable in this case. Here, Pfizer is contending that the confidentiality agreements prohibit disclosure of the exhibits and annotated complaint because they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL. Under such circumstances, Pfizer, which is resisting disclosure, has the burden of demonstrating the applicability of each OPRL exemption on which it relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><em>Third, </em>as noted, Pfizer contends that the exhibits and annotated complaint are exempt under the OPRL as either \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d \u201cconfidential submissions,\u201d or \u201cattorney work product\u201d \u2014 or some permutation of those exemptions. In analyzing those issues, if we conclude that Pfizer is entitled to summary judgment because one of those exemptions applies to particular exhibits, \u201cwe need not consider the applicability of other exemptions\u201d to those exhibits. <em>Id. </em>With those principles in mind, we turn to whether some or all of the exhibits are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL as trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">1. <em>Trade Secrets Exemption Under ORS 192.502(9)(a) and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Pfizer\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the exhibits are exempt as trade secrets under the OPRL. In support of that contention, Pfizer relies on ORS 192.502(9)(a), which exempts from disclosure under the OPRL \u201c[p]ublic records or information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential or privileged under Oregon law.\u201d According to Pfizer, \u201c[d]isclosure of [its] trade secrets would constitute a \u2018prohibited disclosure\u2019 under ORS 192.502(9)(a) because it would be a \u2018misappropriation\u2019 of trade secrets, which is prohibited by the [Uniform Trade Secrets Act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">As in the trial court, the parties\u2019 competing contentions on appeal concern whether the exhibits are trade secrets as defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, specifically, ORS 646.461(4). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201cTrade secret\u2019 means information, including a drawing, cost data, customer list, formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">\u201c(a) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201c(b) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>Kaib\u2019s Roving R.PH. Agency, Inc. v. Smith, </em>237 Or App 96, 103, 239 P3d 247 (2010), we explained that, \u201c[t]o constitute a trade secret under ORS 646.461(4), information (including compilations) must both (1) gain value because it is not generally known and (2) be the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain that secrecy.\u201d We further noted that, generally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201c[e]ach of those determinations is made, not by reference to legal principles, but on the basis of the historical facts and circumstances presented: Is the information at issue generally known within the relevant community? Is it more valuable by virtue of not being generally known? What efforts were made to keep it secret? Were those efforts reasonable? <em>Et cetera. </em>The definition set forth in the statute itself therefore necessarily implies that whether information is or is not a trade secret is a question of fact. If facts and circumstances are presented to establish that the information derives economic value from not being generally known and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy, then the information is a trade secret within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 103.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Further, in contexts in which a party seeks to prohibit disclosure of information as a trade secret, we have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201c[t]he party must also establish good cause for the protective order by demonstrating that disclosure will work a clearly defined and serious injury. Broad allegations of harm unsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning do not satisfy the good cause requirement. The harm must be significant, not a mere trifle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board v. Public Utility Commission, </em>128 Or App 650, 658, 877 P2d 116, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 272 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">For its part, Pfizer contends that the exhibits are trade secrets as a matter of law. In support of that contention, Pfizer relies on the declaration of a Pfizer director, Gibney, explaining that (1) Pfizer invested substantial time and money in creating the exhibits; (2) Pfizer derives economic value from the fact that the information in the exhibits is not generally known and has taken efforts to maintain its confidentiality; and (3) disclosure would allow Pfizer\u2019s competitors to have access to the information and to benefit from Pfizer\u2019s substantial investments in developing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Further, in separate paragraphs, the declaration identifies categories of exhibits <em>(e.g., </em>executive management committee meeting agendas and presentations, strategic operating plan, and study protocols and final study reports). Significantly, with regard to the exhibits in each category, Gibney explains in greater detail the type of information contained in the exhibits and the reasons that it qualifies for trade secret protection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Invoking the Gibney declaration and relying on ORCP 47 D,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Pfizer further contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201c[i]n opposing Pfizer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, [DOJ] offered no evidence to dispute the facts set out in the Gibney Declaration. If [DOJ] wanted to challenge Mr. Gibney\u2019s factual assertions, it could easily have sought discovery from Pfizer, including the deposition of Mr. Gibney. It also could have attempted to submit a factual affidavit by a competent witness challenging Mr. Gibney\u2019s sworn statements regarding Pfizer\u2019s investment in the creation and the maintenance of the protected material. Instead, [DOJ] to leave the Gibney Declaration unchallenged by any evidentiary material and simply filed its own cross-motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In response, DOJ contends that Pfizer\u2019s reliance on the Gibney declaration is misplaced for three reasons. We address each of those contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">First, DOJ contends that \u201cuncontroverted or not, the statements in the [Gibney declaration] did not necessarily establish that the materials are trade secrets.\u201d In other words, DOJ contends that the declaration simply did not demonstrate that the exhibits qualified as \u201ctrade secrets\u201d under the legal definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">However, as we explained in <em>Kaib\u2019s Roving R.PH. Agency; Inc., </em>information constitutes a trade secret for purposes of ORS 646.461(4) if it \u201c(1) gain[s] value because it is not generally known and (2) [is] the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain that secrecy.\u201d 237 Or App at 103. Gibney\u2019s declaration in this case demonstrated both of those requirements. Further, as required by <em>Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, </em>Gibney adequately described the potential harm that would result from the release of the exhibits. Thus, the Gibney declaration was legally sufficient to establish the availability of the \u201ctrade secrets\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Second, DOJ contends that \u201cGibney\u2019s opinion was belied by the content of the [exhibits] themselves, in the context of the circumstances of the case.\u201d Having reviewed each of the exhibits (as redacted by DOJ) \u2014 and assuming that DOJ\u2019s unamplified use of \u201cbelie\u201d embodies an assertion that the content of various (unspecified) exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>is patently irreconcilable with the averments of the Gibney declaration \u2014 we reject DOJ\u2019s contention without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Third, DOJ contends that it <em>\u201cdid </em>demonstrate that Gibney\u2019s statements were immaterial by showing that the information had already been made public or that similar information was readily available.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In support of that contention, DOJ points to its summary judgment submissions \u2014 namely, the October 2008 state documents (i.e., the UTPA complaint against Pfizer, the stipulated judgment, and DOJ\u2019s press release) described above, 254 Or App at 150-51, and the 2009 federal documents (i.e., the federal information against Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., and its plea agreement, the civil settlement and side letter agreement with Pfizer Inc., and the federal government\u2019s press release) described above, 254 Or App at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">DOJ\u2019s contention in that regard partakes of the following syllogism:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">(a) The October 2008 complaint that DOJ filed against Pfizer and the corresponding stipulated judgment, as well as DOJ\u2019s press release describing Pfizer\u2019s conduct in marketing Bextra for off-label uses, are publicly available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(b) The 2009 federal information against Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., and its plea agreement, the civil settlement and side letter agreement with Pfizer Inc., and the federal government\u2019s press release are publicly available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(c) The exhibits at issue on appeal contain examples of the conduct described in those publicly available documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">(d) Therefore, the information in the exhibits has essentially been made public and is generally available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">The success of that syllogism depends on the correctness of DOJ\u2019s predicate premise that the exhibits are nothing more than examples of conduct described in the publicly available documents to which it refers. For the following reasons, we conclude that that premise is incorrect as to the great majority of the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Again, we have reviewed each exhibit at issue on appeal. With regard to Exhibits 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109, we agree with DOJ that the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>therein is publicly available in the sources to which DOJ refers. For example, the core content of some of those exhibits was reproduced \u2014 sometimes verbatim \u2014 in the federal information. Given that circumstance, Exhibits 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109 contain nothing more than has been publicly disclosed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">That is not the case, however, with regard to the remainder of the exhibits. Even as redacted, those exhibits reveal more than generic examples of conduct. In other words, the specific, underlying details in those exhibits have not been revealed by the publicly available sources on which DOJ relies \u2014 and it is <em>that </em>underlying detail that Pfizer contends is a trade secret. Accordingly, as to Exhibits 1-4, 7-9, 11, 13-16, 18-19, 21-40, 44-73, 75-94, 96-101, and 103, we reject DOJ\u2019s contention that the \u201cinformation had already been made public or that similar information was readily available.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Nevertheless, in a further attempt to demonstrate that the exhibits are not exempt under the OPRL as trade secrets, DOJ raises two additional contentions. <em>First, </em>DOJ essentially contends that the exhibits do not contain information that \u201cgain[s] value because it is not generally known.\u201d <em>Kaib\u2019s Roving R.PH. Agency, Inc., </em>237 Or App at 103. To that end, DOJ specifically asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201c[t]he information is old and of no value to a competitor. The market to which these [exhibits] relate no longer exists.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The [exhibits] relate to an illegal and heavily penalized marketing scheme that no competitor would want to emulate. And, the wealth of substantially similar documents that are publicly available show that whatever insights a competitor might somehow discern could easily be \u2018acquired or duplicated\u2019 without access to these [exhibits].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">However, in the face of the Gibney declaration \u2014 which established the availability of the trade secrets exemption\u2014 DO J failed to offer any factual submission in support of those bare assertions. For that reason, we reject them without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Second, DOJ also contends that \u201c[i]llegal conduct is not a trade secret.\u201d We understand that contention to be predicated on DOJ\u2019s understanding that \u201cPfizer agreed to plead guilty to the charges in the [federal] Information.\u201d Whatever the merits of DOJ\u2019s contention \u2014 an issue about which we express no opinion \u2014 its predicate understanding of the federal plea agreement is incorrect. As noted above, 254 Or App at 156-57, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., agreed to plead guilty to criminal conduct alleged in the federal information, and the side letter agreement states that the federal government \u201cdeclines prosecution of Pfizer Inc or any of its subsidiaries (other than Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc as set forth in the Information) for conduct by or attributable to Pfizer Inc or any of its subsidiaries that[,]\u201d among other things, \u201cfalls within the scope of the Information to which Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., is pleading guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Thus, as a matter of law, the trade secrets exemption applies to Exhibits 1-4, 7-9, 11, 13-16, 18-19, 21-40, 44-73, 75-94, 96-101, and 103. Accordingly, our inquiry reduces to whether Exhibits 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109 \u2014which are not exempt from disclosure as trade secrets under ORS 192.502(9)(a) and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act because their core content has been publicly disclosed\u2014 are nevertheless exempt under some other provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>OPRL.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Specifically, we turn to whether those exhibits are exempt from disclosure as \u201cconfidential submissions\u201d under another provision of the <em>OPRL </em>\u2014 viz., ORS 192.502(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">2. <em>Confidential Submissions Exemption Under ORS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>192.502(4)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">ORS 192.502(4) exempts from disclosure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201c[i]nformation submitted to a public body in confidence and not otherwise required by law to be submitted, where such information should reasonably be considered confidential, the public body has obliged itself in good faith not to disclose the information, and when the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The trial court determined that the exemption is inapplicable both because Pfizer had been required by law to produce the exhibits and because the public interest would not suffer by the disclosure. On appeal, Pfizer contends that the court erred in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">We need not address Pfizer\u2019s contentions in that regard because DOJ, as an alternative basis for affirmance, contends that the confidential submissions exemption is inapplicable as a matter of law because, contrary to the trial court\u2019s determination, those exhibits are not of a nature that \u201cshould reasonably be considered confidential.\u201d In particular, DOJ notes that \u201c[m]uch of the information has been disclosed publicly[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">As previously explained, 254 Or App at 164-65, Exhibits 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109 are not exempt as trade secrets because their core content has been publicly disclosed. Given the circumstances of this case\u2014 including Pfizer\u2019s acknowledgement that Exhibits 10 and 12, which had been posted on the <em>New York Times\u2019 </em>website, are no longer exempt under the confidential submissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>exemption, 254 Or App at 165 n 15 \u2014 we conclude that, in addition to Exhibits 10 and 12, Exhibits 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109 are not exempt under the confidential submissions exemption as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">3. <em>Exemption of Annotated Complaint Because It Discloses Exhibits That Are Exempt Under OPRL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Having considered whether the exhibits are exempt under the OPRL as \u201ctrade secrets\u201d or \u201cconfidential submissions,\u201d we have ultimately concluded that, as a matter of law, Exhibits 1-4,7-9,11,13-16,18-19,21-40,44-73,75-94, 96-101, and 103 are exempt from disclosure as trade secrets. Thus, to the extent that the annotated complaint discloses information contained in those exhibits, it too is exempt from disclosure. To hold otherwise would permit disclosure of exhibits exempt as trade secrets under the OPRL contrary to the parties\u2019 confidentiality agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">4. <em>Exemption of Annotated Complaint and Exhibits Under ORS 192.502(9)(a) and ORCP 36 B(3) Restricting Disclosure of Attorney Work Product</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Finally, as did the trial court, we reject Pfizer\u2019s contention that the annotated complaint and the compilation of exhibits referred to therein are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL because DOJ \u201chad contractually obligated itself under the Confidentiality Agreements to protect its work product if such materials would otherwise be responsive to a public records request.\u201d In support of that contention, Pfizer relies on ORS 192.502(9)(a), which exempts from disclosure \u201c[p]ublic records or information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential or privileged under Oregon law.\u201d According to Pfizer, that exemption</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\u201cshields from disclosure in response to a public records request attorney work product materials, the disclosure of which is restricted under ORCP 36 B(3) (\u2018[T]he Court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Pfizer\u2019s contention, however, is fundamentally flawed. That is so because, as explained above, 254 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>App at 158-59, the confidentiality agreements limit DOJ\u2019s ability to disclose the exhibits that Pfizer itself <em>produced. </em>In other words, contrary to Pfizer\u2019s contention, DOJ is not contractually obligated to protect its own work product in the event that it is subject to a public records request. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in concluding that the annotated complaint and the compilation of exhibits to which it referred are not exempt from disclosure as \u201cattorney work product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In sum and for the reasons that we have explained, the confidentiality agreements obligate DOJ to withhold the Pfizer-produced exhibits to the extent that they are exempt from disclosure under the OPRL. We further conclude as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">(1) As a matter of law, Exhibits 1-4, 7-9, 11, 13-16, 18-19, 21-40, 44-73, 75-94, 96-101, and 103 are exempt as \u201ctrade secrets\u201dpursuant to ORS 192.502(9)(a) ofthe OPRL because their disclosure is \u201cprohibited or restricted or otherwise made confidential or privileged under Oregon law,\u201d viz., the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">(2) To the extent that the annotated complaint discloses information contained in those exhibits, it too is exempt from disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">(3) As a matter of law, Exhibits 10, 12, 17, 20, 41-43, 74, 95, 102, and 104-109 are not exempt under the OPRL as \u201cconfidential submissions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">(4) The annotated complaint and compilation of exhibits in its entirety is not exempt under the OPRL as \u201cattorney work product.\u201d Accordingly, as previously noted, those parts of the annotated complaint that do not disclose the content of exhibits exempt from disclosure are not themselves exempt from disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Accordingly, we reverse, in part, the trial court\u2019s denial of Pfizer\u2019s motion for summary judgment and allowance of DOJ\u2019s cross-motion and remand for the trial court to issue a declaration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Reversed in part and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> For ease of reference, the parties and the trial court used the term \u201cPfizer\u201d to refer to Pfizer Inc. as well as one of its subsidiaries, Pharmacia Corporation. For ease of reference and unless otherwise noted, we do the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> Although the pertinent provisions of the OPRL have been amended numerous times since the parties entered into their confidentiality agreements, those amendments do not affect our analysis; accordingly, we refer to the current version of those provisions throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> ORS 646.618(1) provides that a prosecuting attorney may, under certain circumstances, \u201cexecute in writing and cause to be served an investigative demand upon any person who is believed to have information, documentary material or physical evidence relevant to the alleged or suspected violation\u201d of two provisions of the UTPA that describe unlawful practices. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">\u201c[t]he investigative demand shall require such person, under oath or otherwise, to appear and testify, to answer written interrogatories, or to produce relevant documentary material or physical evidence for examination, at such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>reasonable time and place as may be stated in the investigative demand, or to do any of the foregoing, concerning conduct of any trade or commerce which is the subject matter of the investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\"><em>Id. </em>If the person on whom DOJ serves an investigative demand fails or refuses to obey it, the prosecuting attorney may request a court order to, among other things, \u201crestrain the person from engaging in conduct of any aspect of the trade or commerce that is involved in the alleged or suspected violation!.]\u201d ORS 646.626(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> The parties attribute no significance to the fact that the original 2003 agreement referred only to Pharmacia, and neither do we. Further, because the substance of both agreements is the same, throughout this opinion, we take our quotations from the 2005 agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\"> DOJ eventually served an investigative demand on Pfizer on February 9, 2006. Our understanding is that all but two of the exhibits at issue on appeal were produced before that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\"> In particular, the annotated complaint, which is 36 pages long and contains 96 footnotes, cites to and quotes from the exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\"> Two reporters also requested disclosure of the annotated complaint and supporting exhibits under the OPRL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> At this point, it is sufficient to note that ORS 646.461(4) defines the term \u201ctrade secret\u201d for purposes of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which, as noted, is incorporated into the OPRL through ORS 192.502(9)(a). The complete text of that provision is set out in our analysis below. 254 Or App at 160-61. In addition, ORS 192.501(2) defines the term for purposes of another OPRL exemption, which exempts \u201ctrade secrets\u201d from disclosure, \u201cunless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\"> To be precise, the trial court allowed Pfizer\u2019s motion and denied DOJ\u2019s cross-motion as to Exhibits 5 and 6 on the ground that they were exempt from disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>as trade secrets under the OPRL. DOJ does not cross-appeal to challenge that ruling. Thus, the only ruling on appeal is the trial court\u2019s denial of Pfizer\u2019s motion and allowance of DOJ\u2019s cross-motion and, for simplicity, we describe it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> <em>See </em>ORS 28.110 (\u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d); <em>State ex rel Dewberry v.

Public Utility Commission, </em>128 Or App 650, 658-59, 877 P2d 116, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 272 (1994) (\u201cCourts traditionally examine six factors in determining whether information constitutes a trade secret: (1) the extent to which the information is known outside the business; (2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken to safeguard the secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to the business or its competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended by the business in developing the information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\"> For tautologically obvious reasons, we do not recount those averments in particular detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"> ORCP 47 D provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule!,] an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of that party\u2019s pleading, but the adverse party\u2019s response, by affidavits, declarations or as otherwise provided in this section, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue as to any material fact for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, the court shall grant the motion if appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> Relatedly, after oral argument, DOJ filed a notice of probable mootness, asserting that Exhibits 10 and 12 had been quoted in a <em>New York Times </em>article and posted on the <em>New York Times\u2019 </em>website. In response, Pfizer acknowledged that, \u201c[i]n light of their release to the public,\u201d we \u201cneed not consider further the application of the trade secrets and confidential submissions exemptions to those two protected [exhibits].\u201d We accept Pfizer\u2019s acknowledgement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> For similar reasons, we also reject DOJ\u2019s contention that, because information about other drug companies\u2019 marketing strategies is widely available on the Internet, the exhibits at issue here are simply examples of the publicly available strategies employed by other companies. That other companies may\u2014 or may not \u2014 employ similar marketing strategies as a general matter does not contradict Pfizer\u2019s assertion, as substantiated without contradiction by the Gibney declaration, that the particulars of how Pfizer implemented its marketing strategy are not publicly known or could be of value to its competitors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b187-10\"> In that regard, DOJ\u2019s October 2008 press release states that, \u201c[d]ue to safety concerns, in 2004 and 2005 respectively, Vioxx\u201d \u2014 a drug produced by a competitor that like Bextra and Celebrex was \u201cdesigned to reduce pain and inflammation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>without the negative [gastrointestinal] side effects of traditional [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]\u201d such as \u201cIbuprofen (Advil\u00ae) and Naproxen (Aleve\u00ae)\u201d\u2014 and \u201cBextra were withdrawn from the market place and in 2005 [the Food and Drug Administration] required a \u2018black box\u2019 safety warning\u201d for Celebrex, which \u201cdenotes the serious risk of adverse effects from the drug.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\"> Pfizer also contends that those exhibits are exempt from disclosure under OES 192.501(2), which exempts trade secrets \u201cunless the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance.\u201d As explained above, 254 Or App at 164-65, the categorical exemption for trade secrets in ORS 192.502(9)(a) and the Uniform Trade Secrets Act did not apply as a matter of law to Exhibits 17,20,41-43,74,95, 102, and 104-109. For the same reasons, we reach the same conclusion under ORS 192.501(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
