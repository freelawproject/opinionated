In a single assignment of error, defendant argues that, in light of <em>State v. Portis, </em>233 Or App 256, 225 P3d 841 <em>(.Portis </em>7), <em>rev dismissed as moot, </em>348 Or 559, 236 P3d 718 <em>(Portis IT) </em>(2010), the trial court had no authority to enter that supplemental judgment. In <em>Portis I, </em>we held that House Bill (HB) 3508 (2009) authorizes entry of a supplemental judgment when a trial court determines that an inmate is for additional credits, but does not authorize entry of a supplemental judgment upon a determination that the inmate is <em>ineligible. </em>We therefore dismissed the appeal with instructions for the trial court to enter its decision as a nonappealable order rather than as a supplemental judgment. 233 Or App at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The state agrees that, in light of <em>Portis I, </em>\u201cthe trial court lacked the authority to enter the supplemental judgment,\u201d but points out that we need not direct the court to enter its decision as a nonappealable order because, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Portis II, </em>defendant\u2019s for consideration for earned time credits is now moot. 348 Or at 564-65 (describing effect of subsequent legislative changes to earned time credits). The state argues that \u201cthe appropriate remedy \u2014 and the only remedy suggested by defendant \u2014 is thus exceedingly narrow: dismiss the appeal and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to vacate the supplemental judgment concerning HB 3508 earned-time credits.\u201d We agree with the state\u2019s proposed resolution and dismiss the appeal so that the court can vacate the supplemental judgment denying defendant consideration for earned time credits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> The state correctly notes that the supplemental judgment is erroneously dated January 7, 2009; defendant\u2019s hearing concerning earned time credit was held on January 7, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
