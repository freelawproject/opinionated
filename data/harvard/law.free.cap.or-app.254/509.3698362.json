The trial court later granted defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment with respect to the aggravated murder conviction, vacated that conviction, and entered an amended judgment dismissing that charge. The state appeals, asserting that, in light of <em>State v. Dasa, </em>234 Or App 219, 227 P3d 228, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 173 (2010), the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment and in dismissing the aggravated felony murder charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant cross-appeals and raises seven assignments of error.

However, he asserts that <em>Dasa </em>was incorrectly decided and asks that it be overruled. We decline defendant\u2019s invitation and adhere to our analysis in <em>Dasa. </em>Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment and in entering an amended judgment dismissing the aggravated felony murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On appeal, order arresting judgment on Count 1 reversed and remanded, amended judgment vacated and remanded with instructions to reinstate conviction for aggravated murder, and for resentencing; on cross-appeal, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> In view of our resolution of that issue, we need not address the state\u2019s sentencing-related assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
