Further, \u201c[i]n analyzing whether consent to a search is voluntary, the relevant inquiry is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was the product of the defendant\u2019s free will or, conversely, was the result of express or implied coercion.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Stephens, </em>175 Or App 220, 225, 27 P3d 170 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Defendant managed an RV trailer park in Umatilla, where he lived in a converted bus and kept a shop behind his residence. On January 31,2007, during the investigation of an unrelated crime, an individual, Mercer, informed Umatilla County Sheriff\u2019s Office Detective Dixon that defendant had recently provided him methamphetamine. Mercer also told Dixon that defendant \u201chad a large cabinet of stolen jewelry *** in [defendant\u2019s] camp trailer.\u201d On February 15, Oregon State Trooper Wilson interviewed Barnes, an inmate in the Umatilla County Jail, regarding defendant\u2019s activities. Barnes told Wilson that he had purchased drugs from defendant and that Barnes thought that defendant had stored some stolen jewelry in what he believed to be defendant\u2019s \u201ccamp trailer.\u201d Based on those reports of defendant\u2019s drug activity, Wilson obtained a search warrant for defendant\u2019s bus and shop.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On February 21, 2007, defendant was at his residence when Dixon, Wilson, and nine other police officers arrived to execute the search warrant. Wilson told defendant that \u201cwe knew that [defendant had] been selling drugs out of his residence there and we were there to shut that operation down\u201d; defendant responded, \u201c[you] just did.\u201d Defendant cooperated when Wilson patted him down and led him to the back of a patrol car, where Wilson read defendant the search warrant and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant acknowledged that he understood those rights, and then admitted that the officers would find methamphetamine in his bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">During the search of defendant\u2019s bus and shop, officers discovered methamphetamine, drug paraphernalia, and property that had been reported stolen, including valuable china and Coca-Cola glassware and collectibles. Officers also found two bills of sale for a 1975 Prowler RV that was located in another space on the other side of the same RV park \u2014 and which had not been included within the scope of the search warrant. One of those bills of sale listed Travis Davis as the seller and Elton Long as the buyer. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>other listed Elton Long as the seller, and the space for the buyer\u2019s name had been left blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">When Dixon asked defendant about the RV, defendant asked to speak with Wilson. Defendant told Wilson that he was holding the RV for former park tenants, Davis and Long, for back rent that they owed and that it \u201cwas full of property * * * that he kind of figured * * * was stolen property.\u201d Specifically, defendant told Wilson that he \u201chad been in the trailer a couple of times and he [had seen] what he believed to be a gun that was wrapped up[,] *** a lot of Coca-Cola stuff, a TV set and some other property,\u201d which defendant maintained that Davis and Long had placed in the RV.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Because the RV was not included in the search warrant, Wilson asked defendant for consent to search. Defendant disclaimed ownership of the property in the RV and told Wilson that \u201che did not want to be charged with anything in the trailer,\u201d and that he would not consent to the search unless and until he had that \u201cin writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In response, Wilson altered a preprinted \u201cVoluntary Consent to Search\u201d form. Specifically, Wilson, in his own handwriting, inserted the language emphasized below, so that the consent form read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">\u201cI, <em>Patrick D. Marshall, </em>do hereby freely give the below signed peace officer (or any peace officer in the State of Oregon, as defined by ORS 161.015) consent to search the following described property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201c \u201975 <em>Prowler RV! trailer </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201cI certify that I have not been coerced, threatened, or made any promises concerning the results of such search, except those stipulated herein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\"><em>\u201cMr. Marshall is not responsible for the property stored inside the RV Trailer! MSW </em>[Trooper Wilson\u2019s initials]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">\u201cBy signing this form, I acknowledge that I am giving voluntary permission for this search!.] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">\u201cFurthermore, I understand that I have the right to refuse permission for the search; and that I can stop the search at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(Handwritten insertions emphasized.) Defendant signed the consent form, as so modified by Wilson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In the ensuing search of the RV, officers found, among other items, a flat-screen TV, a shotgun wrapped in a blanket, Coca-Cola glassware and collectibles, and a cabinet full of jewelry. Much of that property had been reported stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Based on the searches, defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of methamphetamine and unlawful possession of methamphetamine, as well as felon in possession of a firearm, ORS 166.270 (Count 3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and theft in the first degree by receiving, ORS 164.095 (Count 4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence found in the RV, arguing that his consent was involuntary because it was based on an improper <em>inducement </em>\u2014 viz., defendant understood Wilson\u2019s modification of the consent form to constitute a promise of immunity from prosecution for items found inside the RV, and, but for that assurance, defendant would never have consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">At the suppression hearing, Wilson testified on direct examination regarding the circumstances of defendant\u2019s purported consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Did [defendant] consent verbally to you going in [to the RV|?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201c[WILSON]: Yes. Before he did that, though, he wanted \u2014 he advised me that he didn\u2019t want to be charged with anything in the trailer and that he wanted that in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you promise him that you weren\u2019t going to charge him with anything found in the trailer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">\u201c[WILSON]: I did not promise Mr. Marshall anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">I advised him that if he wanted that written on the form, I would write that on the form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Wilson testified further on redirect:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Trooper Wilson, when you executed this agreement, or when you signed this paper, let\u2019s not even call it an agreement, why did you write this out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201c[WILSON]: The form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">\u201c[WILSON]: To obtain verbal consent from Mr. Marshall to look inside that trailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And when you wrote it out, was it your intention \u2014 was this what you were writing because you believed that this was the case? I mean, was this written by you at your own instigation, or why did you write it, beyond wanting consent to search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">\u201c[WILSON]: Why did I write that Mr. Marshall is not responsible for the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-15\">\u201c [WILSON]: Because that\u2019s what he wanted wrote [sic] on the form before he would give us consent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">For his part, defendant testified that he would not have consented to the search \u201cbut for\u201d the \u201cstipulation and agreement\u201d that he would not be charged in relationship to anything found in the RV.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">The trial court denied suppression. In doing so, the court stated that \u201c[t]here is no credible evidence from which to find that Wilson agreed and/or promised to give Defendant some type of immunity from prosecution in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>return for his voluntary consent to search the trailer.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, consequently, determined that defendant\u2019s consent to search the RV was voluntary. The jury found defendant guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Defendant appeals the judgment of conviction for felon in possession of a firearm and first-degree theft, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Defendant contends that the state failed to prove that he voluntarily consented to the search of the RV, because his consent was obtained by a false promise of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The state counters that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, because \u201c[t]he notation on the consent form merely memorialized defendant\u2019s asserted disclaimer of responsibility for the contents of his RV and was not a promise of immunity from prosecution.\u201d Furthermore, the state asserts that defendant\u2019s voluntariness argument relies on inapposite principles derived from case law concerning confessions. The state alternatively contends that, \u201c[inasmuch as defendant voluntarily told police that stolen property and guns were located in the RV trailer before he gave consent to search it, the police inevitably would have discovered the evidence at issue because they unquestionably would have secured a warrant had he refused consent.\u201d Finally, the state argues that, even if the court erroneously denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the error was harmless with respect to the theft conviction in light of the stolen property discovered during the course of the warranted (and indisputably lawful) search of defendant\u2019s bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">By way of reply, defendant remonstrates that the state\u2019s inevitable discovery argument is unreviewable, because of insufficient development of a record pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>to whether police would have been able to secure a warrant to search the RV. Defendant also, as described in detail below, <em>see </em>254 Or App at 434-35, proffers a closely reasoned response as to why the admission of the evidence from the RV could have affected the jury\u2019s assessment of his defense as to the items found in the bus and, thus, was not harmless with respect to his theft conviction. <em>See </em>ORS 164.055.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">With the arguments so joined, the central \u2014 and, ultimately, dispositive \u2014 issue in this case is whether Wilson\u2019s actions, with respect to obtaining defendant\u2019s consent to search the RV, so tainted that consent as to compel suppression. Under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, a warrantless search is <em>per se </em>unreasonable, unless the search falls within an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983). One such exception is voluntary consent to search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cUnder the consent exception to the warrant requirement, the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that someone having the authority to do so voluntarily gave the police consent to search the defendant\u2019s person or property and that any limitations on the scope of the consent were complied with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>State v. Weaver, </em>319 Or 212, 219, 874 P2d 1322 (1994) (citing <em>State v. Paulson, </em>313 Or 346, 351-52, 833 P2d 1278 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">When voluntariness is challenged, we \u201cexamine the totality of the facts and circumstances to see whether the consent was given by defendant\u2019s free will or was the result of coercion, express or implied.\u201d <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>290 Or 493, 502, 624 P2d 99 (1981). As with any exception to the warrant requirement, the state bears the burden of persuasion and must prove that defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Stevens, </em>311 Or at 137. In that regard, although we are, as noted, bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact, we \u201cmust assess independently the ultimate legal determination of voluntariness.\u201d <em>Acremant, </em>338 Or at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In <em>Weaver, </em>the Supreme Court identified four general categories of consent cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201cthose involving questions ofthe <em>voluntariness </em>ofthe consent, those involving the <em>authority </em>of the party consenting to the search, those involving questions of the <em>scope </em>of the consent, and those \u2018in which suppression of evidence obtained during a consent search may be necessary to vindicate a defendant\u2019s rights that were violated by earlier, unlawful police conduct.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">319 Or at 219 (quoting <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>317 Or 27, 39, 854 P2d 399 (1993)) (footnotes omitted; emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The touchstone of three of those \u201cconsent-to-search\u201d genres (all except \u201cauthority\u201d) is autonomous choice: The lawfulness of the warrantless search derives from, and is innately circumscribed by, the unimpaired autonomous choice of the person giving consent. Here, defendant posits that his \u201cconsent\u201d was elicited by \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d tactics of the investigating <em>officer </em>\u2014 viz., the giving of an illusory promise of immunity \u2014 and, thus, was not the product of autonomous choice. That is, his \u201cconsent\u201d was not consent at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">While defendant forthrightly acknowledges that there is no Oregon appellate decision holding that an illusory inducement abrogates an ostensible consent to search, he invokes our precedents addressing the effect of promises of leniency on the voluntariness of admissions elicited during police interviews. We agree with defendant that those cases are highly instructive in that they are grounded substantively, albeit not exclusively, on the imperatives of autonomous choice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>In <em>State v. Tanner, </em>236 Or App 423, 431, 236 P3d 775 (2010), we summarized the operative principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">\u201cVoluntariness requires that neither duress nor intimidation, <em>hope nor inducement </em>caused the defendant to confess. The test for voluntariness under Article I, section 12, is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the waiver of rights and the confession were the product of an essentially free, unconstrained and informed choice or <em>whether the accused\u2019s capacity for self-determination was critically impaired. Threats, promises, inducements, and similar overreaching by the police have consistently led to suppression of a defendant\u2019s resulting statements and confessions-, </em>by contrast, in the absence of police overreaching, challenges to the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statements or confessions have consistently failed. Under Article I, section 12, police overreaching is an essential predicate of a challenge to the admissibility of a statement or a confession as involuntary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">(Internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted; emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>State v. Goree, </em>151 Or App 621, 632, 950 P2d 919 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 123 (1998), describes the analytical framework with particular respect to inducements to confess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201cTo conclude that a defendant\u2019s will was overborne or that his capacity for self-determination was impaired by a promise of leniency requires findings that the defendant understood that there was, in fact, a promise of leniency, that the defendant\u2019s understanding to that effect was reasonable, that the defendant actually relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>on that promise in confessing and that the defendant was reasonable in doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">(Citing, <em>inter alia, State v. Aguilar, </em>133 Or App 304, 307-08, 891 P2d 668 (1995), and <em>State v. Pollard, </em>132 Or App 538, 549, 888 P2d 1054, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 138 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Pollard </em>is exemplary. There, the defendant was convicted of murder by abuse after his infant child died from numerous and severe injuries. 132 Or App at 540. The defendant sought to suppress inculpatory statements that he had made during a noncustodial interview with a detective, Grossman. <em>Id. </em>at 544. During that interview, Grossman told the defendant that he could help him obtain psychiatric treatment if he told Grossman what had happened to the infant. <em>Id. </em>at 547. The defendant had explained to Grossman that he had been abused by his own father and that he thought that might have something to do with how he had treated his child. <em>Id. </em>at 546. Grossman reiterated that he could \u201chelp\u201d the defendant only if he was \u201ctotally honest,\u201d and the defendant subsequently made various inculpatory statements. <em>Id. </em>at 547. The defendant filed a motion to suppress those statements, arguing that they had been \u201cinduced by the detective\u2019s implied promises of treatment instead of criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543. The trial court denied that motion, and the defendant was subsequently convicted of murder by abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On appeal, we determined that the defendant reasonably could have interpreted Grossman\u2019s statements as promises of treatment instead of prosecution. <em>Id. </em>We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">\u201cAn implied promise of immunity from prosecution is sufficient to compel suppression of a confession:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201c \u2018The precise form of words in which the inducement is presented to the prisoner\u2019s mind is immaterial. It is sufficient if they convey to him the idea of temporal benefit or disadvantage, and his confession follows in consequence of the hopes thereby excited.\u2019 <em>State v. Wintzingerode, </em>9 Or 153, 163 (1881).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 544. We concluded, in <em>Pollard, </em>that \u201c[t]he <em>quid pro quo </em>was apparent\u201d \u2014 and accordingly, we reversed and remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>for a new trial, because the state had \u201cfailed to sustain its burden of proving the voluntariness of [the] defendant\u2019s statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The application of the foregoing principles to the circumstances here is straightforward. <em>First, </em>defendant \u201cunderstood that there was, in fact, a promise\u201d of immunity, and his \u201cunderstanding to that effect was reasonable.\u201d <em>Goree, </em>151 Or App at 632. With due respect, and notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that there was no \u201cpromise of immunity,\u201d that determination is unsupported on this record. Rather, the record permits <em>only </em>the contrary determination. Whether an objectively reasonable person would have understood Wilson\u2019s amendment to the consent form to constitute a promise of immunity is a legal determination. <em>Accord State v. </em>Baker/<em>Jay, </em>232 Or App 112, 128, 221 P3d 749 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 280 (2010) (applying a reasonable person standard to limitations on the scope of consent and explaining that \u201c[o]nce the facts have been determined, the scope of consent is a question of law\u201d); <em>see also Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487-88, 443 P2d 261 (1968) (\u201c[W]e are not bound by a trial judge or jury\u2019s finding of voluntariness if we believe the historical facts upon which such finding is based are insufficient to meet constitutional standards.\u201d). Specifically, as noted, the preprinted text of the consent-to-search form, which immediately preceded Wilson\u2019s handwritten notation, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cI certify that I have not been coerced, threatened or <em>made any promises </em>concerning the results of such search, <em>except those stipulated herein.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(Emphasis added.) Immediately following, Wilson then inserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cMr. Marshall is not responsible for the property stored inside the RV Trailer!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Wilson acknowledged that he added that language because defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be charged with anything in the trailer and that he wanted that in writing * * * before he would give [his] consent.\u201d Given the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have believed that the terms of the written consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>form did, in fact, constitute a promise of immunity. <em>See, e.g., Aguilar, </em>133 Or App at 308 (explaining that we view the voluntariness of a confession from the perspective of a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><em>Second, </em>defendant actually relied on Wilson\u2019s promise in consenting to the search and that reliance was reasonable. <em>See Goree, </em>151 Or App at 632. Again, Wilson testified that he altered the voluntary consent form with a specific purpose of obtaining defendant\u2019s consent \u2014 and that defendant would not have otherwise consented. <em>See </em>254 Or App at 425. Thus, Wilson\u2019s testimony established that defendant, in giving his consent, actually relied on what he believed was a promise of immunity with respect to the contents of the RV. Further, that reliance was reasonable. Wilson, a law enforcement officer, inserted a qualifying disclaimer in an official form at a citizen\u2019s request. He never told defendant that he could not do so because of any purported lack of authority, much less tell defendant that, even if inserted, the ostensible assurance was illusory. Under those circumstances, a person in defendant\u2019s position could reasonably rely on the ostensible promise \u2014 as defendant did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Before proceeding with the balance of the analysis of the consequences of defendant\u2019s misbegotten consent to search, we pause to acknowledge that \u2014 as the state asserts \u2014 voluntariness with respect to statements given in response to police questioning and voluntariness with respect to consent to search are not congruent. Although each is fundamentally predicated on \u201cfree [and] unconstrained\u201d choice, <em>Tanner, </em>236 Or App at 431 (internal quotation marks omitted), the former also partakes of an additional <em>concern </em>\u2014 viz., that <em>any </em>material inducement, even a <em>real and substantial </em>(as opposed to illusory) inducement, might elicit a false confession. <em>State v. Nunn, </em>212 Or 546, 564, 321 P2d 356 (1958), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Neely, </em>239 Or 487, 395 P2d 557 (1964), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>239 Or 487, 398 P2d 482 (1965), <em>and State v. Brewton, </em>238 Or 590, 395 P2d 874 (1964). That concern, pertaining to the <em>reliability </em>of information obtained is, to be sure, generally inapposite in the context of consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to search. In all events, however, we need not determine here whether, if ever, the provision of some real inducement as consideration for consent to search could ever abrogate the voluntariness of such consent because here, at least, Wilson\u2019s false inducement subverted defendant\u2019s autonomous choice, rendering his purported consent involuntary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In sum, as in <em>Pollard, </em>132 Or App at 549, \u201c[t]he <em>quid pro quo </em>was apparent\u201d: But for Wilson\u2019s promise that he would not be held responsible for the contents of the RV, defendant would never have consented to the search of the RV. That promise proved to be false, as defendant was charged with evidence discovered during that search. Under those circumstances, defendant\u2019s \u201ccapacity for self-determination was critically impaired,\u201d <em>Tanner, </em>236 Or App at 431, abrogating his purported consent. The warrantless search of the RV did not fall within the consent exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The state asserts, nevertheless, that the denial of suppression (and defendant\u2019s consequent convictions) should be affirmed on an alternative basis: inevitable discovery. To prevail on that contention, the state must establish \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that certain proper and predictable investigatory procedures would have been utilized in the instant case, and (2) that those procedures inevitably would have resulted in the discovery of the evidence in question.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>300 Or 203, 226, 709 P2d 225 (1985), <em>cert den, </em>475 US 1141 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The state concedes that it did not raise that contention before the trial court and acknowledges that the record, as presented for our review, may be insufficiently developed to establish the requisites of \u201cinevitable discovery.\u201d That concession is well taken. Indeed, the record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>silent as to whether officers would have inevitably obtained a warrant and searched the RV in the absence of defendant\u2019s consent. Nonetheless, the state requests that we remand the case to allow the circuit court to further consider that matter. We decline to do so. The state, as the proponent of the evidence obtained from a warrantless search, had the opportunity \u2014 indeed, the obligation \u2014 to develop a record sufficient to substantiate any and all grounds on which it might seek to justify the admission of that evidence. To hold otherwise would invite piecemeal presentation and <em>seriatim </em>appeals of suppression disputes. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Finally, we address the state\u2019s harmless error contention. The state does not contend that the error was harmless with respect to defendant\u2019s conviction for felon in possession \u2014 nor could it so contend, because the weapon on which that conviction (Count 4) was predicated was found in the RV. However, with respect to the first-degree theft conviction, the state posits that, even if the trial court erroneously admitted the evidence from the RV, that error was harmless because \u201c [s] ufficient evidence of stolen property found inside [defendant\u2019s residence] established his guilt of first-degree theft wholly independent of anything found in his RV.\u201d In particular, the value of the stolen property found in defendant\u2019s residence far exceeded that required under ORS 164.055, even without reference to the property discovered during the unlawful search.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Defendant counters that, regardless of the value of the property found in his residence, admission of the items found in the RV could have prejudicially affected the jury\u2019s consideration of his purported culpable mental state. In particular, the theory of defense at trial was that defendant did not know that any of the property that he possessed <em>in his residence </em>was the subject of theft, and that he did not have a direct interest in the stolen property in the RV. According to defendant, the only evidence of defendant\u2019s awareness that he might possess stolen property was that defendant had told Wilson that he \u201cfigured\u201d that the property in the RV was stolen, including, specifically, Coca-Cola items similar to those found in his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Evidentiary error is harmless only if there is \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). \u201cIn that inquiry, we ask whether we can conclude that the admissible facts present such convincing evidence of guilt that it is highly unlikely that there were wavering jurors who would have voted for acquittal but for the inadmissible facts.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>253 Or App 277, 284, 290 P3d 827 (2012) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the error was not harmless. The state did not adduce any direct evidence that defendant knew that the stolen property that was found in his bus and shop \u201cwas the subject of theft.\u201d ORS 164.095. To be sure, the jury <em>could </em>have inferred that defendant had \u201cgood reason to know\u201d that the property that he had obtained was stolen. Nevertheless, in light of defendant\u2019s theory at <em>trial </em>\u2014 viz., that he did not know that any of the property in his bus had been stolen \u2014 and his admitted suspicion that the property in the RV had been stolen, we cannot conclude that there is \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the admission of the property found in the RV affected the verdict.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the error with respect to the denial of the motion to suppress was not harmless with respect to the theft conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Convictions on Counts 3 and 4 reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> Defendant was also convicted of unlawful distribution and possession of methamphetamine, but does not challenge those convictions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part, \u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> Because we reverse on state constitutional grounds, we do not reach defendant\u2019s alternative contention that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cmandates enforcement of a governmental promise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> Wilson testified that he \u201cfound out about\u201d the RV from Dixon after he \u201chad the search warrant done and signed by the judge,\u201d but before police executed the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b446-9\"> Shortly thereafter, while officers searched the RV, Wilson provided defendant another form, titled \u201cStatement of Facts.\u201d On that form, defendant added the following handwritten disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\u201cThe trailer in question was brought in my possession for back space rent.

That amendment does not affect our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> We note that, although we have never had occasion to hold that an illusory inducement abrogates a consent to search, we have, at least parenthetically, referred to the <em>absence </em>of \u201cpromises\u201d in <em>sustaining </em>a consent to search. <em>State v. Ry/Guinto, </em>211 Or App 298, 308, 154 P3d 724, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007) (noting that officer \u201cdid not raise his voice, draw a weapon, or employ any threats or <em>promises. </em>He simply requested consent ***.\u201d (footnote omitted; emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>at 308 n 7 (\u201cBut nothing that [the trooper] said or did indicated that defendants would receive <em>any benefit, </em>or be subjected to any detriment, based on whether they consented.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). <em>Accord State v.

Vondehn, </em>348 Or 462, 480-81, 236 P3d 691 (2010) (noting that a valid waiver of the right against self-incrimination must be both knowing and voluntary), <em>with State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 20, 115 P3d 908 (2005) <em>(\u201c[A]ny </em>case in which the state relies upon a defendant\u2019s consent to validate a warrantless search, the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary.\u201d (Emphasis in <em>Hall.)).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> The state suggests that Wilson\u2019s written statement did not \u201cinterfere[ ] with [defendant\u2019s] capacity for self-determination\u201d because <em>defendant, </em>and not Wilson, \u201cproposed and formulated the added wording to the consent form.\u201d That suggestion ignores the reality that Wilson, with full awareness that defendant would not execute the consent form without the qualifying language, inserted the disclaimer into the form, signifying the state\u2019s acceptance of that condition. It also, and just as significantly, ignores the reality that defendant\u2019s consent was, in fact, predicated on the assurance on which the state subsequently reneged. With respect, the principled extension of the state\u2019s logic would mean (in another context) that a seller\u2019s fraudulent agreement to a buyer\u2019s request for certain warranties did not \u201cinterfere with (the buyer\u2019s) capacity for self-determination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\"> Indeed, in closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized the connection between defendant\u2019s knowledge regarding the stolen property found in the RV and stolen property found in defendant\u2019s residence \u2014 that is, that the former corroborated culpable knowledge with respect to the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
