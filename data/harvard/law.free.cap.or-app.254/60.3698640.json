ORS 813.010. Defendant assigns error to (1) the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of his marijuana consumption and its effects and (2) the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that he operated his vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance. We reject the latter challenge with limited discussion, and we conclude that the court did not err in admitting the evidence concerning his marijuana use and its effects. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Clarke is a trained and certified drug recognition expert (DRE) who has conducted hundreds of DUII investigations. On April 9, 2009, Clarke was on patrol near State Street and Lancaster Drive in Salem. At about 1:00 a.m., Clarke saw a vehicle leave the parking lot of a tavern and turn west onto State Street, crossing a median curb placed there to keep cars from turning in that direction. Clarke followed the vehicle and pulled it over in the parking lot of a business a few blocks away. Clarke introduced himself to defendant, who was the driver. Clarke smelled a \u201clight\u201d odor of alcohol and noticed that defendant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, watery, and that he had droopy eyelids. Defendant also had dexterity problems; it took a few attempts before he was able to retrieve his license and registration and present them to Clarke. Defendant presented an Oregon identification card rather than a driver\u2019s license and told Clarke that his license was suspended for a previous DUII. He also told Clarke that \u201che had a couple drinks while at the bar.\u201d When he checked defendant\u2019s driving status, Clarke learned that defendant\u2019s license was suspended and that he was required to have an ignition interlock device on his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">At that point, Clarke asked defendant to perform field sobriety tests (FSTs). Defendant agreed, and after asking him some medical history questions, Clarke administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, the walk-and-turn test, the one-leg stand test, and the modified Romberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>internal clock test. Clarke did not complete the HGN test, but he nevertheless noted nystagmus in both of defendant\u2019s eyes. Clarke also noticed that defendant\u2019s pupils appeared to be dilated. On the walk-and-turn test, defendant exhibited two out of eight possible clues for impairment. On the one-leg stand, defendant exhibited one clue \u2014 a side-to-side sway\u2014 out of four possible clues for impairment. On the modified Romberg test \u2014 wherein the officer has the subject tilt his head back with closed eyes and estimate the passing of a certain amount of time \u2014 defendant estimated 34 seconds during what was actually 30 seconds. Clarke characterized defendant\u2019s performance as \u201cpassing\u201d on the one-leg stand, and stated that defendant\u2019s modified Romberg performance was \u201cwithin normal ranges.\u201d During both the one-leg stand and the walk-and-turn tests, Clarke observed that defendant had leg tremors. Clarke testified that leg tremors can be an indication of use of a controlled substance in addition to alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">During the modified Romberg test, defendant\u2019s eyelids trembled. Clarke stated that eyelid tremors also can signify the presence of a controlled substance other than alcohol. While still at the scene of the stop, Clarke measured defendant\u2019s pupils using a \u201cpupilometer,\u201d and found that both pupils were \u201cdilated for the lighting conditions.\u201d Clarke asked defendant to open his mouth and saw \u201craised taste buds near the back of his tongue [,]\u201d which Clarke knew to be an indicator of possible marijuana consumption. Defendant told Clarke that he had smoked marijuana the night before. Based on his training and experience, Clarke knew that a person could still be under the influence of marijuana 24 hours after smoking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Clarke arrested defendant for DUII and driving while suspended (DWS). A breath test administered at the jail showed that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.10. According to Clarke, if a subject\u2019s BAC on a breath test is higher than 0.08, a DRE does not conduct a DRE evaluation. Therefore, Clarke did not perform a DRE evaluation on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Defendant was charged by amended information with DUII under ORS 813.010(l)(c), and DWS, ORS 811.175. Before trial, defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>all evidence that Clarke might give concerning defendant\u2019s marijuana consumption and its effects. Defendant argued that the foundation for Clarke\u2019s testimony was inadequate because he had not conducted a complete DRE evaluation of defendant, and the observations that he made were at the roadside and not in the controlled setting required by the DRE protocol. Relying on <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995), defendant argued that, in the absence of a completed DRE, the physiological signs that Clarke observed in this case were not signs of controlled substance intoxication usually recognized or understood by most people, but rather, constituted scientific evidence that could not properly be admitted solely on the basis of an officer\u2019s \u201ctraining and experience.\u201d In sum, defendant asserted that the marijuana-related evidence was inadmissible to show that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance because it misleadingly conveyed the stature of an approved scientific methodology in that the methodology had not been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The trial court took defendant\u2019s motion under advisement, indicating that it would \u201cmake a decision as to what [it could] consider and what [it could not] and let the parties know what [its] decision [was] and go from there.\u201d In the ensuing bench trial, the state adduced Clarke\u2019s testimony described above. At the close of the state\u2019s casein-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had operated his vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance. Although defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence that he had driven under the influence of alcohol, he asserted that, because the state had pleaded the charge as a \u201ccombination\u201d DUII under ORS 813.010(l)(c), it was required, but had failed, to show that marijuana use had contributed to his alcohol intoxication. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. At the close of evidence, the trial court took the case under advisement and indicated that it would announce its decision on the motion <em>in limine </em>when it rendered its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In a letter opinion, the trial court found defendant guilty of both charged offenses. In support of its verdict, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>trial court enumerated 28 findings of fact. In particular, defendant focuses on the following findings that the court made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">\u201c15. Clarke observed tremors in defendant\u2019s lead leg while he was standing and that the pupils of defendant\u2019s eyes were dilated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201c16. Clarke testified that based on his law enforcement training, education, and experience, leg tremors and dilated pupils are \u2018indicators\u2019 of possible consumption of a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201c18.

Based on Clarke\u2019s training and experience, raise[d] buds are an indicator of cannabis consumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201c20.

The evidence is insufficient to establish that defendant was driving under the influence of marijuana, alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">The trial court also made the following pertinent findings of fact, to which defendant does not refer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-17\">\u201c22. Testing of defendant\u2019s breath revealed a .10% blood alcohol level about one hour and 6 minutes after the stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-18\">^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201c26. The evidence establishes that defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">To place defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal in proper perspective, we first consider the nature of the DUII charge in this case. As noted, the amended information charged defendant with DUII under ORS 813.010(l)(c), which provides that a person commits that offense if the person drives while \u201cunder the influence of any combination of intoxicating liquor, an inhalant and a controlled substance.\u201d Where the evidence is sufficient to establish that the defendant drove while impaired, and the defendant admitted the recent use of both alcohol and a controlled substance, a trier of fact can find that the defendant was under the combined influence of alcohol and a controlled substance without additional evidence that ingestion of the controlled substance caused the defendant\u2019s impairment. <em>See State v. Harmon, </em>239 Or App 587, 592, 244 P3d 910 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 654 (2011) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that, to prove a combined alcohol-controlled substance DUII, the state must adduce \u201cadditional evidence of causation beyond the evidence of his admissions and impairment []\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">By contrast, when a charging instrument alleges that the defendant has driven solely under the influence of a controlled substance under ORS 813.010(l)(b), it is necessary to establish that the influence of the controlled substance alone unlawfully impaired the defendant\u2019s operation of his or her vehicle. In such circumstances, it is common for the state to introduce evidence of impairment through DRE evidence. <em>See State v. Sampson, </em>167 Or App 489, 491, 6 P3d 543, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 361 (2000) (describing the DRE protocol as \u201ca 12-step procedure performed by a trained officer that purports to determine whether a subject is under the influence of a controlled substance\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In <em>Sampson, </em>we concluded that the procedure and results of the DRE protocol are admissible as scientific evidence in a DUII-controlled substance prosecution to show that a defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance. 167 Or App at 512. We noted, however, that the state still must establish, in each case, that the DRE officer was properly qualified to administer the protocol, that the officer administered it properly, and that the results were accurately recorded. <em>Id. </em>The admissibility of the complete DRE protocol as scientific evidence does not demonstrate the general admissibility of each component of the protocol. Rather, \u201cin <em>Sampson, </em>we approved the 12-step DRE protocol as scientific evidence because its complete administration by a competent examiner qualified for admission as scientific evidence ***.\u201d <em>State v. Aman, </em>194 Or App 463, 472, 95 P3d 244 (2004), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>339 Or 281 (2005). Further, in <em>Aman, </em>we concluded that an incompletely administered DRE protocol is not admissible as scientific evidence, although we noted that evidence of individual components of the DRE protocol were not necessarily inadmissible as nonscientific evidence of impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 473; <em>see also State v. Hernandez, </em>227 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Or App 319, 324, 206 P3d 197 (2009) (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that individual components of an incomplete DRE protocol were admissible as nonscientific expert evidence where the state failed to identify which of the protocol were nonscientific).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The state\u2019s theory in this case was that defendant was guilty of operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol and that, at least to some extent, his use of marijuana had contributed to his impairment. Thus, at trial, the state\u2019s primary focus was on evidence pertaining to defendant\u2019s alcohol intoxication. As noted, although Clarke was a trained DRE, he explained that had not completed the full DRE protocols after defendant\u2019s BAC was measured at .10 on the breath test. Likewise, Clarke did not testify that defendant had operated his vehicle under the influence of a controlled substance, although he did opine that defendant had operated his vehicle while intoxicated. In short, the state\u2019s theory was that defendant had operated his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and that his ingestion of marijuana in the previous 24 hours had materially contributed to the extent of his intoxication. <em>See, e.g., State v. Stiles, </em>165 Or App 584, 594, 998 P2d 703 (2000) (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018being under the influence of a controlled substance,\u2019 as used in ORS 813.010(2), necessarily encompasses all cases in which the state contends that the defendant\u2019s use of a controlled substance materially contributed to culpable impairment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The evidence regarding defendant\u2019s consumption of marijuana and its effects was tailored accordingly. That evidence showed that, while Clarke was investigating defendant for DUII, defendant exhibited several indicators of impairment by a controlled substance. Defendant\u2019s pupils were dilated, his leg trembled during field-sobriety tests, and his eyelids trembled \u2014 all signs, according to Clarke\u2014 of impairment that are unexpected when a person is solely under the influence of alcohol. Because of his training and experience in recognizing the signs of controlled-substance use, Clarke suspected that defendant had used marijuana. Clarke asked defendant to open his mouth; defendant complied, and Clarke saw that defendant\u2019s taste buds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>were raised on the back of his tongue, which Clarke also recognized as consistent with marijuana use. Based on those indicators, Clarke asked defendant whether he had used marijuana, and defendant admitted that he had used it the night before. Clarke testified that, based on his training and experience, the effects of marijuana can persist for 24 hours.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That array of evidence was sufficient to submit the combination alcohol-marijuana DUII theory to the trier of fact under <em>Harmon. </em>Thus, if that evidence was admissible, it was sufficient to defeat defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">For two reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the marijuana evidence as inadmissible scientific evidence. First, at least some of the evidence was nonscientific expert opinion evidence that was admissible under OEC 702. Under that rule, where \u201cscientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d In <em>State v. Rambo, </em>250 Or App 186, 279 P3d 361 (2012), we held that, where a DRE protocol was not completed, an investigating officer nevertheless could opine, based on his or her expertise, that the defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance based on the defendant\u2019s performance of tests that \u2014 although also included in the DRE protocol \u2014 do not improperly convey that they were conducted as part of an approved scientific methodology. So, for example, in <em>Rambo, </em>we upheld the trial court\u2019s admission of such opinion testimony based on evidence \u201crelating to [the] defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content, her statements, the HGN test, her performance on the field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sobriety tests, her pupil size, and the needle injection sites on her body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Echoing defendant\u2019s argument here, in <em>Rambo, </em>the defendant had argued that, \u201c[e]ven if there were mixed scientific and nonscientific components, the end result is that [the officer] was integrating scientific tests to form a larger scientific conclusion, giving the imprimatur of science to his opinion when his opinion has not been established as scientific absent a urinalysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193. Our reasoning in rejecting that argument informs our analysis in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cIn <em>Aman, </em>the vice of admitting opinion evidence of an incompletely administered DRE protocol was that the DRE officer not only had testified at length about his training and experience, he also testified at length about the \u2018details of the 12-step protocol.\u2019 <em>Aman, </em>194 Or App at 471. In contrast, here, the evidence showed that [the officer] was qualified, by virtue of considerable training and experience, to recognize the symptoms of drug impairment in the course of a DUII investigation. Based on such training and experience, police officers can \u2014 and frequently do \u2014 testify as to their opinions of whether an individual was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. <em>See, e.g., State v. Chatelain, </em>347 Or 278, 281, 220 P3d 41 (2009) (\u2018[0]ne of the arresting officers testified that defendant \u201cshow[ed] all the classic signs of [being under the influence of] some sort of stimulant\u201d: he \u201cwas real fidgety,\u201d seemed \u201creally, really, extremely anxious,\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop messing with his clothes.\u2019\u201d); <em>State v. Moore, </em>334 Or 328, 332, 49 P3d 785 (2002) (officer \u2018testified that, when he arrived at the scene, defendant was intoxicated\u2019); <em>State v. Vantress, </em>195 Or App 52, 55, 96 P3d 867 (2004) (officer \u2018testified that defendant\u2019s leaning conduct was \u201cpretty common with intoxicated drivers\u201d in his experience as an officer\u2019); <em>State v. Kimsey, </em>182 Or App 193, 196, 47 P3d 916 (2002) (officer testified that defendant \u2018seemed to be intoxicated\u2019). The fact that they may rely in part on independently admissible scientific evidence, such as blood alcohol content and HGN test results, to reinforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>their opinions, does not render those opinions inadmissible as unqualified scientific evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u201cAlthough the line we draw may be fine, it is not artificial. Specialized expert opinion evidence based on a witness\u2019s training and experience draws its force from that training and experience, but not necessarily from the mantle of science. Unlike in <em>Aman </em>and <em>[State </em>v]. <em>Marrington </em>[335 Or 555, 561-63, 73 P3d 911 (2003)], here, the officer did not \u2014 apart from his reference to independently admissible scientific tests \u2014 rely on the vocabulary of science, nor did he suggest that his conclusions had been reached through the application of a scientific method to collected data. The trial court\u2019s ruling scrupulously sanitized the record of any evidence of a scientifically-based protocol, thereby mitigating the risk that [the officer\u2019s] testimony would be given unfair weight beyond the credentials that he claimed. The trial court did not err in admitting the challenged evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><em>Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 194-95 (emphasis omitted). In this case, some, or most, of the FSTs that Clarke administered may have been admissible under OEC 702, because they were neither part of the DRE protocol nor otherwise suggestive of a scientific methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">However, Clarke\u2019s testimony concerning the dilation of defendant\u2019s pupils is more problematic. In that regard, defendant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">\u201cOAR 257-025-0012 provides that \u2018pupil size estimation,\u2019 an approved FST, may be performed only by \u2018officers who have completed the 8-hour \u201cDrugs That Impair Driving\u201d curriculum].]\u2019 Determining \u2018pupil size under varying light intensities\u2019 is part of an approved test that only an officer who has completed DRE training and been certified as a DRE may use. Clarke employed both types of pupil size evaluation. First, he estimated that defendant\u2019s pupils were dilated more than normal. Next, Clarke actually performed an approximation of the DRE pupil evaluation in which the DRE examines the sides of the subject\u2019s pupils under indirect light and determines their size using a \u2018pupilometer.\u2019 He testified that the state of defendant\u2019s pupils was consistent with marijuana consumption. Both the test and the conclusion were scientific evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>As noted, in <em>Rambo, </em>we approved the trial court\u2019s admission as nonscientific expert evidence of an officer\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s pupil size. However, the trial court in that case had excluded under OEC 403 a portion of the state\u2019s proffer, in particular, \u201cthe darkroom test\u201d which, as an element of the determination of \u201cpupil size under varying light intensities\u201d at issue here, is a part of the DRE protocol that may only be administered by a DRE officer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 189.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Rambo, </em>we did not consider whether the admission of such evidence was improper in the absence of a particularized scientific foundation or a completed DRE protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">However, we need not determine whether the pupil-dilation evidence was scientific in nature because, even if it was, defendant\u2019s challenge to its admission is not well taken. As discussed, like the defendant in <em>Rambo, </em>defendant has consistently asserted that the officer\u2019s testimony \u2014 including the pupil dilation evidence \u2014 was inadmissible to show that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance because it falsely conveyed the imprimatur of an approved scientific methodology that had not been completed. Here, however, Clarke did not opine, based on his DRE training, that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance because he had dilated pupils. As the trial court found, Clarke testified that, \u201cbased on his law enforcement training, education, and experience, *** dilated pupils are \u2018indicators\u2019 of <em>possible </em>consumption of a controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>substance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In fact, Clarke never opined that defendant was currently under the influence of a controlled substance at all; rather, he abandoned that focus when it became apparent to him that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. After that point, and throughout trial, the focus of this case instead was on whether defendant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana within 24 hours of his arrest had materially contributed to his alcohol intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Because of the narrow purpose for which the marijuana-related evidence was proffered and received, the trial court did not improperly infer that the eye-dilation evidence was part of a scientific protocol that showed that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance at the time of the offense. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the challenged marijuana-related evidence \u2014 including the eye dilation evidence \u2014 on the ground that it was scientific evidence of controlled substance intoxication that was inadmissible in the absence of a completed DRE.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ATe\"> Those steps are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201c1.
