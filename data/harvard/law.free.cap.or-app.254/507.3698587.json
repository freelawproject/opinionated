Haley, </em>254 Or App 410, 296 P3d 560 (2012), this case is on remand from the Supreme Court. <em>SAIF Corporation v. Preston, </em>352 Or 564, 291 P3d 736 (2012). In our earlier decision, 242 Or App 571, 256 P3d 160 (2011), we held that claimant was not entitled to an insurer-paid attorney fee under ORS 656.382(2) (2007)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because, although SAIF had at one point challenged her entitlement to permanent partial disability and she ultimately prevailed, she did not prevail at the same hearing that considered SAIF\u2019s challenge; rather, she prevailed at a subsequent hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board. We relied on our decision in <em>SAIF v. DeLeon, </em>241 Or App 614, 251 P3d 794 (2011). The Supreme Court has now reversed that decision, <em>SAIF v. DeLeon, </em>352 Or 130, 282 P3d 800 (2012), and held that the claimant in that case was entitled to insurer-paid attorney fees because she <em>ultimately </em>prevailed after the insurer had challenged her award at an <em>earlier </em>stage \u2014 the same circumstances as here. On remand, therefore, we reinstate the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board order and the insurer-paid attorney fees that the board awarded. <em>Accord Haley, </em>254 Or App at 411-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> ORS 656.382(2) (2007) provides, in. part:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u201cIf a request for hearing ** * * is initiated by an employer or insurer, and the * * * board * * * finds that the compensation awarded to a claimant should not be disallowed or reduced, the employer or insurer shall be required to pay to the claimant or the attorney of the claimant a reasonable attorney fee * * * for legal representation by an attorney for the claimant at and prior to the hearing * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
