J.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Defendant Terry Emmert was a member of plaintiff Evergreen West Business Center, LLC (Evergreen), a limited liability company formed to purchase and develop property located in Washington County. Evergreen purchased the property with a loan from West Coast Bank, but eventually fell behind on payments and was at risk of losing the property to foreclosure. According to Evergreen, Emmert agreed to work with West Coast Bank to postpone the foreclosure, but, rather than do as promised, Emmert instead purchased the note and trust deed to the property from West Coast Bank, allowed the foreclosure sale to proceed, and then purchased the property for himself at the trustee\u2019s sale \u2014 all without notifying any of Evergreen\u2019s other members.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Evergreen then brought this action alleging that Emmert had breached a fiduciary duty to Evergreen by secretly acquiring the property. The complaint sought damages or, alternatively, imposition of a constructive trust whereby the property would be sold and the proceeds distributed to Evergreen\u2019s creditors and its members; Evergreen later amended the complaint to request punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">A jury returned a verdict in Evergreen\u2019s favor, awarding nominal damages of $1 but punitive damages in the amount of $600,000. Neither side was satisfied with that verdict. Emmert asked the trial court to reduce the punitive damages award, arguing that the 600,000-to-l ratio of punitive to compensatory damages violated his right to due process. Evergreen, for its part, asked the court to rule on the remedy of a constructive trust as an alternative to the jury\u2019s nominal damages award, but wanted to keep the punitive damages component.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The trial court ruled that, given the $1 economic damages award, a punitive damages award of $600,000 was grossly excessive, and, adhering to case law that suggested a 4-to-l ratio as the outer limit permitted under the Due Process Clause, the court reduced the punitive damages award to $4. The court also ruled that Evergreen was entitled to the imposition of a constructive trust and allowed Evergreen to between the two remedies \u2014 a $5 verdict (the nominal award plus punitive damages) or imposition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>constructive trust without any punitive damages. Evergreen chose the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Emmert now appeals the ensuing judgment against him, arguing that he did not owe any fiduciary duty to Evergreen, did not breach any such duty, and was not unjustly enriched at Evergreen\u2019s expense. He also argues that the court erred in imposing a constructive trust remedy that would exceed the $1 jury award of economic damages, and in failing to credit him for his expenditures on the property after he acquired it. Evergreen cross-appeals, arguing that the court erred in reducing the punitive damages award and in concluding that punitive damages are not available in conjunction with an equitable remedy. For the reasons that follow, we reverse on appeal and on cross-appeal, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Unless otherwise noted, we state the facts in the light most favorable to Evergreen, the prevailing party at trial. <em>Liles v. Damon Corp., </em>345 Or 420, 423, 198 P3d 926 (2008). In 2001, Brad Taggart, John Hoffard, Carl Senour, and Emmert formed Evergreen, a manager-managed limited liability company. The company was formed to purchase a 4.57-acre parcel and develop that property as a small business park that would have Senour, a cabinet maker, as the anchor tenant. Evergreen purchased the property for $846,044, most of which ($552,500) was borrowed from West Coast Bank and secured by a trust deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">While the property was being developed, the acquisition loan matured, and, in March 2004, West Coast Bank notified Evergreen that the bank intended to foreclose the trust deed on the property. Taggart, who was Evergreen\u2019s manager, sought a new loan in the amount of $3.4 million to pay off the acquisition loan and to fund construction on the property. That loan application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Taggart then approached Emmert about Evergreen\u2019s financial situation, and the two agreed to work on a two-step process to obtain financing. First, Evergreen would obtain a \u201cbridge loan\u201d of $900,000 to pay off West Coast Bank and a few other parties. Second, Evergreen would obtain separate construction financing. Emmert suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>that Taggart contact Bob Dyer, a banker at Oregon Pacific Banking Company, with whom Emmert had done other business. Taggart did so, and Dyer told him that <em>\u201ca </em>small loan\u201d of $900,000 \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Dyer, though, was in the process of leaving Oregon Pacific Banking Company and preferred to take the loan application with him to his future employer, Premier West Bank. After Dyer joined Premier West Bank, he asked Taggart for a new appraisal of the property and an explanation of how the $900,000 in loan proceeds would be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In the meantime, West Coast Bank advised Taggart that the scheduled foreclosure sale was being postponed to September 15, 2004. Taggart assured a loan officer for West Coast Bank that the bridge loan from Premier would be approved and would allow Evergreen to pay off the promissory note, but West Coast Bank required \u201csomething in good faith\u201d \u2014 namely, a $50,000 payment toward the loan \u2014 to further delay the foreclosure proceedings while the bridge financing was finalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Taggart then met with Emmert and explained West Coast Bank\u2019s demand for a $50,000 payment to postpone the foreclosure sale beyond September 15. At that point, Emmert told Taggart to \u201cdo nothing but focus on this [bridge] loan with Bob Dyer\u201d at Premier West Bank and that Emmert himself \u201cwill take care of the West Coast Bank loan.\u201d From time to time after that discussion, Taggart asked Emmert about the West Coast Bank situation, and Emmert told Taggart \u201cnot to worry about it; that he [Emmert] was taking care of it and he had everything under control].]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Emmert, it turned out, was negotiating with West Coast Bank \u2014 but not for the benefit of Taggart or Evergreen. Rather, beginning in early September 2004, Emmert began negotiating to purchase the promissory note and related trust deed from West Coast Bank. On September 15, Emmert paid $50,000 to West Coast Bank to postpone the foreclosure sale. From that point, West Coast Bank sent letters only to Emmert; it did not copy Taggart on a letter stating that the foreclosure was rescheduled to October 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Despite status inquiries from Taggart, Emmert never disclosed that he was in the process of purchasing the underlying promissory note and trust deed to Evergreen\u2019s property Rather, Emmert allowed Taggart to continue working with Dyer to obtain a $900,000 loan for Evergreen. On September 22,2004, in response to Dyer\u2019s earlier request for an explanation of how those loan proceeds would be used, Taggart drafted an explanation and sent it to Emmert for his approval. Emmert approved the draft, and Taggart sent the explanation to Dyer on September 27, 2004. Dyer then told Taggart that he was leaving on a hunting trip and would process the loan application when he returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Emmert, though, told Dyer not to proceed with that bridge loan to Evergreen because Emmert had \u201cworked something out\u201d with the noteholder, West Coast Bank. And Emmert had worked something out: the purchase of the note. On October 14, 2004, the day before the scheduled foreclosure sale, Emmert purchased the note and trust deed from West Coast Bank for $563,979.49. Emmert signed the assignment of the note and trust deed on October 21, 2004. The following day, Emmert\u2019s attorney as trustee, held a foreclosure sale. Emmert bid on and obtained the property himself, at a total investment of $613,979.49. An appraisal obtained for the Premier West Bank loan, and dated one month earlier, had valued the property at $1,390,000. After purchasing the property for himself, Emmert then used the property as security to obtain, in his own name, the $900,000 loan from Premier West Bank to develop the property</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Evergreen subsequently filed this action for breach of fiduciary duty Evergreen alleged, among other contentions, that Emmert \u201cagreed to provide financial assistance to [Evergreen] in order to avoid the pending foreclosure and to obtain said development loan * **[,]\u201d and that, instead of doing so, Emmert \u201cpurchased the lender\u2019s note and trust deed from the lender and then foreclosed on said real property and took ownership of it for his own account, all without notifying [Evergreen] or the other members that he was doing or had done so.\u201d Evergreen sought alternative remedies: On the one hand, Evergreen alleged that Emmert \u201cobtained title to said real property by fraud and breach of his fiduciary duty\u201d and asked the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>to \u201cdeclare that Defendant Emmert holds title to said real property in trust for Plaintiff and said members\u201d and \u201csaid real property [be] sold for the benefit of [Evergreen], and the proceeds distributed first to creditors and then to members as their interests may appear.\u201d Alternatively, Evergreen alleged that it was \u201cdamaged in a sum to be determined at trial, but not less than $800,000.\u201d Later, Evergreen was allowed to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The breach of fiduciary duty claim was tried to a jury. As to the of the claim, the jury was instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cTo recover for breach of fiduciary duty, the plaintiff must prove, one, the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties; two, a breach of one or more of the fiduciary duties arising out of that relationship; and three, damage to the plaintiff resulting from a breach of one or more of those duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The jury was further instructed that, under Oregon law, \u201cA member of a limited liability company who is not also a manager, owes no duties to the limited liability company or other members solely by reason of being a member.\u201d In the event of a breach of fiduciary duty, the jury was told, \u201cthen the non-breaching party is entitled to any profits made by the breaching party as a result of the breach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The jury returned a verdict in which it found that Emmert had breached a fiduciary duty to Evergreen. As for damages, the jury awarded Evergreen $1 in economic damages and $600,000 in punitive damages. At that point, Emmert filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and a motion to reduce the punitive damages award. In his JNOV motion, Emmert argued that, as a member of Evergreen, he owed no duty to Evergreen or its other members under ORS 63.155(9), which provides that, for manager-managed LLCs like Evergreen, \u201c[a] member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the limited liability company or the other members solely by reason of being a member [.]\u201d In his motion regarding punitive damages, Emmert argued that the $600,000 award was grossly excessive in light of the nominal damages awarded; he asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the court to \u201ceither grant a JNOV with regard to punitive damages, or reduce the punitive damages award to $4\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In response to those motions, Evergreen defended the jury\u2019s determinations regarding the breach of fiduciary duty and the punitive damages award, but it also asked the court to impose a constructive trust as an alternative to the jury\u2019s damages award. Evergreen argued that \u201cthe measure of damage is the profit available to Defendant Emmert\u201d but that \u201cthe jury concluded that Defendant Emmert has not yet received any profit. The jury recognized in accordance with the evidence, that at any time Defendant Emmert can obtain profit, but apparently they concluded that they could not tell how much he would receive.\u201d Thus, Evergreen argued, the property should be subject to a constructive trust and sold such that Emmert \u201cwill be entitled to the $613,979.49 that he paid for the note and trust deed, and Plaintiff will be entitled to the balance of the proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">After a hearing on the various motions, the trial court reduced the punitive damages award from $600,000 to $4, concluding that anything greater than an award of four times the $1 economic damages award would violate due process. <em>See Goddard v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>344 Or 232, 259-61, 179 P3d 645 (2008) (explaining that punitive damage awards in cases of purely economic injury should generally be limited to a 4-to-l ratio). The court also concluded that imposition of a constructive trust was available to Evergreen as an alternative remedy, but that the equitable relief could not be joined with a punitive damages award. Faced with the choice between a $5 award and the imposition of a constructive trust, Evergreen the latter remedy. The court then entered a judgment \u201cthat Plaintiff Evergreen West Business Center, LLC is granted a constructive trust of the Property\u201d and that the \u201cProperty shall be sold by [Evergreen]. From the proceeds [Evergreen] shall repay to [Emmert] the first $613,979.49. [Emmert] shall be responsible for paying any obligations for which [Emmert] has pledged the Property. To the extent [Emmert] does not do so, and proceeds from the sale of the Property are used to pay [Emmert\u2019s] debt in excess of $613,979.49, [Evergreen] shall be entitled to a supplemental judgment for any such sums.\u201d Emmert appeals that judgment, and Evergreen cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">A. <em>Emmert\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We begin by addressing Emmert\u2019s first and second assignments of error on appeal because our resolution of those assignments obviates the need to address many of the remaining issues in the case. Emmert\u2019s first two assignments of error concern the trial court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Although Evergreen pleaded a claim for \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d \u201cthe concept of constructive trust does not stand on its own as a substantive claim, but exists solely as an equitable remedy, available to divest an individual who has been unjustly enriched of property that he or she ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy.\u201d <em>Tupper v. Roan, </em>349 Or 211, 219, 243 P3d 50 (2010) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). For that reason, the \u201cconcepts of constructive trust and unjust enrichment thus are intertwined: When \u2018the law employs a constructive trust, the doctrine of unjust enrichment governs generally the substantive rights of the parties.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Barnes v. Eastern and Western Lbr. Co., </em>205 Or 553, 597, 287 P2d 929 (1955)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Oregon cases do not \u201cprovide any really comprehensive exposition of that doctrine\u201d but instead \u201csimply describe the kinds of actions and circumstances that would constitute unjust enrichment warranting imposition of a constructive trust, and then observe that the concept extends to other similar acts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. For purposes of this case, suffice it to say that those circumstances include \u201cwhen a person in a fiduciary or confidential relationship acquires or retains property in violation of a duty impressed upon him by that relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Albino v. Albino, </em>279 Or 537, 550, 568 P2d 1344 (1977)). The remedy is limited to those circumstances in which there is no other remedy available. <em>See Belton v. Buesing, </em>240 Or 399, 409, 402 P2d 98 (1965) (constructive trust is a \u201cremedial institution invented by equity to avoid unjust enrichment in situations where there is no other available equitable remedy\u201d); <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>206 Or App 239, 251, 136 P3d 745, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 449 (2006) (\u201cOregon courts impose constructive trusts as remedial devices to avoid unjust enrichment when no other adequate remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>is available.\u201d); <em>see generally Alsea Veneer, Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>318 Or 33, 43, 862 P2d 95 (1993) (\u201cEquitable relief does not lie if there is an adequate remedy at law\u201d; \u201cremedy at law must be practical, efficient, and adequate, as full a remedy as that which can be obtained in equity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">With those precepts in mind, we turn to the trial court\u2019s imposition of a constructive trust. Emmert\u2019s first two assignments of error advance three reasons why the court erred in imposing that equitable remedy: (1) Emmert did not owe any fiduciary duty to Evergreen; (2) if he did owe a duty, he did not breach it; and (3) the jury determined his \u201cunjust benefit\u201d to be nominal and, for that reason, \u201cthe constructive trust should either not have been imposed (because the legal remedy of damages would be adequate as a matter of law) or limited to payment of $1 from the sale of the Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The first two of those arguments merit little discussion. Emmert\u2019s concept of fiduciary duties is premised on a misreading of ORS 63.155, a statute concerning fiduciary duties for members and managers of limited liability companies. Section 9 of that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cIn a manager-managed limited liability company:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201c(a) A member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the limited liability company or the other members solely by reason of being a member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201c(b) A manager is held to the same standards of conduct prescribed for members in subsections (2) to (8) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201c(c) A member who, pursuant to an operating agreement, exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the limited liability company\u2019s business is held to the standards of conduct described in subsections (2) to (8) of this section to the extent that the member exercises the managerial authority vested in a manager by this chapter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">\u201c(d) A manager is relieved of liability imposed by law for violation of the standards prescribed by this section to the extent, if any, of the managerial authority delegated to the members who are not also managers by an operating agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>According to Emmert, that statutory scheme should be construed so that \u201cany fiduciary duty owed by one member to another (or to the company) is to be strictly limited to managerial duties imposed on that member by the Operating Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">ORS 63.155(9), however, addresses an LLC member\u2019s fiduciary duties <em>\u201csolely </em>by reason of being a member\u201d and when a member, \u201cpursuant to an operating agreement, exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the limited liability company\u2019s business ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrary to Emmert\u2019s suggestion, the statute does not preclude a member from establishing a fiduciary relationship with anyone \u2014 including the LLC \u2014 in other ways. In this case, Evergreen\u2019s claim was not based on the fact that Emmert was a member of the LLC or that he was exercising rights pursuant to the LLC\u2019s operating agreement. Rather, it was based on the common-law theory that Emmert, by promising to handle the West Coast Bank loan on behalf of Evergreen, had entered into a relationship of confidence with the company that required him to act \u201cin good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing the confidence.\u201d <em>Starkweather v. Shaffer, </em>262 Or 198, 205, 497 P2d 358 (1972). The jury instructions on fiduciary duties, as well as Evergreen\u2019s closing argument, the former of which is set out above, 254 Or App at 367, are explicit as to that theory. Nothing in ORS 63.155 prevents one member from assuming fiduciary duties by entering into a relationship of confidence with another.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Emmert\u2019s second argument \u2014 that even if he owed a fiduciary duty to Evergreen, he did not breach it \u2014 simply disregards the jury\u2019s findings. Emmert selectively identifies facts that are favorable to his case while ignoring the ample evidence that he secretly negotiated on his own behalf while purportingto actonbehalfofEvergreen.Thejury was entitled to \u2014 and did \u2014 reject Emmert\u2019s version of events. In short, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Emmert had breached a fiduciary duty, and, consequently, for the trial court to conclude that he violated the type of a \u201cduty imposed by a confidential or fiduciary relationship\u201d that would support the imposition of a constructive trust. <em>See Albino, </em>279 Or at 550 (\u201cA constructive trust arises where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>a person in a fiduciary or confidential relationship acquires or retains property in violation of his duty to the grantor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Emmert\u2019s remaining contentions focus on the effect of the jury\u2019s verdict in this case \u2014 specifically, the fact that the jury determined that he had profited only in a nominal amount. <em>See Frazee v. Brazda, </em>239 Or 624, 627, 399 P2d 346 (1965) (\u201cNominal damages are usually defined as a trivial sum and are usually represented by a judgment for one dollar or a lesser sum.\u201d); <em>Hall v. Cornett Et al., </em>193 Or 634, 644, 240 P2d 231 (1952) (\u201cNominal damages means no damages at all.\u201d (Internal quotation marks and citations omitted.)). According to Emmert, the jury\u2019s verdict determined that the \u201cunjust benefit\u201d to Emmert was $1 and, for that reason, the court should not have imposed a constructive trust that would allow Evergreen to recover more than that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Evergreen, for its part, argues that Emmert was unjustly enriched far more than the $1 jury verdict, because he \u201creceived property worth $1,390,000 by paying only $613,979.49 as a result of his breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d Moreover, Evergreen argues, real property is unique, and the constructive trust remedy and damages remedy serve different purposes: \u201cThe constructive trust is imposed to give [Evergreen] back its property, not so that [Evergreen] can obtain a dollar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In the abstract, we agree with Evergreen\u2019s contention that damages might be an inadequate remedy where an agent\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty has divested his principal of real property. However, that is not true here, given how this case was tried to the jury. As set out above, Evergreen did not seek damages in the amount of its own loss from Emmert\u2019s actions; rather, Evergreen sought damages measured by Emmert\u2019s <em>gain. </em>The jury was instructed, at Evergreen\u2019s request, that \u201cthe non-breaching party is entitled to any profits made by the breaching party as a result of the breach.\u201d Evergreen offered evidence that the property was worth more than $1.3 million at the time of the foreclosure sale and that Emmert, by breaching his fiduciary duties to Evergreen, had obtained that property for approximately $600,000. During closing arguments, Evergreen\u2019s counsel emphasized that evidence and told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the jury that Emmert had therefore profited \u201covernight\u201d more than $700,000. Evergreen asked the jury to award that amount \u2014 that is, the profit that Emmert obtained \u2014 to Evergreen.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">For whatever reason, the jury returned an award of damages in the amount of $1. It was only after the jury awarded nominal damages on that claim that Evergreen requested that the court rule on its alternative request for a constructive trust. Given that posture, we agree with Emmert that the constructive trust imposed by the court was not a permissible equitable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Equitable remedies are not for the purpose of correcting disappointing jury verdicts or remedying a failure of proof. As we recently explained in <em>Kazlauskas v. Emmert, </em>248 Or App 555, 275 P3d 171 (2012), there is a difference between a jury verdict that is inadequate as a matter of <em>law </em>and one that is inadequate as a matter <em>o\u00ed fact. </em>In <em>Kazlauskas, </em>the defendant (the same Terry Emmert) argued that the trial court had erred in allowing the plaintiff, Kazlauskas, to a remedy of specific enforcement rather than the jury\u2019s damages verdicts on breach of contract claims. We agreed with Kazlauskas that, \u201cat least in the abstract, a party is entitled to from among different remedies for a breach of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569. We also explained, however, that if \u201c\u2018adequate relief may be obtained in law, then equitable jurisdiction will not be invoked.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Thompson v. Coughlin, </em>329 Or 630, 638, 997 P2d 191 (2000)). Thus, the question was whether Kazlauskas had an adequate remedy at law in the form of damages. We concluded that he did, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the actual award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cKazlauskas tried his claim for damages to the jury, which awarded damages \u2014 albeit not in as great an amount as he sought. Moreover, as noted, in his cross-appeal concerning the jury\u2019s deliberations, Kazlauskas asserts that, if we were to reinstate the jury\u2019s initial verdict for a greater amount of damages than it ultimately awarded, he would that damages remedy rather than specific performance. Thus, Kazlauskas\u2019s position in this litigation is <em>not that monetary damages for the breaches were inadequate as a matter of law, but that the monetary damages that the jury actually awarded were inadequate as a matter of fact. We </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>disagree with Kazlauskas\u2019s proposition that equitable relief is available under such circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cKazlauskas nonetheless asserts that monetary damages were inadequate because the future profits from the sale of Victory Lane and Flax Plant Road \u2018cannot be ascertained.\u2019 That argument is both legally and factually unavailing on this record. At trial, Kazlauskas presented expert testimony from a real estate appraiser who testified as to the value of Victory Lane in light of its prospects for future development. The appraiser concluded that, within the next seven to 10 years, the property was likely to be brought within the urban growth boundary. In light of its potential for future development, he valued the property at $2,520,000, which was approximately twice the amount that Emmert had paid Kazlauskas for it. Counsel for Kazlauskas argued to the jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c\u2018And so the profit \u2014 right now, Mr. Emmert has a profit on this property of $1,282,500. That\u2019s the \u2014 if it were to be sold today, that\u2019s the amount of the upside, 20 percent of which is $258,500.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cWith respect to the Flax Plant Road property, Kazlauskas relied on Emmert\u2019s current financial statement as evidence of its value. In closing, he argued to the jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201c\u2018The current value is a million eight. The purchase price from the Carters was $451,000. [A local improvement district assessment is] $460,000. So the profit today is $889,000,30 percent of which is $226,700. That\u2019s what the profit is.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">\u201cIn sum, Kazlauskas presented evidence of a precise amount of lost profits damages, and he asked the jury to award that amount. Moreover, as noted, <em>see </em>248 Or App at 559-60, he asserts on appeal that, if we were to direct the trial court on cross-appeal to reinstate the jury\u2019s initial verdict for $258,500 on the Victory Lane claim and $266,700 on the Flax Plant Road claim, he would abandon his of specific performance and, instead, his damages remedy. Thus, Kazlauskas provided the jury with a precise amount of damages to which he sought entitlement, and he adduced particularized evidence in support of that amount. In addition, he has made it clear that a jury verdict in that amount would, in fact, adequately compensate him for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>breaches. In such circumstances, specific performance was not an appropriate remedy. Kazlauskas\u2019s remedy at law was \u2018practical, efficient, and adequate.\u2019 <em>Alsea Veneer, </em>318 Or at 44.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">248 Or App 555 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Here, likewise, Evergreen has not seriously-contended that Emmert was unjustly enriched in a way that could not have been valued for or compensated by a damages award in this case. Rather, the contention is that the jury, as a matter of <em>fact, </em>did not actually award damages in accordance with the evidence. Evergreen has offered various explanations for the jury\u2019s nominal award. In the trial court, Evergreen suggested that the jury was misled by closing arguments when Emmert\u2019s counsel stated (without objection from Evergreen) that the measure of damages was the value to Evergreen rather than the profit by Emmert. Evergreen also speculated that the jury simply was unwilling to award lost profits because it believed that, until the property was sold, Emmert had not profited. Similarly, Evergreen on appeal suggests that \u201cthe jury\u2019s determination of damages probably resulted from the improper admission of testimony as to [Emmert\u2019s] holding costs, because until [Emmert] sold or did something with the property, he had not yet earned a profit.\u201d However, those criticisms are directed toward the jury\u2019s deliberations and the proof adduced at trial, not the adequacy of a damages award as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Under the circumstances \u2014 that is, where the jury is presented with evidence of a damages claim that would wholly compensate the nonbreaching party \u2014 the equitable remedy of a constructive trust is not available simply because the jury returns a lesser verdict than requested.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>B. <em>Evergreen\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Evergreen\u2019s first two assignments of error on cross-appeal involve the subject of punitive damages; its third assignment concerns the admission of evidence regarding the costs Emmert incurred to hold and maintain the property after the foreclosure sale. We start with Evergreen\u2019s third assignment of error \u2014 the admission of purportedly inadmissible evidence \u2014 because reversal on that assignment would require a retrial, including on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In its third assignment of error, Evergreen contends that the \u201ctrial court erred in admitting testimony concerning [Emmert\u2019s] holding costs after he obtained title to the property.\u201d Specifically, Evergreen argues that the trial court allowed Emmert to testify that he had incurred substantial expenses holding the property after he acquired it, which, Evergreen believes, \u201cinfluenced the jury to conclude that he did not have any profit to return to [Evergreen].\u201d Thus, Evergreen requests that we remand the case \u201cfor trial solely as to the issue of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Evergreen\u2019s third assignment of error, however, cannot clear the initial hurdle of preservation of error. The relevant exchange at trial was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cQ. [EMMERT\u2019S COUNSEL] Looking at what\u2019s in front of you that\u2019s marked as Exhibit 163, can you identify that document, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\u201cA. [EMMERT] Well, sort of. It is a \u2014 an accounting of the checks that made \u2014 were made payable on my behalf to Evergreen West Business Center, plus the amount of the loan, plus the taxes and plus the \u2014 the\u2014the interest on the loan to date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">\u201cQ. All right. And this would be the loan that was taken on the property after you bought it at the foreclosure sale?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">\u201cQ. And what is that amount, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c[EVERGREEN\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection; he\u2019s relying on a document that\u2019s not been introduced and would be subject to\u2019an objection of relevancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: He can \u2014 he can answer based on his own knowledge. If he needs the document to refresh his memory, he can do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">At that point, Emmert testified, without further objection,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cAs I said they brought it to me in pieces, so that I\u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m adding it up. And at the time, I\u2019m rounding this one number off, but basically there was $761,010, including the contributions that \u2014 that I made to the Evergreen West, the $50,000 for West Coast Bank for Evergreen Business Park, the $50,000 and the $563,979.49. So that comes to a total of $761,010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\u201cThere was a principal reduction of [$56,000] which is not counted, but the interest would be $388,240, and there were taxes and fees of $35,000 paid. And, of course, they do have legal expenses on it, but that was not added into the number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">As that colloquy demonstrates, Evergreen\u2019s objection was to Emmert\u2019s reliance <em>on a document </em>that, according to counsel, would have been subject to a relevancy objection, and that is how the court understood it. The court allowed Emmert to testify based on his own recollection and to refresh his recollection with the document. That objection did not alert the court in the slightest to the argument that Evergreen now makes on appeal \u2014 namely, that \u201c[w]hen a party wrongfully takes property belonging to another, and incurs holding costs that do not result in any physical improvement to the property, that party has to pay his own self-inflicted costs, even including interest.\u201d We therefore decline to reach Evergreen\u2019s third assignment of error on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Finally, we turn to Evergreen\u2019s arguments regarding punitive damages. In its first assignment of error, Evergreen argues that the court erred in ruling that \u201cpunitive damages are not legally available for [Evergreen\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>claim for a constructive trust.\u201d Given our conclusion that the constructive trust was erroneously imposed in this case, Evergreen\u2019s first assignment of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The only remaining issue, then, is whether the trial court erred in reducing the jury\u2019s punitive damages award from $600,000 to $4. As noted above, the trial court reduced the jury\u2019s punitive damages award after applying the familiar guideposts for assessing the constitutionality of such awards: \u201c(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 US 408, 418, 123 S Ct 1513, 155 L Ed 2d 585 (2003). The court\u2019s ruling turned on the second guidepost and, more directly, the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Goddard, </em>344 Or at 275, that \u201cwhen the conduct has solely economic effects and does not cause or risk physical harm to another, the ratio between the punitive damages award and compensatory damages normally cannot exceed four to one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">After the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case, the Oregon Supreme Court explained that there are circumstances\u2014 namely, \u201cwhen the compensatory damages award is small and does not already serve an admonitory function\u201d \u2014 in which the second guidepost and its ratio test are \u201cof limited assistance in determining whether the amount of a jury\u2019s punitive damages award meets or exceeds state goals of deterrence and retribution.\u201d <em>Hamlin v. Hampton Lumber Mills, Inc., </em>349 Or 526, 536-37, 246 P3d 1121 (2011). In <em>Hamlin, </em>the jury had awarded $6,000 in lost wages and $175,000 in punitive damages to a plaintiff who alleged that his employer had refused to reinstate him after he suffered an injury at work, thereby violating ORS 659A.043. This court, employing a 4-to-l ratio, reduced the punitive damages award to $24,000, four times the plaintiff\u2019s lost wages. The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the jury\u2019s punitive damages award was constitutionally permissible, despite being 22 times larger than the compensatory award (once prejudgment interest was included).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In reaching that outcome, the court explained that \u201c$6,000 in lost wages is a relatively small recovery that we would not expect to serve an admonitory, as well as a compensatory, function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. And, because there was no indication that $6,000 would have been particularly onerous for the employer, the court concluded that \u201cthe fact that the ratio between the punitive and compensatory damages is greater than a single digit does not, in itself, indicate that the punitive damages that the jury awarded were \u2018grossly excessive.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539. Thus, the court looked to the other guideposts as better indicators of the outer limits of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The court, quoting <em>Campbell, </em>described the first guidepost \u2014 the reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct\u2014 as \u201c \u2018[t]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award[.]\u2019\u201d 349 Or at 539. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court explained that the employer in <em>Hamlin </em>had acted with \u201cintentional malice, trickery, or deceit\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s conduct</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201cwas sufficiently reprehensible that, in the circumstances presented \u2014 where the compensatory damages are low and the ratio between the compensatory and punitive damages is not a reliable indicator of the constitutionality of the punitive damages award \u2014 defendant\u2019s conduct may justify an award of punitive damages in excess of a single-digit multiplier of the compensatory damages awarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The remaining guidepost \u2014 the difference between the punitive damages awarded and the civil penalties authorized or imposed \u2014 did not play a significant role in the court\u2019s analysis, because neither party challenged this court\u2019s conclusion that comparable civil penalties \u201cneither militate [d] against, nor support [ed], a punitive damages award in excess of a single-digit multiplier of the compensatory damages awarded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">After reviewing the guideposts and determining that \u201cthe punitive damages award in this case may exceed a single-digit multiplier of the compensatory damages award without violating due process,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court addressed the ultimate question: \u201cwhether the amount of punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>damages actually awarded \u2014 $175,000\u2014is, nevertheless, \u2018grossly excessive.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542. The court answered that question in the negative after measuring the award against \u201cawards that legislatures and courts have permitted in similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">\u201c[T]he compensatory damages are small and the ratio between the punitive and compensatory damages \u2014 22:1\u2014is in the low double digits. That ratio is higher than would be constitutionally permissible if the compensatory damages were more substantial, but is not so high that it makes the award \u2018grossly excessive.\u2019 The amount of the punitive damages award \u2014 $175,000\u2014also is not so high that we can say that it exceeds, rather than serves, this state\u2019s interests in deterring and punishing the violation of ORS 659A.043. We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict, and we reinstate it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 543-44 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In the wake of <em>Hamlin, </em>we reconsidered an earlier decision, <em>Lithia Motors, Inc. v. Yovan, </em>226 Or App 572, 204 P3d 120 (2009) <em>(Lithia Motors I), vac\u2019d and rem\u2019d, </em>349 Or 663, 249 P3d 1281 (2011), in which we had reduced a punitive damages award from $100,000 to $2,000, an amount four times the jury\u2019s $500 compensatory award. On remand, we applied the reasoning in <em>Hamlin </em>and concluded that the jury\u2019s full punitive damages award of $100,000 should be reinstated. <em>Lithia Medford LM, Inc. v. Yovan, </em>254 Or App 307, 295 P3d 642 (2012) <em>(Lithia Motors II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\"><em>Lithia Motors II </em>involved a consumer, Yovan, who purchased a vehicle from Lithia Motors, an auto dealer. Yovan prevailed on a claim against the dealership for \u201cthreatening arrest or criminal prosecution of [Yovan]\u201d and by \u201cattempting to or threatening to enforce a right or remedy with knowledge or reason to know that the right or remedy did not exist,\u201d thereby violating Oregon\u2019s Unlawful Trade Practices Act. The jury awarded no economic damages, $500 in noneconomic damages, and $100,000 in punitive damages. The trial court then granted the dealership\u2019s motion for remittitur, reducing the punitive damages award to $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">On appeal, we initially affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling by an equally divided court. The Supreme Court, however, vacated that decision and remanded for reconsideration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>light of its intervening decision in <em>Hamlin. </em>On remand, we concluded that the second guidepost was indeed of limited assistance in the case, and that the other two guideposts demonstrated that \u201cthe ratio between punitive damages and compensatory damages in this case can constitutionally exceed 9-to-l.\u201d <em>Lithia Motors II, </em>254 Or App at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In reaching that conclusion, we first explained that the record established that the dealership\u2019s conduct was more than \u201cminimally reprehensible.\u201d 254 Or App at 326. We relied on the fact that \u201cthe Oregon legislature has recognized the harm that creditors may inflict on consumers and debtors, such as [Yovan], and has indicated its intent to deter and to punish creditors who engage in that type of conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 324; the fact that the dealership \u201cknew that [Yovan] was financially vulnerable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 325; and the fact that the dealership \u201cengaged in trickery or deceit to further its own financial interests,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 325. In light of those facts, we concluded, \u201cthe most important guidepost, the reprehensibility of [the dealership\u2019s] conduct, supports the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages in excess of a single-digit multiplier of the $500 compensatory damages award in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Then, turning to the third guidepost (civil penalties in comparable cases), we explained that the UTPA itself provided a civil remedy rather than monetary penalties for the dealership\u2019s conduct, so the UTPA \u201citself is not significant in the analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. Nonetheless, we concluded that \u201c[t]he civil penalty for comparable UTPA violations *** is relevant.\u201d Id. Specifically, we reasoned that, in a suit brought by a prosecuting attorney on behalf of the state, \u201ca penalty of up to $25,000 can be assessed for <em>each </em>willful use of a method, practice, or act in violation of the UTPA,\u201d and that the dealership had \u201cengaged in multiple acts of deception and abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in <em>Lithia Motors </em>77). Thus, we concluded, \u201cThe civil penalty available for UTPA violations further suggests that the punitive damages award in this case could exceed a single-digit multiplier of compensatory damages to serve the state\u2019s interest in deterring and punishing violations of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">After concluding that we were \u201cnot bound to impose a single-digit ratio,\u201d we turned to the final step of the analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>directed by <em>Hamlin: </em>\u201c\u2018whether the amount of punitive damages actually awarded *** is, nevertheless, \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 254 Or App at 327 (quoting <em>Hamlin, </em>349 Or at 542). We began that analysis, as the court did in <em>Hamlin, </em>by canvassing punitive damages awards in comparable cases from Oregon and other states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201cThe Oregon Supreme Court has repeatedly approved punitive damages awards in amounts equal to or greater than $100,000, the amount in question here. <em>See, e.g., [Hamlin, </em>349 Or] at 542, 543 ($175,000 for violation of unlawful employment practice); <em>Parrott, </em>331 Or at 565 ($1 million for violation of the UTPA). Courts in other jurisdictions have done so as well in consumer protection cases. <em>See, e.g., Grabinski v. Blue Springs Ford Sales, Inc., </em>203 F3d 1024, 1026-27 (8th Cir), <em>cert den, </em>531 US 825 (2000) (affirming punitive damages award of $100,000 and $50,000 against dealership; actual damages award of $5,300 and $2,535, for concealment of prior automobile wreck damages by dealerships in violation of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act); <em>Electro Services, Inc. v. Exide Corp., </em>847 F2d 1524, 1525 (11th Cir 1998) (affirming punitive damages award of $3.5 million; compensatory damages award of $750,000, for an action against automotive battery manufacturer for deceptive trade practices); <em>Saunders v. Equifax Information Services, L.L.C., </em>469 F Supp 2d 343, 346, 356-57 (ED Va 2007) (in consumer action against bank and credit reporting agencies after bank improperly demanded full payment of car loan, repossessed car, and reported default to agencies, affirming $80,000 punitive and $1,000 compensatory damage award); <em>United Technologies Corp. v. American Home Assur. Co., </em>118 F Supp 2d 174, 175, 181 (D Conn 2000) (affirming punitive damages award of $16 million for violations under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act); <em>Griffith v. Barnes, </em>560 F Supp 2d 29, 37-38 (DDC 2008) (awarding punitive damages of $100,000 under the D.C. Consumer Protection Procedures Act where the defendant made misrepresentations to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not seek actual damages); <em>Thorsen v. Durkin Development, LLC, </em>129 Conn App 68, 76-78, 20 A3d 707, 713-14 (2011) (affirming punitive damages award of $280,000; compensatory damages award of $30,211.43 for violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>Lithia Motors II, </em>254 Or App at 327-28. Based on that survey, we concluded that \u201ca $100,000 punitive damages award is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>not outrageous or \u2018grossly excessive\u2019 as measured by similar types of cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further concluded that the dealership was \u201cfully on notice\u201d that the jury could assess punitive damages of that magnitude and that the $100,000 award was not \u201cgrossly excessive given the deterrent function that it serves and the resources [the dealership] has to pay it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329. Accordingly, we reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment remitting punitive damages and instead reinstated the jury\u2019s full award.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">We conclude that this appeal, like <em>Hamlin </em>and <em>Lithia Motors II, </em>is a case in which the jury\u2019s compensatory award was too small to serve any admonitory function, and that the second guidepost is therefore a poor indicator of the constitutional limits on a punitive damages award.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, in light of the first and third guideposts, we further conclude that the trial court erred in applying a strict 4-to-l ratio to the punitive damages award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The \u201cmost important indicium of reasonableness of a punitive damages award\u201d \u2014 the reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 is consistent with a punitive damages award in this case that well exceeds a single-digit multiplier of nominal damages. Emmert, although risking purely economic harm to Evergreen, engaged in \u201cintentional malice, trickery, or deceit\u201d on par with that in <em>Hamlin </em>and <em>Lithia Motors II </em>\u2014 conduct \u201csufficiently reprehensible\u201d to merit a punitive damages award that will serve a correspondingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sufficient admonitory function, certainly something larger than the typically permissible ratios.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">With regard to the third guidepost, we are not aware of any civil penalties that provide an exact fit for the type of breach of fiduciary duty at issue here. There are two statutory schemes, however, that suggest significant fines for deceitful business practices involving real estate or procuring debt instruments. Oregon\u2019s Unlawful Trade Practices Act, which we relied upon in <em>Lithia Motors II, </em>makes it unlawful for a person, in the course of the person\u2019s business, to \u201cemploy[ ] any unconscionable tactic in connection with the sale, rental or other disposition of real estate, goods or services or collection or enforcement of an obligation,\u201d ORS 646.607, and, more generally, to \u201cengage! ] in any other unfair or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce,\u201d ORS 646.608(1) (u). In an enforcement action by a prosecuting attorney, the civil penalties for that type of conduct include a fine as high as \u201c$25,000 per violation.\u201d ORS 646.642(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Oregon\u2019s securities laws, albeit not directly in play here, provide a similarly substantial penalty for deceit in the procurement of a debt instrument. ORS 59.135 makes it \u201cunlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d to \u201cemploy any device, scheme or artifice to defraud\u201d or \u201cto engage in any act, practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person [.]\u201d \u201cSecurities,\u201d in turn, include \u201ca note, * * * debenture, evidence of indebtedness, * * * real estate paper sold by a broker-dealer, mortgage banker, mortgage broker * * *.\u201d ORS 59.015(19)(a). The civil penalties for violating Oregon\u2019s securities laws\u2014 including fraudulently obtaining a security instrument\u2014 include fines of \u201cnot more than $20,000 for each violation and a maximum penalty of $100,000 for a continuing violation.\u201d ORS 59.255(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Those statutory schemes, in our view, further suggest that the business practices engaged in by Emmert\u2014 breaching his fiduciary duties and secretly obtaining the promissory note and deed of trust, which allowed him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>foreclose on the property and obtain it for himself \u2014 justify something exceeding a single-digit ratio in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Having decided, as the court did in <em>Hamlin, </em>\u201cthat the punitive damages award in this case may exceed a single-digit multiplier of the compensatory damages award without violating due process,\u201d 349 Or at 541, we must now consider \u201cwhether the amount of punitive damages actually awarded \u2014 [$600,000]\u2014is, nevertheless, \u2018grossly excessive.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the award, although high, is not grossly excessive, particularly in light of punitive damages awards that courts have approved in other cases involving breaches of fiduciary duty, and in light of the financial deterrent required to prevent the type of calculated breach of duty involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In cases in which parties have suffered significant financial harm from the acts of disloyal agents, juries often have awarded \u2014 and courts have approved \u2014 large punitive damages awards. <em>E.g., Whitney v. Citibank, N.A., </em>782 F2d 1106 (2d Cir 1986) (approving award of $1.5 million in punitive damages and $236,677.25 compensatory damages for bank\u2019s knowing participation in breach of fiduciary duties to plaintiff); <em>Armstrong v. Republic Realty Mortg. Corp., </em>631 F2d 1344 (8th Cir 1980) (upholding punitive damages award of $125,000 and $14,000 in compensatory damages for breach of fiduciary duty by mortgage broker); <em>McDermott v. Party City Corp., </em>11 F Supp 2d 612 (ED Pa 1998) (jury\u2019s award of $375,000 in punitive damages was not constitutionally excessive based on $42,537.61 in compensatory damages for agent\u2019s breach of duty by usurping of corporate opportunity); <em>E.J. McKernan Co. v. Gregory, </em>252 Ill App 3d 514, 623 NE2d 981 (1993) (affirming jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages totaling $1,067,000 and punitive damages of $420,000 for agents\u2019 exploitation of fiduciary relationship by usurping corporate opportunities); <em>National Bank v. Doss, </em>141 Ill App 3d 1065, 491 NE2d 106 (1986) (approving punitive damages of $2,000,000 and compensatory damages of $500,000 against a lawyer who purchased farm for a nominal sum from client of \u201climited mental capability\u201d). But courts have also upheld large awards when the actual damages suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>were relatively small. <em>E.g., Schaffer v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>1996 SD 94, 552 NW2d 801 (1996) (affirming jury\u2019s punitive damages award of $750,000 against brokerage that deceived its investors, despite fact that jury awarded only $25,000 in compensatory damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Comparable cases involving breaches of fiduciary duty tell us that the jury\u2019s award of $600,000 in punitive damages in this case is a serious sanction, but they do not persuade us that it is unconstitutionally excessive. One of the guiding principles in those breach of fiduciary duty cases, as in all punitive damages cases, is that the award serve, rather than exceed, the state\u2019s interest in deterring the conduct at issue. <em>See Hamlin, </em>349 Or at 543. In this case, there was evidence that Emmert had a net worth of approximately $160,000,000; that he saw potentially large profits in breaching his fiduciary duties to Evergreen and obtaining the company\u2019s real property for himself; and that he made a calculated decision to breach his duties to the company in pursuit of that perceived individual profit. The jury, hearing that evidence, as well as evidence of Emmert\u2019s previous behavior in other business dealings, concluded that an award of $600,000 was necessary, given his net worth and history, to deter him from engaging in a similar calculation in the future. We cannot, on this record, say that the jury\u2019s decision in that regard went beyond the state\u2019s interests in preventing future tortious conduct by Emmert. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Reversed and remanded on appeal and on cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> We appreciate that real property is unique, but Evergreen has never suggested that the property should have been conveyed back to it; from the beginning, Evergreen has asked that the property be sold for its benefit. We also appreciate that the valuation of the property has changed over time, but that alone does not render damages an inadequate remedy. <em>Cf. Kazlauskus, </em>248 Or App at 571 (rejecting argument that future profits could not be ascertained and describing appraiser\u2019s testimony about future development).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\"> At a later hearing on the form of judgment, Emmert\u2019s counsel conceded that a constructive trust could be imposed to ensure payment of the $1, and Emmert argues on appeal that any constructive trust must be limited to an award of $1. The court\u2019s intent plainly was not to enter a constructive trust to ensure payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of a $1 nominal damages award, and we therefore simply reverse the judgment in that regard rather than modifying it to impose a $1 limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Moreover, because we are reversing the judgment imposing the constructive trust, we need not reach Emmert\u2019s third assignment of error, in which he argues that his costs in maintaining and keeping the property should have been reimbursed from any sale of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-6\"> Evergreen\u2019s argument starts from the premise that the \u201cactual harm\u201d in this case was far greater than the nominal damages award \u2014 again arguing that, \u201c[i]n light of the evidence that the property was worth $1,390,000, and the debt was only $613,979.59, resulting in an equity of more than $700,000 having been taken by [Emmert], there is no constitutional barrier to such an award.\u201d We cannot simply disregard the jury\u2019s award of nominal damages when assessing what was taken by Emmert. The jury, rightly or wrongly, concluded that he profited only nominally from the breach of fiduciary duty, and there is scant evidence that Evergreen itself, already experiencing significant financial distress, was significantly harmed by losing the property to foreclosure; that was, after all, where the property was headed anyway, and Evergreen\u2019s options appear to have been limited to a bankruptcy filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> <em>See also Hamlin, </em>349 Or at 547 (Gillette, J. pro tempore, dissenting) (\u201cNo matter what the tort is, if a jury awards only $1 in nominal compensatory damages, a single-digit ratio of punitive damages \u2014 $9\u2014is far too low. In such cases, the award must be greater than the single-digit ratio ***.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b408-6\">Wollheim, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">concurring in part, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">I concur with the majority opinion with one exception.
