On that conviction, the trial court imposed an upward durational departure sentence of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months\u2019 post-prison supervision. On appeal, defendant asserts various sentencing-related errors, among them that the court erred in imposing sentence on his second-degree assault conviction because the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum for the offense. He acknowledges that he failed to preserve that claim of error for appeal but urges us to correct it as error apparent on the record. ORAP 5.45(1); <em>see also Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). The state concedes that the court erred in sentencing defendant on that conviction and that a remand for resentencing is warranted in this case. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Assault in the second degree is a Class B felony. ORS 163.175(2). Under ORS 161.605(2), the \u201cmaximum term of an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment\u201d for a Class B felony is 10 years, or 120 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the trial court imposed an upward durational departure sentence of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment on defendant\u2019s conviction for that offense, thus exceeding the statutory maximum. That is error apparent on the record. <em>See, e.g., State v. Longenecker, </em>175 Or App 33, 36, 27 P3d 509, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 656 (2001); <em>State v. Skelton, </em>153 Or App 580, 593, 957 P2d 585, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 448 (1998). Moreover, because the error could have a significant effect on defendant\u2019s sentence, it can be corrected with a minimum of judicial resources, and the state has no interest in defendant serving an unlawful sentence, we exercise our discretion to correct it. <em>See State v. Medina, </em>234 Or App 684, 691, 228 P3d 723 (2010); <em>Skelton, </em>153 Or App at 593. Accordingly, we remand the entire case to the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>for resentencing. ORS 138.222(5). Given that disposition, we need not address defendant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\"> Second-degree assault is also a Ballot Measure 11 offense with a mandatory minimum prison term of 70 months. ORS 137.700(2)(a)(G). Atrial court may impose a sentence under the sentencing guidelines that is greater than the mandatory minimum sentence specified by Ballot Measure 11. <em>State ex rel Huddleston v. Sawyer, </em>324 Or 597, 604, 932 P2d 1145 (1997); see <em>also </em>ORS 137.700(1) (\u201cThe court may impose a greater sentence [than the specified minimum] if otherwise permitted by law[.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
