Youth advances three assignments of error, two of which we reject without discussion. In his remaining assignment of error, youth asserts that the juvenile court erred by denying his motion to suppress a handgun and ammunition found during a search of his backpack by the school principal, because that search violated youth\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We recount the material facts in accordance with the trial court\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the evening of September 22, 2010, youth called and sent a text message to V, also a student at the school, and told her that he was going to bring a gun to school the next day and shoot her. The next morning, V reported youth\u2019s threat to Glader, a school counselor, who, in turn, informed the school\u2019s principal, Smith. Glader also told Smith that she believed that there might have been threats to other students, but she did not specifically identify those students. Smith testified that Glader had been at the school for three years and that he had worked closely with her. Although Smith had not personally met V, he testified that there had been \u201cno indication [s] of any previous problems\u201d with her. Smith was familiar with youth, who had had \u201cdisciplinary issues.\u201d Smith had worked closely with youth and his family to resolve those issues. Although the idea of youth threatening to bring a gun to the school and shooting another student was \u201csomething that was outside the realm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>of what [he] thought could happen,\u201d Smith testified that it was \u201cnot an option in my job to disbelieve it until it\u2019s \u2014 till I find out the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Smith called Deputy Sheriff Chertrude to assist with the investigation. Smith also called youth\u2019s mother, who came to the school as well. While waiting for youth\u2019s mother to arrive, Smith searched youth\u2019s locker; he did not find a gun there. After Chertrude and youth\u2019s mother arrived, Smith went to youth\u2019s classroom. Youth was seated at a desk, and his backpack was underneath the desk, but within his reach. Smith picked up youth\u2019s backpack and escorted him to Smith\u2019s office. Youth\u2019s mother and Chertrude joined youth and Smith in the office. A friend of youth\u2019s family also was present. Smith told youth that \u201c[w]e had a student that said you were going to bring a gun to school and shoot them today and that that threat happened last night over a series of either text or phone calls.\u201d Youth denied making the threats. Smith asked youth why V would make up such a threat, and he told youth that he had \u201ca hard time believing a new student to our building is just going to make up a story, so I have to take it seriously. I don\u2019t have any reason to believe that she\u2019s lying to me, so what happened?\u201d Youth then admitted to having had some sort of relationship with V.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">As the interaction in the office unfolded, the backpack was lying beneath Smith\u2019s desk, near his feet, and had been under Smith\u2019s control since he took it from under youth\u2019s desk in the classroom. After about five or six minutes of conversation, Smith told youth that, \u201cwith this kind of verbal threat, I need to check and see * * * if this is true or not. So I have to follow through in my processes here, so I\u2019m going to search your backpack.\u201d Youth neither objected nor consented to the search, and Smith opened the backpack. The backpack had five or six compartments, and Smith began by opening the largest compartment; it contained only books. Smith then opened a second compartment, which was about eight inches long and eight inches wide, where he found several rounds of .45 caliber handgun ammunition. Smith then unzipped another compartment that was large enough to hold a textbook or a pair of shoes, and he found a .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun wrapped in a bandana. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Chertrude took the gun from Smith and determined that it was not loaded. Chertrude then placed youth in handcuffs and read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">At a pretrial hearing, youth moved to suppress the handgun and ammunition, arguing that Smith had violated his Article I, section 9, rights by searching his backpack. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. M. A. D., </em>348 Or 381, 393, 233 P3d 347 (2010), youth argued that Smith had not received \u201ccredible information, based on specific and articulable facts,\u201d regarding the threat, and, thus, did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that he would find a weapon in the backpack. Youth also argued that there had been no \u201cimmediate threat\u201d justifying a warrantless search of the backpack because, after Smith seized it, youth no longer could reach the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The juvenile court denied youth\u2019s motion. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201c[Smith] has a report from a student that was identified by name, that the youth, also identified by name, was bringing a * * * gun to school to harm another student today. Not only is the person making the report named specifically, the youth is named specifically Not only is the time current \u2014 the gun is coming to school today \u2014 from a report made last night, but the report of the specific type of threat is identified: bringing a gun to school to shoot her. Each and every one of those facts is very specific in terms of the threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\"><em>i </em>if: &gt;}: if: if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c[Smith] *** asked [youth] about the report, and although [youth] denied making the threat, denied bringing this gun to school, he acknowledged that he knew who the reporter was and acknowledged that there was a relationship. So that can tell the principal reasonably that the report has some merit, some basis. It is not one that is without merit or truly fanciful. And subsequently, the principal conducts a search and finds first the bullets and then the gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201cI would note that in the course of the search, that search took a very specific process. The [principal] did not search small or tiny compartments. He searched compartments in the backpack that would reasonably hold an item that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>alleged to have been brought on the campus: a gun. So he didn\u2019t open small containers or examine small containers. He opened portions of the backpack that would reasonably contain a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cAnd first he finds the bullets. That gives him a reason beyond any kind of common sense to believe that the other compartments might hold a gun, because bullets, of course, have no value without a gun. And, of course, in the very next compartment, he finds a gun. So stated in short, that search was no further intrusive than it needed to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u00abHi ^ * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201cFor all those reasons, the court finds that the principal did have a reasonable suspicion that there w[ere] imminent health or safety threats or risk to the students of the school, and had a right, under the Oregon and United States Constitution, to conduct that search of the backpack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Following a trial, the court found youth to be within its jurisdiction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">On appeal, youth asserts that, because Smith testified that youth bringing a gun to the school was \u201csomething that was outside the realm of what [he] thought could happen,\u201d Smith lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the search. Youth further argues that, even if Smith reasonably suspected that a gun was inside the backpack, the warrantless search exceeded the scope of the \u201cschool exception\u201d to the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9, that the Supreme Court articulated in <em>M. A. D., </em>because Smith\u2019s seizure of the backpack removed any immediate threat to the safety of other students and staff at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Warrantless searches of students without probable cause or some other exception to the warrant requirement, such as consent, are permissible when a school official reasonably suspects, based on specific and articulable facts, that the student is in possession of something that poses an immediate threat to the student or others. <em>M. A. </em>D., 348 Or at 392-93; <em>State v. B. A. H., </em>245 Or App 203, 210, 263 P3d 1046 (2011). In developing reasonable suspicion, \u201ca school official may not rely on generalizations about [a student\u2019s activity] or on information that is not specific or current.\u201d <em>M. A. D., </em>348 Or at 393. In this case, youth did not consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>to the search of the backpack, and the trial court did not conclude that Smith had probable cause to believe that youth had a gun inside his backpack so as to support the issuance of a warrant to search the backpack.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the dispositive question is whether, before searching the backpack, Smith reasonably suspected, based on specific and articulable facts, that the backpack contained a weapon that posed an immediate threat of harm to V or others at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Applying the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>M. A. </em>D., we answer that question affirmatively. V told Glader that youth had threatened her on the evening of September 22. On the morning of September 23, Glader told Smith that youth had threatened V and had also specified the manner in which he would harm V; that is, by bringing a gun to the school to shoot her. Although Smith testified that youth\u2019s threat was \u201csomething that was outside the realm of what [he] thought could happen,\u201d he testified that, it was \u201cnot an option in [his] job to disbelieve [the threat] until it\u2019s \u2014 till [he found] out the information.\u201d Moreover, although Smith did not personally know V, he had worked closely with Glader, from whom he learned of youth\u2019s threat. In its totality, that information was sufficient for Smith to reasonably suspect that youth had brought a gun to the school for the purpose of harming V or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We turn to youth\u2019s alternative argument that the search of his backpack was unlawful because its seizure had dissipated any immediate threat to school safety. In <em>M. A. </em>D., the court analogized a school setting to circumstances involving the \u201cofficer-safety exception\u201d to the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9. As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cUnder the officer-safety exception, a police officer may take \u2018reasonable steps\u2019 \u2014 including a limited search \u2014 to protect the officer or others if, \u2018during the course of a lawful encounter with a citizen, the officer develops a reasonable suspicion, based upon specific and articulable facts, that the citizen might pose an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the officer or to others then present.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u00ab\u00ed\u00a1\u00ed ^ \u00edj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201c*** [T]he officer-safety exception requires reasonable suspicion of an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the officer or others, based on specific, articulable facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">In assessing whether an officer\u2019s actions are permitted based on those facts, the court \u2018asks only whether safety precautions chosen by the officer were reasonable under the perceived circumstances.\u2019 Because such \u2018reasonable steps,\u2019 which may include at least a limited search, do not violate Article I, section 9, evidence of wrongdoing obtained as a result of the search will not be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\u201c*** As persons responsible for maintaining a safe learning environment, when school officials perceive there to be an immediate threat to student or staff safety at a school, they must be able to take prompt, reasonable steps to remove that threat. As with an officer-safety search, when a school official develops a \u2018reasonable suspicion,\u2019 based on \u2018specific and articulable facts,\u2019 that a particular individual on school property either personally poses or is in the possession of some item that poses an \u2018immediate threat\u2019 to the safety of the student, the official, or others at the school, the school official \u2018must be allowed considerable latitude to take safety precautions.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\"><em>M.A. D., </em>348 Or at 391-93 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In short, the scope of a permissible school-safety search is determined by what is reasonable under the perceived circumstances, which, in turn, \u201cdepends on the nature of the safety threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392 n 5. For example, a \u201creasonable suspicion that the person searched is carrying a rifle\u201d would \u201cnot ordinarily be sufficient to justify a strip search of the person or a search of the person\u2019s wallet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In <em>State v. Gilkey/White, </em>172 Or App 95, 18 P3d 402 (2001), a police officer stopped a vehicle. The officer suspected that the occupants possessed methamphetamine. The officer seized, and subsequently searched, a closed tube of \u201cchapstick\u201d because he suspected that it might conceal a weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98. In concluding that the search violated the defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights, we explained that, \u201c[o]nce the officer had seized the [container], he no longer had any reason to believe that it still posed a threat to him[,]\u201d and, thus, \u201cno immediate officer safety concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>justified\u201d the officer\u2019s warrantless search. <em>Id. </em>at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted). Relying on <em>Gilkey/White, </em>youth asserts that, when Smith seized the backpack in this case, any threat to safety had dissipated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The court in <em>M. A. D. </em>noted that \u201cwe do not mean to suggest that the officer-safety doctrine and a school official\u2019s search of a student *** are identical in all respects.\u201d 348 Or at 393. In particular, the court emphasized that \u201cthe public school setting and the obligation of school officials to provide a safe learning environment requires that they be able to respond quickly to credible information *** about immediate threats.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the dispositive inquiry is what is reasonable under the perceived circumstances, fact matching from decisions involving markedly different circumstances is of little utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Here, Smith was confronted with an immediate threat both to a named student and to the general safety of the school. As noted, Glader told Smith that, in addition to V, youth might have threatened other, unidentified students. Smith did not know the type or size of the gun that youth reportedly had brought to school or the manner in which youth possessed it. That is, Smith did not know whether youth was carrying the gun on his person, had the gun in his backpack, or had concealed it somewhere else inside the school.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Smith was faced with the choice of returning the unopened backpack to youth, his mother, or the family friend, searching elsewhere in the school, or searching youth\u2019s person. Smith chose to search the backpack, and, in light of the other options, that choice was reasonable; it was the most likely to reveal a gun and dissipate the safety threat without further intrusions or delay. For those reasons, in light of the nature of the safety threat, Smith\u2019s decision to search youth\u2019s backpack was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-6\"> Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\"> Although youth notes that we have discretion to review this case <em>de novo, </em>he has not demonstrated that this is the kind of \u201cexceptional case\u201d that would justify such review.

Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo </em>and, instead, are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact that are supported by evidence in the record. <em>State v.
