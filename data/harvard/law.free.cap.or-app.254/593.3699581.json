J.</author>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The State Board of Chiropractic Examiners (board) found that petitioner had committed more than 800 violations of the provisions of ORS chapter 684, which governs the practice of chiropractic, and imposed a civil penalty of $201,250. Petitioner seeks judicial review of the board\u2019s order, arguing that the board lacks the power to discipline him because he never applied for or received a license to practice chiropractic in Oregon. Petitioner also argues that the board may not impose a civil penalty of more than $10,000 in a single disciplinary proceeding regardless of the number of violations committed. We conclude that the board has the power to discipline petitioner and to impose a fine of up to $10,000 per violation of the provisions of ORS chapter 684. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We begin with the facts found by the board, which petitioner does not dispute. From 2003 to 2008, petitioner, who was never licensed by the board and never applied for a license, owned two \u201cwellness\u201d clinics and employed a licensed chiropractor, Warner, who believed that petitioner was a licensed naturopathic physician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner examined and treated numerous patients, forged Warner\u2019s name on patients\u2019 charts, insurance forms, and other medical forms, and ordered x-rays in Warner\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In 2008, the board proposed a civil penalty of $226,500 against petitioner for that conduct. Petitioner requested a hearing. Before his hearing, petitioner moved for summary determination on the basis that the board lacked authority to levy a civil penalty against him. An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied that motion. After a hearing before the ALJ, a limited rehearing, and review by the board, the board issued a final order imposing a civil penalty of $201,250 against petitioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board explained the types of violations that petitioner had committed and the number of each type, as reflected in the following table:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Violation Number of Penalty per Total Violations Violation Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"akm-dedup-0\">Unlicensed practice on patients 560 $250 $140,000</p>\n<p id=\"Amf\">Forged signatures on charts 138 $250 $34,500</p>\n<p id=\"AdT\">Forged Medicare and Medicaid Forms 83 $250 $20,750</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1c\">Fraudulent referrals 19 $250 $4,750</p>\n<p id=\"AcP\">Forged signatures \u2014 insurance 4 $250 $1,000</p>\n<p id=\"avq-dedup-0\">Completing a work release form 1 $250 $250</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of the board\u2019s order, arguing that the relevant statutes demonstrate that the board may discipline only a licensee or an applicant for a license to practice chiropractic. He asserts that, because he was an unlicensed practitioner who never applied for a license, the board lacks authority to discipline him and the ALJ should have granted his motion for summary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">The board\u2019s authority derives from ORS chapter 684, in which the legislature has set out a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the practice of chiropractic. The board is charged with enforcement of the regulatory scheme and supervision of chiropractic practice. The most basic requirement of chapter 684 is that a practitioner of chiropractic be licensed: \u201cWithout first complying with the provisions of this chapter, no person shall * * * [p]ractice or attempt to practice chiropractic.\u201d ORS 684.015(l)(a); <em>see also </em>ORS 684.040 - 684.112 (governing licensing); ORS 684.020 (providing that, with exceptions not relevant here, \u201cit is unlawful for any person to practice chiropractic in this state unless the person first obtains and maintains an active license, as provided in this chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">The legislature granted the board rulemaking authority that reflects its supervisory role over the practice of chiropractic. The board may adopt rules \u201c[establishing standards and tests to determine the moral, intellectual, educational, scientific, technical and professional qualifications of applicants for licenses to practice in this state\u201d and \u201c[t]o enforce the provisions of [ORS chapter 684] and to exercise general supervision over the practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>chiropractic within this state.\u201d ORS 684.155(l)(a), (b). The board\u2019s supervisory role also includes enforcement of the statutory scheme and the board\u2019s rules through several types of disciplinary action. The text of ORS 684.100(1) demonstrates the breadth of that authority. That section provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u201c(1) The State Board of Chiropractic Examiners may refuse to grant a license to any applicant or may discipline a person upon any of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201c(a) Fraud or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201c(b) The practice of chiropractic under a false or assumed name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201c(c) The impersonation of another practitioner of like or different name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\u201c(p) Violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">ORS 684.100(9) lists seven types of discipline that the board may impose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\u201cIn disciplining a person as authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the board may use any or all of the following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">\u201c(a) Suspend judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">\u201c(b) Place the person on probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">\u201c(c) Suspend the license of the person to practice chiropractic in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">\u201c(d) Revoke the license of the person to practice chiropractic in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">\u201c(e) Place limitations on the license of the person to practice chiropractic in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-17\">\u201c(f) Impose a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">\u201c(g) Take other disciplinary action as the board in its discretion finds proper, including assessment of the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-19\">Petitioner argues that, despite the text of ORS 684.100(1), which provides that the board may discipline <em>\u201ca </em>person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>for \u201c [violation of any provision\u201d of chapter 684, the board does not have authority over those persons who violate the provision prohibiting unlicensed practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the scope of the board\u2019s disciplinary authority under ORS 684.100 presents a question of statutory interpretation. In interpreting a statute, our task is to discern the intent of the legislature. ORS 174.020(l)(a); <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). To determine what the legislature intended, we consider the text of a statute in context as well as any useful legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172. Nevertheless, our reliance on legislative history is circumscribed by the words of the statute, \u201cfor it is not the intent of the individual legislators that governs, but the intent of the legislature as formally enacted into law[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173. \u201c[0]nce the meaning and application of a statute have been put before us, we have an obligation to correctly construe and apply that statute.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Tri-Met, </em>234 Or App 615, 624, 228 P3d 1225, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010); <em>see also Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997) (\u201cIn construing a statute, this court is responsible for identifying the correct interpretation, whether or not asserted by the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">As explained below, based on the plain text of the statute, understood in the context of the comprehensive regulatory scheme, we conclude that the board may impose civil penalties against unlicensed practitioners of chiropractic like petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary, which are based on prior versions of the statute and on legislative history, do not persuade us that, contrary to the text, the statute does not grant the board that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We begin our analysis with the text and context of ORS 684.100. As set out above, chapter 684 provides that no person may practice chiropractic without first obtaining a license, ORS 684.015(l)(a), and the board has authority to \u201cdiscipline a person\u201d for \u201c[v]iolation of any provision of this chapter,\u201d ORS 684.100(l)(p). Thus, the board \u201cmay discipline a person\u201d for practicing chiropractic without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>If we were to attribute to <em>\u201ca </em>person\u201d the narrow definition that petitioner proposes \u2014 a licensee or an applicant \u2014 then the statute would prevent the board from disciplining unlicensed practitioners of chiropractic other than those who had applied for licensure. Consequently, it would prevent the board from imposing discipline for \u201cviolation of any provision of this chapter,\u201d ORS 684.100(l)(p), creating an inconsistency in the text of the statutory scheme. Thus, in order to give effect to the contents of subsection (1), <em>\u201ca </em>person\u201d must include an unlicensed practitioner. We now turn to petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Petitioner contends that, were we to understand <em>\u201ca </em>person\u201d to mean \u201cany person\u201d \u2014 including someone with no link to the practice of chiropractic \u2014 the board could discipline any person for \u201c[flraud or misrepresentation.\u201d ORS 684.100(l)(a) But our interpretation of \u201ca person\u201d is not so broad. We do not hold that, in context, \u201ca person\u201d means \u201cany person\u201d; instead, we determine the meaning of \u201ca person\u201d by reference to its statutory context.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Looking to the enumerated bases for discipline \u2014 particularly ORS 684.100(l)(p) \u2014 and the rest of the regulatory scheme, it is clear that the proper subjects of the board\u2019s discipline include persons, like petitioner, who violate chapter 684 by practicing chiropractic without a license. For present purposes, we need not determine whether anyone else falls under the board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Petitioner also argues that prior versions of ORS 684.100 demonstrate that the legislature never intended to grant the board power to discipline unlicensed practitioners. The premise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that, historically, the text of ORS 684.100 unambiguously limited the board\u2019s authority to licensees and applicants for licenses. Petitioner contends that the textual changes to the statute since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>1971 reflect no legislative intention to expand the board\u2019s authority to include unlicensed practitioners. Furthermore, petitioner posits, the legislative history of those changes supports that conclusion. Consequently, petitioner reasons that we must conclude that the board\u2019s authority remains limited despite text that suggests broader authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In order to address petitioner\u2019s argument, we set out the history of the provision in some detail. In 1971, ORS 684.100(1) provided, \u201cThe board may refuse to grant a license to any applicant who desires to practice chiropractic in this state or may suspend or revoke such a license upon any of the following grounds: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In 1973, the legislature enacted what is now ORS 684.100(l)(p), which provided that one of the bases for the board\u2019s denial, suspension, or revocation of a license was \u201c [violation of any provision of this chapter or a rule enacted thereunder.\u201d Or Laws 1973, ch 265, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In 1975, the legislature enacted ORS 684.100(9), which specified the methods by which the board could impose discipline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201cIn disciplining a person as authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the board may use any or all of the following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201c(a) Suspend judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201c(b) Place him on probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201c(c) Suspend his license to practice chiropractic in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">\u201c(d) Revoke his license to practice chiropractic in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">\u201c(e) Place limitations on his license to practice chiropractic in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">\u201c(f) Take such other disciplinary action as the board in its discretion finds proper, including assessment of the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Or Laws 1975, ch 492, \u00a7 5. In 1979, the legislature amended that provision to substitute <em>\u201ca </em>person\u201d and \u201cof the person\u201d for \u201chim\u201d and \u201chis\u201d in ORS 684.100(9)(b) to (e). Or Laws 1979, ch 744, \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In 1985, the Joint Committee on Sunset Review considered chapter 684 and received an extensive report on the history, practice, and regulation of chiropractic in Oregon. The report stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cUnder the law, persons providing chiropractic care must be licensed by the board. * * * Persons not licensed 'may not use the title \u2018chiropractor\u2019 or any abbreviation indicating they provide chiropractic care. The board\u2019s primary function is to enforce these standards and ensure that person providing chiropractic service abide by the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cBoard responsibilities include preparing and administering written and oral examinations, issuing licenses, and conducting investigations of alleged law violations. The board is authorized to suspend, revoke, refuse to renew, put licensees on probation, or place limitations on licensees for specified grounds. It may also require licensees to pass a competency examination or take any other disciplinary action it finds proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Testimony, Joint Committee on Sunset Review, HB 2264, Apr 15,1985, Ex E at 5-7 (report of Kevin Elverum, Director of Legislative Research). In communications with the Joint Committee on Sunset Review, the board requested \u201cthat it be given the authority to levy civil penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The legislature granted the board that power by inserting new text into ORS 684.100(1) and (9):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">\u201c(1) The board may refuse to grant a license to any applicant, * * * may suspend or revoke such a license or may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 upon any of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">\u201c(s) Violation of any provision of this chapter or a rule enacted thereunder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">\u00abHi Hi Hi \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">\u201c(9) In disciplining a person as authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the board may use any or all of the following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u00ab\u00edfc \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">\u201c(f) Impose a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Or Laws 1985, ch 354, \u00a7 5 (boldface designates new text).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Finally, the legislature amended ORS 684.100 again in 1991 to eliminate redundancies that had been created when the legislature added, and later amended, ORS 684.100(9). The legislature removed the text in the introduction to ORS 684.100(1) that listed some of the disciplinary actions that the board could take, because a full list of disciplinary actions appeared later in the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201cThe board may refuse to grant a license to any applicant <em>l may suspend or revoke such a license or may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000\\ or </em>may discipline a person upon any of the following grounds: * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Or Laws 1991, ch 892, \u00a7 7 (brackets and italics designate deleted text, boldface designates new text). In 1991, the legislature also increased the maximum amount of a civil penalty from $1,000 to $10,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Petitioner\u2019s argument begins with the proposition that, under the 1971 version of ORS 684.100, the board had authority to discipline only a licensee or an applicant. We agree. At that time, the text of ORS 684.100(1) permitted the board to refuse to grant a license, to suspend a license, or to revoke a license on enumerated grounds. That text did not grant the board authority over unlicensed practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Petitioner\u2019s argument then jumps from that 1971 baseline \u2014 authority to discipline only a licensee or an applicant \u2014 to 1991, when the legislature inserted \u201cor may discipline a person\u201d in place of the text that referred to suspension or revocation of a license and civil penalties. Petitioner argues that, \u201c[w]hen the legislature acted in 1991 to amend ORS 684.100(1), no other statutes or rules were enacted or amended in a manner that suggested the legislature intended to expand the scope of the Board\u2019s authority.\u201d Consequently, petitioner reasons, we should understand the 1991 Legislative Assembly\u2019s use of \u201ca person\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>part of a nonsubstantive change to eliminate redundancy rather than as a substantive change that expanded the board\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We agree with petitioner\u2019s contention that the context of the 1991 change suggests that it was not intended to expand the board\u2019s authority. However, petitioner is too hasty in jumping from the baseline meaning of the provision in 1971 directly to the 1991 amendment. As explained above, the legislature amended the statute several times in the interim. The textual changes that the legislature enacted during those years \u2014 specifically, those enacted in 1985\u2014 provided the board with authority to discipline unlicensed practitioners of chiropractic. Because the most persuasive evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent is \u201cthe words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes,\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171 (internal quotation marks omitted), we do not need independent evidence that legislators wished to expand the scope of the board\u2019s authority. The text of the statute demonstrates that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">As noted above, in 1985, ORS 684.100(1) was amended to provide,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201c(1) <em>The board may </em>refuse to grant a license to any applicant, * * * may suspend or revoke such a license or may <em>impose a civil penalty </em>not to exceed $1,000 <em>upon any of the following </em>grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">\u201c(s) <em>Violation of any provision of this chapter </em>or a rule enacted thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">(Emphases added.) That text provided the board with authority to impose civil penalties for violations of chapter 684. As discussed above, a \u201cprovision of this chapter\u201d is\u2014 and was, in 1985 \u2014 the prohibition on practicing chiropractic without a license. Thus, with the 1985 amendments, the legislature granted the board authority to impose a civil penalty for unlicensed practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Petitioner argues that another statute, ORS 684.105, provides context indicating that the legislature never intended to expand the board\u2019s disciplinary authority. That statute has not been amended since 1971, when it was first enacted. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\u201c(1) Where the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners proposes to refuse to issue a license, or proposes to revoke or suspend a license, opportunity for hearing shall be accorded as provided in ORS chapter 183 [the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">\u201c(2) Judicial review of orders under subsection (1) of this section shall be in accordance with ORS chapter 183.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">ORS 684.105. Petitioner contends that, had the legislature ever intended to expand the scope of the board\u2019s disciplinary authority to include unlicensed practitioners, it also would have expanded the scope of ORS 684.105 to include unlicensed practitioners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">It is true that the legislature never updated ORS 684.105 to accord with the broader authority that it granted to the board in the 1985 amendments. Nevertheless, we conclude that that discrepancy reflects a legislative oversight rather than a lack of legislative intent to expand the board\u2019s disciplinary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">As noted above, ORS 684.105 has not been amended since 1971, at which time the board\u2019s disciplinary authority was limited in two pertinent ways: First, the board lacked the power to impose civil penalties on anyone. Second, the board could discipline only applicants and licensees. The current text of ORS 684.105 retains both of those limitations. It makes a board proceeding subject to the APA only when the board \u201cproposes to refuse to issue a license, or proposes to revoke or suspend a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Petitioner does not dispute that the 1985 amendments granted the board authority to impose civil penalties on applicants and licensees. But ORS 684.105 does not make proceedings imposing such penalties subject to the APA. The fact that the legislature failed to broaden ORS 684.105 to include some disciplinary proceedings that are indisputably within the board\u2019s authority convinces us that the current wording of ORS 684.105 does not indicate that, contrary to the text of ORS 684.100, the legislature did not intend to expand the board\u2019s authority to include unlicensed practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Petitioner also argues that ORS 684.190(1) grants district attorneys the exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on unlicensed practice. That provision states, \u201cThe district attorneys shall prosecute all persons charged with violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. The executive director of the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, under the direction of the board, shall aid the district attorneys in the enforcement of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">We agree with petitioner that that provision grants enforcement power to district attorneys, but our reading of the text of ORS 684.100 demonstrates that that grant is not exclusive. Nothing in ORS 684.190(1) suggests the contrary. The provision allows prosecution for \u201cviolation of any of the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Nothing in the text distinguishes unlicensed practice \u2014 with regard to which petitioner argues the provision is exclusive \u2014 from any other \u201cviolation of * * * the provisions of this chapter\u201d \u2014 with regard to which petitioner concedes that the provision is not exclusive. Furthermore, the text of ORS 684.190(1) mirrors the text of ORS 684.100(l)(p), suggesting, contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, that the authority of the district attorneys to prosecute is coextensive with the authority of the board to discipline.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Finally, petitioner contends that legislative history demonstrates that the board lacks authority to discipline him. He cites the report considered by the Joint Committee on Sunset Review in 1985, quoted above, 254 Or App at 600, arguing that it demonstrates that the board\u2019s authority was limited to applicants and licensees. We agree that, up to the time of the 1985 amendment \u2014 that is, until after the report was researched and produced \u2014 the board\u2019s authority was so limited. However, as noted in the report, the board requested that the legislature amend ORS 684.100 to grant the board new disciplinary authority. The legislature did so, and, as explained above, the text of that change granted the board authority to impose civil penalties on unlicensed practitioners. That legislative action was consistent with both the board\u2019s request for the power to impose civil penalties and the report, which noted that \u201c[p]ersons not licensed may not use the title \u2018chiropractor\u2019 or any abbreviation indicating they provide chiropractic care. <em>The board\u2019s primary function is to enforce these standards and ensure that persons providing chiropractic service abide by the law.\u201d </em>Testimony, Joint Committee on Sunset Review, HB 2264, Apr 15,1985, Ex E at 5-6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Finally, petitioner argues that testimony of the board\u2019s executive director regarding an amendment proposed in 1991 shows that the board lacks authority to impose a civil penalty on petitioner. At that time, at the request of the board, the legislature enacted a new provision enabling the board to take injunctive action against any person violating the provisions of chapter 684. That provision, now codified at ORS 684.155(3), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201cWithout the necessity of prior administrative proceedings or hearing and entry of an order or at any time during such proceedings if they have been commenced, [the board may] institute proceedings to enjoin the practice of any person operating in violation of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Or Laws 1991, ch 892, \u00a7 10. Notably, that provision authorizes the board to seek an injunction for any violation of chapter 684; it is not limited to practice without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The board\u2019s executive director explained in written testimony that that provision would \u201callow the Board to stop a person from practicing without a license. The Board now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>has no jurisdiction over unlicensed persons who practice chiropractic.\u201d Testimony, House Committee on Business and Consumer Affairs, HB 2637, Mar 5,1991, Ex O at 2-3. In her remarks, the executive director explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201c[A] doctor * * * might move here from another state. He might be licensed in that state but unlicensed in our state, opens a clinic and begins to practice. Well, currently, we have no jurisdiction because this person is an unlicensed person, or one of our licensees will allow the license to lapse and continue to practice. Currently, our statute only allows us at that point to go to the district attorney with this and make a criminal case out of it. We would like to have statutory language which would allows us to stop that, to enjoin the doctor from practicing[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Tape Recording, House Committee on Business and Consumer Affairs, HB 2637, Mar 5,1991, Tape 44, Side A at 224-34 (statement of Christie Joachim).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">For two reasons, that legislative history does not change our conclusion. First, the relevant change to ORS 684.100 took place in 1985, not 1991. The belief of the board\u2019s executive director, a nonlegislator, in seeking a different statutory change six years later provides minimal guidance. <em>See DeFazio v. WPPSS, </em>296 Or 550, 561, 679 P2d 1316 (1984) (\u201cThe views legislators have of existing law may shed light on a new enactment, but it is of no weight in interpreting a law enacted by their predecessors.\u201d); <em>see also Patton v. Target Corp., </em>349 Or 230, 242, 242 P3d 611 (2010) (noting that \u201cthe comment of a single legislator at one committee hearing generally is of dubious utility in determining the intent of the legislature in enacting a statute (and the comment of a nonlegislator witness even less helpful)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Second, even if the testimony were relevant, it would not be persuasive because it does not clearly address the board\u2019s ability to impose civil penalties as opposed to the board\u2019s ability to stop unlawful practice. The executive director\u2019s statements about the board\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d appear broad. However, the ultimate request is for \u201cstatutory language which would allow us to stop [unlicensed practice] , <em>to enjoin the doctor from practicing.\u201d </em>Tape Recording, House Committee on Business and Consumer Affairs, HB 2637, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Mar 5,1991, Tape 44, Side A at 224-34 (statement of Christie Joachim) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Furthermore, the text of the provision that the legislature enacted is inconsistent with petitioner\u2019s reading of the executive director\u2019s remarks in two ways. If the executive director\u2019s concern was that the board lacked any means by which to discipline unlicensed practitioners, then the text of the statute is underinclusive because it grants the board only one means by which to discipline them\u2014 injunctive action. By the same token, the text is overinclusive because it grants the board authority to seek an injunction for any violation of chapter 684 \u2014 not just unlicensed practice. Thus, the text of the provisions suggests that the executive director\u2019s remarks may have been directed only toward the board\u2019s ability to <em>enjoin </em>unlicensed practice, not toward its ability to impose any discipline whatsoever. Consequently, the executive director\u2019s statement does not persuade us that the board lacks authority to impose civil penalties on unlicensed practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">In his second assignment of error, petitioner posits that, if the board did have authority to impose a civil penalty on him, that penalty could not exceed a total of $10,000 because it was imposed in a single proceeding. As set out in greater detail above, 254 Or App at 596, ORS 684.100(1) provides that the board \u201cmay discipline a person upon <em>any </em>of the [enumerated] grounds [.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) And, ORS 684.100(9)(f) provides, \u201cIn disciplining a person as authorized by subsection (1) of this section, the board may use any or all of the following methods: * * * Impose a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000.\u201d Petitioner contends that, \u201c[b]ecause the statute does not specifically authorize a $10,000 maximum \u2018per violation\u2019 or \u2018for each offense,\u2019 * * * the maximum must be construed to apply to the single disciplinary proceeding [at issue here].\u201d He cites several other statutes that authorize civil penalties in other contexts, all of which include statements specifying that the penalty is \u201cfor each offense\u201d or \u201cper violation\u201d. <em>See </em>ORS 260.995; ORS 672.690(1); ORS 673.400(2); ORS 674.850(1); ORS 671.995(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The text of ORS 684.100, however, demonstrates that the board may impose a penalty of up to $10,000 for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>violation of chapter 684. The civil penalty is a method that the board may use \u201c [i] n disciplining a person as authorized by subsection (1) of this section.\u201d ORS 684.100(9)(f). Subsection (1) authorizes the board to \u201cdiscipline a person upon any of the following grounds!.]\u201d ORS 684.100(1). It proceeds to enumerate those grounds. Here, the board elected to discipline petitioner for 805 prohibited acts. For each of those acts, the board was entitled to \u201cuse any or all of the * * * methods\u201d set out in ORS 684.100(9). Those methods include \u201c[i]mpos[ing] a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000.\u201d ORS 684.100(9)(f). The board imposed a penalty of $250 for each prohibited act. That was within its power.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> From 2003 to 2005, petitioner owned one clinic.

Instead, the question before us is whether ORS 684.100(1) refers to persons \u2014 individual or <em>corporate </em>\u2014 who <em>are unlicensed practitioners.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-14\"> That provision was originally eneacted as ORS 684.100(l)(s).

That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cThe lapse, suspension or revocation of a license issued under ORS chapter 684 by the operation of law or by order of the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners or by the decision of a court of law, or the voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee, shall not deprive the board of jurisdiction to proceed with any investigation of or any action or disciplinary proceeding against the licensee or to revise or render null and void an order of disciplinary action against the licensee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Petitioner asserts that the board\u2019s proposed interpretation of ORS 684.100 renders that provision redundant because, \u201c[i]f the Board has jurisdiction over <em>any </em>person, regardless of his or her status, jurisdiction would not divest when a license expired.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Our holding here, however, is directed toward a situation different from the one addressed by ORS 684.156. We conclude that ORS 684.100 provides the hoard with authority over an unlicensed practitioner \u2014 that is, someone who, at the time of the <em>violation </em>of chapter 684, is not licensed. ORS 684.156 provides jurisdiction over a person who, although he or she was licensed at the time of the violation, is no longer licensed at the time of the <em>disciplinary proceeding. </em>Consequently, our holding does not render ORS 684.156 redundant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
