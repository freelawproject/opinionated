Plaintiff PIH Beaverton, the current owner of the hotel, brought a negligent-construction claim against Super One, a general contractor, and various subcontractors (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d). Super One, in turn, sought indemnity from two subcontractors: (I) Gary Thompson dba Portland Plastering Company (Portland Plastering), via a cross-claim, and (2) Wood Mechanix, Inc., via third-party claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants moved for summary judgment against plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim, and the trial court granted those motions on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s claim was time barred because it was brought after the 10-year ultimate repose period set forth in ORS 12.135. We discuss plaintiff\u2019s appeal from that decision (A142268) in the first section of this opinion, below. Wood Mechanix and Portland Plastering then moved to dismiss Super One\u2019s claims for contractual indemnity. In granting that motion, the trial court agreed with the subcontractors\u2019 argument that Super One\u2019s indemnity claims also were time-barred under ORS 12.135. We discuss Super One\u2019s appeal from that decision (A142301) in the second section of this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In the end, we conclude that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to defendants on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s negligent construction claim was time-barred. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants and remand for further proceedings. We reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to the trial court\u2019s dismissal of defendant Super One\u2019s indemnity claims against Wood Mechanix and Portland Plastering. We affirm that aspect of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>PLAINTIFF\u2019S APPEAL FROM SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN DEFENDANTS\u2019 FAVOR ON PLAINTIFF\u2019S NEGLIGENT CONSTRUCTION CLAIM (A142268)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">As noted above, the trial court granted summary judgment to defendants on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s negligent construction claim was time barred. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the claim is barred by ORS 12.135(1) (2007),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a statute of ultimate repose. Defendants contend that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct and alternatively argue that, if ORS 12.135(1) does not bar plaintiff\u2019s claim, ORS 12.115 does. We agree with the trial court that ORS 12.135(1) is the applicable statute. Unlike the trial court, however, we conclude that evidence in the record creates a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u201cOn review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we view the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment to determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Pincetich v. Nolan, </em>252 Or App 42, 46, 285 P3d 759 (2012). In this case, there is no dispute about the majority of the historical facts. Rather, the parties\u2019 arguments relate primarily to the proper interpretation of ORS 12.135(1) and whether the facts on summary judgment establish, as a matter of law, that plaintiff\u2019s action was untimely under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The facts, described in the light most favorable to plaintiff, are as follows: In December, 1995, VIP\u2019s Industries, Inc., and VIP\u2019s Motor Inns, Inc.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contracted with defendant Super One, a general contractor, to build a hotel and perform certain related site work. Super One engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the remaining defendants, as subcontractors, to perform specific aspects of the construction. On February 13, 1997, VIP\u2019s filed a \u201cNotice of Completion\u201d of the hotel pursuant to ORS 87.045, a statute related to the filing of construction liens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also on February 13, 1997, Washington County issued a certificate for \u201cTemporary Occupancy from 2/13/97-3/3/97\u201d for the hotel. According to Steven Johnson, the then-president of VIP\u2019s Motor Inns, Inc., posting and recording a notice of completion was always done \u201cas a routine matter when a hotel was about to open.\u201d He explained that VIP\u2019s sometimes \u201cmight even take possession of the property under a temporary certificate of occupancy\u201d before the property was fully complete. Here, the parties agree that VIP\u2019s did, in fact, begin accepting guests and operating the hotel on or around February 13,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Regarding the status of the hotel\u2019s construction in early 1997, Johnson testified that he did not \u201chave an independent recollection of exact dates,\u201d but said that he did \u201cnot believe [defendants] had completed their work as of [February 13].\u201d Johnson asserted that he knew that \u201cconstruction efforts and work by Super One on the job site\u201d continued even after the contractors had submitted all pay applications \u201cbecause work just needed to be done. Things needed to be completed.\u201d Johnson further testified that he specifically recalled \u201cthere being quite a bit of work to be done between ourselves in order to * * * complete the project.\u201d When asked if particular contractors had performed work after February 13,1997, Johnson testified that he knew \u201cfor a fact\u201d that Super One had. He explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cTo the best of my recollection, specifically, there was work to do at the back of the property having to do with storm drainage and wetlands * * * [n]ot after the building itself was completed [,] * * * [but] after we took possession and occupied and opened for business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Johnson did not \u201chave a specific recollection of individual items as to the structure,\u201d as opposed to the storm-drainage and wetlands work, that were left to be done after February 13, 1997, but reiterated that the company\u2019s \u201ctypical practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and experience was to have quite a bit of work still left to do\u201d after the initial occupancy, given that it \u201cusually pushed very, very, hard to get into possession and open for business as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Johnson also filed a declaration commenting on when he would have considered the hotel to be complete. Specifically, Johnson declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cTo the best of my recollection, I did not provide written acceptance of Super One\u2019s work under the terms of the Construction Contract, nor do I recall that the project architect, Charles Hagel, provided a Certificate of Substantial Completion.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] I considered construction of the Hotel by Super One to be complete once all Washington County approvals were obtained, a final certificate of occupancy issued, and Super One completed all work required under the contract for construction of the Hotel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The architect for the hotel similarly declared that he \u201cconsidered construction of the Hotel to be complete when the appropriate government permitting authority issued a final Certificate of Occupancy.\u201d Washington County issued a \u201cNotice of Completion of Final Inspection Requirements and Certificate of Occupancy\u2019 for the hotel on September 24, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Plaintiff purchased the hotel from VIP\u2019s in 2006. Soon after that purchase, plaintiff allegedly discovered multiple, significant construction defects with the \u201c[b]uilding\u2019s envelope and other components,\u201d resulting in \u201cwater intrusion and property damage to, among other things, the siding, sheathing, framing and trim on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Building.\u201d Plaintiff filed suit for negligent construction against defendants on May 23, 2007 \u2014 more than 10 years after VIP\u2019s filed the February 13, 1997, \u201cNotice of Completion\u201d under ORS 87.045, but less than 10 years after September 24, 1997, when Washington County issued its final notice of completion and certificate of occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred either by ORS 12.115(1) or by ORS 12.135(1). The former statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cIn no event shall any action for negligent injury to person or property of another be commenced more than 10 years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">ORS 12.115(1). The latter statute provides, as relevant, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201c[a]n action against a person, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising from such person having performed the construction, alteration or repair of any improvement to real property * * * shall be commenced within 10 years from <em>substantial completion </em>or abandonment of such construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201c(3) For purposes of this section, \u2018substantial completion\u2019 means the date when the contractee accepts in writing the construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property or any designated portion thereof as having reached that state of completion when it may be used or occupied for its intended purpose or, if there is no such written acceptance, the date of acceptance of the completed construction, alteration or repair of such improvement by the contractee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">ORS 12.135 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion based on ORS 12.135(1). In doing so, the court rejected defendants\u2019 argument that the February 13,1997, \u201cNotice of Completion\u201d constituted a \u201cwritten acceptance\u201d under ORS 12.135(3) that, standing alone, would be sufficient to trigger the ultimate-repose period. The court reasoned, however, that the existence of that notice, in combination with select terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of the construction contract, VIP\u2019s undisputed occupancy and use of the hotel on or about February 13, 1997, and a \u201clack of any specific evidence of work performed after [that date] by any of the defendants on any of the structures that are the subject of the claims in this lawsuit,\u201d meant that the project was, in fact, substantially completed by February 13, 1997, and that the repose period therefore began to run on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in applying ORS 12.135(1). It contends that, under a proper application of the statute, a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the date on which the ultimate-repose period began to run. Defendants urge us to uphold the trial court\u2019s decision under ORS 12.135(1) (although they do not wholly endorse the trial court\u2019s reasoning) and alternatively argue that, if ORS 12.135(1) does not bar plaintiff\u2019s claim, ORS 12.115 does.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">As an initial matter, we agree with the trial court that ORS 12.135(1) is the ultimate-repose statute that applies to plaintiff\u2019s claim for negligent construction. That statute applies specifically to claims against a person arising from that person\u2019s construction of an improvement to real property \u201cwhether in contract, tort or otherwise.\u201d \u201cAccordingly, it controls over the more general negligence provision of ORS 12.115.\u201d <em>Sunset Presbyterian Church v. Brockamp &amp; Jaeger, </em>254 Or App 24, 31, 295 P3d 62 (2012). The remaining question, then, is whether the trial court properly applied ORS 12.135(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">As noted, ORS 12.135(1) bars claims arising from the construction of an improvement to real property that are filed more than 10 years after the \u201csubstantial completion\u201d of the construction. Unlike some other statutes that also refer to \u201csubstantial completion\u201d but do not define the term, ORS 12.135 includes a definition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because that statutory definition of \u201csubstantial completion\u201d is key to our decision in this case, we quote it again here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u201cFor purposes of this section, \u2018substantial completion\u2019 means the date when the contractee accepts in writing the construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property or any designated portion thereof as having reached that state of completion when it may be used or occupied for its intended purpose or, if there is no such written acceptance, the date of acceptance of the completed construction, alteration or repair of such improvement by the contractee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">ORS 12.135(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">That definition has two parts. Under the first clause of subsection (3), \u201csubstantial completion\u201d occurs \u2014 and the ultimate-repose period in ORS 12.135(1) begins to run\u2014 on \u201cthe date when the contractee <em>accepts in writing </em>the construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property or any designated portion thereof as having reached that state of completion when it may be used or occupied for its intended purpose^]\u201d ORS 12.135(3) (emphasis added). Thus, that first part of the definition contemplates that a construction project may be \u201csubstantially completed\u201d before it is <em>finally </em>completed. Importantly, however, no matter how much work has been done on an improvement to real property, that improvement will be considered \u201csubstantially complete\u201d under the first clause of ORS 12.135(3) only if the contractee has <em>accepted in writing </em>that it has \u201creached that state of completion when it may be used or occupied for its intended purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In the absence of that kind of \u201cwritten acceptance,\u201d the second clause of ORS 12.135(3) applies. It dictates that substantial completion will be deemed to occur on the date of the contractee\u2019s \u201cacceptance of the completed construction, alteration or repair of such improvement.\u201d Significantly\u2014 and in contrast to the first clause \u2014 that second part of the ORS 12.135(3) definition does not incorporate any notion of less-than-total completion. Rather, it somewhat counterintuitively defines \u201csubstantial completion\u201d in terms of the contractee accepting construction of an improvement to real property, or any designated portion thereof, that actually has been \u201ccompleted.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>On appeal, defendants renew their argument that plaintiffs claims are time barred under the first, \u201cwritten acceptance,\u201d clause of ORS 12.135(3). They contend that VIP\u2019s filing of the February 13, 1997, notice of completion constituted a qualifying \u201cwritten acceptance.\u201d We, like the trial court, reject that argument. The February 13 notice of completion states, in part, that \u201cnotice is hereby given that the building, structure and other improvements, including site improvements on [the hotel] have been completed.\u201d It goes on to notify all persons claiming a construction lien on the property that they should \u201cfile a claim as required by ORS 87.035.\u201d That notice simply echoes the statutory requirements for notices posted to trigger the 75-day period for perfecting construction liens. Nothing about it purports to constitute \u201cacceptance\u201d of an improvement to real property. And even if the notice could be viewed as an acceptance of <em>something, </em>it would not necessarily be an acceptance that the hotel project was sufficiently complete to \u201cbe used or occupied for its intended purpose,\u201d as the first clause of ORS 12.135(3) requires. <em>See Dallas LBR. &amp; Supply v. Phillips, </em>249 Or 58, 59-60, 436 P2d 739 (1968) (noting that an ORS 87.045 notice did not establish the date of \u201csubstantial completion,\u201d where the notice was filed by an employee of the mortgagee who had no \u201cknowledge or information at all about the completion of the house\u201d). In short, we agree with the trial court that filing a notice under ORS 87.045 \u201cdoes not necessarily equal substantial completion for purposes of starting the statute of [ultimate repose] for bringing a construction defect suit.\u201d The trial court ruled correctly that defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on their theory that plaintiff\u2019s action was time-barred under the first clause of ORS 12.135(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>We part with the trial court\u2019s reasoning, however, with respect to the second clause of that statute, which provides that, absent \u201cwritten acceptance\u201d under the first clause, substantial completion occurs on \u201cthe date of acceptance of the completed construction, alteration or repair of such improvement by the contractee.\u201d ORS 12.135(3). The .trial court determined that February 13,1997, was \u201cthe date of acceptance of the completed construction\u201d for purposes of that clause. In reaching that conclusion, the trial court relied largely on the notice of completion discussed above, the evidence that VIP\u2019s occupied and utilized the hotel on February 13, 1997, and the construction contract, which defined \u201csubstantial completion,\u201d for purposes of <em>its </em>provisions, as \u201cthe stage in the progress of the Work when the Work or designated portion thereof is sufficiently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its intended use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We do not view those considerations as establishing, as a matter of law, that plaintiff had accepted the \u201ccompleted\u201d improvement to real property on February 13, 1997, for purposes of the second clause of ORS 12.135(3). As explained above, the second clause of subsection (3) does not relate to the date on which an improvement can be occupied or utilized for its intended purpose, as the first clause does. Instead, the second clause references the date on which the contractee \u201caccepts\u201d the construction as \u201ccompleted.\u201d ORS 12.135(3). \u201cComplete,\u201d as relevant here, means \u201cpossessing all necessary parts, items, components or elements : not lacking anything necessary : ENTIRE, PERFECT,\u201d or \u201cbrought to an end or to a final or intended condition * * * : CONCLUDED, COMPLETED,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>465 (unabridged ed 2002), and thus does not encompass the incomplete. In short, a consideration of the text shows that the second clause of ORS 12.135(3) applies only when a contractee has accepted construction that <em>actually </em>has been completed. That interpretation is consistent with the legislative history establishing that the point of completion is reached, for purposes of the second clause of ORS 12.135(3), \u201cwhen the contractee takes from the contractor responsibility for the maintenance, alteration, and repair of the improvement, which typically, if not invariably, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>will be the point at which little or no work remains to be done by the contractor.\u201d <em>Sunset Presbyterian Church, </em>254 Or App at 34. Thus, it is possible that a contractee might not accept construction of an improvement to real property as having been \u201ccompleted\u201d (for purposes of the second clause of ORS 12.135(3)) until some time after the date on which the contractee occupied the improvement or otherwise started utilizing the improvement for its intended purpose (and the project would have been considered \u201csubstantially complete\u201d under the first clause of ORS 12.135(3) if the contractee had provided the required \u201cwritten acceptance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Indeed, this record includes evidence suggesting both that work on the project was not completed until sometime after the date on which VIP\u2019s occupied the hotel and that VIP\u2019s did not accept the construction as completed until that later time. That evidence includes Johnson\u2019s testimony that storm-drainage and wetlands work remained to be done after VIP\u2019s took possession and opened the hotel for business, as well as his testimony that he did not consider the hotel to be complete until all \u201cWashington County approvals were obtained, a final certificate of occupancy issued, and Super One completed all work required under the contract for construction of the Hotel.\u201d The record also reflects that Washington County did not issue its \u201cNotice of Completion of Final Inspection Requirements and Certificate of Occupancy\u201d for the hotel until September 24, 1997 \u2014 over seven months after VIP\u2019s\u2019 initial occupancy. A factfinder could infer from that evidence that VIP\u2019s would not have accepted the construction as completed until the remaining work was finished and final approvals obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The terms of the construction contract between VIP\u2019s and the general contractor (Super One) also could support a finding that VIP\u2019s did not accept the improvement as \u201ccompleted\u201d until sometime after it occupied the hotel, as the contract distinguishes between \u201csubstantial completion\u201d and \u201cfinal completion.\u201d First, the contract required the contractor to prepare and submit a \u201ccomprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected\u201d upon substantial completion of \u201cthe Work.\u201d In other words, the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>contemplated that \u201csubstantial completion\u201d \u2014 as that term was used in the contract (not in ORS 12.135(3)) \u2014 could occur when some work still remained to be done. The contract then discussed \u201cfinal completion and final payment\u201d in terms of a <em>subsequent </em>post-inspection date on which the architect would approve the construction as having been \u201ccompleted in accordance with terms and conditions of the Contract.\u201d Thus, the contract terms, too, could support a determination that VIP\u2019s\u2019 occupancy of the hotel on February 13,1997, did not equate to VIP\u2019s\u2019 having accepted the construction as \u201ccompleted\u201d on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We conclude that the evidence outlined above raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether VIP\u2019s\u2019 \u201cacceptance of the completed construction\u201d of the improvement to real property occurred on February 13,1997, as the trial court found, or some time after May 23, 1997\u2014 and thus within 10 years of the date on which plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed. ORS 12.135(1), (3). Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s negligent construction claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">SUPER ONE\u2019S APPEAL FROM JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF PORTLAND PLASTERING AND WOOD MECHANIX ON SUPER ONE\u2019S INDEMNITY CLAIMS (A142301)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As explained above, after plaintiff filed its negligent construction suit against Super One on May 23,2007, Super One filed a cross-claim against Portland Plastering and a third-party claim against Wood Mechanix for, among other things, contractual indemnity for Super One\u2019s defense costs and liability to plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Portland Plastering and Wood Mechanix both moved to dismiss, arguing to the trial court that Super One\u2019s indemnity claims were barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>10-year ultimate repose period set forth in ORS 12.135(1). The trial court agreed, and it entered judgment dismissing all claims brought by Super One against Portland Plastering and Wood Mechanix.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">On appeal, Super One concedes that its indemnity claims were not commenced within 10 years of the hotel\u2019s substantial completion. Nonetheless, it argues, those claims are not time barred because ORS 12.135(1) does not apply to indemnity claims as a matter of law. We conclude, to the contrary, that ORS 12.135(1) does apply to Super One\u2019s indemnity claims against the subcontractors. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of those claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Again, ORS 12.135(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cAn. action against a person, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising from such person having performed the construction, alteration or repair of any improvement to real property or the supervision or inspection thereof, or from such person having furnished the design, planning, surveying, architectural or engineering services for such improvement, shall be commenced within the applicable period of limitation otherwise established by law; but in any event such action shall be commenced within 10 years from substantial completion or abandonment of such construction, alteration or repair of the improvement to real property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We determine whether the legislature intended ORS 12.135(1) to apply to claims for indemnity by looking to the text, context, and useful legislative history of the provision. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Looking first to text, the statute contemplates that the ultimate repose period applies to <em>any </em>action \u201carising from\u201d certain construction-related activities, regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of the legal theory that forms the basis for the action\u2014 that is the import of the phrase \u201cwhether in contract, tort or otherwise.\u201d The question posed by this appeal, then, is what it means for an action to \u201carise from\u201d the construction-related activities described in ORS 12.135(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Black v. Arizala, 337 </em>Or 250, 95 P3d 1109 (2004), provides a starting point for our analysis, as it explains the meaning of the phrase \u201caction * * * arising from,\u201d albeit in a different context. In <em>Black, </em>the court looked to dictionary definitions as it considered the meaning of a contract\u2019s reference to actions \u201carising from\u201d that contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cThe dictionary defines the verb \u2018arise\u2019 to include \u2018to originate from a specific source [,]\u2019 \u2018to come into being [,]\u2019 and \u2018to become operative[.]\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>117 (unabridged ed 1993). The dictionary also explains that \u2018from\u2019 is \u2018used as a function word to indicate the source or original or moving force of something: as * * * (4) the place of origin, source, or derivation of a material or immaterial <em>thing[T Id. </em>at 913.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 267 (brackets in <em>Black). </em>Thus, the court concluded, an action \u201carises from\u201d a contract if the contract is \u201cthe specific place of origin or the source of the legal action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The definitions cited by the Supreme Court in <em>Black </em>are equally helpful to our construction of ORS 12.135(1). Applying those definitions, we conclude that the phrase beginning with \u201carising from\u201d and ending with \u201csuch improvement\u201d \u2014 that is, the part of ORS 12.135(1) that describes certain construction-related activities \u2014 identifies the factual origins from which a legal action must derive for ORS 12.135(1) to apply to that action. Thus, the text of ORS 12.135 suggests that it applies to indemnity actions that, as in this case, ultimately derive from the indemnitor\u2019s allegedly defective performance of construction-related activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Super One rejects that interpretation of the statute. It contends that its contractual indemnity claims against Portland Plastering and Wood Mechanix do not \u201carise from\u201d those subcontractors\u2019 performance of any construction but, instead, \u201carise from\u201d the indemnity provisions in the contracts between Super One and the subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">We are not persuaded by Super One\u2019s argument, which does not identify any meaningful distinction between a claim for contractual indemnity and any other claim that sounds in contract. \u201c[I]ndemnity is a remedy, not a cause of action[,]\u201d and \u201c[t]he right to indemnity must be based on a legal theory of recovery which specifies the legal reason why one party is responsible to hold another party harmless <em>\u201d Freeport Investment Co. v. R.A. Gray &amp; Co., </em>94 Or App 648, 651, 767 P2d 83, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 33 (1989). When the right to indemnity is based on a contract, the terms of that contract identify when one party to the contract may have a claim against another. Here, the pertinent contracts provide that Portland Plastering and Wood Mechanix will indemnify Super One for \u201call claims, loss, damage, injury, suits and liability arising out of or resulting directly or indirectly from performance\u201d of those contracts, which related to the performance of construction activities on the hotel project (for Portland Plastering, installation of an exterior insulation finish system (EIFS); for Wood Mechanix, framing and window installation). Thus, any contractual right to indemnity that Super One might have <em>necessarily </em>would arise from the subcontractors\u2019 performance of their contractual construction-related duties \u2014 that is, from \u201cconstruction * * * of [an] improvement to real property\u201d within the meaning of ORS 12.135(1). <em>Cf. So. Pac. Co. v. Morrison-Knudsen Co., </em>216 Or 398, 408, 338 P2d 665 (1959) (a contractual claim for indemnity \u201carises out of a liability flowing from the indemnitee\u2019s negligent conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In arguing to the contrary, Super One relies heavily on <em>Huff v. Shiomi, </em>73 Or App 605, 699 P2d 1178 (1985). Super One contends that, in that case, \u201cthis court recognized that an indemnity claim is different in kind from the underlying action from which the indemnity claim is derived, and thus not governed by the statute of repose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>applicable to the underlying action.\u201d Super One reads too much into our limited discussion concerning the statute of repose that was at issue in <em>Huff. </em>In that case, we summarily concluded that ORS 30.905 (1983) amended by Or Laws 2009, ch 485, \u00a7 1, which prescribed the limitation and ultimate repose periods for \u201cproduct liability civil action [s],\u201d did not apply to a common-law indemnity claim that a defendant physician brought against the manufacturer of medication that the physician had prescribed to the plaintiff patient. Our unexplained conclusion may have been based on the statutory definition of a \u201cproduct liability civil action\u201d as \u201ca civil action brought against a manufacturer, distributor, seller or lessor of a product <em>for damages for personal injury, death or property damages </em>arising out of [specified factual situations].\u201d ORS 30.900 (emphasis added). The indemnity claim in <em>Huff </em>was not an \u201caction * * * for damages for personal injury, death or property damages.\u201d Rather, the damages in that case would have been compensation for losses related to the physician\u2019s discharge of a common liability between the manufacturer and the physician. Consequently, the claim in <em>Huff </em>would not have qualified as a \u201cproduct liability civil action\u201d to which ORS 30.905 (1983) would have applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Turning to the case at bar, ORS 12.135(1), unlike ORS 30.905 (1983), does not tie the applicability of its repose provisions to claims for which the plaintiff seeks a certain type of damages. ORS 12.135(1) instead applies to <em>any </em>action, \u201cin contract, tort, or otherwise,\u201d regardless of the type of damages sought, so long as the action arises out of the specified construction-related circumstances. In short, ORS 12.135(1) covers a broader range of actions than ORS 30.905 (1983), and <em>Huff </em>therefore does not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We also reject Super One\u2019s argument that the legislative history of ORS 12.135 weighs against a conclusion that the statute covers indemnity claims. In making that contention, Super One points out that nothing in the legislative history of the original 1971 enactment of ORS 12.135, nor in the 1983 amendments to that statute, evidences a legislative intent <em>not </em>to exclude indemnity claims from ORS 12.135(1). That argument overlooks the 1991 amendments to ORS 12.135, which resulted from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>year\u2019s Senate Bill 722. Or Laws 1991, ch 968 \u00a7 1. When SB 722 (1991) was first introduced, it contained a provision that, if enacted, would have added a new subsection to ORS 12.135 excluding from the statute\u2019s coverage \u201cany action for contribution or indemnity arising out of an action brought pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, whether based in contract or tort.\u201d <em>See </em>Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 722, May 6, 1991, Exs B &amp; C (amendments and hand engrossed bill). That revision was later stricken from the bill, and the language applying ORS 12.135 to any action \u201cagainst a person, whether in contract, tort or otherwise\u201d was retained. <em>Id. </em>That legislative history suggests that the legislature knew how to exempt indemnity actions from ORS 12.135(1), and chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Our construction of ORS 12.135(1) also is consistent with legislative intent to both \u201cfix[] a starting date for applying the statutory time limits to actions against construction contractors [,]\u201d <em>Securities-Intermountain v. Sunset Fuel, </em>289 Or 243, 250, 611 P2d 1158 (1980), and\u2014 by establishing a 10-year repose period \u2014 \u201cto provide an absolute cutoff date for the bringing of such actions.\u201d <em>Beals v. Breeden Bros., Inc., </em>113 Or App 566, 572, 833 P2d 348, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 727 (1992); <em>see also Shasta View Irrigation Dist. v. Amoco Chemicals, </em>329 Or 151, 162, 986 P2d 536 (1999) (ultimate repose periods provide a \u201cdeadline for the initiation of an action whether or not the injury has been discovered or has even occurred,\u201d and \u201ccannot be extended regardless of unfairness to the plaintiff\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As with other statutory periods of ultimate repose, the 10-year period in ORS 12.135(1) serves two purposes: (1) to avoid \u201cthe lack of reliability and availability of evidence after a lapse of long periods of time;\u201d and (2) to allow people, \u201cafter the lapse of a reasonable time, to plan their affairs with a degree of certainty, free from the disruptive burden of protracted and unknown liability.\u201d <em>Beals, </em>113 Or App at 571 (internal quotation marks omitted). We perceive no reason why those rationales do not apply as strongly to. general contractors\u2019 claims against subcontractors as they do to property owners\u2019 claims against general contractors, subcontractors, and anybody else who may have \u201cperformed the construction, alteration or repair of any improvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to real property,\u201d supervised or inspected that work, or \u201cfurnished the design, planning, surveying, architectural or engineering services for such improvement [.]\u201d ORS 12.135(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The considerations outlined above lead us to conclude that ORS 12.135(1) applies to indemnity actions that ultimately derive from the indemnitor\u2019s allegedly defective performance of construction-related activities. The statute thus applies to Super One\u2019s indemnity claims against Portland Plastering and Wood Mechanix. Super One has conceded that, if ORS 12.135(1) applies, its claims are time barred because they were filed \u201cmore than ten years after the hotel was substantially completed.\u201d Given that concession, we conclude that the trial court correctly dismissed Super One\u2019s indemnity claims against the subcontractors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In sum, we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiff\u2019s negligent construction claim. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that claim. We also conclude, however, that the trial court correctly entered judgment in favor of Portland Plastering and Wood Mechanix on Super One\u2019s indemnity claims. Accordingly, we affirm that aspect of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In A142268, reversed and remanded.
