He raises five assignments of error, all but one of which we reject without discussion. We write only to address petitioner\u2019s contention that the post-conviction court erred in excluding trial counsel\u2019s testimony \u2014 given as part of an Oregon State Bar disciplinary proceeding\u2014 on the ground that it was irrelevant. Petitioner argues that the testimony is relevant to his post-conviction claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate. Specifically, petitioner argues that it is relevant to show trial counsel\u2019s knowledge of certain statements made by the prosecutor prior to the second of two trials and to show \u201cwhy [trial counsel] did or did not take certain actions\u201d in his representation of petitioner. We agree with petitioner that the testimony was relevant for those reasons and that its exclusion was not harmless. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new post-conviction trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In 1999, petitioner was charged with two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427, after the complainant alleged that petitioner touched her inappropriately while she was playing at a house where petitioner was visiting. A trial on those charges ended with a hung jury. Petitioner filed a complaint with the Oregon State Bar alleging that the prosecutor had made improper statements to the public, including jurors from the first trial, and the Bar began an investigation. In a subsequent letter to the Bar, the prosecutor explained that he had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cadvised [a juror from the first trial] that there were other <em>rumors </em>about [petitioner] that also caused me to be concerned. One of the <em>rumors </em>was a suspicion voiced by [petitioner\u2019s] former wife to Mrs. Carpenter[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] that at one time she had been concerned that [petitioner] had been involved with a female student at the school where he was a teacher. I informed this juror that I had made some inquiry into this matter but that I had been unable to find any independent information about [petitioner\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s] suspicion as it had been related to me. I also stated that such an allegation did not warrant any detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>investigation to determine whether it was true or not as it would likely have no evidentiary value in the case at hand because of the lack of similarity in the situations and the ages of the victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">(Emphases in original.) The prosecutor also noted that he had told two other jurors that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201c[t]he only information I had about any relationship between [petitioner] and a possible student came from Mrs. Carpenter. That information was that [petitioner\u2019s ex-wife] had voiced her suspicions that her husband had done this; however, I informed them that I had been unable to find any information to support [petitioner\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s] suspicion. In so far as I was able to determine, it was an unconfirmed suspicion and I did not make any statement that it was more than a suspicion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Meanwhile, petitioner was reindicted on three counts of first-degree sexual abuse. At the second trial, petitioner called several character witnesses to testify as to his sexual propriety. One witness, Millette, testified that petitioner had an \u201cappropriate\u201d sexual character. On cross-examination, the prosecutor impeached her testimony using the information that he had received from Carpenter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Have you ever heard anything about the defendant having a secret correspondence with a 14-year-old girl?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201c[WITNESS]: Never.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever know that the defendant came home with hickeys on his stomach and at unusual times of night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201c[WITNESS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever know that he would often be out away from his wife until 3:00, 4[:00] in the morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201c[PETITIONER\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Objection. He\u2019s making a statement of fact when there\u2019s no evidence to support it. He can ask whether\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know what he can ask. If you have a basis for asking them, fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I have a basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Then go ahead and ask them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever know that he was out until 3:00,4[:00] in the morning and would come up at that period of time without much explanation as to where he\u2019d been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201c[WITNESS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And do you know that he \u2014 prior to their divorce that he was in an adulterous relationship with another woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201c[WITNESS]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Another witness, Chubb, testified that petitioner had an \u201cappropriate\u201d and \u201cupstanding\u201d sexual character. On cross-examination, a similar exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Are you aware that while he was married, he\u2019d often come home at 3:00 or 4[:00] in the morning without an explanation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201c[WITNESS]: No. I wouldn\u2019t be aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Are you aware that he was suspected of having a relationship with a little girl writing letters secretly to a post office box that his wife did not have access to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">\u201c[PETITIONER\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: I\u2019m going to object to the past tense. He was suspected. He hasn\u2019t identified whether [these are] * * * Carpenter\u2019s suspicions or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-15\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Are you aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-16\">\u201c [WITNESS]: I \u2014 I just know what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Ma\u2019am, you\u2019re either aware or you\u2019re not aware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-18\">\u201c[WITNESS]: Oh, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-19\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Are you aware that he would return home with hickeys on his stomach unexplained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-20\">\u201c[WITNESS]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Are you aware that prior to the divorce he was in an adulterous relationship with another woman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201c[WITNESS]: No, I\u2019m not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">A nonunanimous jury ultimately found petitioner guilty of one count of first-degree sexual abuse. He was found not guilty on the other two counts. Following his conviction, petitioner filed a direct appeal, which was unsuccessful. <em>State v. Holbrook, </em>196 Or App 353, 103 P3d 1211 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 681 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Ultimately, the Bar brought an action against the prosecutor, alleging that the prosecutor\u2019s questions to Millette and Chubb on cross-examination violated Code of Professional Responsibility Disciplinary Rule (DR) 7-106(C)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bar trial panel found that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were improper under a court-made corollary to OEC 405(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the prosecutor \u201cdid not have a good faith belief that [petitioner] had actually engaged in the conduct in question.\u201d <em>In re Tichenor, </em>340 Or 108, 111-12, 129 P3d 690 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Bar trial panel then concluded that, on that basis, the prosecutor had violated DR 7-106(C)(l). <em>Tichenor, </em>340 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>at 112. The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that \u201c[t]he two rules address different concerns. Proof of a violation of the corollary to OEC 405(1) does not give rise to a violation of DR 7-106(0(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. The court did not consider whether the questions were inadmissible under the corollary to OEC 405(1) \u2014 that is, whether the prosecutor lacked a reasonable basis to believe that the conduct had actually occurred \u2014 concluding that \u201c[t]he Bar alleged only that the [prosecutor] violated DR 7-106(0(1), and it is sufficient in this case to hold only that the evidence failed to establish a violation of that disciplinary rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Petitioner filed this petition for post-conviction relief, alleging, among other things, that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate in failing to \u201cprevent the state from introducing improper character impeachment.\u201d Petitioner argued that the prosecutor\u2019s questions on cross-examination were improper under the corollary to OEC 405(1) because the prosecutor lacked a reasonable basis to believe that the conduct alleged in his questioning on cross-examination had actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In support of his post-conviction claim that trial counsel was inadequate, petitioner sought to introduce the testimony of trial counsel, given as part of the above-mentioned Bar proceeding. At that proceeding, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel testified that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the prosecutor\u2019s questions on cross-examination. Trial counsel explained that, although he knew of the rumors prior to the second trial, he did not believe that the prosecutor would refer to them because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201cin [the prosecutor\u2019s] response [to the Bar], he had adamantly denied \u2014 he admitted that Ms. Carpenter had made these statements that she attributed to [petitioner\u2019s ex-wife] and that he had tried to investigate them and was unable to corroborate any of them. And [the prosecutor] emphatically stated that [he had] no reason to believe that any of this is beyond rumor. It has no evidentiary value, there\u2019s no need to investigate it further. [He] told the jurors because [he] had no reason to believe it to be true, in essence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Further, he testified that he did not conduct research on the law concerning cross-examination about specific instances of conduct until after the second trial (in connection with a motion for new trial). Trial counsel also testified at length regarding the manner and extent to which he objected to the prosecutor\u2019s questions on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The post-conviction court excluded trial counsel\u2019s testimony on the ground that it was irrelevant because the Supreme Court had reversed the decision of the Bar trial panel. Petitioner now appeals, arguing that \u201csworn testimony from * * * trial counsel regarding his knowledge of certain events and why he did or did not take certain actions is highly relevant to this proceeding.\u201d The state responds that the post-conviction court did not err in concluding that the testimony was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We agree with petitioner. Under OEC 401, relevant evidence is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">As noted, petitioner alleged below that trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate for failing to adequately prepare and object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions during cross-examination. Consequently, trial counsel\u2019s testimony is relevant to show his knowledge of events and frame of mind prior to the second trial and during the questioning. In that context, it is clearly relevant to whether trial counsel\u2019s representation of petitioner was constitutionally inadequate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Moreover, the testimony is not made irrelevant by the fact that the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Bar trial panel. As noted, in doing so, the Supreme Court did not decide the underlying <em>evidentiary issue </em>\u2014 whether the prosecutor had a reasonable basis to believe that the conduct that he referenced during cross-examination had actually occurred. It held only that the Bar had presented insufficient evidence to show that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning on cross-examination violated a disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>rule. Accordingly, the opinion has no bearing on whether the questions were inadmissible under the rules of evidence and whether, if so, trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate in his preparation and response to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Nevertheless, we must still consider whether that error was harmless. \u201cEvidentiary error is not reversible \u2018unless a substantial right of the party is affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Petersen v. Palmateer, </em>172 Or App 537, 545, 19 P3d 364, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 326 (2001) (quoting OEC 103(1)). \u201cTrial error substantially affects the rights of a party if the outcome of the case either would or may have been different had the error not occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, we conclude that this standard was satisfied. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new post-conviction trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> Carpenter is the sister of petitioner\u2019s ex-wife, and she was a witness for the state at both trials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> That rule provided that, \u201c[i]n appearing in the lawyer\u2019s professional capacity before a tribunal,\u201d a lawyer may not \u201c[s]tate or allude to any matter that the lawyer has no reasonable basis to believe is relevant to the case or that will not be supported by admissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct became effective January 1, 2005.
