Illinois denied the jurisdiction of this court, and. the allegations of the bill, and alleged that- if the conditions complained of \u25a0 at St. Louis existed they resulted from discharge of sewage into the Mississippi by cities of Missouri and from other causes for which Illinois was not responsible.

Lake Michigan is the natural basin for the sewage of Chicago. The expert evidence in this case shows that more polluting and infectious material is now contained in the water than prior to the opening of the canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-4\">According to the science of bacteriology, it is practically impossible to discover in a contaminated water the disease producing organisms, so small are the organisms and so delicate the test to be made. It has, however, been observed, that where large quantities of <em>bacilli coli communis </em>have been found, it is a conclusive indication that the water is sewage polluted and, therefore, infected with disease producing organisms. The number of bacteria is important if the source of the polluting ' matter is known. However, bacteriologists when applying the science to the sanitary observations of water, disregard largely the number of bacteria and depend mostly upon the character of the pathogenic organisms found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-5\">Typhoid bacilli, the most dangerous perhaps of any of the water-borne diseases, has never been discovered in the waters of a running stream, save as to two or three reported instances, and from the present conditions of the science, their discovery is not a practical proposition. So it may be said that from the standpoint of bacteriology and chemistry as applied to sanitary observations, there is no direct means of proving the absolute presence of pathogenic bacteria in water. A water supply may be chemically without fault and yet contain many living disease producing organisms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-6\">The effect of the sewage of Chicago upon the waters of the Mississippi River at the mouth of the Illinois has been such as if a large and populous city had been established on January 17, 1900, upon the banks of the Mississippi River discharging its sewage into the waters of that river. The chemical analysis discloses that the water in the Illinois River at Grafton contains more infectious material, and material liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>contain infection, than it did prior to the opening of the drainage canal. It also discloses that the waters of the Mississippi River above Grafton and the Missouri River are freer from contaminating and infectious matter than the waters of the Illinois. This, of course, is but a natural condition. The sewage of. two millions of people could not have the effect of improving conditions at any point on the Illinois River.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">As soon as the canal was opened the death rate from typhoid, in St. Louis started upward and has continued on the increase ever since. Typhoid mortality per 100,000 population in St. Louis for the years 1900, 1901, 1902 and 1903 increased 77.7 per cent over the typhoid mortality per 100,000 population in 1896, 1897, 1898 and 1899. This enormous increase occurred with no change in the manner of treating the water. The increase has been gradual, both in winter and summer \u25a0seasons, with no relaxation in the least except that the percentage of increase has been greater in the winter seasons than during the summer months. All parts .of the city where the public water supply has been used have alike suffered. No local epidemic has occurred, in fact, nothing has been observed, after a very searching investigation, that can in any way be charged with the cause of the increase save the dis- ' charge of the sewage of Chicago into the canal in question and hastening its flow to St. Louis by means of the Illinois River.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">Tire evidence discloses the germs of tetanus (lock jaw) and anthrax to have been discovered in the waters of the Illinois River since the opening of the. canal at Chicago-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">The enormous increase in deaths and cases of typhoid in. St. Louis caused by the discharge of.sewage from the city of Chicago into the Mississippi has been a source of financial loss to complainant. It has been truthfully said that \u201cThe average city of 100,000 population wastes perhaps half a million dollars, per year on the luxury of having it.\u201d Not only is it a long, tedious and grave illness, often leaving life-long disabilities in its wake, but it is also one of the most expensive of ailments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">Counting each death in the city of St. Louis caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>sewage from Chicago as having a value of $5,000, the loss to complainant is no small matter. While if we take into consideration the cost and expense of treating and nursing those cases wherein a recovery is had, together with the loss of labor while ill, the loss to the community reaches a total of many hundred thousand dollars per annum. This is the financial loss. The sorrows of death, pains of sickness and mental distress cannot, from the standpoint of humanity, be measured in dollars and cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">The population residing upon the natural watershed of the Illinois River brands it as more heavily infected than that of either the Mississippi or the Missouri. Physical and atmos-pherical conditions also must not be overlooked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">The population upon the watershed of the Mississippi River has already burdened it with an immense sewage disposal which burden will become greater as population increases. Much trouble will soon arise in this connection, making it impossible to secure suitable water without very expensive' treatment and improvement plapts. The discharge of the sewage from Chicago into the drainage basin of the Mississippi has not only hastened that condition, but if not restrained, will compel St. Louis to spend many million dollars in the construction of a filter plant in order to force its typhoid mortality back to conditions similar to 1896, 1897, 1898 and 1899. The danger and damage to complainant, the menace to its welfare, the loss of its reputation as a city of comparatively low typhoid mortality and the impediment to its financial and industrial growth., caused by the injury sustained and the constantly increasing embarrassing conditions manifestly convict defendants of the injuries complained of, and unquestionably' warrant the decree prayed for in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">Much might be said of what may be expected in the future, as shown by the evidence in the case, if present conditions are permitted to become permanent. Ere long we may depend on Chicago having a population of more than 5,000,000. That city wifi then, so to speak, be brought nearer to St. Louis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>in su far as its contaminating effect upon the water supply is concerned. The volume of the water passing through the canal will be necessarily increased, thus hastening the flow down the river. It is not necessary, however, to look to future developments for grounds of relief, the existing conditions are amply sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">The expert testimony of eminent scientists, chemists and bacteriologists shows that the principal water-borne diseases may be designated as cholera, typhoid, dysentery, anthrax and tetanus, anti the result produced by <em>bacilli coli com-munis </em>when injected under the skin of a human being, or when lodged in the appendix producing appendicitis. Typhoid fever or <em>bacilli typhosis </em>is a common water-borne disease in this country. It is caused by crude sewage being discharged into the water supply. This fact is demonstrated by the. effect of the establishment of filtration plants for the purpose of treating the water supplied for the cities of Hamburg, Germany; London, England, and Berlin, Germany, and a number of. large cities in this, country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">That typhoid, cholera, dysentery, anthrax and tetanus are water-borne diseases was conceded by all witnesses. In fact sanitary science has come to realize? with absolute assurance that the diseases above mentioned \u00e1s a general thing are caused by inferior water, or water which has been subjected to sewage' pollution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">While it is practicality impossible to discover or detect the physical presence of bacilli in running water, save or except as to <em>bacilli coli communis, </em>which are found in abundance in all streams in which sewage is emptied, all persons having knowledge of sanitary science, have settled beyond question that the diseases above mentioned are as a general proposition more readily communicated by \u25a0 means of inferior water supplied than in any other way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-8\">In th\u00e9 \u2019 examinations of the water of the Illinois River bacillus of tetanus and of anthrax was discovered in the water of that river. This in connection with <em>bacilli coli communis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>which is very prevalent in the water of the Illinois, as shown by all the testimony in the case, constitutes practically the total results of the. discoveries of the pathogenic bacillus in the waters of the rivers in question during this entire investigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-5\">\u25a0 A riparian population has the right to the use of a stream for drinking and other domestic uses in its natural state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-6\">Where discharges of sewage render the water of a stream impure or infectious, the injured have a right to ask and obtain relief through the power of the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-7\">Although those residing upon the stream have the right to cast their waste into the stream so long as it does not substantially interfere with the convenience, health .and comfort or the business interests of those residing on the river below, yet, such right does not extend to those residing upon another watershed so as to permit such discharges or deposits by artificial means into the stream draining a different watershed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-8\">When discharges have such effect as to render the conditions dangerous and unsanitary, the right to maintain such nuisance cannot become permanent by prescription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">The fact that others contribute to the injury constitutes no excuse of justification for the one charged to continue in the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-10\">The fact that riparian owners are allowed to discharge their waste and refuse into a stream so long as it does not create a substantial injury to those lower down, is merely a privilege even to the law of convenience and public policy.

In this way certain diseases are communicated from one individual to another.

Defendants have no right to change or alter the velocity of the stream or the volume of water passing down it. By the increased volume of water discharged into the Illinois River not only is the height of the water increased, but also the velocity likervise becomes much greater, the particular damage resulting to complainant in this respect being that inasmuch as the velocity of the current and the volume of water is increased, th\u00e9 longevity of disease-producing organisms is greatly advanced and the rapidity with which they pass from Chicago to St. Louis is largely accelerated. As shown by all of the evidence in the case, this constitutes a material and substantial, in fact, a great damage and injury to complainant. There is no contrariety of opinion that by the increase in the volume of water the life of the disease-producing organisms is greatly increased, and likewise, by the increase of the current, the distance traveled by pathegenic.bacteria within their lifetime is largely extended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">The evidence slipws that all the typhoid epidemics of consequence have been produced by infectious water.

Covington, Kentucky, and New Albany, Indiana, suffer severely from the disease. .At these points the water is pumped into large reservoirs, where it is confined for more than 30 days, during which time it retains sufficient germs of the disease that when distributed to the consumers, typhoid conditions result. Chicago, one of the greatest typhoid-ridden cities in the.United States, takes its water supply from Lake Michigan, heretofore looked upon as an acceptable source for pure water.

That river empties into the Illinois River, and the latter empties into the Mississippi at a point about forty-three miles above the city of St. Louis. It was alleged in the bill that the result of the threatened discharge would be to send fifteen hundred tons of poisonous filth daily into the Mississippi, to deposit great quantities of the same upon the part of the bed of the last-named river belonging to the plaintiff, and so to poison the water of that river, upon which various of the plaintiff\u2019s cities, towns and inhabitants depended, as to' make it unfit for .drinking, agricultural, or manufacturing, purposes. It was alleged that the defendant Sanitary District was acting in pursuance of a statute of the State of Illinois and as an agency of that State. The case is stated at .length in 180 U. S. 208, where a demurrrer to the bill -was overruled. A supplemental bill alleges that since the filing of the original bill the drainage canal has been opened and .put into operation and has produced and is producing all the evils which were apprehended when the injunction first was asked. The answers deny the plaintiff\u2019s case, allege that the new plan sends the water of the Illinois River into the Mississippi much purer than it was before, that many .towns and cities of the plaintiff along the Missouri and Mississippi discharge their sewage into those rivers, and that if there is any trouble the plaintiff must look nearer home for the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The decision upon the demurrer discussed mainly the jurisdiction of the court, and, as leave to answer was given when the demurrer was overruled, naturally there was no very precise consideration of the principles of law to be applied if the plaintiff should prove its case. That was left to the future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>with the general intimation that the nuisance must be made out upon determinate and' satisfactory evidence, that it must not be doubtful and that the danger must be shown to be real and immediate. The nuisance set forth in the bill was one which would be of international importance \u2014 a visible change of a great river from a pure -stream into a polluted and poisoned ditch. The only question presented was whether as between the States of the Unioh this court was eompet\u00e9nt to deal with a situation which, if it arose between independent sovereign-ties, might lead to war. Whatever differences of opinion there might be upon matters of detail, the jurisdiction and authority of this court to deal with such a case as that is not open to doubt. But the evidence now is in, the actual facts have required for their establishment the most ingenious experiments, and for their interpretation the- most subtle speculations, of modern science, and therefore it becomes necessary at the present stage to consider somewhat more nicely than heretofore how the evidence is to be approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The first question to be answered was put in the well known case of the Wheeling bridge. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., </em>13 How. 518. In that case, also, there was a bill brought by a State to restrain a public- nuisance, the erection of a bridge alleged to obstruct navigation, and a supplemental bill to abate it after it was erected. The question was put most explicitly by the dissenting judges but it was accepted by all as fundamental. The Chief Justice observed that if the bridge was a nuisance it was an offence against the sovereignty whose laws had been violated, and he asked what sovereignty that was. 13 How. 581; Daniel, J., 13 How. 599. See also <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>185 U. S. 125. It could not be Virginia, because that State had purported to authorize it by statute.' The Chief Justice found no prohibition by the United States. 13 How. 580.' No third source of law was suggested by any one. The majority accepted the Chief Justice\u2019s postulate, and found an answer in what Congress had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It hardly was disputed that Congress could deal with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>matter under its power to regulate commerce. The majority observed that although Congress had not declared in terms that a State should not obstruct the navigation of the Ohio, by bridges, yet it had regulated navigation upon that river in various ways and had sanctioned the compact between Virginia and Kentucky when Kentucky was let into the Union. By that compact the use and navigation of the Ohio, so far as the territory of either State lay thereon, was to be free and common to the citizens of the United States. The compact, by the sanction of Congress, had become a law of the Union. A state law which violated it was unconstitutional. Obstructing the navigation of the river was said to violate it, and it was added that more was not necessary to give a civil remedy for an injury done by the obstruction. 13 How. 565, 566. At a later stage of the case, after Congress had authorized the bridge, it was .stated again in so many words that the ground of the former decision was that <em>\u201c </em>the act of the Legislature of Virginia afforded no authority or justification. It w\u00e1s in conflict with the acts of Congress, which were the paramount law.\u201d 18 How. 421, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In the case at bar, whether Congress could act or not, there is no suggestion that it has forbidden the action of Illinois. The only ground on which that State\u2019s conduct can be called in question is one which must be implied from the words of the Constitution. The Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States to controversies between two or more States and- between a State and citizens of another State, and gives this court original jurisdiction in cases in which a State shall be a party. Therefore, if one State raises a controversy with another, this court must determine whether there is any principle of law and, if any, what, on which the plaintiff can recover. But the fact that this court miist decide does not mean, of course, that it takes the place of a legislature. Some principles it must have power to declare. For instance, when a dispute arises about boundaries, this court must determine the line, and in doing so must be governed by rules explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>or implicitly recognized. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. 657, 737. It must follow and apply those rules, even if legislation of one or both of the States seems to stand in the way. But the words of the Constitution would be a narrow ground upon which to construct and apply to the relations between States the same system of municipal law in all its details which would be applied between individuals.' If we suppose a case which did not fall within the power of Congress to regulate, the result of a declaration of rights by this court would be the establishment of a rule which would be irrevocable -by any power except that of this court to reverse its own decision, an amendment of the Constitution, or possibly an agreement between the States sanctioned by the legislature of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The difficulties in the way of establishing such a system of law might not be insuperable, but they would be great and new. Take the question of prescription in a case like the present. The reasons on which prescription for a public nuisance is denied or may be granted to an individual as against th\u00e9 sovereign power to which he is subject have no application to an independent state. See 1 Oppenheim, International Law, 293, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243. It would be contradicting a fundamental principle of human nature to allow no effect to the lapse of time, however long, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>194 U. S. 451, 457, yet the fixing of a definite time usually belongs to. the legislature rather than the courts. The courts did fix a time in the rule against per-petuities, but the usual course, as in the instances of statutes of limitation, the duration of patents, the age of majority, etc., is to depend upon the lawmaking power.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">It is decided that a case such as is made by the bill may be a ground for relief. The purpose of ,the foregoing observations is not to lay a foundation for departing from that decision, but simply to illustrate the great and serious caution with which it is necessary to approach the question whether a case is proved. It may beImagined that a nuisance might be created by a State upon a navigable river like the Danube, which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>amount to a <em>casus belli </em>for a State lower down, unless removed. If such a nuisance were created by a State upon the Mississippi the controversy would be resolved by the more peaceful means of a suit in this court. But it does not follow that every mat.ter which would warrant a resort to equity by one citizen against another in the same jurisdiction equally would warrant an interference by this court with the action of a State. It hardly can be that we should be justified in declaring statutes ordaining such action void in every instance where the Circuit Court might intervene in a private suit, -upon no other ground than analogy to some selected system of municipal law, and the fact that we have jurisdiction over controversies between States.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The nearest analogy would be found in those cases in which an easement has been declared in favor of land in one State over land in another. But there the right is recognized on the assumption of a concurrence between the two States, the one, so to speak, offering the right, the other permitting it to be accepted. <em>Manville Co. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>138 Massachusetts, 89. But when the State itself is concerned and by its legislation expressly repudiates the right set up, an entirely different question is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Before this court ought, to intervene the case should be of serious magnitude, clearly and fully proved, and the principle to be applied should be one which.the court is prepared deliberately to maintain against all considerations on the other side. See <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>185 U. S. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">As to the principle to be laid down the caution necessary is manifest. It is a question of the first magnitude whether the destiny of the great rivers is to be the sewers of the cities along their banks or to be protected against everything which threatens their purity. To decide the whole matter at one blow by an irrevocable fiat would be at least premature. If we are to judge by what the plaintiff itself permits, the discharge, of sewage into the Mississippi by cities and towns is to be expected. We believe that the practice of discharging into the river is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>general along its banks, except where the levees of Louisiana have led to a different course. The argument for the plaintiff asserts it to be proper within certain limits. These are facts to be considered. Even in cases between individuals some consideration is given to the practical course of events. In the black country of England parties would not be expected to stand upon extreme rights. <em>St. Helen\u2019s Smelting Co. </em>v. <em>Tipping, </em>11 H. L. C. 642. See <em>Boston Ferrule Co. </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>159 Massachusetts, 147, 150. Whore, as here, the plaintiff has sovereign powers and deliberately permits discharges similar to those of which it complains, it not only offers a standard to which the defendant has the right to appeal, but, as some of those discharges are above the intake of St. Louis, it warrants the defendant in demanding the strictest proof that the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct does not produce the result, or at least so conduce to it that courts should not be curious to apportion the blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We have studied the plaintiff\u2019s statement of the facts in detail and have perused the evidence, but it is unnecessary for the purposes of decision to do more than give the general result in a very simple way. At the outset we cannot but be struck by the consideration that if this suit had been brought fifty years ago it almost necessarily would have failed. There is no pretence that there is a nuisance of the simple kind that was known to the older common law. There' is nothing which can be detected by the unassisted senses \u2014 no visible increase of filth, no new smell. On the contrary, it is proved that the great volume of pure water from Lake Michigan which is mixed with the sewage at the start has improved the Illinois River in these' respects to a noticeable extent. Formerly it was sluggish and ill smelling. Now it is a comparatively clear stream to which edible fish have returned. Its water is drunk by the fishermen, it is said, without evil results. The plaintiff\u2019s case depends upon an inference of the unseen. It draws the inference from two propositions. First, that typhoid fever has increased considerably since the change and that other exp\u00eda-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>nations have been disproved, and second, that the'bacillus of typhoid can and does survive the journey and reach the intake of St. Louis in the Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We assume the now prevailing scientific explanation of ty.phoid fever to be correct. But when we go beyond that assumption everything is involved in doubt. The data upon which an increase in the deaths from typhoid fever in St. Louis is alleged are disputed The elimination of other causes is denied. The experts differ as to the time and distance within which a stream would purify itself. No case of an epidemic caused by infection at so remote a source is brought forward, and the cases which are produced are controverted. The plaintiff obviously must be cautious upon this point, for if this suit should succeed many others would follow, and it- not improbably would find itself a defendant to a bill by one or more of the States lower down upon the Mississippi. The distance which the sewage has to travel (357 miles) is not open to debate, but the time of transit to be inferred from experiments with floats is estimated at varying from eight to eighteen and a half days, with forty-eight hours more from intake to distribution, and when corrected by observations of bacteria is greatly prolonged by the defendants. The experiments of the defendants\u2019 experts lead them to the opinion that a typhoid bacillus could not survive the journey, while those on the. other side maintain that it might live and keep its power for twenty-five days or more, and arrive at St. Louis. . Upon the question at issue, whether the new discharge from Chicago hurts St. Louis, there is a categorical contradiction between the experts on the two sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The Chicago drainage canal was opened on January 17, 1900. The deaths from typhoid fever in St. Louis, before and after that date, are stated somewhat differently in different places. We give them mainly from the plaintiff\u2019s brief: 1890, 140; 1891, 165; 1892, 441; 1893, 215; 1894, 171; 1895, 106; 1896, 106; 1897, 125; 1898, 95; 1899, 131; 1900, 154; 1901, 181; 1902, 216; 1903, 281. It is argued for the defendant that the num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>bers for the later years have been enlarged by carrying over cases which in earlier years would have been put into a miscellaneous column (intermittent, remittent, typho-malaria, etc., etc.), but we assume that the increase is real. Nevertheless, comparing the last four years with the earlier ones, it is obvious that the ground for a specific inference is very narrow, if we stopped at this point. The plaintiff argues that the increase must be due to Chicago, since there is nothing corresponding to it in the watersheds of the Missouri or Mississippi. On the other hand, the defendant points out that there has been no such enhanced rate of typhoid on the banks of the Illinois as would 'have been found if the opening of the drainage canal were the true cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Both sides agree that the detection of. the typhoid bacillus in the water is not to be expected. But the plaintiff relies upon proof that such bacilli are discharged into the Chicago sewage in considerable quantities; that the number of bacilli in the water of the Illinois is much increased, including the <em>bacillus coli communis, </em>which is admitted to be an index of contamination, and that the chemical analyses lead to the same inference. To prove that the typhoid bacillus could make the journey an experiment was tried with the <em>bacillus prodigiosus, </em>which seems to have been unknown, or nearly unknown, in these waters. After preliminary trials, in which these bacilli emptied into the Mississippi near the mouth of the Illinois were found near the St. Louis intake and in St. Louis in times varying from three days to a month, one hundred and seven barrels of the same, said to contain one thousand million bacilli to the cubic centimeter, were put into the drainage canal near the starting point on November 6, and on December 4 an example was found'at the .St. Louis intake tower. Four 'others were found on the three following days, two at the tower and two at the mouth of the Illinois. As this bacillus is asserted to have about the same length of life'in sunlight in living waters as the <em>bacillus typhosus, </em>although it is a little more hardy, the experiment is thought to prove one element of the plaintiff\u2019s case, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the very small number found in many samples of water is thought by the other side to indicate that practically no typhoid germs would get through.. It seems to be conceded that the purification of the Illinois by the large dilution from Lake Michigan (nine parts or more in ten) would increase the danger, as it now generally is believed that the bacteria of-decay, the saprophytes, which flourish in stagnant pools, destroy the pathogenic germs. Of course the addition of so much water to the Illinois also increases its speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u2022 On the other hand, the defendant\u2019s evidence shows a reduction in the chemical and bacterial accompaniments of; pollution in a given quantity of water,. which would be natural in view of the mixture of nine parts to one from Lake Michigan. It affirms that theTllinois is better or no worse at its mouth than it was before, and makes it at least uncertain how much of the present pollution is due to Chicago, and how much to sources further down, not complained of in the bill. It contends that if any bacilli should get through they would be spattered and enfeebled and would do no harm. The defendant also- sets against the experiment with the <em>bacillus prodigiosus </em>a no less striking experiment with typhoid germs suspended in the Illinois Riv\u00e9r in permeable sacs. -According to this the duration of the life of these germs has been much exaggerated, and in that water would not be more than three or four days. It is suggested, by way, of criticism, that the germs-may not have been of normal strength, that the conditions were less favorable than if they had floated down in a comparatively unchanging body of water, and that the germs may have escaped, but the experiment raises at least a serious doubt. Further, it hardly is denied that there is no parallelism in detail between .the increase and decrease of typhoid fever in Chicago and St. Louis. The defendants\u2019 experts maintain that the water of the Missouri is worse than that of the Illinois, while it contributes a much larger proportion to the intake. The evidence is very strong that it is necessary for St. Louis to take preventive measures, by filtration or otherwise, against the dangers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s own creation or from other sources than Illinois. What will protect against one will protect against another. \u25a0 The presence of causes of infection from the plaintiff\u2019s action makes the case weaker in principle as well as harder to prove than one in which all came from a single source.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Some stress was laid on the proposition that Chicago is not on the natural watershed of the Mississippi, because of a rise of a few feet between the Desplaines and the Chicago Rivers. We perceive no reason for a distinction on this ground. The natural features relied upon are of the smallest. And if under any circumstances they could affect the case, it is enough to say that Illinois brought Chicago into the Mississippi watershed in pursuance not only of its own statutes, but also of the acts of Congress of March 30, 1822, c. 14, 3 Stat. 659, and March 2, 1827, c. 51, 4 Stat. 234, the validity of which is not disputed. <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Duluth, </em>96 U. S. 379. Of course these acts do not grant the right to discharge sewage, but the case stands no differently in point of law from a suit because of the discharge from Peoria into the Illinois, or from any other or all the other , cities on the banks of that stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We might go more into detail, but we believe'that we have said enough to explain our point of view and our opinion of the evidence as it stands. What the future may develop of- course we cannot tell. But our conclusion upon the present evidence is that the case proved falls so far below the allegations of the bill that it is not brought within the principles heretofore established in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\n<em>Bill dismissed without prejudice.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
