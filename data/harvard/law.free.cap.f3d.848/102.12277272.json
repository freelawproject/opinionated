Vitaliano, <em>Judge, </em>dismissing his complaint alleging that his employer defendant Municipal Credit Union (\u201cMCU\u201d) denied him leave and terminated his employment in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (\u201cFMLA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq., </em>after Coutard sought leave to take care of his seriously ill grandfather who, <em>in loco parentis, </em>had raised him as a child. The district court granted MCU\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that, although the FMLA provides that an eligible employee may be entitled to take leave in order to care for a person -with whom he had an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship as a child, Cou-tard had informed MCU merely that he needed to take care of his grandfather without informing MCU of the <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship. On appeal, Coutard contends principally that the district court erred in ruling that his failure to mention the nature of the relationship was disposi-tive, given the undisputed facts that MCU did not inform its employees that an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship could entitle them to FMLA leave, did not inquire whether Coutard had such a relationship with his grandfather, and, when he requested FMLA leave, responded categorically that the FMLA did not entitle him to such leave to care for a grandparent. Cou-tard asks that we reverse the dismissal of his complaint and order that partial summary judgment on the issue of liability be granted in his favor. For the reasons that follow, we hold that because Coutard met the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave and requested that leave expressly to care for his seriously ill grandfather, MCU as an employer covered by the Act had an obligation to specify the additional information that it needed in order to determine whether he was entitled to such leave. We conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to MCU on the basis that Coutard had failed to provide the necessary information, given MCU\u2019s denial of Coutard\u2019s request without requesting additional information. In light of other facets of the record, we conclude that Coutard was not entitled to partial summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Coutard sought leave under the FMLA to care for his grandfather Jean Manesson Dumond. According to Coutard, Dumond had raised Coutard as his son from before the age of four, after Coutard\u2019s father died, until Coutard was approximately 14. In January 2013 Dumond \u2014 who had suffered a stroke in 2011 \u2014 lived with Coutard, was 82 years old, and suffered from a number of chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, prostate cancer, high cholesterol, and heart disease. On the evening of January 22, 2013, Dumond was taken to a hospital by ambulance; he was diagnosed with bronchitis, and was discharged on January 23. Coutard, believing that Dumond was seriously ill and should not be left unattended, determined to stay home and care for him until Coutard could secure the assistance of a home health aide, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sought FMLA leave to do so. MCU denied him leave, and when he remained at home to care for Dumond, MCU terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In this action alleging that MCU\u2019s actions interfered with and violated Cou-tard\u2019s right under the FMLA, both sides moved for summary judgment. Certain of the facts, and the applicability of certain basic legal principles, are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">It is undisputed that MCU, a financial institution, was an employer to which the FMLA applied throughout January 2013; that Coutard was employed by MCU from July 18, 2011, to February 4, 2013; and that in the 12 months preceding his January 23, 2013 request for FMLA leave, Coutard worked for MCU for more than 1250 hours and was within the FMLA\u2019s definition of employees who were \u201celigible,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(2)(A), to take leave in order to care for a person deemed a family member by the FMLA, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2612(a)(1). Such persons include a grandfather who stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to the employee when the employee was a child under the age of 18. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C), 2611(7), 2611(12)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In granting MCU\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court also found it undisputed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Coutard was raised by his maternal grandfather, Jean Manesson Dumond, after his biological father passed away before Coutard\u2019s fourth birthday. Du-mond acted in all respects as [Coutard\u2019s] father \u2014 feeding him, clothing him, paying for his education, taking him to school, providing emotional and social support. In fact, Dumond referred to Coutard as his son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Memorandum and Order dated April 9, 2015 (\u201cD.Ct. Ord.\u201d), at 1-2 &amp; n.1 (internal quotation marks and citations to Plaintiffs Rule 56 Statement of Material Undisputed Facts (\u201cCoutard\u2019s Rule 56.1 Statement\u201d) omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">In January 2013, when Coutard requested FMLA leave to care for Dumond, it is undisputed that <em>\u201cMCU informed Coutard that </em>he could not take FMLA leave to care for his grandfather, because <em>the statute does not apply to </em>grandparents.... \u201d (Defendant\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Facts in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cMCU\u2019s Rule 56.1 Statement\u201d) \u00b6 12 (emphases added).) The district court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">On January 23, 2013, following Du-mond\u2019s bronchitis episode, plaintiff took leave from MCU to care more intensively for him.... To provide th[e necessary] level of care for his grandfather, Coutard absented himself from work from January 23, 2013 to February 4, 2013. \u00b0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">Prompted by his grandfather\u2019s bout with bronchitis, <em>plaintiff requested to take FMLA leave from MCU, but it was denied on the ground that grandparents are not covered under the Act. </em>Critically, although defendant never informed Cou-tard that grandparents could be covered under the FMLA, depending on the circumstances, <em>Coutard admits that he never notified MCU, at the time he made the FMLA request or at any relevant point thereafter, that Dumond had raised him as if he were his father. </em>Specifically, <em>Coutard admits, he merely asked MCU whether he would be permitted to take leave for his grandfather and did not provide MCU with specific information about his personal circumstances or suggest that his grandfather might stand in loco parentis with him. </em>Following his inquiry, though MCU did not permit him to take FMLA leave, it did advise him to apply for a short-term leave of absence under a separate MCU personnel policy. Coutard then took no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>action, applying neither for the FMLA leave nor the short-term company leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">.... Because he was absent for more than two consecutive days without leave, on February 4, 2013, MCU notified him by letter that his employment was terminated due to job abandonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">D.Ct. Ord. at 3-4 (internal quotation marks \u2014 as well as citations to Coutard\u2019s Rule 56.1 Statement, MCU\u2019s Rule 56.1 Statement, Defendant\u2019s Counterstatement of Disputed Facts in Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cMCU\u2019s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement\u201d), and Plaintiffs Counterstatement of Facts in Response to Defendant\u2019s Rule 56 Statement of Material Facts \u2014 omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Coutard argued that he would have informed MCU about the <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship with his grandfather had he been asked or had he. known of those FMLA provisions. However, he stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACb\">[defendant ... never informed.me that grandfathers are in fact covered by the FMLA if an in loco parentis relationship exists. If defendant or [its benefits manager with whom Coutard spoke] had informed me about the FMLA\u2019s in loco parentis coverage or had requested information as to whether grandpa Du-mond had an in loco parentis relationship with me when I was a child, I would have gladly and promptly provided such information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">(Declaration of Frantz Coutard dated May 12, 2014, \u00b6 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In response, MCU took the position that it was. not obligated to inform employees affirmatively of the FMLA\u2019s coverage of <em>in loco parentis </em>relationships. <em>(See, e.g., </em>MCU Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Coutard\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cMCU\u2019s Opposing Mem.\u201d) at 1-2, 7-8.) MCU pointed out that United States Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) regulations promulgated under the FMLA allowed employers to post a DOL form provided in Appendix C to 29 C.F.R. Part 825 (\u201cAppendix C\u201d) in satisfaction of their duties to provide employees with \u201ca notice explaining the Act\u2019s provisions,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.300(a)(1); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 825.300(a)(4). Based on part of the DOL form provided in Appendix C \u2014 submitted to the district court by MCU in support of its motion for summary judgment <em>(see </em>Declaration of Douglas E. Motzenbecker dated May 12, 2014 (\u201cMotzenbecker Declaration\u201d), Exhibit J) \u2014 MCU argued that the employee has the burden, at the time he requests FMLA leave, to provide all of the facts needed to show his entitlement to that leave. <em>(See </em>MCU\u2019s Opposing Mem. at 2-3, 6-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The district court agreed with MCU\u2019s position. It stated that in order to prevail on his FMLA claim, Coutard was required to prove five elements, to wit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">(1) that he [wa]s an eligible employee; (2) that defendant constitute[d] an employer covered by the Act; (3) that he was entitled to leave; (4) that he gave notice to his employer of his intention to take leave; and (5) that his employer denied him benefits that he was entitled to under the Act,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">D.Ct. Ord. at 8, \u201cthe only one in material controversy [being] the fourth,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9. The court framed the dispositive issue as \u201cwhether Coutard sufficiently notified MCU of Dumond\u2019s <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship with him and that it was on that basis he sought FMLA leave,\u201d <em>id. </em>It quoted a regulation that requires an employee to \u201c \u2018provide sufficient information\u2019 \u201d to indicate that \u201c \u2018the FMLA <em>may </em>apply to the leave request,\u2019 \u201d and requires the \u201c \u2018employer\u2019 \u201d to seek \u201c \u2018any additional ... information\u2019 \u201d needed for it to determine \u201c \u2018whether the leave <em>is </em>FMLA-qualify-ing,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 11-12 (quoting 29 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00a7 825.303(b) (emphases ours)). But the court concluded that the employee\u2019s obligation is to provide the employer with all of the needed information \u201cat or before the time he requests leave.\u201d D.Ct. Ord. at 14. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(b), to seek leave for the unforeseeable illness of an immediate family member, such as a parent, an employee must \u201cprovide sufficient information for an employer to reasonably determine <em>whether the FMLA may </em>apply to the leave request.\u201d Further, <em>\u201c[w]hen an employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA.\" Id. \u201cThe employer will be expected to obtain any additional required information through informal means,\u201d </em>and \u201cthe employee has an obligation to respond to an employer\u2019s questions designed to determine whether an absence is <em>potentially </em>FMLA-qual-ifying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>... Similarly, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.300(b), an employer becomes obligated to notify the employee of his eligibility to take FMLA leave \u201c[w]hen an employee requests FMLA. leave, or when the employer acquires knowledge that an employee\u2019s leave <em>may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason.\u201d </em>The employer\u2019s notification requirements come into effect once \u201cthe employer has enough information to determine whether the leave <em>is </em>being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 825.300(d)(1), (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">In determining the adequacy of the notice given by the employee, [t]he critical question is whether the information imparted to the employer is sufficient to reasonably apprise it of the employee\u2019s request to take\u00a1 time off.... While an employer\u2019s duty to inquire may be predicated on statements made by the employee, the employer is not required to be clairvoyant.... An employer\u2019s duty to conduct further inquiry into a request for leave is triggered when an employee gives sufficient notice of a ... need for the requested leave....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">... <em>FMLA is not triggered unless </em>the employee can later show that <em>the employer should have reasonably understood, at the time of the request, that the expressed need for leave was covered by FMLA....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">Overall, an employee <em>will be found to have failed to sufficiently explain </em>his reasons for needed leave, and the burden of inquiry will not shift to the employer <em>if he does not, at or before the time he requests leave, explain that his grandparent had raised him and it was that relationship, </em>as opposed to the blood-grandfather relationship, <em>that brought his request under the FMLA umbrella.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">D.Ct. Ord. at 11-15 (footnote and other internal quotation marks omitted (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Because Coutard did not inform MCU of the <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship when he requested FMLA leave, the court granted MCU\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">On appeal, Coutard contends principally that he provided MCU with sufficient information to permit it to understand that his leave request was potentially within the scope of the FMLA, and that if he did not provide sufficient information it was only because MCU failed in its obligations (a) to provide him with information as to his right to seek such leave under the Act\u2019s <em>in loco parentis </em>provision, and (b) to request further information from him. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that MCU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>was required to make further inquiry of Coutard before denying his request for FMLA leave, and we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings. We reject MCU\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint can be upheld on other grounds, <em>see </em>Part II.C. below; and we reject Coutard\u2019s request that we order the grant of partial summary judgment on the issue of liability in his favor, <em>see </em>Part II.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">A. <em>The FMLA and the Regulations Implementing It</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The FMLA provides generally that a covered employer is required to grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period for personal or family needs indicated in the Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a). There are four principal facets to the scope of the Act: (1) the employers to which it applies, (2) the employees who are eligible for FMLA leave, (3) the personal or family relationship in question, and (4) the qualifying reasons for the requested leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">An FMLA-covered \u201cemployer\u201d includes \u201cany person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(4)(A)(i). With respect to a covered employer that has at least 50 employees within 75 miles of the employee\u2019s worksite, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2611(2)(B)(ii), the Act defines an \u201celigible employee,\u201d in pertinent part, as an employee who has been employed\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">(i) for at least 12 months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested under section 2612 of this title; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">(ii) for at least 1,250 hours of service with such employer during the previous 12-month period,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\"><em>id. </em>\u00a7 2611(2)(A); <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.110(a) (so defining \u201celigible employee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">In general, with respect to \u201cEntitlement to leave,\u201d the FMLA provides in part that (subject to the employer\u2019s right to request certification from a health care provider, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2613),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATj\"><em>an eligible employee </em>shall be <em>entitled </em>to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pASx\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">(C) <em>In order to care for </em>the spouse, or <em>a </em>son, daughter, or <em>parent, of the employee, if such </em>spouse, son, daughter, or <em>parent has a serious health condition,</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-12\"><em>id. </em>\u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C) (emphases added). The term \u201cparent\u201d is defined to include not only the employee\u2019s biological parent but also \u201can individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a son or daughter,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2611(7); \u201cson or daughter,\u201d to the extent pertinent here, is defined to include \u201ca child[,] of a person standing in loco parentis, who is ... under 18 years of age,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2611(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">The FMLA provides that covered employers must conspicuously \u201cpost ... a notice, to be prepared or approved by the [DOL], setting forth excerpts from, or summaries of, the pertinent provisions of th[e Act],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2619(a), and that it is \u201cunlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under th[e Act],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2615(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">With respect to interference claims under the FMLA, our Court has \u201cformally adopt[ed]\u201d the \u201cstandard regularly used by district courts of this Circuit\u201d \u2014 which was used by the district court in this case\u2014 that is, that to prevail on an interference claim,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>a plaintiff must establish: 1) that she is an eligible employee under the FMLA; 2) that the defendant is an employer as defined by the FMLA; 3) that she was entitled to take leave under the FMLA; 4) <em>that she gave notice to the defendant of her intention to take leave-, </em>and 5) that she was denied benefits to which she was entitled under the FMLA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHj\"><em>Graziadio v. Culinary Institute of America, </em>817 F.3d 415, 424 (2d Cir. 2016) <em>(\u201cGraziadio\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). We did not, however, have occasion to consider what constitutes notice that is sufficient. <em>See id. </em>at 425 (\u201cDefendants have not questioned the adequacy of Graziadio\u2019s notice.... \u201d). Although the adequacy of notice is usually a fact-specific question, the determinative issue on this appeal is whether the district court correctly interpreted the DOL regulations in determining what kind of notice Coutard was required to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The regulations in effect at the time Coutard requested FMLA leave from MCU, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. pt. 825 (2009), include instructions as to the proper timing and contents of the notice that an employee is required to give an employer in order to take such leave, and the notice that employers must provide to employees as to their rights under the Act. As pertinent here, the regulation governing the notice that an employee must give the employer as to his need for leave that was not foreseeable provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">(a) <em>Timing of notice. </em>When the approximate timing of the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide notice to the employer as soon as practicable....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">(b) <em>Content of notice. </em>An employee shall provide sufficient information for an employer to reasonably determine <em>whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request. </em>Depending on the situation, such information may include ... whether the employee or the employee\u2019s family member is under the continuing care of a health care provider ... or if the leave is for a family member that the condition renders the family member unable to perform daily activities.... <em>When an employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the </em>FMLA.... <em>The employer will be expected to obtain any additional required information </em>through informal means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 825.303(a) and (b) (emphases added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 825.302(c) (with respect to foreseeable needs, \u201cthe employer should inquire further of the employee if it is necessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is being sought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The regulation in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.300 prescribed the notice that must be given by a covered employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">(a) <em>General notice. </em>(1) <em>Every employer covered by the FMLA is required to post </em>and keep posted on its premises, <em>in conspicuous places </em>where employees are employed, <em>a notice explaining the Act\u2019s </em>provisions....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAFP\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">(3) <em>If an FMLA-covered employer has any eligible employees, it shall also provide this general notice to each employee </em>by including the notice in employee handbooks or other written guidance to employees concerning employee benefits or leave rights, if such written materials exist, or by distributing a copy of the general notice to each new employee upon hiring.

UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\u201d and includes sections headed \u201cBasic Leave Entitlement,\u201d \u201cEligibility Requirements,\u201d \u201cEmployee Responsibilities,\u201d and \u201cEmployer Responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Under \u201cBasic Leave Entitlement,\u201d the DOL Form states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid job-protected leave to eligible employees for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7r\">\u2022 to care for the employee\u2019s spouse, son or daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">29 C.F.R. pt. 825, App\u2019x C. As this \u201cBasic Leave Entitlement\u201d section of the DOL Form does not mention that the term \u201cparent\u201d includes a person who, when the employee was a child, served <em>in loco par-entis </em>to the employee, MCU argues that it was not required to inform employees of those provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">However, the DOL Form, after defining or describing, <em>inter alia, </em>eligibility requirements, protections, and serious health conditions, goes on to describe the notice responsibilities of employees and employers, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Employee Responsibilities</p>\n<blockquote id=\"pAXB\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">Employees must provide sufficient information for the employer to determine if the leave <em>may </em>qualify for FMLA protection ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">Employer Responsibilities</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-16\"><em>Covered employers must inform employees </em>requesting leave <em>whether they are eligible </em>under FMLA. <em>If they are, the notice must specify any additional information required....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">29 C.F.R. pt. 825, App\u2019x C (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">Thus, the \u201cResponsibilities\u201d sections of the DOL-prescribed notice and the related regulations establish that if an eligible employee provides sufficient information for the employer reasonably to determine that the requested leave \u201cmay\u201d qualify for FMLA protection, the employer \u201cmust\u201d specify whether, and what, additional information is required for a determination of whether the employee is entitled to such leave. <em>Id.; see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>An employer is not required to use the DOL Form; but if it does not, \u201cthe information provided\u201d by the employer must <em>\u201cindudei </em>], at a minimum, <em>all of the information contained in that [Appendix C] notice.\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.300(a)(4) (emphases added). Thus, whether or not the DOL Form is used, a covered employer \u201cmust\u201d 'inform employees both (a) that they need provide only sufficient information to show that the requested leave reasonably \u201cmay\u201d be FMLA-qualifying, and (b) that if an eligible employee provides such information and the employer needs additional information it is the employer\u2019s responsibility to seek such additional information. 29 C.F.R. pt. 825, App\u2019x C; <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.300(a)(4); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 825.303(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In light of these regulations, we conclude that the obligation of an employee to give notice of his need for FMLA leave is not the obligation, imposed by the district court on Coutard, to provide the employer with all of the necessary details to permit a definitive determination of the FMLA\u2019s applicability at or before the time of the request. Rather, in the absence of a request for additional information, an employee has provided sufficient notice to his employer if that notice indicates reasonably that the FMLA may apply. <em>See, e.g., Lichtenstein v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, </em>691 F.3d 294 (3d Cir. 2012) (interpreting the 2009 version of \u00a7 825.303).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In <em>Lichtenstein, </em>the district court had summarily dismissed an FMLA claim because the notice given by the employee had described a circumstance that \u201c \u2018might not\u2019 \u201d qualify for FMLA leave, <em>id. </em>at 304. The Third Circuit reversed the grant of summary judgment. In considering \u201cthe specificity of information employees must provide to adequately notify employers of unforeseeable FMLA leave,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 296, the court of appeals concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">the District Court answered the wrong question. The question is- not whether the information conveyed to the employer necessarily rules out non-FMLA scenarios. The question is whether the information allows an employer to <em>\u201creasonably </em>determine whether the FMLA <em>may </em>apply.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(b) (emphases added). Reasonableness does not require certainty, and \u201cmay\u201d does not mean \u201cmust,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">691 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">We note that a prior version of \u00a7 825.303 did not contain the above \u201cFMLA may apply\u201d language; it provided that an employee, in giving notice, \u201cneed not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is needed,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he employer will be expected to obtain any additional required information through informal means,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(b) (1995). But even that earlier regulation\u2019s less specific language has been interpreted as meaning that an employee need only provide the employer with sufficient information to understand that the circumstances indicate that the FMLA \u201cmay\u201d apply. <em>See, e.g., Rask v. Fresenius Medical Care North America, </em>509 F.3d 466, 471 (8th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[T]he employer\u2019s duties are triggered when the employee provides enough information to put the employer on notice that the employee <em>may </em>be in need of FMLA leave.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted (emphasis ours))), <em>cert. denied, </em>554 U.S. 919, 128 S.Ct. 2965, 171 L.Ed.2d 887 (2008); <em>Burnett v. LFW Inc., </em>472 F.3d 471, 479 (7th Cir. 2006) (\u201cThe employee\u2019s notice obligation is satisfied so long as he provides information sufficient to show that he <em>likely </em>has an FMLA-qualifying condition....

[Ejmployers ... are en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>titled to the sort of notice that will inform them ... that the FMLA <em>may </em>apply.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted (emphases in <em>Burnett))); Bachelder v.

Employees need only notify their employers that they will be absent under circumstances which indicate that the FMLA <em>might </em>apply.... In short, the employer is responsible, having been notified of the reason for an employee\u2019s absence, for being aware that the absence <em>may </em>qualify for FMLA protection.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We conclude that the district court erred in ruling that Coutard was required, at the time of his request, to provide MCU with all of the information it needed to determine with certainty that his requested leave was within the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">MCU asks us to reach the contrary conclusion, relying principally on <em>Sherrod v. Philadelphia Gas Works, </em>57 Fed.Appx. 68 (3d Cir. 2003), in which the Third Circuit upheld summary judgment dismissing an FMLA complaint because the plaintiffs request for leave in order to care for her grandmother had not specified \u201cthat her grandmother had raised her,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 72. The regulation applied in that case, however, was \u00a7 825.208(a)(1), which required the employee to \u201c \u2018explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the employer to determine that the leave <em>qualifies </em>under the Act,\u2019 \u201d 57 Fed.Appx. at 72 (quoting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.208(a)(1) (2002) (emphasis ours)). Section 825.208(a)(1) was withdrawn effective January 16, 2009; and although it was revised and renumbered 825.301, the revised version adds the caveat that the employee\u2019s notice must \u201csatisfy the notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 825.302 or \u00a7 825.303,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.301(b) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Section 825.303, the regulation relevant to Coutard, required him initially, as discussed above, only to provide sufficient information to indicate that the FMLA \u201cmay\u201d apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">B. <em>The Sufficiency of Coutard\u2019s Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbV\">There can be no serious question that an employee\u2019s request for leave to care for his seriously ill grandfather seeks leave that \u201cmay\u201d qualify for FMLA protection. Although MCU argues that it was not required to inquire as to whether Coutard had a \u201c[ujnique\u201d relationship with his grandfather (MCU brief on appeal at 27), a grandparent\u2019s raising of a child <em>in loco parentis </em>is hardly unique. The very reason that Congress in the FMLA defined \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cson or daughter\u201d to include, respectively, <em>\u201can individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee </em>when the employee\u201d was \u201cunder 18 years of age,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2611(7) &amp; 2611(12)(A) (emphasis added), and \u201ca child of a person standing in loco parentis,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(12), was to \u201creflect <em>the reality </em>that <em>many children </em>in the United States today <em>do not </em>live in traditional \u2018nuclear\u2019 families with their biological father and mother,\u201d and are increasingly raised by others including \u201ctheir grandparents,\u201d S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 22 (1993), <em>reprinted in </em>1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 24 (other internal quotation marks omitted (emphases ours)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Indeed, MCU, in support of its summary judgment motion, submitted a July 2010 DOL \u201cFact Sheet #28C\u201d \u2014 attached to the Motzenbecker Declaration as Exhibit K\u2014 titled \u201cFMLA leave to care for a parent with a serious health condition on the basis of an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship.\u201d That general-information document stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiF\">[i]n enacting the FMLA, Congress recognized the changing needs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>American family, including the growing need for wage earners to provide care both for their children and for their parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">This Fact Sheet provides guidance on an employee\u2019s entitlement to FMLA leave to care for an individual who stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to the employee when the employee was a child....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAeh\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Examples of <em>in loco parentis</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">Examples of situations in which FMLA leave to care for a parent may be based on an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA9yX\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\n<em>An employee may take leave to care for her grandmother with a serious health condition if the grandmother assumed responsibility for raising the employee after the death of her parents when the employee was a child.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">DOL Fact Sheet #28C at 1-2 (emphasis added). Both the express provisions in the FMLA for coverage with respect to <em>in loco parentis </em>relationships and the express example of a grandmother in the publication available to employers on the DOL website \u2014 submitted to the district court by MCU \u2014 made it reasonable for MCU to understand that Coutard\u2019s request for leave in order to take care of his seriously ill grandfather might come within the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">We conclude that the district court erred in ruling that Coutard\u2019s notice to MCU was deficient because he did not specify the <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship with his grandfather at or before the time he requested FMLA leave, and in ruling that MCU was entitled as a matter of law to deny Coutard FMLA leave without requesting additional information.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">C. <em>MCU\u2019s Alternative Grounds for Affir-mance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">MCU contends that we can affirm the judgment dismissing the complaint on alternative grounds, including Coutard\u2019s alleged failure to provide certification that Dumond had a serious health condition and his failure to mitigate damages. These contentions are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">In urging that the complaint was properly dismissed because Coutard failed to proffer medical proof of Dumond\u2019s health, MCU relies on the FMLA provision that \u201c[a]n employer may require that a request for leave under\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C) for a \u201cparentfs]\u201d serious health condition \u201cbe supported by a certification issued by the [relevant] health care provider,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2613(a). However, \u201c[u]nder the FMLA, an employee seeking leave need not submit a medical certification <em>unless and until one is specifically requested by her employer.\u201d Graziadio, </em>817 F.3d at 426 (emphasis in original). Although the record indicates that MCU may have requested evidence of Dumond\u2019s health in suggesting that Coutard apply for leave that would not be protected by the FMLA, it does not indicate that MCU made any request pursuant to the FMLA. Instead, \u201cMCU informed Coutard that ... the statute does not apply to grandparents .... \u201d (MCU\u2019s Rule 56.1 Statement \u00b6 12.) MCU not having requested information pursuant to the FMLA \u2014 and having wrongly indicated to Coutard that the FMLA cannot be applied to a grandfather \u2014 MCU is not entitled to defend this FMLA claim on the ground that Coutard did not provide information that the FMLA would have required if MCU had requested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">In urging that Coutard failed to mitigate damages, MCU relies principally on the fact that he did not accept MCU\u2019s conditional offer of reinstatement. MCU\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>letter communicating that offer, however\u2014 sent by its attorneys to Coutard\u2019s attorney after the commencement of the present lawsuit <em>(see </em>Motzenbecker Declaration \u00b6 5) \u2014 proposed a \u201cresolution of the case .... without an admission of fault or liability on the part of either party\u201d (see <em>id. </em>Exhibit D). Such an offer could not properly be the basis for affirmance of summary judgment, as \u201c[t]he evidence considered on summary judgment must generally be admissible evidence,\u201d <em>LaSalle Bank National Ass\u2019n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., </em>424 F.3d 195, 205 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>see </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) (\u201cdeclaration used to support or oppose a motion [for summary judgment] must ... set out facts that would be admissible in evidence\u201d), and offers of compromise are not admissible in evidence to \u201cdisprove the validity <em>or amount </em>of a disputed claim,\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 408(a) (emphasis added). MCU\u2019s offer is inadmissible for the purpose proffered here. The letter offered reinstatement in exchange for settlement of the pending lawsuit; it stated that it was being sent \u201c[p]ursuant to FED. EVID. R. 408\u201d; and it is proffered here with respect to the amount of damages Coutard could receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">MCU\u2019s other contentions in support of the grant of summary judgment in its favor have no greater merit and do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">D. Coutard\u2019s <em>Request for Partial Summary Judgment in His Favor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We also reject Coutard\u2019s contention that because MCU failed in its obligations (a) to provide him with notice of his right to seek FMLA leave under the Act\u2019s <em>in loco parentis </em>provision, and (b) to request further information from him upon his request for leave, he was entitled to partial summary judgment in his favor on the issue of liability. The fact that both sides have moved for summary judgment does not guarantee that there is no material issue of fact to be tried and that one side or the other is entitled to that relief. <em>See, e.g., Eastman Machine Co. v. United States, </em>841 F.2d 469, 473 (2d Cir. 1988). In considering such motions and determining whether there is a genuine issue of fact to be tried, \u201cthe court must evaluate each party\u2019s motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.\u201d <em>Schwabenbauer v. Board of Education, </em>667 F.2d 305, 314 (2d Cir. 1981); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) (the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion under consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Here, in addition to the unresolved issue of whether the state of Dumond\u2019s health met FMLA standards, MCU did not in fact concede the truth of Coutard\u2019s assertions that Dumond had raised him <em>in loco parentis. </em>Rather, it objected to the <em>in loco parentis </em>characterization as asserting a conclusion of law <em>(see </em>MCU\u2019s Rule 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 14) and denied knowledge or information as to the truth of the underlying factual assertions <em>(see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-24). Thus, although it was proper for the district court to accept Coutard\u2019s assertions as true when it was deciding the summary judgment motion of MCU, it could not properly accept them as true in deciding the motion by Coutard. A jury would not be compelled to accept such testimony by Coutard; his credibility is a matter for assessment by the factfinder; and his childhood relationship with Du-mond remains one of the issues for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">We have considered all of MCU\u2019s arguments in support of the judgment and all of Coutard\u2019s arguments in support of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>request for partial summary judgment in his favor, and have found in them no merit. The judgment dismissing the complaint is vacated; the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
