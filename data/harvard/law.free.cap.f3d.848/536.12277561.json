CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b584-19\">Respondent-Appellant Paul Chappius, Jr., Superintendent of the Elmira Correctional Facility, appeals from the April 21, 2016 Order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>York (Katherine Polk Failla, <em>Judge) </em>granting Petitioner-Appellee Brian Carmichael's petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Order granting the writ, stayed pending this appeal, would invalidate Carmichaers custody imposed pursuant to a December 10, 2007 judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (Robert H. Straus, <em>Justice), </em>following a jury trial and conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">After an unsuccessful direct appeal of his conviction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as a failed motion to vacate his conviction based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Carmichael sought a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in federal court on grounds (1) that the state trial court misapplied the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Batson v. </em>Kentucky,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) that Carmichael received ineffective assistance of counsel. On July 17, 2015, Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck filed a Report and Recommendation proposing that the District Court reject both of Carmichael\u2019s arguments and deny his petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court declined the recommendations of Magistrate Judge Peck and granted Carmichael\u2019s petition, holding that the New York State Appellate Division, First Department, had unreasonably applied <em>Batson </em>and its progeny when it affirmed the state trial court\u2019s finding that Carmichael failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case showing that the prosecution used its peremptory challenges in a. discriminatory manner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">We hold that the District Court incorrectly applied the standard for evaluating a state court\u2019s rulings set forth in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (the \u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We further hold that the Appellate Division\u2019s order affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of Carmichael\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge was not an unreasonable application of \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Accordingly, we VACATE the District Court\u2019s April 21, 2016 Order granting Carmichael the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>and REMAND the cause to the District Court for such further proceedings as may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>appropriate and consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">I. Jury Selection in Carmichael\u2019s Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">On September 17, 2007, jury selection began in Brian Carmichael\u2019s criminal trial before Justice Robert H. Straus of the Supreme Court of the State of New York.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court tasked the parties with selecting a twelve-person jury from three separate panels, each composed of twenty-six venirepersons. Both Carmichael and the People of the State of New York, represented by the New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cthe State\u201d), received twenty peremptory challenges for use during jury selection. The parties could use their peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors from the venire. Both parties also received six additional peremptory challenges, which they could use only to strike potential alternate jurors. This appeal concerns the State\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges during the process of jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">After questioning of the twenty-six venirepersons on the first panel concluded, the Court asked the parties if they wished to exercise any of their peremptory challenges against the first twelve potential jurors. The State exercised five peremptory challenges and counsel for Carmichael exercised three. Then, the Court asked the parties to consider the next twelve venire-persons. When the State struck four more potential jurors, defense counsel raised his first <em>Batson </em>challenge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">Defense counsel told the Court that he \u201cfe[lt] compelled to make a <em>Batson </em>challenge\u201d because \u201cwe [] had two African Americans in the jury pool and [the State] has challenged both of them.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the State used two of its peremptory challenges to strike Shackwanna Boiken and Charmaine Hamilton, both black females. The Court denied defense counsel\u2019s challenge finding that the removal of two black jurors \u201cby itself does not constitute [a] prima facie showing of a pattern of use of strike[s] in a discriminatory way.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Following the denial of defense counsel\u2019s first <em>Batson </em>challenge, the State declined to use any more strikes on venirepersons in the first panel. Defense counsel, however, struck all six of the remaining potential jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">The parties next considered the second panel of twenty-six potential jurors. The State and defense counsel combined to strike eleven of the first sixteen individuals in this group. Notably, neither party struck Bettina Boyd, a black woman.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During consideration of the next five veni-repersons, however, the State struck Dina Grant, another black female. This strike prompted defense counsel to raise his second <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Defense counsel stated, \u201c[although [the State] has allowed Ms. Bo[yd] to remain on the jury, the lone black juror selected so far ... I believe out of the four African American jurors we have considered on the panel[,] [the State] has challenged three of them.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court responded by noting that Ms. Boyd, a black female, remained on the jury, and that defense counsel struck another venireperson, Yalira Ve-larde, whom the Court believed to be a black female. A disagreement then ensued between defense counsel and the Court over whether Ms. Velarde was \u201cHispanic\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, the Court told defense counsel, \u201cI am not saying you are right and I am wrong or the opposite. I am only making a record as to race because it\u2019s sometimes necessary to do so when there\u2019s a <em>Batson </em>challenge.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ultimately, the Court denied defense counsel\u2019s challenge, holding again that \u201cthe statistical basis is not sufficient alone to raise a discriminatory use of a free peremptory challenge under New York law.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The parties resumed their consideration of the remaining venirepersons on panel two. Defense counsel used one peremptory challenge and the State used two. One of the two venirepersons struck by the State was Jessica Simmons, a black female. In response, defense counsel raised his third <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Defense counsel argued that, \u201cMs. Simmons is African American and it\u2019s now four out of five.... We\u2019ve had probably 140 people that we\u2019ve considered in two days, only five African Americans have come before us in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court calculated that four out of six black potential jurors had been struck, including Ms. Velarde. The Court also repeated its prior refrain that challenges based on statistical evidence, such as defense counsel\u2019s challenges, \u201care generally not sufficient to raise or create an inference or create a prima facie case of discriminatory use of p[ere]mptory challenges.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Defense counsel responded that he could not \u201csee any potential basis [for a <em>Batson </em>challenge] ... other than the numbers.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court denied defense counsel\u2019s third <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">After the State struck the last remaining venireperson in panel two, the parties considered the potential jurors in the third and final panel. At this point, the parties had selected nine jurors and were aiming to fill only three outstanding seats before choosing alternates. The State struck the first venireperson in the third panel, but the parties accepted the second and third individuals as jurors. Diana Duggins, a black female, was one of the two persons thus selected for the jury. The parties filled the final open seat with the sixth individual on the third panel. Ultimately, two black women \u2014 Ms. Boyd and Ms. Duggins \u2014 were seated on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">With the jury of twelve selected, the parties turned their attention to picking alternate jurors. Each side had six peremptory challenges to use during this part of the process. The State began by striking three potential alternates, two of whom were black. Consequently, defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>raised his fourth and final <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Defense Counsel explained his position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">It seems again that [the State] is exercising [its] challenges to exclude African Americans. I do note that as we proceeded with selection [the State] did not challenge Ms. Duggins who was the sixth in my view African American that we have considered ... but when we got to the alternates he challenged Ms. Sanders[,] a black female[,] and now he\u2019s also challenging Mr. Pratt who is a male black, so I see a clear pattern of challenging African Americans, your Honor. I make my <em>Batson </em>challenge on that basis. Four of the six we have considered have been challenged. We have been through three panels so approximately 210 have come into this courtroom. ... [W]e have considered in total eight African Americans and six of those have been challenged by [the State] in my view.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Court denied defense counsel\u2019s final <em>Batson </em>challenge. It reiterated that \u201cthe statistical analysis by itself does not provide for this court that level of challenge, doesn\u2019t create a prima facie case requiring us to go on to step two of the analysis so the challenge must be denied.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As a result, the Court did not require the State to articulate any nondiscriminatory reasons for its use of the challenged peremptory strikes. The parties then selected the final alternate juror and Carmichael\u2019s case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">On October 17, 2007, the jury convicted Carmichael on three counts of second degree criminal sale of a controlled substance. Two months later, Justice Straus sentenced Carmichael to three concurrent seventeen-year terms of imprisonment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">On September 30, 2009, Carmichael appealed his conviction to the New York State Appellate Division, First Department. One of the grounds for Carmichael\u2019s direct appeal is relevant here: his claim that the trial court erred in finding that he failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that the State used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. The crux of Carmichael\u2019s argument on direct appeal was that the trial court had misinterpreted the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>People v. Brown, </em>97 N.Y.2d 500, 743 N.Y.S.2d 374, 769 N.E.2d 1266 (2002), by concluding that statistical evidence of a discriminatory pattern in the use of peremptory strikes is never sufficient to set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgments of the state trial court, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-14\">[t]he [trial] court properly denied defendant\u2019s applications made pursuant to <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(476 U.S. 79 [106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986)]). Viewing jury selection as a whole, we conclude that defendant did not meet his burden at step one of the inquiry. Defendant did not produce \u201cevidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination ha[d] occurred\u201d in the exercise of peremptory challenges <em>(Johnson v. California, </em>545 U.S. 162, 170 [125 S.Ct. 2410, 162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>L.Ed.2d 129 (2005) ]). While numerical evidence may suffice, in this case it did not warrant an inference of discrimina-tion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">After the New York Court of Appeals denied Carmichael leave to appeal<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and after the Supreme Court of the United States denied Carmichael\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Carmichael filed a motion to vacate his judgment of conviction in the state trial court on grounds that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Justice Roger S. Hayes denied Carmichael\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Carmichael appealed Justice Hayes\u2019s order to the Appellate Division, First Department, which affirmed the denial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The New York Court of Appeals denied Carmichael leave to appeal.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Thereafter, Carmichael filed a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in the District' Court. He raised two claims: (1) the jury selection process violated his rights as set forth in <em>Batson </em>and its progeny, and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney lacked knowledge of the standard for establishing a <em>prima facie Batson </em>case under New York law. On April 21, 2016, the District Court declined the recommendations of the magistrate judge and granted Carmichael\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The District Court reviewed the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment affirming the state trial court\u2019s denial of Carmichael\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge because it was the last reasoned state-court decision to address Carmichael\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It then concluded that the Appellate Division had unreasonably applied <em>Batson </em>and its progeny when it affirmed the state trial court\u2019s finding that Carmichael did not make out a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the State used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> According to the District Court, evidence of the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges was so abundant \u2014 for example, the State \u201cstruck twice the number of black jurors than one would expect, and two-thirds to three-quarters of the black jurors under consideration\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>\u2014 that it had no choice but to conclude \u201cthat the Appellate Division [had] applied <em>Bat-son </em>and its progeny in an unreasonable manner.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Having determined that the Appellate Division erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>finding, the District Court did not reach Carmichael\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The State timely filed a notice of appeal as of right and the District Court granted the State\u2019s application for a stay pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting a petition for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of <em>habeas corpus.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 2254 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code, as amended by the AED-PA, prohibits federal courts from granting a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>on the basis of a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in a state court proceeding \u201cunless the adjudication [of the claim] resulted in a decision (1) that was \u2018contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u2019 or (2) that was \u2018based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In this case, we are concerned only with the first of the two enumerated bases for granting <em>habeas </em>relief.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The Supreme Court has instructed that section 2254(d)(l)\u2019s \u201ccontrary to\u201d and \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clauses have independent meaning.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d when \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of Supreme Court precedent, on the other hand, occurs when a state court \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The District Court here concluded that the Appellate Division had applied Supreme Court precedent to the facts of Carmichael\u2019s case in \u201can unreasonable manner.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">To merit federal <em>habeas </em>relief under the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of section 2254(d)(1), a petitioner \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In other words, a federal court may not issue a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>\u201csimply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application <em>must also be unreasonable.\u201d </em><footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In determining whether a particular state court application is \u201creasonable\u201d under the circumstances presented, \u201ca ha-beas court must be guided by the level of specificity of the relevant precedent\u2019s holding.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> When the applicable rule is \u201cmore general,\u201d state courts will have \u201cmore leeway ... in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Ultimately, this represents a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>state-court rulings, which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">II. The <em>Batson^ </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Supreme Court precedent relevant here is, of course, <em>Batson v. Kentucky. </em>In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court established \u201ca three-step burden-shifting framework for the evidentiary inquiry into whether a peremptory challenge is race-based.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In the first step, the objecting party must set forth a <em>prima facie </em>showing \u201cthat the circumstances give rise to an inference that a member of the venire was struck because of his or her race.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> If the objecting party makes the requisite showing, \u201cthe burden shifts to the [party striking the potential juror] to come forward with a neutral explanation\u201d for its peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Finally, if the party striking the juror tenders a \u201cneutral explanation,\u201d the trial court has \u201cthe duty to determine if the [objecting party] has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">An objecting party can establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination \u201cby offering a wide variety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives \u2018rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201ca \u2018pattern\u2019 of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In addition, \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during <em>voir dire </em>examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> As we have had occasion to note in the past, the Supreme Court has not \u201cprovided a more particularized view of what constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>showing of discrimination under Batson.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We have held, however, that statistical evidence alone may, in some circumstances, suffice to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination during jury selection.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Ultimately, the Supreme Court has expressed confidence in the ability of trial judges to be able to determine whether \u201cthe circumstances concerning the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges creates a prima facie case of discrimination against [ ] jurors [from a protected class].\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">III. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">The specific issue in this appeal concerns the first step of the <em>Batson </em>framework. In granting Carmichael the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>the District Court held that it was unreasonable for the Appellate Division to conclude that Carmicha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>el failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of discrimination given the high percentage of black members of the venire removed during jury selection.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> On appeal, the State contends that the District Court failed to give the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling the level of deference required by the AEDPA. We agree. While statistical evidence alone may, in some circumstances, suffice to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination during jury selection,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> the Appellate Division did not apply <em>Batson </em>and its progeny in an unreasonable manner when it concluded that, in the circumstances presented, the statistical evidence did not warrant an inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Carmichael made four separate <em>Batson </em>applications during the jury selection process. He based each of his applications on numerical evidence alone, <em>ie., </em>the number of peremptory challenges used against black members of the venire compared to the total population of blacks in the venire. The trial court denied each application on the basis that Carmichael had failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of racial discrimination. In denying Carmichael\u2019s fourth and final challenge, the state trial court declared that \u201cthe statistical analysis by itself does not ... create a prima facie case requiring us to go on to step two....\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Carmichael\u2019s argument on appeal focuses almost entirely on his contention that the state trial court incorrectly held him to a heightened evidentiary standard when it concluded \u201cthe statistical basis is not sufficient alone to raise a discriminatory use of a free peremptory challenge under New York law.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Indeed, the District Court concluded that the trial court acted \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established Supreme Court precedent in denying Carmichael\u2019s <em>Batson </em>applications because the trial court applied New York law in a way that increased Carmichael\u2019s evidentiary burden at step one of the <em>Batson </em>framework.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> However, because the Appellate Division considered Carmichael\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge on the merits and affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial, the District Court rightly based its consideration of Carmichael\u2019s <em>habeas </em>petition on whether the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling on the <em>Batson </em>challenges was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> For that reason, our review concerns only the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Appellate Division applied <em>Batson </em>unreasonably when it affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">On direct appeal of Carmichael\u2019s conviction, the Appellate Division held that Carmichael \u201cdid not meet his burden at step one of the [Batson] inquiry\u201d because he \u201cdid not produce evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination ha[d] occurred in the exercise of peremptory challenges.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> It noted that \u201cnumerical evidence <em>may </em>suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>fice,\u201d but concluded that <em>\u201cin this case </em>it did not warrant an inference of discrimination.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The District Court correctly gave the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling the \u201cbenefit of the doubt\u201d by concluding that it did not apply law \u201ccontrary to\u201d Supreme Court precedent when, in contrast to the state trial court, the Appellate Division treated numerical evidence as capable of satisfying step one of the <em>Batson </em>framework.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the District Court held that the Appellate Division \u201capplied <em>Batson </em>and its progeny in an unreasonable manner\u201d because it concluded that the numerical evidence presented by Carmichael did not warrant an inference of discrimination.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Out of approximately 210 individuals considered for the jury only eight were black.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> And of those eight, the State removed six from the venire with peremptory challenges. As the District Court noted, the eight black potential jurors accounted for 14 to 16 percent of the total number of individuals questioned during jury selection who were not removed for cause. Yet, the State used six of its twenty-one peremptory challenges on black venireper-sons, or close to 29 percent of its available strikes, to remove 75 percent of them from the potential jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The first step in the <em>Batson </em>framework, which the Appellate Division was charged with applying in Carmichael\u2019s case, is a paradigmatic \u201cgeneral standard.\u201d <footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Courts must rely on their own judgment and experience to determine whether the objecting party has established a <em>prima facie </em>showing \u201cthat the circumstances give rise to an inference that a member of the venire was struck because of his or her race.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> For that reason, we must afford the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling \u201cmore leeway\u201d on <em>habeas </em>review.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">As we have previously explained, \u201c[c]ases involving successful challenges to exclusion rates have typically included patterns in which members of the racial group are completely or almost completely excluded from participating on the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Whether the 75 percent exclusion rate at issue here meets that high threshold is a matter on which \u201cfairminded jurists could disagree.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> For that reason alone, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling was an \u201cunreasonable\u201d application of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny warrants vacatur.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">That said, it bears noting that there was other evidence in the record supporting the Appellate Division\u2019s reasonable conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s 75-percent exclusion rate did not warrant an inference of discrimination. For example, during his third attempt at a <em>Batson </em>challenge, Carmichael\u2019s counsel admitted to the trial court that he did not \u201csee any potential basis ... other than the numbers\u201d for his <em>Batson </em>challenge.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> In addition, although defendants of any race may assert <em>Batson </em>challenges,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> it is not entirely irrelevant that Carmichael himself was not black. Nor was there any indication in the record at the time of the <em>Batson </em>challenges that racial sympathy or antipathy would play any role in his trial. Finally, two black venirepersons ultimately were seated on Carmichael\u2019s jury, which (as the District Court noted) represented 17 percent of all sworn jurors \u2014 one to three percentage points higher than the percentage of blacks in the venire.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Although the District Court explained why <em>it </em>did not find these countervailing factors persuasive, a rational person considering all of the \u201crelevant circumstances\u201d presented could reasonably conclude that there was insufficient evidence of discrimination.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Had we been presiding over jury selection in Carmichael\u2019s case in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>first instance, we might very well have concluded that Carmichael made out a pri-ma <em>facie </em>showing of race discrimination.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> However, as we have had occasion to observe before, the fact that numerical evidence may have <em>permitted </em>an inference of discrimination does not establish that a contrary conclusion <em>must be </em>an unreasonable application of <em>Batson </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The AEDPA establishes a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings:\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> a state court\u2019s error must be \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement\u201d if it is to warrant reversal on a <em>habeas </em>petition in federal court.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Deference to state courts is especially important when reviewing <em>habeas </em>claims predicated on a violation of the first step of the <em>Batson </em>framework because <em>Batson </em>and its progeny provide state courts with limited guidance on what constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient evidence of discrimination was simply not unreasonable under the circumstances presented. The District Court erroneously applied too stringent a standard on <em>habeas </em>review. Accordingly, on these facts, we are required to vacate the District Court\u2019s Order granting Carmichael the writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">To summarize: we hold that the District Court incorrectly applied the standard for evaluating a state court\u2019s rulings set forth in the AEDPA when it concluded that the Appellate Division\u2019s order affirming the denial of Carmichael\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge was an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">For the reasons set out above, we VACATE the District Court\u2019s April 21, 2016 Order granting Carmichael the writ of <em>ha-beas corpus </em>and we REMAND the cause to the District Court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate and consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-6\">. <em>Carmichael v.
