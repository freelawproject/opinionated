After the close of evidence, Magistrate Judge Scott ruled as a matter of law against appellant on a number of claims, while the jury found for MTBank on the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">On appeal, appellant contends that the district court erred by: (i) admitting evidence in violation of Fed. R. Evid. 408 that MTBank made an offer of reinstatement allowing her to work remotely, (ii) disqualifying the attorneys for both parties under the advocate-witness rule, (iii) not instructing jurors on her claim that MTBank violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) by failing to engage in an interactive process, and (iv) dismissing as a matter of law appellant\u2019s New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) claim, which appellant argues had the same legal and factual underpinnings as her ADA claim that was presented to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">We hold that (i) the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of the reinstatement offer because the offer was, as a matter of law, not unconditional; (ii) the district court erred in sua sponte disqualifying the attorneys, because the disqualification depended on the erroneous admission of evidence relating to the reinstatement offer; (iii) the jury instructions were not erroneous; and (iv) we lack jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s NYSHRL ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">We vacate the judgment in part, insofar as it adopted the jury\u2019s verdict and the. district court\u2019s disqualification order; dismiss the appeal in part, insofar as it pertains to claims under the NYSHRL; and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">\u201cIn reviewing this record we construe all evidence, draw all inferences, and make all credibility determinations in favor of the party that prevailed before the jury.\u201d DiBella v. Hopkins, 408 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">In January 2010, appellant began her employment with MTBank in Buffalo, New York as a Lead on its Quality Assurance Test (QAT) team in the bank\u2019s Central Technology (CT) Department. The QAT team executes system testing of computer programs for bank applications. In March 2011, appellant decided to resign her position and relocate to Los Angeles, where her husband had taken a job. However, her supervisor, Monica Holcomb, suggested that she continue to work at MTBank remotely through the bank\u2019s Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA) policy. Under the AWA policy, \u201c[a]n employee\u2019s failure to resume [a] traditional work schedule or location upon revocation of an AWA will be considered a voluntary resignation of employment.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 77. Appellant accepted Holcomb\u2019s offer and began working remotely from California.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>In the spring of 2012, MTBank\u2019s management began exploring a reorganization of the CT Department, including the QAT team. This reorganization was intended to facilitate the Voyager Project, a planned overhaul of MTBank\u2019s existing online banking system. On May 30, 2012, MTBank announced the reorganization to CT Department employees. In a meeting attended remotely by appellant, management explained that, in light of the reorganization, all AWAs would be reviewed. Later that day, Holcomb called appellant, who confirmed that she understood that her AWA status could be affected by the reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The next day, appellant notified Lonnie Basciani \u2014 who had replaced Holcomb as appellant\u2019s supervisor and in turn reported to Holcomb \u2014 that she was pregnant. Shortly thereafter, she expressed concern about her AWA policy. Management determined, however, that team leads would need to be physically present in Buffalo at least two days per week in order to communicate and work directly with the individuals implementing the Voyager Project. At the time, appellant was the only employee on AWA status and not based in Buffalo. On June 27, 2012, Holcomb notified appellant that her AWA status would be altered, and that she would need to begin traveling to Buffalo.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The following day, on June 28, 2012, appellant emailed Holcomb and MTBank\u2019s Human Resources Department, requesting a meeting to discuss the possibility of delaying the start of her commute to Buffalo until after she gave birth. At a July 3, 2012 meeting with Holcomb, however, appellant was informed that her request to be exempted from traveling to Buffalo during the duration of her pregnancy was denied. Appellant was given a deadline of July 27 to confirm that she would begin reporting to Buffalo in early August.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On July 19, appellant submitted a letter from her obstetrician to Holcomb and MTBank\u2019s Human Resources Department, stating that, for health reasons, she should not engage in air travel for the duration of her pregnancy. After receiving this letter, Human Resources and MTBank management examined whether appellant could work on non-Voyager Project matters until she gave birth in December 2012. They concluded that there was not enough non-Voyager work to keep her occupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">For the next eight weeks, appellant received minimal communication from MTBank, except for periodic directives that she continue working. Finally, on September 11, 2012, MTBank notified appellant that she should either permanently relocate to Buffalo within thirty days or apply for and, if eligible, take early short-term disability leave, allowing her to remain in California through the end of her pregnancy. If she chose neither of these options, she would be terminated and given eleven weeks of severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">On September 14, 2012, appellant emailed MTBank, rejecting its offers. She explained that she was \u201cnot able to relocate to Buffalo within the next 30 days due to medical restrictions on [her] ability to travel during [her] pregnancy.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 78. On September 20, 2012, Ariel Y. Graff, an attorney for appellant, wrote a letter to MTBank\u2019s General Counsel stating that appellant had been \u201ceffectively terminated ... because of her pregnancy ... Constituting] unlawful discrimination on the basis of gender, pregnancy and pregnancy-related medical conditions.\u201d Id. at 60-62. He also stated that he was writing, in part, \u201cto offer the Company and potential individually named Defendants the opportunity to avoid a costly legal action that will result in substantial liability and adverse publicity for the Company and its executives.\u201d Id. at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The letter was forwarded to MTBank\u2019s vice-president and counsel, Sean Ronan, who spoke with Graff by telephone on October 12, 2012. At the start of the conversation, Graff made clear, and Ronan agreed, that Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Fed. R. Evid. 408 (providing that offers of settlement are inadmissible in later proceedings under certain conditions), would govern the conversation. Graff then made a settlement offer demanding $200,000. Ronan responded that the bank was not prepared to agree to such a monetary settlement. Instead, he suggested that appellant be reinstated and that she be allowed to work remotely from Los Angeles for the remainder of her pregnancy. No explicit statement was made that the reinstatement offer was conditioned upon the execution of a release of appellant\u2019s claims for monetary damages. Later, in a letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Ronan described his oral offer to appellant as follows: \u201cOur decision to offer [appellant] the accommodation she had demanded was not unlike any other offer of compromise [MTBank] \u2014 and a myriad of other parties \u2014 may offer to stave-off the vicissitudes of litigation. Distasteful and disruptive as it may have been, we ultimately decided to capitulate to [appellant\u2019s] demand solely because we recognized that it would be better than incurring time and expense fighting the issue.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On November 8, 2012, appellant filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC. On the same day, appellant filed the present action, eventually amending her complaint to allege that MTBank had: (i) engaged in unlawful interference under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et seq., the California Family Rights Act, Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12945.2, and the California Pregnancy Disability Leave Law, Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12945(a); (ii) unlawfully retaliated under the FMLA, Title YII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., and the NYSHRL, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 et seq.; (iii) unlawfully discriminated under Title VII, the ADA, and the NYSHRL; and (iv) failed to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, the NYSHRL, and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Before trial, appellant filed a motion m limine with the district court, seeking to exclude \u201c[a]ll offers made by [MTBank] to reinstate [appellant] in exchange for settling the instant action\u201d pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 408. See J. App\u2019x at 8. MTBank opposed the motion. It argued, first, that the reinstatement offer was admissible to show that appellant failed to mitigate damages and, second, should not be excluded under Rule 408 because the offer was unconditional, i.e., was not contingent on appellant\u2019s releasing MTBank from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied appellant\u2019s motion. The court reasoned that, under Pierce v. F.B. Tripler &amp; Co., 955 F.2d 820, 827 (2d Cir. 1992), an offer of settlement made by defendant\u2019s counsel to plaintiffs counsel is presumed to be inadmissible unless there is \u201cconvin-cin[g evidence] that the offer was not an attempt to compromise the claim.\u201d Sheng v. M &amp; T Bank Corp., 2014 WL 5500632, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2014). The court suggested that Pierce may no longer be good law in light of our decision in Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898 (2d Cir. 1997), which validated the proposition that an unconditional offer \u201ccannot be construed as an offer to settle or compromise under Rule 408.\u201d Sheng, 2014 WL 5500632, at *3. The district court concluded that there was \u201cno evidence to suggest that the offer of reinstatement was conditioned upon the compromise of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tiffs claims,\u201d and, therefore, the evidence of the reinstatement offer was admissible to show that appellant had not attempted to mitigate damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id. The court further ruled that both Graff and Ronan were disqualified from acting as trial counsel under the advocate-witness rule because they were the only witnesses who could testify before the jury as to whether MTBank extended an unconditional offer and whether appellant unreasonably rejected that offer. Id. at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">A jury trial began on November 3, 2014. After the close of evidence, the district court granted MTBank\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) on a number of appellant\u2019s claims, including the failure to accommodate under the NYSHRL. The court also declined to instruct the jury that the ADA imposes an affirmative duty on employers to engage in an interactive process with all employees who have requested accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On November 7, 2014, the jury returned a verdict for MTBank on the four remaining claims: interference under the FMLA, retaliation under the FMLA, failure to accommodate under the ADA, and failure to accommodate under the California FEHA. On December 2, 2014, appellant appealed from \u201cthe jury verdict entered in this action on the 7th day of November 2014.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">a) Admissibility of the Reinstatement Offer and Attorney Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of MTBank\u2019s offer of reinstatement. We agree and find that this error was not harmless. Because the admission of the evidence served as the basis for Graff and Ronan\u2019s disqualification, they may appear in subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, United States v. Cuti, 720 F.3d 453, 457 (2d Cir. 2013), a standard that is met only when the district court \u201cbased its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or rendered a decision that cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions,\u201d In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). We will not vacate for a new trial, however, if any error was harmless, i.e., where we \u201ccan conclude with fair assurance that the evidence did not substantially influence the jury.\u201d United States v. Mercado, 573 F.3d 138, 141 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Rule 408(a) prohibits, inter alia, the admission of \u201c[e]vidence of the following ... to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim ...: (1) ... offering ... valuable consideration in ... attempting to compromise the claim....\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 408(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">In Pierce, we held that \u201cwhere a party is represented by counsel, threatens litigation and has initiated the first administrative steps in that litigation, any offer made between attorneys will be presumed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>an offer within the scope of Rule 408.\u201d 955 F.2d at 827. The Pierce presumption can be rebutted only if \u201c[t]he party seeking admission of [the] offer ... demonstrate^] convincingly that the offer was not an attempt to compromise the claim.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We do not agree with the district court that Pierce is \u201cno longer ... good law\u201d in light of our decision in Lightfoot. See Sheng, 2014 WL 5500632, at *3. Lightfoot \u2019s only citation to Pierce approved the earlier decision. See 110 F.3d at 909 (citing Pierce, 955 F.2d at 826-29). Indeed, Lightfoot simply stated the obvious: \u201cBy definition, an unconditional offer may not require the employee to abandon or modify his suit, and ... therefore cannot be considered an offer of settlement or compromise.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Analogizing to Pierce, we conclude that the district court erred in admitting evidence of MTBank\u2019s reinstatement offer. While Pierce uses the word \u201cpresumed,\u201d it did not relegate the issues to the tangled analysis sometimes employed in the area of legal presumptions. See generally Fed. R. Evid. 301, Advisory Committee notes. Rather, it simply recognized the self-evident inference that, even when a lawyer informs counsel for a (potential) plaintiff that the (potential) defendant agrees to all relief believed to be demanded, some sort of release, at the very least, is expected in return. This expectation, which is almost universal, absent express reservations to the contrary, renders the offer conditional and subject to exclusion under Rule 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">To be sure, there may be exceptional circumstances in which the parties understand that an unconditional offer is being made, but no such circumstances exist here. Appellant was represented by counsel who initiated the first steps toward the litigation by sending a letter dated September 20, 2012 to MTBank\u2019s General Counsel alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of gender and pregnancy. The letter prompting the call was marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY,\u201d and the two attorneys, Graff and Ronan, began their October 12, 2012 call by agreeing that Rule 408 would govern the conversation. Of course, such an agreement by itself does not preclude a party from making an unconditional offer, but it does suggest that the parties here were hoping to take advantage of Rule 408\u2019s protection \u2014 protection available only for conditional offers. Further, although Ro-nan had not explicitly made reinstatement contingent upon the execution of a release and waiver of claims, the reinstatement offer was made immediately after Graffs settlement offer of $200,000 was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Moreover, Ronan himself admitted the offer was conditioned on appellant\u2019s forgoing litigation when he told the EEOC that \u201c[MTBank\u2019s] decision to offer [appellant] the accommodation she had demanded was not unlike any other offer of compromise [MTBank] \u2014 and a myriad of other parties \u2014 may offer to stave-off the vicissitudes of litigation. Distasteful and disruptive as it may have been, [MTBank] ultimately decided to capitulate to [appellant\u2019s] demand solely because we recognized that it would be better than incurring time and expense fighting the issue.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 75. This constitutes an admission by MTBank that the reinstatement offer was conditioned upon dropping the lawsuit and its monetary demand, eliminating, as a matter of law, any factual issue as to whether the offer was conditional.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">While \u201cevidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error analysis,\u201d Mercado, 573 F.3d at 141, our review of the record convinces us that this error was hardly harmless. See, e.g., J. App\u2019x at 94 (MTBank\u2019s opening statement (\u201c[Appellant] was offered ultimately exactly what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>she had asked for.... So, why are we standing here today if that\u2019s what she was offered?\u201d)); id. at 260 (MTBank\u2019s closing statement (\u201cThe bottom line I\u2019m <em>going to </em>offer is, [appellant\u2019s] attorneys know that the offer is a game changer.... You don\u2019t always get what you want exactly when you want it, but here, [appellant] was offered exactly what she asked for.\u201d)). The reinstatement offer may, therefore, have substantially affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment insofar as it adopted the jury\u2019s verdict. In addition, we also vacate the appeal insofar as it adopted the district court\u2019s order sua sponte disqualifying Graff and Ronan, because that order rested on the erroneous admission -of evidence relating to MTBank\u2019s reinstatement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">b) The Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201cWe review a claim of error in the district court\u2019s jury instructions de novo, disturbing the district court\u2019s judgment only if the appellant shows that the error was prejudicial in light of the charge as a whole.\u201d Turley v. ISG Lackawanna, Inc., 774 F.3d 140, 152-53 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, 153 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal citation omitted). We will not require a new trial \u201c[i]f the instructions, read as a whole, presented the issues to the jury in a fair and evenhanded manner.\u201d Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 F.3d 127, 156 (2d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Before this case was submitted to the jury, appellant objected to the district court\u2019s proposed jury instructions on the ground that the instruction on the ADA failure-to-aecommodate claim did not \u201cinclude within the definition of failure to accommodate a failure to engage in the interactive process with the employee in violation of [the] Code of Federal Regulations and Brady v. Walmart.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 251. Appellant presses this contention on appeal, arguing in effect that a defendant\u2019s failure to engage in an interactive process is alone sufficient to support a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA. We disagree. We do hold, however, that district courts may admit an employer\u2019s failure to engage in an interactive process as evidence of discrimination under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\u201cDiscrimination in violation of the ADA includes, inter alia, \u2018not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.\u2019 \u201d McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)). A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of disability discrimination arising from a failure to accommodate by showing each of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">(1) [P]laintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">McBride, 583 F.3d at 96-97 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">In McBride, we agreed with \u201ceach of our sister Circuits ... that failure to engage in an interactive process does not form the basis of an ADA claim in the absence of evidence that accommodation was possible.\u201d Id. at 100-01 (collecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cases). Therefore, there is no valid independent claim under the ADA for failure to engage in an interactive process. See Noll v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machines Corp., 787 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[Plaintiff-employee] contends that [defendant-employer] failed to engage in [an interactive] process, and advances an argument that this failure gave rise to an independent cause of action [under the ADA]. We disagree.\u201d). We clarify, however, that an employer\u2019s failure to engage in a good faith interactive process<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> can be introduced as evidence tending to show disability discrimination, McBride, 583 F.3d at 101 (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1116 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S.Ct. 1516, 152 L.Ed.2d 589 (2002); Cravens v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, 214 F.3d 1011, 1020-21 (8th Cir. 2000); F.jellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 952 (8th Cir. 1999); Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 317-20 (3d Cir. 1999)), and that \u201cthe employer has refused to make [a reasonable] accommodation,\u201d 583 F.3d at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The regulations implementing the ADA are consistent with our view that a failure to engage in a good faith interactive process is not an independent violation of the ADA. They state that, \u201c[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the [employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the [qualified] individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.\u201d' 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(o)(3) (emphasis added). Even where the employer has refused to interact with the claimant, a violation of the ADA requires a showing of a disability as defined by the ADA, proof of qualification, and the existence of a reasonable accommodation. See McBride, 583 F.3d at 101 (\u201c[A]n employer\u2019s failure to engage in a sufficient interactive process does not form the basis of a claim under the ADA and evidence thereof does not allow a plaintiff to avoid summary judgment unless she also establishes that, at least with the aid of some identified accommodation, she was qualified for the position at issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We see no conflict between this proposition and our ruling with regard to the exclusion of Ronan\u2019s offer under Rule 408, discussed supra, and admitting evidence of MTBank\u2019s failure to discuss possible accommodations. An offer of an accommodation conditioned upon the dropping of monetary claims does not fulfill the requirements of the ADA as to an interactive process. The Act clearly imposes a duty to provide an accommodation in job requirements, if feasible. The discussion obligation relates only to the feasibility of accommodating employer/employee needs. Conditioning proposed accommodations on the dropping of claims does not fulfill that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">c) The NYSHRL Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in granting MTBank\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), on her failure to accommodate claim under the NYSHRL \u2014 arguing that this claim had the same factual premises and was governed by the same legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>principles as her ADA failure-to-accommodate claim, which was allowed to proceed to trial. However, appellant did not properly preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-2\">A notice of appeal must \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). The requirement is jurisdictional, Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 132 S.Ct. 641, 651-52, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012), but \u201cit is well settled that courts should apply a liberal interpretation to that requirement,\u201d Conway v. Vill. of Mount Kisco, 750 F.2d 205, 211 (2d Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">Here, appellant\u2019s Notice of Appeal appealed \u201cfrom the jury verdict entered in this action on the 7th day of November 2014,\u201d not from the district court\u2019s prior judgment as a matter of law. J. App\u2019x at 272 (emphasis added). Indeed, appellant argued for the first time in her opening brief to this court that the district court erred in its entry of judgment on the NYSHRL claims. As a result, we find that appellant did not properly preserve her argument that the district court erred in granting MTBank\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment in part, insofar as it adopted the jury\u2019s verdict and the district court\u2019s disqualification order; dismiss the appeal in part, insofar as it pertains to claims under the NYSHRL; and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\">. Appellant named as defendants in her complaint \"M&amp;T Bank Corporation, and Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Company d/b/a M&amp;T Bank.\u201d We refer to them collectively herein as \u201cMTBank.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">. The court ultimately allowed the jury to resolve \u201cquestions of fact\u201d over whether MTBank \u201cmade an unconditional offer of reinstatement and whether the plaintiff reasonably refused the offer.\u201d IR at *4 &amp; n.6. This procedure followed Fed. R. Evid. 104, which directs that the trial court decide \"preliminary questions\u201d of fact governing issues of admissibility \u2014 here, whether the reinstatement offer was conditional or not \u2014 -but allow the jury to determine the same facts where the same preliminary questions of fact go to the merits \u2014 here, whether appellant failed to mitigate damages by declining an unconditional offer of reinstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-6\">. An employer engages in an interactive process by, for example, \u201cmeeting with the employee who requests an accommodation, requesting information about the condition and what limitations the employee has, asking the employee what he or she specifically wants, showing some sign of having considered the employee\u2019s request, and offering and discussing available alternatives when the request is too burdensome.\u201d Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 218-19 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
