Besides this, there stood in the name of the deceased two houses in Ermita, Manila, which were, however, encumbered with a debt of twelve thousand dollars, payable in Mexican money, which debt was due to one Julian de La 0, and the deceased moreover owned certain furniture and jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The remaining undivided half interest not owned by Fuente in the three first described pieces of property were jointly owned by his nephew, Gabriel Olives y Gonzal\u00e9z de la Fuente, and two nieces, who were both married\u2014Angeles Olives y Gonzalez de la Fuente, wiffe of Eduardo Gutierrez y Repide, and Paz Olives y Gonzalez de la. Fuente, wife of Manuel Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">By the will of Fuente all his property w;as given to his nephew Gabriel and his two nieces Angeles and Paz, subject, however, to a right of usufruct during her life in his wife Concepcion Calvo. It would seem that some controversy arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>between the widow as usufructuary anc[ the nephews and nieces as heirs of Fuente ,and as coowners in their own right as to the'partition of the property. ,The result was a written agreement between the parties\u2014the nephews and nieces and the wife\u2014the whole of which is in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the parts which we think are pertinent to this controversy we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">\u201cThe undersigned, Angeles and Paz Olives, in -the presence of their respective husbands, and Gabriel Olives, as heirs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>certain property of Francisco Gonzalez de la Fuente, and Concepcion Calvo, as usufructuary heiress of the said Gonzalez agree upon a division of the inheritance, the principal conditions of which are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201cFirst. The property No. \u2014 on the Escolta, half of which belonged to the testator, shall be sold at the price not less than ninety thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u201c Second. From, the proceeds of the sale there shall be paid the amount owing to pious works, the amount owing Mr. Ro\u00e9nsch, that owing Julian de La O, and the unpaid legacies made by Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez de la -Fuente.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u201cThird. The remainder shall be turned over to Concepcion Calvo, to be used by her as usufructuary heiress, after she has given a mortgage bond (fianza hipotecaria).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXC\">This suit in the form of a bill in equity was commenced by the'plaintiff in .error, the widow, against the defendants, the \u25a0 nephew and nieces asserting rights under the agreement and asking the .appointment' of a receiver, to take \u2022 charge of the fund arising from the sale of the property on the Escolta and money derived from other sources, as well as a .balance coming from the Ermita property after paying the'debt with which that property was encumbered. Without going into detail or considering irrelevant questions,, it suffices to say that the principal right which, the widow asserted was that she was entitled under the agreement to hold as usufructuary the whole proceeds of the property on the Escolta after, making the payments specified in the agreement. That is,, her principal claim was that her usufructuary right under the will, in virtue of the agreement, attached not' only to the proceeds of the share of the property on the Escplta owned by-her husband at.his death, but also to the share of the. proceeds representing the undivided interest owned by the nephew and nieces.. The case was put at issue and- much testimony was taken in the trial court which that' court deemed to be admissible upon the theory that.it tended to, throw light upon the meaning of the written agreement'. There was judgment in favor of the Widow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>practically maintaining all her claims, including her asserted right to a usufructuary interest in the whole sum of the Escolta property, and that portion of the decree was in effect the real subject of controversy in the Supreme Court of. the Philippine Islands, to which the case was appealed. That- court, whilst recognizing the rights of the widow in other particulars, reversed the judgment in so far as it decreed her to be entitled to a usufructuary interest in the whole of the proceeds of the Escolta property, and confined her usufructuary, right to the proceeds \u00f3f half of the Escolta property which, had belonged to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Two substantial grounds of error are here assigned: First, that the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands erred in its conclusion concerning, the Escolta property, because in doing so it' disregarded the unambiguous letter of the agreement; and, second, because* it differed with the trial court as to the result of the evidence and therefore departed from the findings of fact made, by the trial court, which it is asserted the court had not the power to do, because there had been no motion for a new trial in. the lower court, on the ground that, the findings of fact were plainly and manifestly against the weight of evidence. Philippine Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 497. We put -this latter, consideration at once out of view as being totally devoid of merit. This is said because we do not think there were findings below concerning the evidence throwing light, upon the contract in the sense which the proposition assumes;' and. even if there were, we find nothing in the record justifying the conclusion that such findings were disregarded by the Supreme Court or that its conclusion on the controverted question was based upon them. True it is that after interpreting the contract and.stating the legal rules by. which it deemed, that interpretation was sustained, the. opinion, of the Supreme Court made reference to* what it believed to be the persuasive force of the testimony concerning the relations and dealings-of the parties leading up to the contract. When the opinion, however, is considered, as a. whole, we'think-it is clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>references made to the testimony may be put out of view, since the action of the court was really based alone upon its construction of the contract and the law applicable to it, and we shall therefore confine ourselves exclusively to that subject. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">It will be observed, that the first paragraph of the contract provided for the sale of the house on the Escolta, \u201chalf of which belonged to the testator,\u201d and fixed the price at which the sale should be made. The second clause provided for the deduction from the proceeds of sale of certain admitted debts or liabilities. The third elapse provided that the remainder should be turned' over to Concepcion Calvo, to be used by her as usufructuary heiress, after the giving by her of a mortgage bond. The whole controversy hinges on the word \u201c remainder.\u201d The plaintiff in error insists because of this word that the plain letter of the contract exacted that the wife should , take as usufructuary not only the proceeds of the sale.of the portion, of the property which the husband owned, and upon which alone prior to the contract her usufructuary right attached, but also the. proceeds of the half of the property which belonged to the other parties and which prior to the contract she had no right or interest in, as usufructuary.</p>\n<p id=\"ABV\">The argument is thus stated:.\u201cTo say that the remainder means \u00f3ne-half of the remainder is to make a new1 contract for the parties in direct contravention of article 1281 of the Spanish and Philippine Civil Code.\u201d The article referred to provid\u00e9s that where the terms of a contract are clear, and there can be no doubt about the intention of the contracting parties, the legal stipulations of the contract shall be enforced. We do not follow the reference in the argument to authorities under the Spanish and Roman law enforcing the legal proposition. It is elementary. The difficulty is in its application to the cause before, us, since the real question under the contract is whether, the word \u201c remainder\u201d as used does not, in view of the subject with which the contract is concerned, relate and relate only to the remainder of the proceeds as to which, und\u00e9r the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>will of the deceased, the usufructuary interest of the widow attached. Considering this subject, and looking at the contract, we think there can be no doubt that the word \u201c remainder \u201d as used in the contract must in the very nature of things, in the absence of an express stipulation to the contrary, be held not\u2019 to have transferred to the widow a usufructuary interest in property which her deceased husband did not own, and which, the very terms of the contract show was owned by other p\u00e1rties. The reasoning Of the court belowi in o\u00fcr opinion, so adequately disposes of the contention that the word \u201c remainder \u201d should be considered as. having transferred to the widow a usufructuary interest in property to whiph that interest did not attach, that we excerpt'a portion thereof, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">\u201cThe co\u00fart below was of opinion that the language of the third section of the foregoing agreement leaves no room for interpretation or construction, and that the word \u2018remainder\u2019 as used therein refers necessarily-to the.balance remaining after deducting from the whole amount received from the Escolta property the amount of the debts and legacies mentioned in the second section. We are of opinion, however, that the court erred in its Construction of this section of .the agreement, and We think-that the word \u2018remainder\u2019 must be limited to the inheritance which it was the intention and object of the parties to plivide, for the preamble expressly states that the parties, fes heirs of Francisco Gonzalez -de la Fuente, agree upon a division of the inheritance, and it is admitted that one-half of the property on the Escolta was, the property of the defendants, and formed no part whatever of said inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u201cArticle 1283 of the Civil Code provides that \u2018howevep general. may be the terms of a contract, there shall not be understood as Included therein\u2019other subjects pr things and cases \u25a0different from those \u25a0 regarding which the. interested p\u00e1rties proposed to contract;\u2019 and w\u00e9 \u00e1re of ppi\u00fcion that .although the word \u2018remainder,\u2019 \u00e1s used in-the third section pf the said agreement, might, in the broadest acceptation of .'.the term, refer to the total balance resulting.from the .sale of the-Escolta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>property, nevertheless, under the provisions1 of the foregoing article it sliould be limited to the subject-matter of \u201cthe agreement, and thus limited, it must be taken to refer to the remainder of the share of the inheritance in which Do\u00f1a Concepci\u00f3n Calvo had-a usufructuary life interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">There de a conflicting cont\u00e9ntion in the argument for the appellant-that if there be doubt as to the meaning of the word. <em>\u201c </em>remainder \u201d that doubt should be resolved in favor of the right of the widow to a usufruct in the- portion of the property not belonging to her'husband and as to which, therefore, she was not his usufructuary, heir.. We do-not stop .to analyze the matter^ thus relied upon, as We think it suffices to say that after an examination <em>oi </em>the whole contract we -find -nothing in it which-Would justify the construction of the word'^remainder \u201d which is, asserted. In other words, we can discover nothing in any part of the agreement Which would authorize, without express language to that effect, the' transferring to one party to,the cpntraet of valuable property belonging to the other, especially when the contract itself was concerned only, as aptly pointed out by the lower court, with settling the \u2022 -rights of the parties to- the property left by the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-4\"> <em>Translation of Exhibit '11 A.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The undersigned, Angeles and Paz Olives, in the presence of their respective husbands, and Gabriel Olives, as heirs of certain property, of Francisco Gonzalez de la Fuente, and Concepcion Calvo as usufructu\u00e1ry heiress of the said Gonzalez, agree upon a division of the inheritance, the principal conditions of which areas follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">First: The property No. \u2014 on the Escolta, half of which belonged to the testator, shall be sold at the price not less than ninety thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Second.
