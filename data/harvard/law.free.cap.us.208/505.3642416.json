Justice McKenna,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag3L\">after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The assignment of errors attacks the decree of the Supreme Court because (1) the court decided or assumed that the defendant was in contempt for not complying with the order for temporary alimony. (2) In so holding or deciding, though defendant had not been cited to show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt for not complying with the order. (3) (4) In affirming the action of the trial court refusing permission to defendant to answer to, or make defense against, the amended petition except on condition that he should comply in five days with the order for temporary alimony. (5) In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>affirming the decree of the court.awarding plaintiff. $6,500 per-' manent alimony and attorney\u2019s fees and certain real property,, constituting the homestead of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The assignments of error are based upon a misunderstanding of the action of the trial court and the opinion .of the, Supreme Court. They proceed upon the supposition that he was not in culpable default to the law and the orders of the court\u2014a default after amplest opportunity to be heard and to contest every charge and claim'against him..</p>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">The summons issued upon the original petition was served upon him by leaving a copy of it at his usual place of residence, as under the law it cpuld be served. Par. 3938; \u00a7 64, Okla. Stat. 1893. It contained the notification that 'unless he answered by the sixteenth of June, 1903, the petition would be taken as true, and judgment would be rendered accordingly. He paid no attention to it. Yet there is more than theTegal presumption-that he received.'it, for on the day-, preceding there had been served on him' a notice of, the application for the temporary alimony and attorney\u2019s fees', the ord\u00e9r to pay which makes the pivot of this'controversy. H\u00e9 does not seem to have been sensitive to'the charges against him,-and,-it may be, he thought his property was secure from the demands of the plaintiff by the conveyance to his son on the.day before. The order upon the application was made May 23, 1903. He did' npt obey it. On the twenty-first of July, 1903, the amended petition was filed. It was served' by publication, he having changed hisy residence to Nevada. He was notified to answer on or before September 4, 1903. -He did not answ\u00e9r, but on that-day he appealed by counsel and submitted a motion- to, set aside service of summons, upon which motion the record shows the court made the, following order: \u201cIt is by the \u00bfcourt ordered-: be-given leave to amend return on said, summons.\u201d He was subsequently personally served with an alias summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u25a0 -It required an 'answer to, the petition'' on- or by -the twelfth of March, 1904. An answer was hot filed. On the sixth of April following a special appearance was entered and a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>made to set aside the summons and the alias summons on various grounds, which motion was denied after hearing. The defendant then offered to file an answer \u201cinstanter,\u201d and the offer was refused on the ground that he was in contempt of court for not complying with the order for temporary alimony. It was, however, ordered that he should be permitted to file an answer \u201cwithin five days'on condition that he purge himself of said contempt by complying with said order within that time.\u201d From the decree of the court it appears that its order was not so- absolute, but that he was given an opportunity to show why he had not complied with the order- for alimony. Had the court the 'power to impose the conditions? Could the court have imposed any conditions or terms at all, and what was the limit of its power? If the court had a discretion it cannot be reviewed unless it was unreasonably exercised. And the court certainly had a discretion'. We have seen that par. 3933, \u00a759 of . the statutes'of the Territory prescribes the result to a defendant for default in not appearing to be that the petition against him will be taken as true and judgment shall be rendered accordingly.' If there is any modification of this in a suit for , divorce it gives no rights to a defaulting defendant. Par. 3983, \u00a7105 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Territory of 1893 provides that a. defendant must demur or answer within twenty days after the day on which the summons is returnable, and. par. 3981, \u00a7 106 is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cThe court, or any judge thereof in vacation, may, in his discretion, and upon such terms as may be -just, allow an answer or reply to be made, or other act to be done, after the time limited by this act, or by an order enlarge such time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u25a0 The question, then, can only be whether :the court abused the discretion given to it by that section. Were the terms which the court imposed just? \u25a0 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The record demonstrates that the order for alimony was. reasonable in itself and reasonable in relation to the means and obligations of defendant to plaintiff. \u25a0 According to plaintiff\u2019s petition, and presumably- according to proof submitted ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>to the court upon the application for alimony of which defendant had notice,- plaintiff was compelled by his cruelty to leave him with her child, then only a month old. She had no means / to support herself and child. She was sick and unable to seek work. She was without means to carry on her suit for divorce. This was her situation as presented to the court, and defendant did not appear to deny it. He did not appear to deny that he. owned real estate in the county where he- lived of the value of $20,000, and in-other places of the value of $14,000; that he had bank deposits of $10,000, and other personal property of the value of $15,000. He did not-appear to deny that his cruelty\u2014a cruelty of a peculiar kind\u2014had driven her with her infant from his house. To this he was not sensitive. 'He was, ' however, not without anxiety for some of the consequences of the charge, and immediately set about to dispose of his property. After this he seemed to feel secure, either in misunder-standing of his rights or in some perverted notion that he could evade or- defy the law. At any rate, he did not appear and he did not obey the order of the court. Whether it could have been directly and expeditiously enforced against him may be doubted. He had put his property in the name of others. An execution, therefore, would have encountered that obstacle, and personal coercion might not have been possible, for certainly as early as July, 1903, he had changed his residence to Virginia City, Nevada. Besides, under- the circumstances, plaintiff cannot .urge that -compliance with the order of the court could have been enforced in some other way than that adopted. It may be that the poverty Which made the order of the court a necessity to her prevented her from enforcing the order, and the defendant may have .deliberately planned to that-\u00bfend. And Jt may have appeared to the court at the hearing of -April 5, 1904, that he had done so. .It may have appeared to the court that his contumacy was without just cause or reason, and it would be continued to defeat the .order of . the court, though he should receive from its discretion a remission of .the consequences of his default. Take the orderbf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the court in its most absolute sense and, we say again, it was reasonable. Take it as described in the final decree and it was indulgent. It added another opportunity to be heard in addition to those defendant had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"A9qq\">The plaintiff in error, without any discussion of the section of the Oklahoma statutes, which we have quoted, attempts to avoid their effect by the contention that he had never been adjudged guilty of eontempt, and/ even if he had been, the power of the court to punish him was limited by a statute of the Territory to imposition of a fine <em>dr </em>a sentence of imprisonment. He hence seeks to invoke the doctrine of <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>167 U. S. 409. 'The contention is based, as we have said, upon the argument that the assignments of error are upon a misconception of' the action of the court. The principle of <em>Hovey </em>v. \u2019 <em>Elliott, </em>therefore, is not applicable. Indeed, the point was reserved in that case, whether one in contempt could be refused <em>\u00e1 </em>right under a statute invoked by him as actor. But we need not stop to consider whether the reasoning, which we may say now we entirely approve, or the cases cited, carry the principle of the case to the point reserved, for we are of opinion that the pending case is not within the principle. The question here, we repeat, is the simple one whether, under the statute giving the power to a court to allow a' defaulting defendant to answer \u201cupon sudh terms as may be just,\u201d the order in eontroversy was within the power. And being of opinion that an affirmative answer is justified, the decree of/ the Supreme Court of the Territory is \u2022 \u2022'</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-7\">Mr. Justice, Brewer dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
