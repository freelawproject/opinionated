Justice Beewee</author>\n<p id=\"A85\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">On February 19, 1903, the legislature of. the State of Oregon passed an act (Session Laws, 1903, p. 14$), the first section of which is in these words ;\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u201cSec. 1. That no female (shall) be employed in any me- . chanical establishment, 6r factory,, or laundry in this State more than ten hours, during any one' day. The hours of work. may be so arranged as to permit, the employment of females <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>at any time so that they shall not work more than ten hours during the twenty-four hours of any on\u00e9 day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Section 3 made a violation of the provisions of the prior sections a misdemeanor, subject to a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $25. On September 18, 1905, an information was filed in the Circuit Court of the State for the county of Multnomah, charging that the defendant \u201con the 4th day of September, A. D. 1905, in the county of' Multnomah and State of Oregon, then and there being the-owner of a laundry, known as the Grand Laundry, in the city of Portland, and the employer of females therein, did then and there unlawfully permit and suffer one Joe Haselbock, he, the said Joe Haselbock, then and there being an overseer, superintendent and agent of said Curt Muller, in the said Grand Laundry, to require a female, to wit, one Mrs. E. Gotcher,. to work more than ten hours iix said laundry on said 4th day of September, A. D. 1905, contrary to' the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the p\u00e9ace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u25a0 A trial resulted in a verdict against the defendant, who was sentenced to pay a fine of $10. The Supreme Court of /he State affirmed the- conviction, <em>State </em>v. <em>Muller, </em>48 Oregon, 252, whereupon the case was brought here on writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The single question is the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant was convicted so far as it affects the work of a female in a laundry. That it does not conflict with any provisions of the state constitution is settled by the decision of the Supreme Court of the State. The contentions of the defendant, now plaintiff in error, are thus stated in his brief:</p>\n<p id=\"AsD\">\u201c(1) Because the statute attempts to prevent persons, <em>sui juris, </em>from making their own contracts, and thus violates the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\" 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United. States; nor shall any .State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;.nor deny to any person within, its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201c (2) Because the statute does not apply equally to all persons similarly situated, and is class legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"A3EK\">\u201c (3) The statute is not a valid exercise of the police power. The kinds of work proscribed are not unlawful, nor are they declared to be immoral or dangerous to the public health; nor can such a law be sustained on the ground that it is designed to protect women on account of their sex. There is no necessary or reasonable connection between the limitation prescribed by the act and the public health, safety or welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">It is the law of Oregon that women, whether married- or single, have. equal contractual and personal rights with men. As said by Chief Justice Wolverton, in <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>36 Oregon, 390, 396, after a review of the various statutes of the State upon the subject:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u201cWe may therefore say with perfect confidence that, with these- three sections, upon the statute book, the wife can deal, not only with her separate property, acquired from whatever source, in the same manner as her husband can with property belonging to him, but that she may make contracts and incur liabilities, and the same may be enforced against her, the same as if she were a <em>femme sole. </em>There is now no residuum of civil disability resting upon her which is not recognized as existing against the. husband. The current runs steadily and strongly in the direction of the emancipation of the wife, and the policy, as disclosed by all recent legislation upon the subject in this State, is to place her upon the same footing as if she were a <em>femme sote, </em>not only with respect to her separate property, but as it affects her right to make binding contracts; and the most natural corollary to the situation is that the remedies for the enforcement of. liabilities incurred are made co-extensive and co-equal with such enlarged conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">It thus appears that, putting to one side the elective franchise, in the matter of personal and contractual rights they, stand on the same plane as the other sex. Their rights in these respects can no more be infringed than the equal rights of their brothers. We held in <em>Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 U. S. 45, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>a law.providing that no laborer shall be required or permitted to work in a bakery more than sixty hours in a week or ten hours in a day was not as to men a legitimate exercise of the police power of the, State, but an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right and liberty of the individual to contract in relation to his labor, and as such was in conflict with, and void under, the Federal Constitution. That decision is invoked by plaintiff in error as decisive of the question before us.- But this assumes that the difference between the sexes does not justify' a different rule respecting a restriction of the hours of labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In patent cases counsel are apt to open the argument with a discussion of the state of the art. It may not be amiss, in the present case, before examining the constitutional question, to notice the course of legislation as well as expressions of opinion from other than judicial sources. In the brief filed by Mr. Louis D. Brand\u00e9is, for the defendant in error, is a very copious collection of all these matters, an epitome of which is found in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>While there have been but few decisions bearing directly upon the question, the following sustain the constitutionality of such legislation: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton Mfg. Co., </em>120 Massachusetts, 383; <em>Wenham </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 Nebraska, 394, 400, 406; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>29 Washington, 602; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beatty, </em>15 Pa. Sup. Ct. 5, 17; against them is the case of <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>People, </em>155 Illinois, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The legislation and opinions referred to in the margin may not be, technically speaking, authorities, and in them is little or no discussion of the constitutional question presented to us for determination, yet they are significant of a widespread belief that woman\u2019s physical structure, and the functions she performs in consequence thereof, justify special legislation restricting or qualifying the conditions, under which she should be permitted to toil. Constitutional questions, it is true, are not settled by even a consensus of present public opinion, for it is the peculiar value of a written constitution that it places in-unchanging form- limitations upon legislative action, and thus gives a permanence and stability to popular government which otherwise would be lacking. At the same time, when a question Of fact is debated-and debatable, and the extent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>which a special constitutional limitation goes is affected by the truth in respect to that fact, a widespread and long continued belief concerning it is- worthy of consideration. We take judicial cognizance of all matters of general knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">It is undoubtedly true, as more than once declared by this court, that the general right to contract in relation to one's business is part of the liberty of the individual, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution; yet it is equally well settled that this liberty is not absolute and extending to all contracts, and that a State may, without conflicting with the provisions of the -Fourteenth Amendment,) restrict in many respects the individual\u2019s power of contract. Without stopping to-discuss at l\u00e9ngth the extent to which a State may act in this respect, we refer to the following cases in which the question has been considered: <em>Allgeyer </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>165 U. S. 578; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>169 U. S. 366; <em>Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 U. S. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">That woman\u2019s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of jnotherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance for a-long time on her feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of . woman becomes an object of public\u2019interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the, race.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Still again, history discloses the fact that woman has always been dependent upon man. He established his control at the outset by superior physical strength, and this control in various forms, with diminishing intensity,.has continued to the present. As minors, though not to the same extent, she has been looked upon in the courts as needing especial care, that her rights may Be preserved. Education.was long denied her, and while now the doors of the school room are opened and. her opportunities for. acquiring knowledge are great, yet even with- that and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>consequent increase of capacity for business affairs it is still true' that in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal competitor with her brother. Though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in.her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full.assertion of those rights. She will still, be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary; to secure a real equality of right. \u25a0 Doubtless there are individual exceptions, and there are many respects in which she has an advantage over him; but looking at it from the viewpoint-of the effort to'maintain an independent position in life,, she is not upon an equality. Differentiated by these matters, from, the other sex, she is propierly placed in a class by herself, . and legislation designed for her protection may be \u201csustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men afid could hot be sustained. It is impossible to close one\u2019s eyes to the fact that she still looks to her brother and depends upon him. Even though all restrictions on political,- personal and contractual rights were taken away., and she stood, so far as statutes are \u25a0 concerned, upon an absolutely equal plane with him, it would still be true that she is so constituted that she will rest upon,. and look to him for protection; that her physical structure and a proper discharge of her maternal functions\u2014having in view; not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race\u2014 justify legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man. The limitations which this statute places upon' her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the time she shall labor, are not imposed solely. for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all. Many words\u2019cannot make this plainer. The two sexes differ in struc- . ture-of body, in the functions to. be perforihed by \u00e9ach, in the amount of physical strength, in the capacity for long-continued labor, particularly when done standing, the influence of vigorous health upon the future well-being of the race, the self-reliance which enables one to assert full rights, and in the capacity to.maintain the struggle for subsistence. This difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>justifies a difference in legislation and upholds that which is designed to compensate for some of the burdens which, rest upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We have not referred in this discussion to the denial of the elective franchise, in the State of Oregon, for while it may disclose a lack of political equality in all things with her brother, that is not of itself decisive. The reason runs deeper, and rests in the inherent difference between the two sexes, and in the different functions in life which they perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">For- these reasons, and without questioning .in any respect the decision in <em>Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>we are of the opinion that it cannot be adjudged(that the. act in question is in conflict with the Federal Constitution, so far as it respects the work of a female in a laundry, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\"> The following legislation of the States impose restrictions in some form or another upon the hours of labor that may be required of women: Massachusetts: chap. 221, 1874, Rev.

Then follow extracts from over ninety reports of committees, bureaus- of statistics, commissioners of hygiene, inspectors of. factories, both in this country and in Europe, to the effect that long hours of labor are'dangerous for women, primarily, because of their special physical organization. The matter is discussed in these reports in different.aspects, but all agree as to the danger. It would of course take too much space to give these reports in detail.' ' Following them are extracts from similar reports discussing the general benefits of short hours from an economic aspect of the question. In many of these reports individual instances are given tending to support the general conclusion. Perhaps the general scope and character of all these reports may be summed up in what an inspector-for Hanover says; \u201cThe reasons for the reduction- of the working day to ten hours\u2014(a) the physical' organization .of women, (6) her maternal functions, (c) the rearing and education of the children, (d) the maintenance of the home\u2014are all so important and so far reaching that the need for such reduction need hardly be discussed.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
