Shannon, deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201cThe will gives the residuary estate to testator\u2019s wife for life, and then proceeds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-5\">\u201c \u2018At the decease of my said wife my estate * * * shall be divided among my surviving children or their heirs, share and share alike. Proviso. If my wife dies before I do * * * my estate * * * shall be equally divided among my surviving children or their heirs, share and share alike.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-9\">\u201cThe will was drafted by a justice of the peace of Pennsylvania and executed in 1905. At that time testator had four children \u2014 Thomas, Michael, James and Jennie \u2014 none of whom were married. [There had been only one other child, who had died in infancy.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-10\">\u201cThomas died in 1915, unmarried. Michael died in 1918, leaving a widow and four children [the present defendants]. Testator died in 1920, and his widow died in 1923. The other two children, James and Jejmie, are the present complainants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-11\">\u201cThey claim the entire estate; the defendants claim one-third, as the \u2018heirs\u2019 of the deceased son Michael.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-12\">\u201cI am satisfied the interpretation contended for by defendants is the correct one. Testator uses the same language in each instance \u2014 both with reference to the time of his own death and the time of the death of the life-tenant \u2014 -\u2018my surviving children or their heirs.\u2019 Literally the property is left \u2018to those of my children who survive me, or to the heirs of those of my children who survive me.\u2019 Obviously, the will does not mean that. Children who survive have no heirs or next of kin. Por the same reason it cannot mean that the division is to be among the surviving children <em>'and1 </em>the heirs or next of kin of the same surviving children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b855-13\">\u201cYor is the word \u2018heirs\u2019 used to indicate the quality of the estate given. The use of the word \u2018or\u2019 contra-indicates that. True, the word \u2018or\u2019 may be construed \u2018and,\u2019 where it is clear that such was the meaning of the testator; but that is not the case here. There is nothing to indicate any intent to prefer or to exclude; all four children were equally the possible recipient\u2019s of testator\u2019s bounty. He could not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>which would die and which would survive. Possibly all might die. In that event who would take under this will ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b856-5\">\u201cIt seems clear that testator meant that the distribution was to be among those children who survived and the \u2018heirs\u2019 o\u00ed any child who might have died, <em>per stirpes. </em>Part of the property is personalty. Under well-known rules of construction \u2018heirs,\u2019 as to personalty, means those who would take under the statute of distribution.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b856-6\"><em>Mr. Charles B. </em>Brady, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b856-7\"><em>Mr. Marshall </em>Miller, for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b856-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The decree appealed from will be affirmed, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed in the court below by Vice-Chancellor Buchanan.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chiee-Justice, Trenchard, Parker, .
