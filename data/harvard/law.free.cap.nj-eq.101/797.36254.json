The case was heard by Vice-Chancellor Eielder; he advised a decree dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill. One of the reasons stated by the learned vice-chancellor for such judicial action was: What the complainant really seeks is the performance of his wife\u2019s promise to convey. The complainant employed the scrivener to whom he and his wife stated their instructions, and, if the scriver misunderstood or failed to carry out their wishes, the conveyance was merely an abortive attempt to make complainant a promised gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">With this reason given by the vice-chancellor for the conclusion we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">The decree of the court of chancery dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill of complaint is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chiee-Justice, Tbehchard, Parker, Mihturn, Kalisoh, Black, Katzenbach, Campbell, Lloyd, White, Vaw Buskirk, McGlennon, Kays, Heteield, Dear, JJ. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
