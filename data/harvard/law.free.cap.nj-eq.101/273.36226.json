In some jurisdictions such agreements will not prevent appeal upon the theory that the jurisdiction of the appellate court depends upon the law and not upon the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">The general rule, however, is that a party may, by express agreement or stipulation before, trial, or judgment, waive his right to appeal, and such agreements or stipulations will be enforced by dismissal of the appeal taken out in violation thereof, or by refusing to pass upon questions covered by the waiver. The intention and agreement to waive the right of appeal must be clear and there must be a sufficient consideration. Such agreements are upheld upon the ground of public ' policy in encouraging litigants to accept as final decisions of courts of original jurisdiction. <em>3 Corp. Jur. 661 </em>\u00a7 <em>533.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">In the cause before us there can be no doubt of the intention, and as the promise or agreement was mutual there was sufficient consideration. <em>U. &amp; G. Rubber Co. </em>v. Conard, <em>80 N. J. Law 286.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
