He appeals his sentence under the sentencing guidelines. Because the district court improperly applied the guidelines to its factual findings, we reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Foster\u2019s constitutional challenge to the sentencing commission and sentencing guidelines is rejected. <em>U.S. v. Mistretta, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">Foster also challenges the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines. This Court will uphold the district court\u2019s sentence so long as it results from a correct application of the guidelines to factual findings which are not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(d); <em>U.S. v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>867 F.2d 216, 221 (5th Cir.1989); and <em>U.S. v. Sarasti, </em>869 F.2d 805, 806 (5th Cir.1989). Foster contests the two-level upward adjustment for the use of \u201ca special skill in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission ... of the offense\u201d under \u00a7 3B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">The district court found that Foster possessed a special skill that required substantial training in his knowledge of printing. In view of the testimony of Foster\u2019s employer that work with a printing press required a high level of technical skill, the finding is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">The guideline also requires, however, that the special skill be used in a manner that facilitated commission or concealment of the offense. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.3. Defendant maintains that he was charged with photographing federal reserve notes, not printing them, and that emphasis on printing skills \u2014 not necessary to photographing \u2014 was misplaced. Among the district court\u2019s conclusions were the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-16\">[I]t does in fact require substantial training in order to be able to produce a successful appearing currency of the United States.... [I]t takes four colors separated into negatives and when those four negatives are used to print they have got to be in perfect registration or you\u2019ll see it. I couldn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">R. 2, 27. There was no evidence that Foster possessed any special skill in photographing. The district court nevertheless increased the sentence for use of special skills required to print counterfeit notes, even though such skills were not used in concealment or commission of the offense to which Foster pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-18\">We note that the commentary to \u00a7 3B1.3 conflicts with the guideline on this point: the commentary would allow consideration of use of a special skill to facilitate the commission of \u201ca crime\u201d \u2014 not necessarily the offense charged. In accordance with the guideline, however, we will not uphold a two-point increase unless such a skill is used to facilitate commission or concealment of \u201cthe offense\u201d \u2014 the one charged in the indictment \u2014 and not any other crime or crimes that may have been revealed during pre-sentence investigation. We believe this interpretation is consistent with the policy statement by the commission that it abandoned efforts to devise a \u201creal offense\u201d system and has moved closer to a \u201ccharge offense\u201d system. Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 Policy Statement \u00a7 lA4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-19\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred because the printing skill was not used in connection with the offense charged. In view of our holding, Foster\u2019s second argument that the enhancement for use of the \u201cspecial skill\u201d was improper because the skill was encompassed in the \u201cspecific offense\u201d is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Because the district court incorrectly applied the guideline, the sentence of the district court is REVERSED and the matter is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
