J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aebg\">Appellant Southern Pacific Company was named defendant in an action brought by one Bambrough to recover damages for bodily injuries sustained in a grade crossing accident. The railroad cross-complained against respondent steel company, seeking indemnity under a 1947 written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">This agreement recites that respondent, called \u201clicensee,\u201d owns land adjoining the proposed crossing and desires a private road crossing of appellant licensor\u2019s tracks. The agreement permits respondent licensee to construct such a crossing, and requires it to \u201cmaintain and keep said crossing in good repair, \u2019 \u2019 and to keep it1 \u2018 and the flange ways thereof free and clear of all rubbish and debris.\u201d No assignment or transfer of the agreement is permitted, and licensee shall not permit its use \u201cby the public or by any person or persons except Licensee, [its] guests, tenants, employees and persons having business with Licensee, it being expressly understood and agreed that said crossing is a private one and is not intended for public use. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Paragraph 7 provides \u201cLicensee shall and hereby expressly agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Licensor . . . from and against any and all loss, damage, injury, cost and expense of every kind and nature, from any cause whatsoever, resulting directly or indirectly from the maintenance, presence or use of said crossing. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Upon answering the cross-complaint, respondent moved for summary judgment. The only supporting declaration set up the claim of Bambrough by quoting the charging allegations of his complaint, which are that appellant \u201cso negligently, recklessly and unlawfully controlled, managed, constructed, operated and maintained\u201d the crossing, and \u201cso negligently, recklessly and unlawfully drove, operated, controlled and maintained\u201d its engine as to cause the collision of an engine and a vehicle driven by Bambrough.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Over appellant\u2019s opposition the motion for summary judgment was granted, the cross-complaint dismissed, and judgment entered in favor of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">\u201cAn indemnity clause phrased in general terms will not be interpreted ... to provide indemnity for consequences resulting from the indemnitee\u2019s own actively negligent acts\u201d <em>(Markley </em>v. <em>Beagle, </em>66 Cal.2d 951, 962 [59 Cal.Rptr. 809, 429 P.2d 129]; <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Ecco-Phoenix Elec. Corp., </em>62 Cal. 2d 40 [41 Cal.Rptr. 73, 396 P.2d 377]; <em>Vinnell Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number><em>Elec. Ry. Co., 52 </em>Cal.2d 411 [340 P.2d 604]). The record before us, however, contains no assertion as to the cause of Bambrough\u2019s injury save his complaint. Under those allegations, Bambrough\u2019s proof may establish that appellant\u2019s operation of the train caused the collision, thus bringing into play the rule of construction urged by respondent. But it is equally conceivable that it may support only his charging allegation that the collision was caused by the construction and maintenance of the crossing, functions expressly undertaken by respondent and chargeable to it. In this state of the record, the drastic remedy of summary judgment is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We note, too, that what respondent refers to as \"magic words\u201d are not always necessary as the circumstances surrounding the execution of the indemnity agreement and the conduct of the parties in relation to it are admissible and may bear upon the question of construction. (See <em>Harvey Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Hatzel &amp; Buehler, Inc., </em>54 Cal.2d 445 [6 Cal.Rptr. 284, 353 P.2d 924].) Under recent decisions <em>(Delta Dynamics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arioto, </em>69 Cal.2d 525 [72 Cal.Rptr. 785, 446 P.2d 785]; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage &amp; Rigging Co., </em>69 Cal.2d 33 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641]; <em>Masterson </em>v. <em>Sine, </em>68 Cal.2d 222 [65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561]), evidence of the intent of the parties may be admissible in aid of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Brown (H. C.), J., and David, J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Retired judge of the superior court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
