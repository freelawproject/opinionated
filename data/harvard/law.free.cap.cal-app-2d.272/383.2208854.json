J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5O3\">Defendants were accused of violating section 11530 of the Health and Safety Code (unlawful possession of marijuana). Their motions to suppress evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a71538.5) and to dismiss the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7995) were granted by a minute order dated September 23, 1968. The People petitioned this court (2d Civ. 33804) for a writ of mandate compelling the superior court to vacate the order granting the motion to suppress evidence, and the People appealed (2d Grim. 15805) from the order suppressing evidence and from the order setting aside the information and dismissing the case. This court ordered that the hearing on the petition be deferred until the hearing of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Appellant-petitioner (People) contends that the seizure of marijuana was reasonable, and that the court erred in suppressing that evidence; and that the court erred in setting aside the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">At the preliminary examination, defendants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence was denied, and the magistrate found that there was reasonable cause to believe that defendants were guilty of violating section 11530 of the Health and Safety Code. The evidence at the preliminary examination may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">On July 20, 1968, about 2 or 3 a.m., Officers Vanderplas and Mercer were in uniform (California Highway Patrol) in a \u201cmarked\u201d police car on Woods Avenue near First Street in Bast Los Angeles. They saw a Chevrolet automobile traveling northbound on Woods Avenue \u201cwithout any lights at all on\u201d \u25a0\u2014the car was \u201centirely dark.\u201d The officers \u201cpulled in behind\u201d the Chevrolet and displayed the red lights on the police car. When the red lights came on, the driver (Vega) of the Chevrolet appeared to shuffle the upper portion of his body abnormally, as though he were grabbing something on the front seat. The Chevrolet turned right on First Street and stopped. Defendant Vega was driving the Chevrolet, and defendant Pitts was in the front seat next to him. Officer Vanderplas got out of the police car and ran, with a lighted flashlight, toward the Chevrolet. He saw defendant Vega make a \u201cfurtive movement\u201d by \u201cleaning over slightly to the right and forward\u201d and he saw defendant Pitts \u201cleaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>slightly to her left and bending forward.\u201d When he (officer) was next to the Chevrolet, he saw Vega pushing a white box under the front seat and Pitts putting a \u201cmetallic tin\u201d under the front seat by the box. At that time, the beam of the officer\u2019s flashlight was shining through a window of the Chevrolet. There were also fluorescent overhead street lights; and the headlights of the police ear, which was parked half a earlength behind the Chevrolet, were on \u201chigh beam.\u201d Vega got out of the Chevrolet at the officer\u2019s request and Pitts said that she was very ill and was on the way to the hospital. The officer \u201csecured\u201d Vega to the back of the Chevrolet and took the white box, which was protruding 2 or 3 inches, from under the front seat. The box contained cigarette wrapping papers and a brown leafy substance resembling marijuana. Defendants were arrested, and Officer Vanderplas searched the Chevrolet and found the tin can which Pitts had put under the front seat. (It is not clear from the record what, if anything, was in the can.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The officers did not have a warrant of arrest or a search warrant. It was stipulated that the contents of the box included marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The superior court heard the motion to suppress evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5) and the motion to set aside the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995) and granted the motions by a minute order dated September 23, 1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to an inquiry from the deputy district attorney after the decision was announced at the hearing of the motions, the judge said: \u201cI granted the 1538.5 first. Having done that, it left no evidence in this case on which the People could proceed. Therefore, I granted the 995. You can always appeal that order.\u201d As previously stated, the People petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus compelling the superior court to vacate the (portion of the) order of September 23, 1968, granting the motion to suppress evidence, and appealed from said order setting aside the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 338, 345 [76 Cal.Rptr. 712], filed April 1, 1969, the trial court, at the time it granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5), dismissed the case pursuant to defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995), \u201crather than dismissing the case on its own motion\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385). The People petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus compelling the trial court to vacate the order granting the motion to suppress, and the People appealed from the order granting both motions. It was held therein that the trial court \u201cacted in excess of its jurisdictions in dismissing the case on defendant\u2019s motion under section 995, Penal Code.\u201d The court reversed the portion of the order \u201cdismissing the case under section 995,\u201d considered the merits of the petition for writ of mandamus, and issued a writ of mandamus directing the superior court to vacate the order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. In the present case, the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in dismissing the ease pursuant to defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">With reference to the merits of the petition for a writ of mandamus herein, the petitioner (People) contends that the seizure of the marijuana was reasonable and that the court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion, under section 1538.5 of the Penal Code, to suppress evidence (marijuana). Section 1538.5 provides in part as follows: \u201c(a) A defendant may-move ... to suppress as evidence any tangible or intangible thing obtained as a result of a search or seizure on the ground that: (1) The search or seizure without a warrant was unreasonable ; . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>56 Cal.2d 864, 866 [17 Cal.Rptr. 495, 366 P.2d 823], it was said: \u201cA search without a warrant is proper where it is incident to a lawful arrest based on reasonable cause to believe that the accused has committed a felony. Such a search is not rendered unlawful merely because it precedes rather than follows the arrest. [Citations.] Reasonable or probable cause is shown if a man of ordinary care and prudence would be led to believe and conscientiously entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the accused is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanson, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 250 [319 P.2d 422], officers in a police car saw a Ford automobile with defective lights driving slowly on a street at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. The officers turned on the red lights of the police ear and \u201cpulled the other car over.\u201d At that time, one of the officers noticed that the two passengers (defendants) in the car \u201cappeared to be hiding something under the front seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>When the officers approached the car, the driver got out; and the officer opened a door of the car, and the defendants got out. The officer then \u201clooked under the seat to see what they had placed under there,\u201d and he found a bag which contained marijuana. The court noted (pp. 253-254) that the defective lights justified the officers in stopping the car; it was their duty to stop the car; it was proper to use the red lights as a signal to stop the ear; the defendants \u2019 movements after the red lights were turned on led the officers to believe that defendants were hiding something under the seat; defendants had not made any such movements before the red lights were turned on; and it was 3 o \u2019clock in the morning. It was held (p. 254) that \u201cthe marijuana was discovered as the result of a reasonable search based upon reasonable cause therefor.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. Blodgett, 46 Cal.2d 114 [293 P.2d 57]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wigginton, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 321 [62 Cal.Rptr. 104]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 618 [28 Cal.Rptr. 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In the present case, the officers saw the Chevrolet being driven at 2 or 3a.m. \u201cwithout any lights at all on\u201d; they turned on the red lights and pulled in behind the Chevrolet; the driver (Vega) of the Chevrolet, who had not made any bodily movements before the red lights were turned on, then shuffled the upper portion of his body and appeared to grab something on the front seat; when the Chevrolet stopped, and while one of the officers was approaching it with a lighted flashlight, defendant Vega made a \u201cfurtive movement\u201d by \u201cleaning over slightly to the right and forward,\u201d and defendant Pitts, who was sitting next to Vega on the front seat, leaned to the left and bent forward; when the officer reached the ear, and while he and his flashlight were outside the ear, he saw defendant Vega pushing the white box under the front seat, and he saw defendant Pitts putting the tin can under the front seat; Vega then got out of the car, and the officer reached into the car and picked up the white box, which was protruding about 2 or 3 inches from under the seat; and the box contained marijuana. The marijuana was obtained by a reasonable search based upon reasonable cause therefor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanson, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wigginton, supra; People v. Shapiro, supra.) </em>Respondent Vega\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argument that the illumination<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the beam of the officer's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>flashlight invaded Vega\u2019s privacy is without merit. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cacioppo, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 392, 396-398 [70 Cal.Rptr. 356].) The court erred in granting the motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The order dismissing the ease (part of minute order of September 23, 1968) is reversed. The appeal from the order granting defendants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence (part of minute order of September 23, 1968) is dismissed. Let a writ of mandamus issue directing the respondent superior court to vacate its order of September 23, 1968, granting each defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and make an order denying said motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Fourt, J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The petition of real party in interest and respondent Vega for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 25, 1969. Peters, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> The minute order states: \u201cEach. The cause is called for hearing on the defendants\u2019 motions under Sections 1538.5 and 995 of the Penal Code. It is stipulated that the Court may read the transcript of the preliminary hearing in connection with the motion under Section 1538.5 of the Penal Code. The motion is argued and granted. The motion under Section 995 of the Penal Code is argued and granted, and the cause is dismissed. Bail exonerated. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> Respondent Pitts has not made an appearance herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> As previously stated, illumination was also afforded by the street lights and by the \u201chigh beam\u201d headlights of the police car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
