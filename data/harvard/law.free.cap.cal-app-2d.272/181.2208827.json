Code, \u00a71237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">On December 26, 1966, two uniformed and armed Los <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Angeles City police officers, Jobe and Jenkins, were on duty, and at about 5:30 p.m., went to a hotel at 258 West Eighth Street in San Pedro. Officer Jobe had previously received information from a confidential informant that defendant had narcotics in his possession.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was known to be living at the hotel, in room 213. At the time he first saw the officers, defendant was in the hallway outside his room, some 60 feet away. He saw them walking up the stairs to the second floor. Defendant was then talking to the landlady at the hotel desk at the front of the hotel and on the second floor, some 15 feet from the stairs. When the officers arrived on the second floor, they observed defendant in the hallway, walking from the front of the hotel and from the area of the stairs leading from the first floor, toward his room. He was some 25 or 30 feet from the room. The door of room 213 was open and the officers were at the door, but had not entered. Persons other than defendant were observed by Officer Jobe in the hotel, and Jobe had walked past some of them in getting to room 213. As defendant approached, Jobe asked him if he was Robert Toulson, and he said he was. Defendant, in response to a question, stated that room 213 was his room. This conversation was had while all three persons, Jobe, Jenkins, and defendant, were in the hallway. Jobe asked defendant \u201c. . . if we [the officers] may come inside and talk to him.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cYes.\u201d All three entered the room. No statement of reason for the requested conversation had been made by Jobe before they entered the room. After the three men were inside the room, Jobe told defendant that he had information that defendant had narcotics, that he was selling narcotics, and that he might have some in his room. Defendant said this was not true. Jobe asked if he might search the room. Defendant said, \u201cYes, I want to tell you that I have some Darvon capsules in the room here, but I have a prescription for them.\u201d Jobe said, \u201c. . . if this was all the narcotics he had, that [he, Jobe] was not concerned with the Darvon capsules.\u201d Defendant then said, \u201cWell, go ahead and search,\u201d or \u201cThen you may go ahead and search. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>As Jobe then walked toward the dresser, defendant \"reached over on top of the dresser and grabbed this sandwich bag which was rolled up. He grabbed it in his right hand and put it down by his side.\u201d Defendant was asked what he had there, and he replied, \"... something someone had left in the room.\u201d Jobe said, \"Let me see it,\u201d and defendant handed it to him. Defendant was placed under arrest after he had handed the bag and its contents to Jobe. The wax sandwich bag was opened by Jobe and was seen to contain three hand-rolled cigarettes. Expert testimony established that the cigarettes contained marijuana. Zig-Zag cigarette papers were found in the pocket of defendant\u2019s trousers and in his dresser drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Defendant raises three contentions on this appeal: (1) the evidence failed to show knowledge by defendant of the narcotic nature of that which he possessed; (2) the commitment of defendant was illegal; (3) defendant should have been apprised of his constitutional rights concerning search and seizure before his consent to search could be deemed voluntary and effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">An amici curiae brief was also filed making the contention in behalf of defendant that \" [t]he search of appellant\u2019s room and the seizure of the marijuana were illegal and the judgment should be reversed because the United States and California Constitutions require that prior to any search without a warrant the officer must warn the suspect of his constitutional right to refuse permission for the search. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In answer to the first contention, it is well established that to justify a conviction of unlawful possession of marijuana, the prosecution must prove actual or constructive possession by defendant and knowledge of its presence and narcotic character. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 881 [46 Cal.Rptr. 415]<em>; People </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 647 [12 Cal.Rptr. 122]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 384 [11 Cal.Rptr. 834].) However, these essential facts may be proved by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences which may be drawn from such evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>257 Cal.App. 2d 843 [65 Cal.Rptr. 366] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schumacher, </em>256 Cal. App.2d 858 [64 Cal.Rptr. 494] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosales, </em>226 Cal. App.2d 588 [38 Cal.Rptr. 329].)  Defendant\u2019s conduct may be sufficient to show his knowing possession of a narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\"><em>(People </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 443 [33 Cal.Rptr. 811]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Baltazar, </em>159 Cal.App.2d 595 [323 P.2d 1062].)  Defendant\u2019s statement of his occupancy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the hotel room coupled with his conduct of grabbing the wax sandwich bag containing marijuana and attempting to conceal the bag from the officers are sufficient to show defendant\u2019s knowledgeable possession of contraband. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rightnour, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 663 [52 Cal.Rptr. <em>654]; People </em>v. <em>Trujillo, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 388 [6 Cal.Rptr. 535].)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Defendant\u2019s next contention, that his commitment was illegal, is without merit. The correlative issue raised by defendant and amici curiae of whether defendant must be apprised of his constitutional rights concerning search and seizure before consent to search is sought is not applicable, because under the facts there was no true search dependent on consent. Hence, it is not considered. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>65 Cal.2d 842, 846 [56 Cal.Rptr. 485, 423 P.2d 557].) Based on information received from a reliable informant, the officers went to defendant\u2019s hotel room. The door was open. Defendant was 25 to 30 feet away, down the hallway. He walked <em>away </em>from the stairs leading to the floor below. He was under no conceivable compulsion to confront the officers. Defendant, by his own choice, approached the officers, admitted his identity, admitted that he was the occupant of the room, and consented to the officers\u2019 entry. To hold that such action is not free and voluntary would effectively hold that officers in uniform could not interview without formalized legal warnings when persons approach them  Whether consent to enter was given voluntarily or in acquiescence to implied assertion of authority is ordinarily a factual determination to be made by the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>45 Cal.2d 751, 753 [290 P.2d 852]: \"Whether in a particular case an apparent consent was in fact voluntarily given or was in submission to an express or implied assertion of authority, is a question of fact to be determined in the light of all the circumstances.\u201d See also <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>59 Cal.2d 439, 442 [30 Cal.Rptr. 1, 380 P.2d <em>641]; People </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 648, 652 [76 Cal.Rptr. 17]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Linke, 265 </em>Cal.App.2d 297, 311-312 [71 Cal.Rptr. 371].)  We cannot conceive, under the circumstances here existent, any reasonable question as to the lawfulness of the officers\u2019 entry, or that permission to do so was not voluntarily given. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>210 Cal.App.2d 489, 498 [26 Cal.Rptr. 677]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>188 Cal.App.2d 606, 609 [10 Cal.Rptr. 604]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>166 Cal.App.2d 638, 651 [334 P.2d 105].) We concur in the trial court\u2019s conclusion.  In any event, <em>\u201cWhere </em>substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>supports a preliminary finding by the trial court and the implied ultimate finding . . . that a voluntary consent has been given, a reviewing court must accept consent freely given as a fact proven.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bilderbach, </em>62 Cal.2d 757, 762-763 [44 Cal.Rptr. 313, 401 P.2d 921]<em>; People </em>v. <em>Linke, supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d 297 at p. <em>311; People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>246 Cal.App. 2d 715, 727 [55 Cal.Rptr. 62]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>191 Cal. App.2d 296, 300 [12 Cal.Rptr. 748].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Following defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cWell, go ahead and search,\u201d and as the officer approached a dresser, defendant grabbed the wax sandwich bag and held it down by his side. This conduct provided the officers with adequate probable cause to arrest defendant, in light of the reliable informant\u2019s assertions of narcotics aetivMy. The totality of the record justifies the conclusion (obviously reached by the trial court) that the officer, with 19 years of police experience, and in the process of investigating a narcotics complaint, had reason to suspect that defendant was then in possession of narcotics.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s attempt to surreptitiously conceal the wax bag constitituted furtive conduct, which is reasonably taken into consideration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reyes, </em>206 Cal.App.2d 337 [23 Cal.Rptr. 705]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>162 Cal.App.2d 836 [328 P.2d 823]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 803 [320 P.2d 128].) The officers\u2019 preliminary request to see the sandwich bag, readily acceded to by defendant prior to his arrest, does not vitiate the legality of his arrest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pettyjohn, </em>172 Cal.App.2d 188 [342 P.2d 416].) The wax bag was in plain and open view, and it is well established that officers need not blind themselves to that which is clearly observable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>69 Cal.2d 51, 56 [69 Cal.Rptr. 585, 442 P.2d 665]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>47 Cal.2d 374, 379 [303 P.2d 721]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 687, 689 [68 Cal.Rptr. 281].) This was not a search. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>161 Cal.App.2d 302, 305 [326 P.2d 646]; <em>People </em>v. <em>West, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 214, 219 [300 P.2d 729].) Probable cause to arrest defendant existed prior to the officer\u2019s examination of the contents of the wax bag. The discovery and seizure of the marijuana violated no rights of defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 214, 222 [45 Cal.Rptr. 297].) As was said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Michael, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 751, 754: \u201c. . . to hold as a matter of law that the evidence was produced in response to an unlawful assertion of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>would seriously hamper officers in the reasonable performance of their duties. Thus, it is not unreasonable for officers to seek interviews with suspects or witnesses or to call upon them at their homes for such purposes. Such inquiries, although courteously made and not accompanied with any assertion of a right to enter or search or secure answers, would permit the criminal to defeat his prosecution by voluntarily revealing all of the evidence against him and then contending that he acted only in response to an implied assertion of unlawful authority. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Peppy, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-15\"> Facts most favorable to the prosecution are necessarily set forth. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>13 Cal.2d 37, 42 [87 P.2d 821].) There is a conflict in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the evidence as to whether the officers entered the room of defendant before he spoke to them or not. We adopt, as did the trial court, the version that they entered after requesting permission to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> Though the officer laid such foundation as to justify the conclusion that the information was reliable, cross-examination as to that issue was not permitted by the judge presiding at the preliminary hearing. Since no error is claimed due to this curtailment of inquiry, we accept the officer\u2019s statement that such informant was reliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> The question of the officer\u2019s conclusion at the time of the ineffectual concealment of the narcotic was not asked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b209-8\">AISO, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3t\">\u2014I respectfully dissent. The People seek to justify an entry, a search, a seizure, and an arrest\u2014all without a search or arrest warrant\u2014and the ensuing conviction upon the theory that defendant consented to the entry, search, and seizure and thereby waived his Fourth Amendment rights. The record, in my opinion, fails to reflect the type of inquiry, required by minimal due process, as to whether defendant\u2019s apparent consent was in fact and in law freely and intelligently given. Nor does the record show that the People have sustained their burden in proving a justification for proceeding without a warrant in this case. The majority opinion, furthermore, sets forth no reason why in arriving at the disposition it reaches, it need not consider whether a defendant must be first advised of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, in the manner now required under the Fifth (right against self-incrimination) and the Sixth (right to counsel) Amendments, before an effective consent may be found.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Since we deal with a federal constitutional question <em>(Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S.Ct. 1684, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>84 A.L.R.2d 933]), which necessitates a review of a constitutional fact upon the entire record (see, e.g., <em>Jacobollis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 184, 187-190 [12 L.Ed.2d 793, 797-799, 84 S.Ct. 1676]; Z<em>eitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 901, 909-910 [31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, 10 A.L.R.3d 707]) for reasons which will be discussed more fully later, a summary of the evidence is set forth rather than facts interpreted in favor of the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The evidence consisted only of the transcript of the preliminary examination, the exhibits received at that hearing, and defendant\u2019s brief testimony at trial controverting only that part of the officer\u2019s testimony that defendant had reached the door way of his room when the officers entered. He testified that he was still 60 feet away. He also testified that the officers were in unif orm and armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Officer Jobe was the People\u2019s sole witness, who testified at the preliminary hearing but not at the trial. His testimony was as follows: He was a \u20181 Police Officer for the City of Los Angeles, assigned to Harbor Division,\" on December 26, 1966. Upon receiving information from a confidential informant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that \u201cdefendant had in his possession narcotics,\" he went to defendant\u2019s room, No. 213, in a hotel located at 528 West 8th Street,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the County of Los Angeles, about 5 :30 p.m. on December 26,1966. He was in -uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Jobe and his partner officer, Jenkins, walked up the stairway to the second floor. He observed defendant in the hallway about 25 or 30 feet away, walking from the front of the hotel towards his room. He and his partner were standing at the doorway of defendant\u2019s room, which was open, when he first observed defendant. Neither he nor his partner entered defendant\u2019s room before defendant had reached it.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Upon seeing defendant, Jobe asked, \u201cif he was Robert Toulson and he said that he was.\" Jobe asked him if the room was his. By then \u201cwe were at the doorway to room 213 and the doorway was open.\" Defendant replied that it was. Jobe asked defendant \u201cif we [Jobe and partner officer] may come inside and talk to him\" or \u201cif we might step into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>room and he said, \u2018Yes, you may\u2019 \u201d or \u201cYes.\u201d There were other people in the hallway but not close enough to hear their conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On cross-examination, he was asked, \u201cQ. You did not then advise him why you wanted to talk to him?\u201d His answer was: <em>\u201cNol until I got inside.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Asked, \u201cDid you tell the defendant why you wanted to enter his room?\u201d he replied, <em>\u201cNot before I entered, no.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) \u201cWe stepped inside the room and I informed him that I had received information that he had narcotics in his possession, also that my information was that there was narcotics in the room. I asked him if this was true and he said no. \u2019 \u2019 On cross-examination he was asked, \u201cAfter you were inside, what was it that you said to him?\u201d Jobe replied, \u201cI told him that I had information that he had narcotics, that he was selling narcotics and that he might have some in his room. I asked him if this was true. . . . He said that it wasn\u2019t. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Then Jobe said, \u201cWould you mind if we looked over your room? [ ]T ] He said, <em>\u2018Well, no, </em>I don\u2019t mind, but first of all I would like to tell you that I have some pills here which are Darvon and these I have from a prescription. \u2019[]]\"] I told him that I wasn\u2019t concerned with the Darvon pills and he said, \u2018Then you may go ahead and search.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) On cross-examination his testimony was: \u2018 \u2018 Then I asked him if I might search the room. . . . He said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 but first he said, \u2018I want to tell you that I have some Darvon capsules in the room here, but that I have a prescription for them. \u2019 . . . After he told me that he had these capsules, I told him that if this was all the narcotics that he had, that I was not concerned with the Darvon capsules. . . . Then he says, <em>\u2018Well, </em>go ahead and search. \u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">On direct examination by the prosecutor, Jobe testified as to the next incident as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">Q. Did anything happen <em>before you started to search the room\u00ed </em>[Italics added.] A. Yes. Q. Would you tell us what that was? A. The defendant reached on top of the dresser and grabbed a wax bag which was laying <em>[sic] </em>on top of the dresser. I asked him, I said, \u2018What is that there?\u2019 He said, \u2018H must have been something somebody left in the room. \u2019 So 1 saj^s, \u00cdLet\u2019s see it,\u2019 and he handed it to me. I opened the wax bag and there were three hand-rolled.cigarettes inside the wax bag. ,Q. Was-this before-or after you asked his permission to search his room? A. This was after. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">On cross-examination the testimony in this particular was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>Then he says, \u2018Well, go ahead and search.\u2019 Q. And then what happened ? A. Then as I walked toward the dresser he reached over on top of the dresser and grabbed this sandwich bag which was rolled up. . . . Q. What then did you do ? A. I asked him what he had there. Q. To which he responded what? A. He said something someone had left in the room. Q. Then what happened? A. I said, \u2018Let me see it,\u2019 and he handed it to me. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The officer also found a package of <em>Zig-Zag </em>cigarette papers in defendant\u2019s right front trouser pocket, and another package in the top drawer of the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The following testimony, objection, and ruling of the magistrate on cross-examination is also recorded: \u201c Q. [By Defense Counsel] In addition to the wax-paper bag, did you discover anything else of a narcotic nature ? A. Yes, I did. Q. What ? A. In a traveling ease which was in the little washroom and closet area there, there were several marijuana seeds in the bottom of this traveling bag. Q. How long have you been on the narcotic cases, Officer ? A. I have been a Policeman for nineteen and a half years. I would say about, perhaps, nineteen years. Q. Have you any degree in Chemistry or Horticulture ? A. No, I do not. [Defense Counsel] : I move that the witness\u2019 testimony on marijuana seeds be stricken as being a conclusion and being uncalled for. The Court : It may go out. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Jobe arrested<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defendant \u201cafter [he] received the wax-paper bag from the defendant.\u201d He did not have either a search or arrest warrant. Defendant did not ask whether he had a search warrant. Defendant was \u201ctransported ... to Harbor Station where he was arrested\u201d and the evidence (sandwich bag and contents and cigarette papers) \u201cwere booked as evidence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">In addition to Officer Jobe\u2019s testimony, it was stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that a qualified forensic chemist be deemed to have been called and have testified that in his opinion the three hand-rolled cigarettes contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The threshold and pivotal question is whether defendant freely and intelligently consented to the officers\u2019 entering his room. Unless the entry be established by the People as having been lawful, then subsequent actions of the police remain unjustified. If the entry was illegal, then what transpired in quick succession thereafter bears the taint of that illegality. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 629, 632 [68 Cal.Rptr. 441, 440 P.2d 921]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 713, 718 [31 Cal.Rptr. 47, 381 P.2d 927]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Kanos </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 381 [74 Cal.Rptr. 902, 450 P.2d 278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Upon the basis of persuasive judicial precedents and of well established rules of law in the area of searches and seizures, it is my opinion that the record fails to establish a valid consent to the officers\u2019 entry into defendant\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Where an entry, a search and seizure, or an arrest is effected sans warrant, the burden is on the People to show a proper justification. <em>(Badillo </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 269, 272 [294 P.2d 23]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 842, 845 [56 Cal.Rptr. 485, 423 P.2d 557]<em>; Tompkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 65, 67 [27 Cal.Rptr. 889, 378 P.2d 113].) The rule applies where the claimed justification is consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 629, 632; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 737, 746 [312 P.2d 665].)

Just as a trial court\u2019s finding that a confession was freely and voluntarily made is not binding upon an appellate court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 562, 571 [75 Cal.Rptr. 642, 451 P.2d 74], so a finding that a consent was freely and voluntarily given should be open to an independent review by an appellate court upon the entire record, including the evidence in the case. At least, it is not binding upon a federal court on collateral review. <em>(Oliver </em>v. <em>Bowens </em>(9th Cir. 1967) <em>supra, </em>386 F.2d 688, 690.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Some courts have stated that the issue on appellate review is not a question of credibility of witnesses, but rather whether the police officer\u2019s testimony \u201ctaken at full value, warrants a finding that [defendant] freely and intelligently gave his unequivocal and specific consent to the search\u201d <em>(Channel </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1960) 285 F.2d 217, 220).

The facts as stated at pp. 819-820 are: \u201c [A] police sergeant testified: <em>\u2018I </em>identified myself to [defendant] as a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>officer and asked him if I could talk to him in his room. . . .

He stated that I could, was perfectly welcome to look anywhere in his room that I wanted to.\u2019 Another policeman gave similar testimony. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948) 333 U.S. 10 [92 L.Ed. 436, 68 S.Ct. 367], a Seattle detective lieutenant and four veteran federal narcotic agents went to a hotel upon the basis of information received from a confidential informant that unknown persons were smoking opium at the hotel. On their arrival, they recognized a distinctive and unmistakable odor of burning opium coming from Room 1. They did not know who occupied that room. \u201cThey knocked and a voice inside asked who was there. 1 Lieutenant Belland, \u2019 was the reply. There was a slight delay, some \u2018shuffling or noise\u2019 in the room and then the defendant opened the door. The officer said, \u2018I want to talk to you a little bit.\u2019 She then, as he describes it, \u2018stepped back acquiescently and admitted us.\u2019 He said, \u2018I want to talk to you about this opium smell in the room here. \u2019 She denied that there was such a smell. Then he said, \u2018I want you to consider yourself under arrest because we are going to search the room. \u2019 The search turned up incriminating opium and smoking apparatus, the latter being warm, apparently from recent use. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The court held: \u201cEntry to defendant\u2019s living quarters, <em>which was the beginning of the search, </em>was demanded under color of office. It was granted in submission to authority rather than as an understanding and intentional waiver of a constitutional right.\u201d (333 U.S. at p. 13 [92 L.Ed. at p. 440].) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">A result similar to those reached in <em>Higgins </em>and <em>Johnson </em>should also be reached in this case by the application of recognized principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Even if the officers had reasonable and probable cause to believe that defendant had narcotics in his room, an entry or a search of his room without a warrant could be justified only as an incident to a lawful arrest or pursuant to a valid consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1967) <em>supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 842, 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 740, 746 [36 Cal.Rptr. 433, 388 P.2d 665], our Supreme Court speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>through Chief Justice Traynor stated: \u201cThe right to seek interviews with suspects at their homes [citations] does not include the right to demand that a suspect open his door. A suspect has no duty to cooperate with officers in securing evidence against him, and in the absence of probable cause to make an arrest, he is entitled to have a magistrate determine whether there is justification for invading the privacy of his home. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 717, the court held it improper for an officer to gain entry by pushing further open a door already open about 2 inches and entering before the defendant or his wife could object. The court stated, \u201cThe right to seek interviews with suspects or witnesses at their homes does not include the right to walk in uninvited merely because there is no response to a knock or a ring.\u201d The police may not induce the opening of a door by ruse or subterfuge <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reeves </em>(1964) <em>supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 268, 273) or by wrongful assertion of authority <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edgar </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 171, 174 [32 Cal.Rptr. 41, 383 P.2d 449]).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently has stated in <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 543, 548 [20 L.Ed.2d 797, 802, 88 S.Ct. 1788]: \u201cWhen a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact freely and voluntarily given. This burden cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In <em>Schoepflin </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1968) 391 F.2d 390, 398-399 the court held a purported consent to entry and search of one\u2019s apartment could not be upheld in the absence of a trial court finding that the words of apparent consent in the circumstances in which they were used \u201creflected (1) an understanding, (2) uncoereed, and (3) unequivocal election to grant the officers a license which (4) [defendant] knew may be freely and effectively withheld. \u2019 \u2019 The court held that no such showing had been made under the following circumstances : A robbery suspect was in bed reading a paper. Three officers went to his front door and three to the back. \u201cAn officer rang the front door bell. [Defendant] appeared at the door in his bathrobe. The officer in charge identified himself and asked if they could come in and talk to him. [Defendant] replied: \u201c \u2018Yes, come ahead.\u2019 The three officers who had gone to the front door then entered the apartment.\u201d Once entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>was gained, the officer in charge explained that they were investigating a bank robbery and a stolen gun. Defendant denied involvement. \u2018 \u2018 After four or five minutes of questioning, the officer in charg\u00e9 asked \u2018if we may search the apartment or the house. . . .\u2019 [Defendant] replied, \u2018Go ahead, I have nothing to hide. \u2019 \u201d A search revealed stolen money, a nylon stocking, and other articles related to the robbery being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In the instant case, the assent to entry was in response to a request by two armed officers in uniform standing at defendant\u2019s open doorway, with the defendant on the outside. These circumstances alone make the purported consent to entry suspect. In <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 260, 268, 269 [57 Cal.Rptr. 623, 425 P.2d 223], our Supreme Court speaking through Justice Tobriner has stated: \u201cWith increasing frequency the courts have denied the efficacy of any consent to a search obtained by covert threats of official sanction or by implied assertions of superior authority. <em>The courts have been quick to note the disparity of position between a government agent and an ordinary citizen. . . . </em>\u2018The Government must show a consent that is \u201cunequivocal and specific\u201d [Citation], \u201cfreely and intelligently given.\u201d [Citation.] Thus \u201cinvitations\u201d to enter one\u2019s house, extended to armed officers of the law who demand entrance, are usually to be considered as invitations secured by force. [Citation.] A like view has been taken where an officer displays his badge and declares that he has come to make a search [citation], even where the householder replies, \u201cAll Eight.\u201d [Citation.] . . . Intimidation and duress are almost necessarily implicit in such situations; if the Government alleges their absence, it has the burden of convincing the court that they are in fact absent.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ransome </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 140, 144 [4 Cal.Rptr. 347]<em>; People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 887, 893 [3 Cal.Rptr. 465]; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Bowens </em>(9th Cir. 1967) <em>supra, </em>386 F.2d 688, 691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Furthermore, the record is completely silent about the defendant\u2019s background or experience. He apparently did not even know enough to ask the officers if they had a warrant. There is nothing to show that defendant knew he had the right to refuse entry to the officers and that such refusal could not be used as affirmative evidence against him. (Cf. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 65, 68 [slamming of a door on an officer seeking entry cannot be used to convert suspicion into probable cause to arrest] ; <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Cedeno </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 213, 227-229 [32 Cal.Rptr. 246].) Defendant in our case was approaching the open doorway to get back into his room with the two officers standing just outside that open doorway; not much choice was open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">I am aware that some eases have stated, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Chaddock </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 483, 485-486 [57 Cal.Rptr. 582], that \u201c [t]he mere asking of permission to enter and make a search carries with it the implication that the person can withhold permission for such an entry or search. \u2019 \u2019 This is not an invariable implication and cannot be so implied absent other evidence of the surrounding circumstances, e.g., the age, physical size, experience, and background of the person asked to consent. It is a common practice for a superior to use language sounding in terms of a polite request, when he actually intends it to b\u00e9 and it is so interpreted by the requestee, that an imperative is meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Furthermore, in this ease the officers went through the formality of seeking defendant\u2019s consent to their entry into defendant\u2019s room knowing that he did not have full knowledge of the facts. It was not police ingenuousness or inadvertence that when Officer Jobe asked defendant, \u201cif we may come inside and talk to him\u201d he did not tell him why they wanted to talk to him or why they wanted to enter his room.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>a By the officer\u2019s own testimony, there were other people in the hallway but not close enough to hear their conversation. So the element of avoiding any embarrassment to defendant by having the conversation overheard was absent. On cross-examination, Jobe was asked, \u201cDid you tell the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>why you wanted to enter his room?\u201d He replied, \u201cNot before I entered, no.\u201d Following the officer\u2019s testimony, \u201cI asked if we might come inside and talk to him and he said yes,\u201d he was asked: \u201cYou did not then advise him why you wanted to talk to him?\u201d His answer was, \u201cNot until I got inside.\u201d The factors to be considered in consenting to an entry for purposes of a general exploratory talk and for purposes of a specific accusation that defendant has narcotics in the very room to which the officer is seeking to gain entrance are materially different, to put it mildly.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u201cThere can be no waiver where the one against whom it is asserted has acted without full knowledge of the facts. It cannot be presumed, in the absence of such knowledge, that there was an intention to waive an existing right.\u201d <em>(Hacker Pipe </em>&amp; <em>Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Chapman Valve Mfg. Co. </em>(1936) 17 Cal.App.2d 265, 274 [61 P.2d 944].) In fact, in this case, the consent to enter was obtained by \u201cfraud.\u201d A consent obtained by half-truths or silence knowing that the consent is being given under mistake, fraud, or duress is invalid. (See Prosser on Torts (3d ed. 1964) pp. 100, 711, 712.) \u201cThe \u2018fraud\u2019 usually said to be involved in such a case may be simply the advantage taken of the [consenting party\u2019s] ignorance to injure him.\u201d (Prosser, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 106.) It requires no sophistication to gather from the record in this case that the real purpose of the officers was to get inside defendant\u2019s room to observe or search, rather than to talk to him. They sought to accomplish their objective in this unwarranted manner even though they could have obtained a search warrant quite easily. The indications from the officer\u2019s testimony that they had information from a reliable informant, suggest it would have sufficed to obtain a search warrant. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca (1965) 380 </em>U.S. 102, 109 [13 L.Ed.2d 684, 689, 85 S.Ct. 741]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallardo </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 105 [52 Cal.Rptr. 777].) There is no showing that this information was received after the courts had closed for the day. They arrived at the hotel around 5 :30 p.m. There was no consent, freely and intelligently given, to enter the defendant\u2019s room. And to so hold where the securing of a warrant was feasible is not to hamstring law enforcement. An analogous situation was presented in <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 719-720. It was there held that where the real object of the officers for entering upon premises is search and not arrest, the arrest may not be used as a pretext to search for evidence; the search conducted under such circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>stances is not reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Having gained entry by an invalid consent, the subsequent consent to a search even if freely and voluntarily given would have been the product of an illegal entry. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1967) <em>supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 842, 846; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 718.) The movements of the defendant to hide three hand-rolled cigarettes cannot be used as furtive movements corroborating the informant\u2019s information. \u201cWhen officers seek to justify a seizure without a warrant on the ground that no search was involved, the objects so seized must have been \u2018in plain view of the officer <em>who has a right to be in the position to have that view </em>. . .\u2019 and must have been \u2018fully disclosed and open to the eye and hand.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 51, 57-58 [69 Cal.Rptr. 585, 442 P.2d 665].) Here the officer did not acquire the right to be standing in defendant\u2019s room to make a view of that movement. Nor did he see any hand rolled cigarettes until he had demanded that defendant hand over the wax-paper bag which defendant was at that juncture holding at his side. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hodson </em>(1964) 225 Cal. App.2d 554, 558 [37 Cal.Rptr. 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Even if we assume arguendo that the consent to entry was valid, the purported consent to search defendant\u2019s room was not free and voluntary. There was hesitation in defendant\u2019s reply. Note his use of \u201cwell\u201d in his replies. Immediately after giving that hesitant verbal assent, but before the officers had commenced the search, defendant went to his dresser and grabbed a wax-paper sandwich bag on top of it. \u201c [C] on duct on the part of a defendant subsequent to his giving an apparent consent to a search may establish that the apparent consent was not voluntarily given.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 345, 351 [38 Cal.Rptr. 670].) The action negates free and intelligent conferring of a privilege. Under such circumstances, there was no free and voluntary consent to search the room. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Shelton </em>(1964) <em>supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 740, 745; <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 439, 443; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 720; <em>People </em>v. <em>Escollias </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 16, 18 [70 Cal.Rptr. 65], opinion of Stephens, J.) Nor could the search and seizure be justified otherwise as being incidental to a lawful arrest on reasonable and probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">When the police have grounds and opportunity to obtain a search warrant, but choose to travel the alternate route of consent, they assume the risk of their investigative endeavors being rendered nugatory. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Currier </em>(1965) <em>supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 103, 111.) They assume a quasi-judicial task of themselves deciding at the scene and in course of investigation whether they have obtained a valid consent. \u201c [T]he officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\u201d in making a split-second decision is bound to make more errors than a 11 neutral and detached magistrate\u201d passing upon an application for a warrant. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1968) <em>supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 51, 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In justifying a consent in a judicial proceeding the People have the burden of putting on record sufficient facts of the surrounding circumstances from which it may be determined that an apparent consent was in fact and in law freely and intelligently given. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gorg </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 776, 782 [291 P.2d 469].) The record in this case does not reflect a fulfillment of this burden. Without such requirement there can be no judicial safeguards against invalid consents. Nor can the possibility that the informant placed the three hand-rolled cigarettes on the dresser be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Reaching the conclusion set forth above, it is unnecessary to determine whether an admonition of one\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment must be given before any consent or waiver of such rights may be found.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1967) <em>supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 842, 846.)

This objection was preserved in his stipulation to the use of the transcript of the preliminary hearing at trial. He also renewed this objection on his motion to set aside the information (Pen. Code, \u00a7 995) with the further elaboration that there can be no valid consent without one being apprised of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Upon denial of his motion, defendant applied for a writ of prohibition (Pen. Code, \u00a7 999a). The appellate court dismissed his petition because of procedural error without reaching the merits. He renewed his objections at trial, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blalock </em>(E.D.Pa. 1966) 255 F.Supp. 268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> He had used the informant on two prior occasions.

(Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.) Noticeably absent from the record is the significance of the three hand-rolled cigarettes to the arresting officer. \"The significance to the deputy of what he observed, the factors he considered in forming his belief, and Ms state of mind relative thereto and his opinion formed thereon are all elements relevant and necessary to the issue of probable cause.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Duarte </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 25, 30 [61 Cal.Rptr. 690], cert. denied, 390 U.S. 971 [19 L.Ed.2d 1181, 88 S.Ct. 1091].) Insufficiency of the evidence in this regal'd was not raised either at the preliminary hearing or at the trial. Hence, this defect cannot be raised on appeal. (See Within, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) pp. 61-62 and 63-64, and cases cited.)
