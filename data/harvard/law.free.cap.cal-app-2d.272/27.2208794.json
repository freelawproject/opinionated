Appellants have been separately charged with unrelated violations of Vehicle Code section 23102 (drunk driving); no prior convictions were alleged in either complaint, although each appellant had previously suffered a conviction for drunk driving. Each moved in the municipal court to strike his prior conviction on the ground that it depended on a guilty plea made without counsel, in violation of the United States Constitution. The motions were denied and appellants jointly petitioned the superior court for mandamus directing the municipal court to hear the motions to strike; their cases are not otherwise related. In denying their petition, the superior court upheld the municipal judge\u2019s determination that he had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of prior convictions not charged in the complaints before him. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Section 23102, subdivision (a), of the Vehicle Code makes a first offense of drunk driving punishable by fine or imprisonment. A person convicted under this section for a second time within seven years is subject to a mandatory term in jail. Section 13209 of the Vehicle Code provides that the court \u201cshall obtain\u2019\u2019 a defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions from the Department of Motor Vehicles before sentencing upon a conviction of section 23102. The statute further provides that the Department of Motor Vehicles \u201cshall furnish\u201d such a record to the court upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In addition to any court-imposed punishment, the Department of Motor Vehicles is required to suspend or revoke driving privileges of a defendant for six months upon his.first conviction of drunk driving unless the trial court recommends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to the contrary, for one year upon a second conviction of drunk driving within seven years, and for three years upon a third conviction of drunk driving within ten years (Veh. Code, \u00a7 13352).  The Department of Motor Vehicles may suspend or revoke a license where it has a record of the prior convictions, even though the prior convictions are not charged and are not proven in the trial court. <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Bright </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 98 [25 Cal.Rptr. 116].)  However, the department may not suspend or revoke a license where the trial court has held that the prior convictions upon which suspension or revocation would be based are invalid; the department thus may not make an independent determination of the validity of the prior convictions. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Orr </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 813 [74 Cal.Rptr. 407].)  Appellants claim that they will be deprived of any opportunity to attack the validity of their prior convictions, unless the municipal court is directed to hear their motions to strike. Hence they contend, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Ratner </em>(1944) 67 Cal. App.2d Supp. 902 [153 P.2d 790], and 39 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 13, that the prosecutor should be required to charge in the complaint all known prior convictions of drunk driving. They further contend that a motion to strike the prior conviction before trial is the only proper means to attack the validity of that conviction (citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffey </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 204 [60 Cal.Rptr. 457, 430 P.2d 15]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pineda, </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 443 [62 Cal.Rptr. 144], cert. den., 390 U.S. 984 [19 L.Ed.2d 1284, 88 S.Ct. 1108]).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The prosecutor is not generally subject to judicial supervision in determining what charges to bring and how to draft accusatory pleadings.  It is not necessary to hold that he acts under supervision in alleging prior convictions ; under conventional procedure appellants will be able to test the priors even though they were not charged. Consistent with the court\u2019s duty under Vehicle Code section 13209 to obtain the departmental record before pronouncing judgment, a challenge to the validity of a prior conviction under section 23102 may be offered at the arraignment for judgment; the defendant must then be asked \u201cwhether he has any legal cause to show why judgment should not be pronounced against him.\u2019\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1200.)  Although this procedure of allocution has been abolished in many states, it has been retained in California (Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7607; see Hunt, Municipal Court Judges\u2019 Handbook (1960) pp. 13-14, 33-34) ; the right of allocution exists in the municipal as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>as the superior courts (Pen. Code, \u00a7 690; Hunt, <em>op.cit. supra, </em>at pp. 33-34). Only if the defendant fails to show legal cause why judgment should not be pronounced at this time may the court render judgment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202).  Judgment must ordinarily be pronounced within five days of a plea, finding, or verdict of guilty in the municipal court (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1449). But such time does not commence to run, and judgment may not be pronounced after a conviction for violation of section 23102, until the trial judge obtains the defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions from the Department of Motor Vehicles (Veh. Code, \u00a7 13209). At this point the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, even if not pleaded, will be before the trial judge. In reply to the question whether defendant can show legal cause why judgment should not be pronounced he can raise the question of the prior convictions\u2019 validity. As with a motion for a new trial or a motion in arrest of judgment, the trial court may then set a hearing to determine the validity of the prior; the time for pronouncing judgment maybe extended for this purpose (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1449).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Appellants argue that they are entitled to a pretrial determination of the validity of their prior convictions on the strength of the language in the <em>Coffey </em>and <em>Pineda </em>cases to the effect that the courts must provide an opportunity to challenge the validity of prior convictions at the \u20181 earliest possible opportunity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffey, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 204, 215.) However, the Supreme Court in <em>Coffey </em>stated that this principle was to apply only where the issue was \u201cproperly raised at or prior to trial\u201d and in the \u201cinterest of efficient judicial administration.\u201d In <em>Coffey </em>and the cases following it (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pineda, supra, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 443), prior convictions were charged in the complaint and therefore properly at issue before trial; this is not true in appellants\u2019 cases. It would also not be in the interests of judicial efficiency to require a pretrial determination of the validity of appellants \u2019 prior convictions when the statute would still require the municipal court to defer pronouncing judgment until a report has been received from the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">There is no danger, as appellants contend, that they will be denied an opportunity to challenge the validity of priors which have not been charged. At the time of arraignment for judgment the fact-finding and guilt-determination functions of the trial court will be at an end; the court\u2019s jurisdiction will not be limited by the content of the complaint (see <em>Rupley </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1953) 120 Cal.App.2d 548 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>[261 P.2d 318]) but will include consideration of defendants\u2019 prior convictions, whether charged or not (Veh. Code, \u00a7 13209). The jurisdictional difficulty now faced by appellants in the municipal court will thus be eliminated. There will also be no need to take separate action against the Department of Motor Vehicles; if the municipal court finds the prior to be invalid before pronouncing judgment, the department may not on the basis of that prior suspend or revoke a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Devine, P.
