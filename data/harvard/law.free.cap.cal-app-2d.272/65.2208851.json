On an order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, judgment was entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor and against defendants for $7,469.09, which included interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants appealed from the judgment which was affirmed by this court. <em>(American City Bank </em>v. <em>Zetlen, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 548 [61 Cal.Rptr. 311].) Thereafter defendants\u2019 petition for hearing was denied by the Supreme Court of California and on October 16, 1967, remittitur was filed in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Fifteen days after the judgment became final plaintiff filed Notice of Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees together with Declaration of Gerald Lipsky<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Memorandum of Points and Authorities. By its motion plaintiff sought an order of the superior court requiring defendants to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by it on defendants\u2019 appeal \u201con the ground that the agreement of the parties, on which the complaint and judgment are based, provides for the recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees by plaintiff; and on the ground that $1,500.00 is a reasonable sum.\u201d The motion was denied, not on the merits but because \u201cthe superior court has no jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, after appeal, without direction or authority from the Appellate Court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The record on appeal from the judgment <em>(American City Bank </em>v. <em>Zetlen, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 548 [61 Cal.Rptr. 311]) reflects no request by plaintiff for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal and no provision therefor made by this court in its decision or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>in the remittitur. Thus the sole issue is whether after the judgment became final the superior court had jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal and thereon make an award without authority having been conferred on it by the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">It is well settled that where a promissory note provides for the recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the enforcement thereof it includes an allowance for legal services rendered on appeal as well as in the trial court. However, which court makes the order fixing attorney\u2019s fees on appeal depends on the procedure utilized by the appellate court. Inasmuch as this court has the authority to set reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on appeal <em>(Martindell </em>v. <em>Bodrero, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 56, 62-63 [63 Cal.Rptr. 774]; <em>Coronet Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>West Thrift Co., </em>244 Cal.App.2d 631, 649 [53 Cal.Rptr. 433]), it may, as it frequently does, outright grant the request for such fees and order payment thereof; or if it does not elect to assume the burden of determining the amount of the fee it may direct the superior court after the remittitur is filed to hear an application for attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on appeal and fix the reasonable amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Appellant relies on <em>Painter </em>v. <em>Estate of Painter </em>(1889) 78 Cal. 625 [21 P. 433], and <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 713 [209 P.2d 854], to support its argument that the determination of reasonableness of fees on appeal rests with the trial court. While it is true that the amount of the fee may he determined by the superior court, it is clear from these two cases that for the court to hear an application for fees on appeal after the judgment becomes final jurisdiction must be conferred on it by the appellate court or by statute. In <em>Painter </em>the attorney\u2019s fees involved were statutory fees; section 1510, Code of Civil Procedure, had left as a matter of original jurisdiction the fixing of fees contemplated therein to the superior court (78 Cal. at page 628). In <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co., </em>plaintiff in its brief requested attorney's fees on appeal; the appellate court by order allowed 30 days from the filing of the remittitur in which plaintiff could file its motion for counsel fees on appeal in the superior court (93 Cal.App.2d at page 719).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Under then section 1510, Code of Civil Procedure (now \u00a7 703, Prob. Code), the trial court in <em>Painter </em>v. <em>Estate of Painter, </em>78 Cal. 625 [21 P. 433], had appointed an attorney to resist a claim filed against the estate; he was successful and</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>for his services allowed a reasonable fee. Upon termination of appellate proceedings and the filing of the remittitur he moved the trial court to fix a reasonable fee for services performed by him on the appeal; the motion was granted and appeal was taken from the order. Affirming the order the Supreme Court declared that it would not accept the burden of determining factual matters relative to fixing a proper fee and that \u201cIt is therefore reasonable to suppose that the legislature intended to leave, as a matter of original jurisdiction, the fixing of all fees contemplated by the section <em>supra </em>[Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1510] to the superior court.\u201d (P. 628.) No statutory fees were involved in <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 713 [209 P.2d 854]. The parties there had contracted for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the lessor in the enforcement of the terms of a written agreement. On defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment plaintiff in its brief made a proper request that the Court of Appeal allow additional fees on appeal (p. 718). After citing <em>Painter </em>to the effect that the reasonableness of the award is a matter for the determination of the trial court, the appellate court held \u20181 In accordance with the above, the trial court, if it be so inclined, may allow a <em>reasonable </em>fee for services on appeal,\u201d and made the following order: \u2018 \u2018 The judgment is affirmed. The motion for counsel fees on appeal may be filed within 30 days from the date of the filing of the remittitur.\u201d (P. 719.) Implicit in the foregoing order is recognition of the fundamental fact that after the remittitur is filed the trial court has no authority to entertain a motion for counsel fees on appeal unless authority is conferred on it by the appellate court. Otherwise, if after the judgment becomes final the trial court has jurisdiction to hear such a motion as urged by appellant herein, its jurisdiction would continue thereafter for a reasonable time and there would be no reason for the appellate court, to allow plaintiff time in which to file its motion, nor could the appellate court divest the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction by fixing a time which might under the circumstances be less than reasonable. Thus, in a suit on a note providing for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, once the trial court derives authority from the Court of Appeal by decision or remittitur, it may after the judgment becomes final entertain a proper application for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal and fix the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The procedure set up in <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co., supra, </em>was followed in each of the following three cases discussed by appellant and on which the trial court herein based its order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In <em>Berven Carpets Corp. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>210 Cal.App.2d 206 [26 Cal.Rptr. 513], defendants appealed from a judgment rendered against them in an action on a promissory note. Said the court at page 217: \u201cFinally we consider the matter of attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal. Plaintiff requests that, in the event of an affirmance, the case be remanded to the trial court for the purpose of fixing a reasonable fee to be paid its counsel for their services on this appeal. It is beyond dispute that such request finds a legal basis in the provisions of the promissory note. No legal cause exists for its refusal. <em>(California Viking Sprinkler Co. </em>v. <em>Cheney </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 564, 571-572 [6 Cal.Rptr. 197]; <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 713, 718-719 [209 P.2d 854].) As the above eases hold, \u2018the determination of the amount of the fees rests with the trial court upon an appropriate showing as to the nature of the services and the related facts. \u2019 <em>(California Viking Sprinkler Co. </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra, </em>at p. 572.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe judgment is affirmed and the cause is remanded with directions that the trial court determine a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee for services performed on appeal and add such fee to the principal amount of the judgment.\u201d Pursuant to request that the remittitur direct the trial court to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, this court in <em>California Viking Sprinkler Co. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 564 [6 Cal.Rptr. 197], affirmed the judgment and directed \u201cthe trial court to determine a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for services performed on appeal and to add such fee to the principal amount of the judgment.\u201d (P. 572.) Respondent in <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Degen &amp; Brody, Inc., </em>181 Cal.App.2d 289 [5 Cal.Rptr. 263], requested that the court declare him to be entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for services on appeal on the ground that the attorney fee provision in the contract included services on appeal and the record indicated that the trial judge limited his award to services performed down to the date of judgment. The court said: \u201cIf that be the case, as we think it is, the procedure outlined in <em>Oakland Cal. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 713, 719, seems appropriate,\u201d (p. 300) then ordered, \u201cThe plaintiff may file in the superior court a motion for attorney fee on appeal within 30 days from date of filing of remittitur.\u201d (P. 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The import of the foregoing eases suggests our conclusion that no authority to hear and determine the matter of attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on appeal having been conferred on the trial court by the Court of Appeal in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>decision or the remittitur <em>(American City Bank </em>v. <em>Zetlen, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 548 [61 Cal.Rptr. 311]), the trial court was without jurisdiction after the judgment became final to hear plaintiff\u2019s motion for counsel fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Wood, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 18, 1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> Mr. Lipsky\u2019s declaration in part states: \u2018\u2018From and after the date of entry of judgment in the trial court in the within action, and until the present time, in excess of thirty (30) hours of legal time have been expended in connection with this matter\u201d in connection with the appeal and the preparation, filing and argument of the motion for additional attorney\u2019s fees, and concluded that \u00a71,500 was a reasonable amount for legal services on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"><em> \u201c </em>Motion denied. In the absence of some authority in the Remittitur or Decision on appeal, the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to change the Judgment entered herein on August 17, 1966. The remittitur awards \u2018Costs to respondent,\u2019 but \u2018costs\u2019 do not include attorney\u2019s fees. To the extent it can be determined from the cases, it would seem that the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, after the appeal, without direction or authority from the Appellate Court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
