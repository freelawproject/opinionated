The necessity for such information is apparent from Mandosa v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 84, 225 S. W. Rep., 169; Davis v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 183, 225 S. W. Rep., 532; Williams v. State, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 115 237 S. W. Rep., 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">The second ground for the motion is that the transcript was delivered to appellant\u2019s attorney, and not transmitted through the mails by the District Clerk to the Clerk of this Court, as is required by the law. Art. 931, C. C. P., reads, \u201cAs soon as a transcript is prepared, the clerk shall forward the same by mail or other safe conveyance, charges paid, inclosed in an envelope, securely sealed, directed to the clerk of the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d The following cases construing the article just quoted appear to support the State\u2019s second ground for requesting a dismissal of the appeal. Lockwood v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 749; Pilot v. State, 38 Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Crim. Rep., 515; Dyer v. State, 44 Texas Crim. Rep., 78; 68 S.
