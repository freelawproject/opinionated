The case was tried at the January Term, 1922. The caption indicates that the proceedings were had at a term of the District Court of Navarro County commencing on the 3d day of October, 1921, and ending on the 24th day of December, 1921. This is manifestly insufficient. The appeal bond appearing in the record is approved only by the sheriff. Art. 904, C. C. P., requires that such bond be approved both by the sheriff and the judge of the trial court. Hanson v. State, No. 6958, decided May 10, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Being of opinion that the State is correct in both of its contentions, its motion to dismiss will be sustained, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
