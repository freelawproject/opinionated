This was refused, but no bill of exceptions was reserved to the failure to grant the motion. The motion does not seem to have been prepared with the view of securing the statement of facts under the terms of Article 1933, Revised Civil Statutes, and Articles 845 and 846 of the Code of Crim. Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Appellant was represented by an attorney not shown by record to have been appointed by the court but presumably of his own selection. No complaint by bill of exceptions is made concerning the action of \u25a0 the court upon this matter. It is mentioned for the reason that in a proper case the statement of facts should be furnished, although the accused is unable to pay for it. See Ex parte Fread, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
