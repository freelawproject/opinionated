There are no bills of exception, in the record, and the statement of facts was not filed in the lower court until May 29, 1922, more than ninety days after adjournment. For this reason the State has filed a motion to strike out the statement of facts. This motion must be sustained unless it appears that appellant has been deprived of his statement of facts without fault on his part. We find among the papers an affidavit of his attorney dated May 9, 1922, asserting that he had just then learned for the first time that no statement of facts was in the rec-cord; that he had prepared one and mailed same from Rogers to the district attorney at Belton requesting him to file same with the clerk when approved by the trial judge. It is nowhere stated in the affidavit when this was done, and it does not appear that counsel ever followed the matter up, or made any inquiry relative to whether it had been received or filed. We are of opinion the diligence required to secure a perfecting of the record is entirely wanting, and the motion of the State will be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>No fundamental errors appear upon the face of the record, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\">\n<em>\u25a0Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b384-4\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">October, 11, 1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b384-6\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AvO\">\u2014 At the last term of this court an affirmance was ordered in this case. After adjournment at said term a formal motion for rehearing was filed on behalf of appellant. When affirmed, the case was before us without proper statement of facts, and the record is still in the same unfortunate condition. Nothing appearing save the formal motion mentioned, the application for rehearing will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
