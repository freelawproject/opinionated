An examination of same reveals that with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the exception of three or four pages, these being mainly the testimony of appellant himself, said statement of facts is open to the objection made by the Assistant Attorney General. The motion to strike out the statement of facts must be sustained. Jetty v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 346, 235 S. W. Rep., 589; Huey v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 400, 235 S. W. Rep., 887; Rylee v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 482, 236 S. W. Rep., 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">There are a number of exceptions to the charge of the trial court, but an examination of same reveals the fact that each of them is dependent, for the error urged therein, upon the existence of certain facts in evidence, which facts are not shown by the bills of exception and are not revealed anywhere in the record because of the absence of a statement of facts. This is true also of several special charges asked by the appellant and refused by the trial court. A continuance was asked because of the absence of certain witnesses but appellant appears to have been satisfied with the refusal thereof by the trial court inasmuch as no bill of exceptions was taken to the refusal of said continuance. See Sec. 304, Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., for authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">No error appearing in the record, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">June 21, 1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b280-10\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWb\">\u2014 Appellant insists we were in error in striking out the statement of facts because in question and answer form. This is not an open question. In addition to the cases cited in the opinion we refer to those collated by Mr. Branch in his Ann. P. C., page 309, Section 601, also the later cases of Moody v. State, 236 S. W. Rep., 741; Jetty v. State, 235 S. W. Rep., 589; Rylee v. State, 236 S. W. Rep., 744; Parker v. State, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 68, 238 S. W. Rep., 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
