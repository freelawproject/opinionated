The precise question was before us in Russell v. State, No. 6923, relative to an indictment returned by this same grand jury. We there held the indictment should have been quashed. Our reasons are fully set out in the opinion in that case. The motion in arrest of judgment should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the prosecution under the present indictment is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
