As appellant passed him, Lynn asked him whether he wanted to buy a melon, to which he replied \u201cno.\u201d After he passed, Lynn continued hollering \u201cwater-melons.\u201d Koontz, after walking some twenty steps, came back and said: \u201cFellow, what did you insult me for?\u201d Lynn replied: \u201cI did not insult you.\u201d Koontz then said: \u201cWhy, you did, and get out and fight me like a man.\u201d Lynn disclaimed insulting him. He finally got out of the wagon. The evidence is conflicting touching which struck the first blow. The appellant struck Lynn several times with his fist, knocked him down and \u201cstomped\u201d him with his feet. The injuries suffered by Lynn were described by several witnesses:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-15\">Doctor Atkinson testified, in substance, that in his examination he found no discoloration about the chest. There was a cut just above Lynn\u2019s left ear, and another from his lip, running down towards his right cheek bone.. There were minor cuts about his left \"ear, but the one on his lip was the principal cut, which required six stitches to sew it up. There were also bruised places and discoloration about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Ms face. The cuts were made by some jagged instrument, and might have been made with a spur, but could not have been made with a man\u2019s fist and the heel of a boot. Lynn was very sick and vomited blood, but it could not be said whether it was blood from an Mternal injury or blood that had been swallowed. He was unconscious, but the doctor was unable to discover the exact cause thereof. The injuries were considered serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">We think the allegations in the indictment were sufficient to charge a battery. We find two bills of exceptions; in each of which complaint is made of the receipt of evidence that at the time of the difficulty the appellant wore spurs upon his feet. Bill No. 1 complains of the admission of such testimony through the witness Atkinson. Bill No. 2 complains of its admission through the witness Mrs. S. A. Walton. Turning to 'the statement of facts, we find that the witness H. A. Walton testified that at the time appellant \u201cstomped\u201d and kicked Lynn, <em>he had spurs on each of his feet. </em>That there were spurs upon the feet of the appellant was not. controverted. There is a well-established rule of evidence that when a fact is proven without objection, ordinarily the admission of other evidence to the same point, over objection, does not justify a reversal. Charles v. State, 85 Texas Crim. Rep. 534; 213 S. W. Rep. 266; Wagner v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep. 306. The application of this principle to the instant case is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">We note also in the agreed statement of facts, purporting by its terms to embrace all the testimony, that neither the witness Mrs. S. A. Walton nor Atkinson makes any reference to spurs on the feet of appellant, but that appears in the testimony of H. A. Walton alone. The evidence, we think, is sufficient to show that the injuries were serious without reference to those which were traceable to the spurs. The court, in a very specific manner, instructed the jury that in determining whether the injuries were serious, they would take no account of any injuries that may have been inflicted by reason of the spurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We are unable to persuade ourselves that there is anything revealed in the record requiring a reversal of the judgment. It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">May 24, 1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b45-9\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AVC\">\u2014 Bills of exception one and two show that witnesses Atkinson and <em>8. A. </em>Walton, over objection, testified that apr pellant had on spurs when he was \u201cstomping\u201d Lynn. All bills of exception must necessarily be considered in relation to the facts in evidence. The statement of facts show that <em>H. A. </em>Walton, a son of S. A. Walton, also testified without objection that appellant had on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>spurs. In support of the proposition that when a \"fact is proven without objection, the admission of other evidence on the same point, over objection, does not ordinarily justify reversal, in addition to the cases referred to in the original opinion, we cite, Rogers v. State, 26 Texas Crim. App., 404. We are further of opinion there was no error in the admission of this testimony even over objection. It is true same could not be appropriated by the jury to base a conviction thereon, the assault not being alleged to have been made with spurs; but it was admissible as a part of the res gestae, and as throwing light on appellant\u2019s intent. Richards v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 423; Irving v. State, 70 Texas Crim. Rep., 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
