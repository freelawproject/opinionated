We have carefully examined the facts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Appellant did not testify. It was shown without dispute that on the occasion in question he gave to the prosecuting witness a check which bore a signature other than that of appellant, which check was turned down by the bank as being of one who had no account at such bank. The statement of facts seems to sustain the proposition that the name signed to said check was a fictitious one. The court submitted the law of both forgery and passing a forged instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">Believing the evidence sufficient to justify the verdict, and finding no error in the record, an affirmance is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
