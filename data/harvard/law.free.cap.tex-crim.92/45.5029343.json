Such has been the previous holding of this court. See Teague v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 503; Lenox v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 259; Vernon\u2019s Tex. Crim. Stat., Vol. 2, p. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">If the appellant gave' notice of appeal, the statute, Article 915, points out the method of having it entered of record at a subsequent term.
