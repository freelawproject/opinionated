A motion to quash based on said ground was overruled. The matter is fully discussed in Russell v. State, No. 6923 this day decided. For the reasons given in the Russell ease we are of opinion the trial court erred in overruling the motion to quash the indictment, and that same necessitates a reversal and dismissal of this case, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
