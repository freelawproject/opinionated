Murphy, the alleged owner, had in his safe three liberty bonds. Some one entered his safe and removed them. One of them was a $50 bond with coupons attached, and there was a smudge of green ink on the outer edge of the bond. The bond was missed about the first day of August, but had not been seen for several days prior to that time. Soon after-wards Murphy identified the bond among a great number which were in possession of the Dallas National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-19\">Carnes, an exployee of the bank, was present when Murphy identified the bond and accounted for its presence there with the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that a man from Dryfuss &amp; Sons, accompanied by another fellow, came to the bank and inquired the price of the bond, and that about forty minutes later, the same fellow came in the bank with another salesman from Dreyfuss &amp; Sons, and Carnes bought and paid him the cash for the bond. Carnes said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\">\u201cI paid the money to the gentleman that came in with the salesman from Dreyfuss &amp; Sons. I could not say that this person was the defendant. I remember Mr. Akerman of Dreyfuss &amp; Sons bringing some man in with the bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Cooper, an employee of Dreyfuss &amp; Sons, testified that the appellant came to the store and \u201coffered liberty bonds in exchange for the goods he desired to purchase. I don\u2019t remember the denomination of the bond. I didn\u2019t go with him to the bank. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Ackerman, another employee of Dreyfuss &amp; Sons testified that the appellant came into the store and asked whether he would take a $50 liberty bond for merchandise; that he told him it would be taken at its market value. The witness said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cI took him to the bank next door, where I got a price on the bond; it was a little over fifty dollars, with the coupons, * * *. I did not go back with him, but walked back to the store and had the underwear man wait on him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">This testimony, as we comprehend it, shows that the appellant offered to sell Dreyfuss &amp; Sons a liberty bond which he exhibited; that in company with one of the employees of said firm he did sell to the bank the particular liberty bond which was afterwards identified by Murphy as the one which had been-stolen from him. This, as we gather from the evidence, occurred very soon after the bond was stolen and apparently brings the case within the rule which permits the conclusion of guilt to be drawn by the jury from the possession by the accused of property recently stolen. The record furnishes no explanation of his possession of the stolen, bond, and therefore, in our opinion, is sufficient to support the finding of the jury that appellant was the thief.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The \"bond, without the coupons attached, was of a value less than fifty dollars, but with the coupons attached to it, was worth more than fifty dollars. The coupons were but evidence, of the fact that the interest which the Government was obligated, on the face of the bond to pay, had not been paid. The interest was a part of the bond. The evidence was sufficient to characterize the offense as a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b55-12\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">May 31, 1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b55-14\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEP\">\u2014 In his motion appellant criticises the court\u2019s charge. Unless the fault in the charge is fundamental, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>it is too late to assail it after verdict. Such has been the law since the enactment of Chapter 138, page 278, Laws of 1913, embraced in Articles 735 and 737, Code of Crim. Proc. See also Gerard v. State, 238 S. W. Rep. 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">It may be stated, however, that we have examined the charge in the light of appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing, and express the opinion that it adequately presented the issues arising from the evidence and fully protected the rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
