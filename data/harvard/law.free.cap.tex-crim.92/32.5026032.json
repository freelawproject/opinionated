We have examined the indictment which is in two counts, one charging burglary of a private residence and the other burglary of an ordinary house. Each seems to follow the language of the statute. The conviction was for burglary of a private residence. The charge of the court seems to be in conformity with the precedents and to fairly present the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
