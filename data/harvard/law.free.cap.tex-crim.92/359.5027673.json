There appear in the record no bills of exception reserved to the refusal of such special charges. There is no statement upon either of said charges as written or in the approval by the trial court which in any way reflects the fact that such charges were presented to the court after the evidence was concluded and before the argument. Being unable to ascertain this necessary fact from the record, we are compelled to decline to consider the question of the refusal of said special charges. Barrios v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 548, 204 S. W. Rep., 326; Gibson v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 281; Gibbs v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep. 487. However, if the matter was before the court properly and in a manner to call for our consideration, we would hold the refusal of said special charges on the part of the court below, correct. Ex parte Doc Mitchum, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 62, 236 S. W. Rep., 936; Stringer v. State, No. 6954, opinion delivered May 24, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Appellant has several bills of exception complaining of the testimony of witnesses relative to a suit case in which officers found quantities of com whisky. Mrs. Moore testified that appellant brought said suit ease into a restaurant and set it down, and that she saw the officers when they came and investigated the contents of said suit case. Appellant\u2019s name was J. R. Geeil. Upon said suit case were the initials J. R. C. In said suit case, in addition to the intoxicating liquor mentioned, was a vest of the same kind of cloth of which were appellant\u2019s coat and trousers. We are unable b <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>agree with appellant that said evidence was inadmissible, or that appellant was not properly connected therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">Having examined the record and finding no error committed upon the trial, and believing same sufficiently establishes the guilt of the appellant, an affirmance is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">October 11, 1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b387-7\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ACp\">\u2014 Appellant complains because our original opinion did n.ot discuss his assignment of error based upon the failure of the trial court to quash the indictment because it omitted the charge that the transportation of the liquor was for the \u201cpurpose of sale.\u201d The disposition of the question raised by the refusal of special charges upon the same issue in effect disposed of the matter adversely to appellant\u2019s contention. However, the point has been passed upon directly in Ex parte Mitchum, 90 Texas Crim. Rep., 62, 236 S. W. Rep., 936; Stringer v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 46; Crowley v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 103. We regard the matter as analogous to our statute which denounces the carrying of arms \u201con or about the person.\u201d Whenever an indictment so alleges an offense is charged, but if accused can show that he comes within one of the exceptions his defense is complete. We do not agree to the proposition contended for, that the indictment must allege that the transportation was for the purpose of sale. Our reasons appear in the opinion found in the cases cited, <em>supra. </em>See also, Copeland v. State; (No. 6994, this day decided.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
