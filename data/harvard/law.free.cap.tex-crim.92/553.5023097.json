The bill shows that he had not been previously furnished one. The law 'declares that \u201che or his counsel may demand a copy, which shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>be given at as early a day as possible.\u201d (Code of Crim. Proc. Art. 554.) There is no impediment in the instant ease to the com pliance with this statute. It required no delay of the trial. It was the imperative duty of the court to have the copy demanded furnished. Venn v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 638; Revill v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 1; Mayes v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 512; Wray v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 632; Matheson v. State, 92 Texas Crim. Rep., 208, 241 S. W. Rep., 1013. The enactment of the statute was doubtless to enforce the provision of the Bill of Rights wherein it is said tha<em>t \u2018 </em>one accused of crime shall have the right- to demand the nature and the cause of the accusation against him and to have a copy thereof.\u201d Const., Art. 1, Sec. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The court was not warranted in refusing this demand. Because of its refusal, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
