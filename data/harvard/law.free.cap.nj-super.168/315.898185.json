A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AqlD\">This case presents the question of whether the representative plaintiff may sue on behalf of the surviving pecuniary beneficiaries of the deceased under our Wrongful Death Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :31\u20141 <em>et seq., </em>where the deceased during her lifetime had obtained a judgment in a personal injury action against defendant, which was .ultimately satisfied, based upon the same negligent acts which allegedly caused the death. This precise question has never previously arisen in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">This is the factual background. On September 8, 1968 plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Concetta Alfone, filed a complaint against defendant, Dr. Sarno, alleging negligent treatment with respect to two subtotal thyroidectomies performed on her in 1960 and 1965. At a trial conducted in November 1971 Concetta Alfone contended that the negligent surgical procedures performed by defendant caused damage to or removal of her parathyroid glands, resulting in hypocalcemia, a serious deficiency in the body\u2019s calcium supply which resulted in permanent residuals. The jury returned a verdict of $100,000 on the personal injury claim and judgment was entered thereon. Defendant appealed, and in an unreported opinion filed in May 1973 this court reversed on the ground that the trial judge erred in requiring defendant to bear the burden of proving that the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :lA-2. On remand the trial judge filed an opinion and entered judgment in March 1974 in favor of defendant on the statute of limitations question. On appeal this court in February 1976 reversed and entered judgment for plaintiff. <em>Alfone v. </em>Sarno, 139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>518 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 71 <em>N. J. </em>498 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On March 18, 1974 Concetta Alfone died intestate, survived by her parents and a teenage daughter. Following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>denial of certification in September 1976 defendant paid the judgment plus pre- and post-judgment interest, and a warrant in satisfaction executed in October by the administrator of her estate was filed as evidence thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On March 11, 1976 Concetta\u2019s father, Alphonse Alione, filed this action as administrator <em>ad </em>prosequendum, alleging her wrongful death as a result of the malpractice of defendant established in the prior action. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the successful prosecution of the personal injury action to a satisfied judgment barred an action under our Wrongful Death Act on the part of the alleged pecuniary beneficiaries, decedent\u2019s parents and child, where the cause of action for death was based on the same allegation of negligence as the personal injury action. The trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Because of the possible pertinence of the allegations and proofs on the elements of damages at the trial of the personal injury action in 1971 to the potential damages recoverable on behalf of the alleged pecuniary beneficiaries in this action we have expanded the record on this appeal to include portions of the record of that trial. At the personal injury trial Concetta Alione claimed damages for pain and suffering, temporary and permanent disability, and past and future medical expenses. Past medical expenses were stipulated at $24,000 to date of trial. Future medical expenses were in substantial dispute but could have been estimated at $30 to $40 a week. The standard jury charge on normal life expectancy was given \u2022\u2014\u2022 the jury was told that a woman of plaintiff\u2019s age, then 32, had a life expectancy of 44.1 years under the mortality tables appended to our court rules. Plaintiff\u2019s case was not presented on any serious contention of substantial foreshortening of her life from defendant\u2019s malpractice, either as a likely occurrence or in itself as a discrete element of damage. There was no evidence of any past lost earnings or of any loss of future earnings offered at the trial. Nor did plaintiff contend for the loss of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>future earning capacity as an element of damages by proof or in summation. The trial judge properly did not instruct the jury to consider any past or future economic loss to Coneetta Alfone as part of its verdict, the proofs being barren as to those elements of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The early common law allowed no action for the death of another, under the maxim <em>actio personalis moritur cum persona.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The law changed in England with the passage of the first wrongful death statute in 1846, known as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, 9 and 10 <em>Viet., </em>c. 93. New Jersey adopted a statute essentially similar to Lord Campbell\u2019s Act in 1848, <em>Gen. Stat. </em>p. 1188, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11. See <em>Cooper v. Shore Electric Co., </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>558, 562-563 (E. &amp; A. 1899). Despite many amendments over the past 120 years, our act retains much of the flavor of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. Most pertinent to the present inquiry, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:31\u20141 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">When the death of a person is caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default, such as would, <em>if death had not ensued, home entitled the person injured to maintain an action for damages resulting from the injury, </em>the person who would have been liable in damages for the injury if death had not ensued shall be liable in an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured * * *'.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The question here is whether the cause of action is, in view of the emphasized language, totally derivative from the rights possessed by decedent as of the time of death or is independent of decedent\u2019s rights \u2014 a separate cause of action inhering in the beneficiaries. Defendant takes the first stated position, arguing from the literal language of the statute that since decedent could no longer have maintained another action once she recovered judgment in her original action, the mandate of the statute bars a subsequent wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Certain basic principles as to the law of damages under our Wrongful Death Act bear discussion at this point. The fundamental aim of our act is compensation for the pecuniary losses suffered by the survivors of those killed by wrongful acts. <em>Tenore v. Nu Car Carriers, </em>67 <em>N. J. </em>466, 473 (1975); <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :31-4 and 5. The amount of recovery is based upon the contributions, reducible to monetary terms, which the decedent reasonably might have been expected to make to the survivors. <em>Dubil v. Labate, </em>52 N. <em>J. </em>255, 259 (1968). \u201cThis has been interpreted to mean the \u2018deprivation of a reasonable expectation of a pecuniary advantage which would have resulted by a continuance of the life of the deceased.\u2019\u201d <em>McStay v. Przychocki, </em>7 <em>N. J. </em>456, 460 (1951), quoting <em>Carter v. West Jersey &amp; Seashore R. R. Co., </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>602 (E. &amp; A. 1908). Damages are awarded only for pecuniary loss and do not include injury to the feelings, mental suffering or loss of society and companionship. <em>Graf v. Taggert, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>303, 308-309 (1964) (see discussion at note 1 on the relaiively limited scope of damages under the act). <em>Cooper v. Shore Electric Co., supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>at 567; <em>Burd v. Vercruyssen, </em>142 <em>N. J. Super. </em>344, 355-356 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 72 <em>N. J. </em>459 (1976). Dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ages may include the monetary value of loss of services, such as the economic worth of services of a deceased mother to her minor children, <em>Carter v. West Jersey &amp; Seashore R. R. Co., supra, </em>76 <em>N. J. L. </em>at 603, but such recovery \u201cis solely for pecuniary loss * * * but it does not include loss of companionship and society as such.\u201d <em>Russell v. Salem Transportation Co., Inc., </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>502, 508 (1972). Economic dependency, however, is not the sole basis for damages for pecuniary loss; minor children may recover the pecuniary value of the loss of the care, guidance and advice of a parent during their minority. <em>Suarez v. Berg, </em>117 <em>N. J. Super. </em>456, 462 (App. Div. 1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the statute permits an award of \u201cthe hospital, medical and funeral expenses incurred for the deceased.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :31-5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"> Our Wrongful Death Act carries its own period of limitations, requiring that suit be brought within two years of death. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:31-3. The action is brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the name of the deceased\u2019s representative, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :3i\u2014 2, for the exclusive benefit of those entitled to take any intestate personal property of the decedent, with those actually dependent having priority. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:31-4. Our Supreme Court has stated that the act is remedial in nature and is to be liberally construed to effectuate its beneficent object, but because it is in derogation of the common law its-remedies are not to be extended beyond their fair intendment. Tu<em>ron v. J. &amp; L. Construction Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>543, 558 (1952). The Wrongful Death Act is distinct from the so-called \u201csurvival action,\u201d <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:15-3, which gives executors or administrators a right of action for tortious injury or damage to the deceased or his property incurred prior to death. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :15-3. In the usual case both actions are joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">It is, therefore, clear that our Wrongful Death Act created a separate cause of action for the loss suffered by designated beneficiaries. That the act, like Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, created a new cause of action, distinct from the survival action, was most forcefully observed in <em>Cooper v. Shore Electric Co., supra, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>at 563-64, where the Court of Errors and Appeals in so concluding quoted from Lore! Blackburn\u2019s observations while construing Lord Campbell\u2019s Act in the House of Lords in <em>Seward v. Vera Cruz, </em>10 <em>App. Cas. </em>59, 70-71 (1885), that it is \u201can action which is new in species, new in its quality, new in its principles, in every way new.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It is curious that a statute could be in existence for more? than 120 years without a fundamental question such as is. presented by this case having been answered by authoritative opinion. Our Supreme Court almost resolved the question in <em>Lawlor v. Cloverleaf Memorial Park, Inc., </em>56 <em>N. J. </em>326, 343-45 (1970), and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit a year earlier resolved it adversely to a subsequent claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>on behalf of the surviving beneficiaries in <em>Roberts v. Union Carbide, </em>415 <em>F. </em>2d 474 (1969).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">As noted above, the basic problem is to determine whether the death action is derivative from and dependent upon the existence of a viable cause of action in the deceased as of the time of death or whether it is independent thereof. The crucial language in the act is, \u201ccaused by a wrongful act * * * such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the person injured to maintain an action for damages.\u201d The issue can arise in three contexts: (1) before death the decedent obtained judgment against the defendant based on the same negligent act \u2014 the case before us; ,(2) before death the decedent settled a claim with the defendant based on the same negligent act, and (3) before death decedent\u2019s otherwise valid personal injury claim was barred by the expiration of the statute of limitations \u2014 an issue which we today decide in the companion case of <em>Silverman v. Lathrop, </em>168 <em>N. J. Super. </em>333 (App. Div. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The traditional majority view precluded an action for wrongful death in all three situations, though most of the decided cases are of older vintage. Annotation, \u201cRelease by, or judgment in favor of, person injured as barring action for his death,\u201d 39 <em>A. L. R. </em>579 (1925); <em>Prosser, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 127 at 911; <em>Speiser, op. cit., </em>\u00a7 5:14 at 613-618, \u00a7 5:20 at 631-634. Older Few Jersey authority supporting this traditional view is represented by <em>Libera v. Wittaker, Clark &amp; Daniels, Inc., </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>292 (Law Div. 1952), a case of a predeath settlement and release of the bodily injury claim, <em>Knabe v. Hudson Bus Transp. Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>333 (E. &amp; A. 1933) (our then highest court), and <em>Coulter v. New Jersey Pulverizing, </em>11 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>5, 163 <em>A. </em>661 (Sup. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>1932), both of the latter statute of limitation eases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted, there are no New Jersey holdings on the prior judgment for bar, but there have been cases so holding elsewhere. <em>E. g., Perry\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., </em>199 <em>Ky. </em>396, 251 <em>S. </em>W. 202 (Ct. App. 1923); <em>Edwards v. Interstate Chemical Corp., </em>170 <em>N. C. </em>551, 87 S. <em>E. </em>635 (Sup. Ct. 1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The minority view, which permits a subsequent action, finds support in <em>Rowe v. Richards, </em>35 <em>S. D. </em>201, 151 <em>N. W. </em>1001 (Sup. Ct. 1915), a settlement ease, and <em>Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, </em>414 <em>U. S. </em>573, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>806, 39 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 9 (1974), a judgment ease involving a common law action for maritime wrongful death based upon the judicial remedy created by <em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, </em>398 <em>U. S. </em>375, 90 <em>S. Ct. </em>1772, 26 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 339 (1970). The five-justice <em>Gaudet </em>majority, in an opinion written by Justice Brennan, treats the entire subject extensively and upholds the right to maintain the death action. 414 <em>U. S. </em>575-584, 91 <em>S. Ct. </em>806. The dissenting opinion of Justice Powell presents the contrary position <em>(id. </em>at 602-604, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>806), stressing the policy against double recovery and the threat to repose as justification for precluding a second action. See also, <em>Goodyear v. Davis, </em>114 <em>Kan. </em>557, 220 <em>P. </em>282 (Sup. Ct. 1923). Several respected academic authorities, to be discussed <em>infra, </em>also support the position of the <em>Gaudei </em>majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The continued validity in this jurisdiction of the derivative-dependent character of the cause of action is most questionable in light of <em>dictum </em>in the unanimous opinion of our Supreme Court in <em>Lawlor v. Cloverleaf Memorial Park, Inc., supra, </em>authored by Juslice Jacobs. In <em>Lawlor </em>there was no need for the court squarely to choose between the derivative-dependent and the independent-separate theories because the filing of the survival action therein was held to relate back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>under third-party practice, thereby escaping the bar of the two-year statute of limitations and preserving the otherwise timely-filed death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The Appellate Division in <em>Lawlor </em>felt controlled by the then still authoritative decision of the Court of Errors and Appeals (our highest court until 1948) in the <em>Enab&amp; </em>case <em>supra. </em>The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">We recognize that there is a diversity of opinion and that all jurisdictions do not follow the construction of the Death Act which has been adopted by our courts. 2 <em>Harper and James, Torts, </em>\u00a7 24.7, pp. 1296-1297 (1956). In a number of states whose wrongful death act is patterned after Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, recovery has been permitted even though decedent had lost his right to sue. See <em>Hoover v. Chesapeake and Ohio R. Co., </em>46 <em>W. Va. </em>268, 33 S. <em>E. </em>224 (Sup. Ct. 1899) ; <em>DeHart v. Ohio Fuel Gas Co., </em>84 <em>Ohio App. </em>62, 85 <em>N. E. </em>2d 586 (Ct. App. 1948) ; Annotation, 167 <em>A. L. R. </em>894, 901-903 (1947). However, until the cited pronouncements of our courts are overruled by our highest court, we consider ourselves bound by them. [106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>374 at 392-393]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">This statement by the Appellate Division sparked the following discussion by the Supreme Court in <em>Lawlor:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Since the Appellate Division entertained the view that the action under the Survival Act had been barred by limitation, it felt obliged by the New Jersey precedents to hold that the AYrongful Death action under <em>H. J. S. A. </em>2A :31-1 was also barred by limitation. 106 <em>H. J. Super. </em>at 390\u201493; <em>Knabe v. Hudson Bus Transportation Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>333, 335 (E. &amp; A. 1933) ; <em>Coulter v. New Jersey Pulverizing Co., </em>11 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>5 (Sup. Ct. 1932). In reaching this conclusion the cited cases, while recognizing generally that the Wrongful Death proceeding is a separate and distinct cause of action subject to <em>H. J. S. A. </em>2A :31-3 which provides that the action \u201cshall be commenced within 2 years after the death of the decedent,\u201d placed primary stress on the following italicized language in <em>H. J. S. A. </em>2A :31-1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">When the death of a person is caused by a wrongful act, neglect or default, <em>such </em>as <em>would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the person injured to maintain an action for damages </em>resulting from the injury, the person who would have been liable in damages for the injury if death had not ensued shall be liable in an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>injured and although the death was caused under circumstances amounting in law to a crime. (Italics ours).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Coulter </em>the former Supreme Court held that where the decedent did not institute any action within the two-year period and died thereafter, his representative was barred by limitation; Justice Eodine expressed the thought that the statute gave \u201can action if the decedent had one\u201d and since the decedent had lost his right of action by \u201clapse of time\u201d his representative had none. 11 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>at 6-7. In <em>Knabe, </em>Justice Parker, speaking for the Court of Errors and Appeals, subscribed to the holding in <em>Coulter, </em>saying: \u201cWe agree that, where any right of action by the living party injured was barred by limitation before his death, the Death Act does not create a right of action in the personal representative.\u201d 111 <em>N. J. L. at </em>335.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Although there are supporting out-of-state cases there are many to the contrary. 106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 392-93; <em>N, O. Nelson Mfg. Corp. v. Dickson, </em>114 <em>Ind. App. </em>668, 53 <em>N. 11. </em>2d 640 (1949) ; <em>McKee v. New Idea, Inc., </em>36 <em>Ohio Law Abs. </em>563, 44 <em>N. E. </em>2d 697, 717 (Ohio Ct. App. 1942) ; <em>Causey v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co., </em>166 <em>N. C. </em>5, 81 <em>S. E. </em>917 <em>(1914); German-American Trust Co. v. Lafayette Box, Board &amp; Paper Co., </em>52 <em>Ind. App. </em>211, 98 <em>N. E. </em>874 (1912).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">These cases take the persuasive position that the statutory terminology \u201crelates to the character of the injury, without regard to the question of time of suit or death.\u201d <em>Hoover\u2019s Adms. v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co., </em>46 <em>W. Va. </em>268, 33 S. <em>E. </em>224 (1899). Much the same approach might be gathered from this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Graf v. Taggert, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>303, 305-06 (1964), that the italicized language, in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :31-1 was \u201cintended to preclude recovery where the injured person could not have recovered because the defendant did not commit a wrongful act or the deceased\u2019s own conduct would have barred his right to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">In light of our holding in the instant matter that the survival action was not barred by limitation, we need not pursue further the issue presented by the aforecited conflicting decisions; there is no dispute that where, as here, the survival action was not barred by limitation, the later death action, instituted well within 2 years after the death <em>(N. J. S\u201e A. </em>2A:31-3), was also not barred. [56 <em>N. J. </em>343-345]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reference to the \u201cpersuasive position\u201d of the many out-of-state cases, contrary to the <em>Knabe </em>view, which hold that \u201cthe statutory terminology \u2018relates to the character of the injury, without regard to the question of time of suit or death,\u2019 \u201d though <em>dictum, </em>convinces us that <em>Knabe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>has been discredited and would not now be followed by the Supreme Court. We therefore accept the view that the statutory terminology means nothing more than that where a person has been injured by a tortious act which later causes his death, the beneficiaries under the wrongful death act have a separate and independent right of action, qualified only by the strong policy against the recovery of duplicate damages. As we have recently stated, \u201c[w]here more recent decisions of the Supreme Court plainly undermine the authority of a prior decision although not squarely and explicitly overruling it, we are entitled to follow the current doctrine and need not be confined by the prior ruling.\u201d <em>State v. Ciuffini, </em>164 <em>N. J. Super. </em>145, 152 (App. Div. 1978); see also <em>State v. Chiarello, </em>69 <em>N. J. Super. </em>479, 498 (App. Div. 1961), certif. den. 36 <em>N. J. </em>301 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We note with interest .the comment of Judge Gibbons of the Third Circuit in <em>Goodman v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., </em>534 <em>F. </em>2d 566, 569-70 (1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 429 <em>U. S. </em>1038, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>732, 50 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 748 (1976), to the effect that the New Jersey courts have recognized that the beneficiary\u2019s claim under the Wrongful Death Act is an independent cause of action and \u201cnot a derivative of the decedent\u2019s personal injury claim,\u201d but that they have \u201cplaced a gloss on the literal language\u201d of the Death Act \u201cinextricably linking the two.\u201d Judge Gibbons, we think, perceptively and correctly observed that the <em>dictum </em>in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lawlor, </em>quoted <em>supra, </em>suggests that \u201cthe gloss heretofore placed by the courts on [the Death Act] is not supported by the statutory language\u201d. 534 <em>F. </em>2d at 570, n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The traditional view barring an independent recovery has long had its detractors. In 1915 the Supreme Court of South Dakota stated in <em>Rowe v. Richards, supra, </em>a settlement-type case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">We must confess our inability to grasp the logic of any course of so-called reasoning through which the conclusion is drawn that the husband simply because he may live to suffer from a physical injury and thus become vested with a cause of action for the violation of' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>his own personal right, had an implied power to release a cause of action \u2014 one which has not then accrued; one which may never accrue; and one -which from its very nature cannot accrue until his death; and one which, if it ever does accrue, will accrue in favor of his wife and be based solely upon a violation of a right vested solely in the wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">[35 <em>S. D. </em>at 215-216, 151 <em>N. W. </em>at 1006]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In <em>Gaudet </em>Justice Brennan describes this as a classic summary of the view that the cause of action for death is independent of the personal injury action. <em>Sea-Land Services v. Gaudet, </em>411 <em>U. S. </em>at 582, n. 8, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>806. See also, <em>Brown v. Moore, </em>247 <em>F. </em>2d 711, 722 (3 Cir. 1957), <em>cert. </em>den. 355 <em>U. S. </em>882, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>148, 22 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 112 (1957) (applying Pennsylvania law); <em>Phillips v. Community Traction Co., </em>46 <em>Ohio App. </em>483, 189 <em>N. E. </em>144 (App. Ct. 1933). This point of view emphasizes the conception that the survivors\u2019 rights accrue only at the death of the victim. As noted by <em>Speiser,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">The theory of such cases is that the cause of action for death does not arise until decedent\u2019s death, that it should be unaffected by acts of the injured person during his lifetime, and that decedent could not have disposed of the right before it arose. <em>ISpeiser, op. </em>eft., \u00a7 5:14 at 615]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">In referring to the crucial language \u2014 \u201csuch as would, if death had not ensued, entitled the person injured to maintain an action\u201d \u2014 <em>Prosser </em>says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">* * * It obviously is intended at least to prevent recovery for death where the decedent could never at any time have maintained an action, as, for example, where there was simply no tortious conduct toward him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">It is not at all clear, however, that such provisions of the death acts ever were intended to prevent, recovery where the deceased once had a cause of action, but it has terminated before his death. The more reasonable interpretation would seem to be that they are directed at the necessity of some original fort on the part of the defendant. under the circumstances giving rise to liability in the first instance, rather than to subsequent changes in the situation affecting only the interest of the decedent. <em>[Prosser, op. ait. </em>\u00a7 127 at 910-911; footnotes omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The author then discusses the factors which have shaped the majority (derivative) and minority .(independent) views. The principle influence appears to have been the \u201cfear of a double recovery\u201d where the decedent has recovered his prospective earnings, either for a diminished or normal life expectancy, in the personal injury action. <em>Id. </em>at 911, n. 33, n. 34. A countervailing factor is the possibility of \u201can improvident settlement by an optimistic individual, confident that he is not going to die, which takes no account of shortened life expectancy, or of the interests of survivors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. As the author notes, \u201cno satisfactory systematic solution to the whole problem has been found.\u201d <em>Iiid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><em>Harper and </em>James, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 24.6 at 1293-1294, perhaps best pinpoints the real nature of the dispute between the contending camps with respect to the defense of former recovery or release by the deceased when it observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">The vital policy behind both of these defenses is certainly in part the prevention of double recovery. The inquiry is invited, therefore, whether there is serious danger of double recovery, gome have argued that there is no such danger, pointing to the fact that a survival act and a wrongful death act redress different injuries and do not (if carefully drawn) overlap. Many states, the argument continues, allow recovery under both types of statutes <em>after the deceased\u2019s death </em>on the very ground that this involves no double recovery, gince the survival statute merely continues the deceased\u2019s own action, the argument concludes, there is no greater danger of double recovery if the wrongful death action is allowed in spite of former recovery by the deceased upon his own claim before his death. This argument overlooks one vital consideration. After deceased\u2019s death, damages under a survival statute are limited to those on account of the period between his injury and death \u2014 a period that has become defined by the event of death itself. If, on the other hand, deceased recovers before his death, his recovery for permanent injuries will be based, under the prevailing American rule, on his prospective earnings for the balance of his life expectancy at the time of his injury <em>undiminished by any shortening \u00f3f that expectancy as a result of the injury. </em>Presumably any settlement would reflect the legal liability under this rule. The danger of double recovery becomes clear when it is recalled that any benefits of which the survivors were deprived, by the death, would have come out of these very prospective earnings if deceased had lived. At least in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>case of serious and apparently permanent injuries, therefore, there is real danger of double recovery if a wrongful death action is allowed after a recovery or release by deceased during his lifetime, [Emphasis in original]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We conclude that an approach crafted to avoid double recovery as to any particular item of damages is fairest to all and would in large measure satisfy those who object to the minority approach. Such an approach is articulated by the <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>2d, \u00a7 92.1 (2),(b) (Tentative Draft. No. 3, 1976), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">If a wrongful death action is permitted even though the decedent had obtained a judgment for his personal injuries, the judgment precludes recovery of damages in the wrongful death action for such elements of loss as could have been recovered by decedent in his action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The Comments to \u00a7 92.1 report that the \u201cauthorities dealing with the question are in profound conflict.\u201d The reporter says that \u201cthe distinct majority of jurisdictions\u201d support the view that the death action is \u201cderivative\u201d and maintainable only if decedent had a claim at death. <em>Id. </em>at 53. But he notes that in \u201ca substantial minority of states\u201d the death statute has been construed as creating an independent cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 54. It is observed that where the authorities permit an independent action \u201cdouble recovery is not permitted. In some jurisdictions this is done by defining the measure of recovery in the respective actions in mutually exclusive terms. In others, where the measure of damages overlap, the beneficiaries are precluded from seeking items of damage recoverable by the decedent in his action\u201d. The Beporter\u2019s Note to the Tentative Draft includes the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">The jurisdictions that permit a subsequent action by the beneficiaries are a minority but perhaps a growing one, particularly given the potential influence of <em>Gaudet v. Sea-Land, Services, Inc., supra. </em>Of these jurisdictions, the only authorities supporting the proposition that the death action beneficiaries can sue even though the decedent lost his personal injury action seem to be <em>DeHart v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Ohio Fuel Gas Co., </em>80 <em>Ohio App. </em>62, 85 <em>N. E. </em>2d 586 (1948), and <em>Kais r Foundation Hospital v. Superior Court, </em>254 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 327, 62 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>330 (1967), the latter being inconsistent with <em>Secrest v. Pac. Elec RR., </em>60 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 746, 141 <em>P. </em>2d 747 (1943). The more widely held view in the jurisdictions that allow the subsequent action is that the beneficiaries of the wrongful death action have what amounts to a claim for supplemental damages following a judgment in favor of the decedent. See <em>Gaudet v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., supra, </em>and authorities cited therein. That is the view adopted in subsection (2) (b) of this Section. <em>[Id. </em>at 57]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We are not confronted in either this case, or in the companion case which we decide today, <em>Silverman v. Lathrop, supra, </em>with the specter of a double recovery. The damages sought and recovered by Coneetta Alfone for her personal injuries will not overlap the damages recoverable by her surviving parents and daughter. Coneetta recovered for her pain, suffering and disability, past and future, as well as her incurred and projected medical expenses. She made no claim for future lost earnings\u2014-the real wellspring of potential double damage claims. Her survivors under our law may recover in this action for funeral and burial expenses and the pecuniary value of any lost services to them, including the deprivation to the daughter of her mother\u2019s care, nurture and guidance during minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">It will be time enough to deal with the precise mechanics of preventing a double recovery either in a judgment or settlement situation when an appropriate case comes before us.

Such feelings, though real and distressing, cannot be taken into consideration in determining the extent of the financial or pecuniary loss suffered by the survivors. However, financial loss does include not only actual monies which would have been contributed to or expended for the benefit of a survivor, but also includes the reasonable value of benefits which would have been received by a survivor from the decedent in the nature of services and assistance (as well as training and guidance to a child) if decedent had continued to live.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em>Cf.
