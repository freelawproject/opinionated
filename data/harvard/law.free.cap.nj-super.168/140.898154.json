The reasons for the trial judge\u2019s denial of relief and dismissal of the action are stated in his written opinion, 161 <em>N. J. Super. </em>414 (Cty. D. Ct. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s assertion on this appeal that he occupied a room at the Passaic Y.M.C.A. as his only residence is insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to establish that he was not a transient guest within the meaning of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>3A:18-61.1. There is no basis for concluding that plaintiff and defendants entered into a tenancy that gave plaintiff a legal status other than that of a transient guest residing on a week-to-week basis at the Passaic Y.M.C.A., which plaintiff conceded to be a hotel for the purposes of this case. The protections afforded by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :18\u201461.1 expressly do not apply to transient or seasonal tenants residing at a hotel, motel or other guest house. Thus, we concur in the conclusion of the trial judge that plaintiff failed to establish a claim for being locked out of his room at the Y.M.C.A. without defendants having first obtained a judgment of possession pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:18-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
