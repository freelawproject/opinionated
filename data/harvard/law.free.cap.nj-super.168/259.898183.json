J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Afe\">Bobert M. Livingston, a licensed obstetrician-gynecologist, and Metropolitan Medical Associates, Inc., (MMA) an outpatient clinic directed by him and now licensed to perform abortions in this State, challenge the validity of the recently enacted \u201cTermination of Pregnancy Bule,\u201d <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.2, on procedural and federal constitutional grounds. The rule, which purports to regulate the performance of second trimester abortions, was promulgated by respondent New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) after public hearing and independent submission of medical documentation, expert reports and statistics.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The operative terms of the rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may be summarized as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>follows: Beyond the first trimester and \u201cwithin a period of gestation not exceeding 16 menstrual weeks and/or 14 gestational weeks\u2019 size,\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an abortion by the \u201cdilatation and evacuation\u201d method may be performed either in a licensed hospital <em>or </em>a \u201clicensed health care facility\u201d on an outpatient basis. Abortions to be-performed beyond that cut-off date, or by, any other medical procedure, must be performed in a hospital on an inpatient basis <em>only.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Appellants contend that <em>N. J. A. G. </em>13 :35-7.2 is invalid on procedural grounds because it .was not \u201cfinally adopted\u201d by the Board, and is unconstitutional as an infringement upon a woman\u2019s federal constitutional right to seek an elective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>abortion. They assert that in reviewing the rule in controversy wc <em>as </em>an appellate court must apply a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test rather than a \u201crational relation\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Addressing first the attack on procedural invalidity, we find this claim to he without merit. It appears from the minutes of the Board\u2019s regular meeting on May 10, 1978 that a proposed form of the rule was adopted by the Board after ratification of certain amendments and \u201cminor changes.\u201d The amended rule was then forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for a final review, as noted in the minutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">Following approval of the amendments the Board, upon motion made and duly seconded authorized the Office of the Attorney General to file the amended rule with the Division of Administrative Procedure or re-publish the rule if the Office of the Attorney General determines re-publication would be necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The Attorney General thereafter suggested several changes in language and sentence structure, as well as the deletion of a \u201creporting\u201d requirement contained in paragraph (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In all other respects, however, the substantive provisions affecting the performance of second trimester abortions remained intact. At its June 21, 1978 meeting, the Board expressly adopted and \u201cratified\u201d these recommended changes as their own, and authorized \u201cpublication\u201d of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Based on the record before us, we cannot accept the argument that the Attorney General usurped the Board\u2019s legislatively-prescribed function to make rules governing the practice of medicine. See <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>45 :9-2 <em>et seq. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Board had previously authorized that the rule be filed as one \u201cfinally adopted.\u201d The Board\u2019s acceptance of minor structural changes, which did not alter the operative terms of the rule, can only be construed as an adoption of the rule as final. Moreover, the direction to \u201cre-publish\u201d the rule in this context clearly suggests that publication of a final rule was intended. See also, <em>N. J. A. G. </em>15:15-3.2 and 3.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The second prong of appellants\u2019 challenge rests on federal constitutional principles. As a threshold matter, it now is well-settled that a woman\u2019s right to an abortion during the first trimester of. her pregnancy is a \u201cfundamental\u201d one. <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 <em>U. S. </em>113, 163, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>705, 35 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 147 (1973), reh. den. 410 <em>U. S. </em>959, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1409, 35 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 (1973) ; <em>Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 <em>U. S. </em>179, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>739, 35 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 201 (1973), reh. den. 410 <em>U. S. </em>93 <em>S. Ct. </em>1410, 35 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 694 (1973); <em>Doe v. Bridgeton Hospital Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>71 <em>N. J. </em>478, 490 (1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 433 <em>U. S. </em>914, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2987, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1100 (1977). However, this fundamental constitutional right is neither \u201cunqualified,\u201d 410 <em>U. S. </em>at 154, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>705, nor \u201cabsolute,\u201d 410 <em>U. S. </em>at 189, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>705, for the duration of pregnancy te term. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Roe v. Wade </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">* * <em>* </em>the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman\u2019s own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy. <em>[Roe v. Wade, </em>410 <em>U. S. </em>at 150, 93 S. Ct. 725]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Beyond the first trimester, then, the State has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in the health and safety of the mother, and by reason of that interest the State may promulgate rules which are \u201creasonably relate [d] to the preservation and protection of maternal health.\u201d <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>410 <em>U. S. </em>at 163, 93 <em>S. Ct </em>732.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Here, the State\u2019s (and the Board\u2019s) interest has clearly reached the \u201ccompelling\u201d point, given the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.2 purports only to regulate abortion procedures beyond the first trimester. Our review is therefore confined to the issue of whether the \u201cTermination of Pregnancy Eule\u201d is both \u201creasonably related to maternal health,\u201d and \u201cnarrowly drawn to express only the legitimate interests at stake.\u201d <em>Roe v. Wade, supra </em>at 155, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>728: <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 <em>U. S. </em>479, 485, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1678, 14 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 510 (1964); <em>Aptheker v. Secretary of State, </em>378 <em>U. S. </em>500, 508, 84 <em>S. Ct. </em>1659, 12 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 992 (1964). This is not to say that the rule before us is not entitled to the presumption of validity normally accorded to a rule enacted by an administrative agency. See, <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N. J. </em>544, 560\u2014563 (1978); <em>Garden State Comm. Hosp. v. State Bd. of Med. Exam., </em>147 <em>N. J. Super. </em>592 (App. Div.), certif. den. 74 <em>N. J. </em>283 (1977). We simply mean that, to the extent that a federal constitutional right is implicated, this court will closely examine the rule to determine whether the Board\u2019s action is both \u201creasonably related\u201d and narrowly circumscribed to avoid undue infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Based upon our careful review of the testimony taken at public hearing, as well as the exhaustive documentation presented to the Board, we hold that <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.2 is constitutional and a valid exercise of the Board\u2019s rule-making authority. As originally proposed, the rule would have limited <em>all </em>second trimester abortions to performance in hospitals on an inpatient basis, regardless of the medical procedure employed. The Board was directed to reconsider this position and hold public hearings on the proposed rule by order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In its present form the rule allows licensed outpatient clinics to perform \u201cdilatation and evacuation\u201d abortions through 16 menstrual weeks and/or 14 gestati-onal weeks. This expansion upon the rule as originally promulgated clearly responds to sound medical evidence presented to the Board, attesting to that procedure\u2019s safety during the early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>part of the second trimester. Indeed, the Board found, and the evidence demonstrated, that \u201cD &amp; E\u201d abortions are the safest of all available methods for the second trimester.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The rule, however, prohibits outpatient clinics from performing second trimester abortions by any alternative procedures, including that method commonly known as \u201csaline instillation.\u201d It is apparent from the record that the saline technique has been a predominant method for termination of second trimester pregnancies in the United States, although studies do mot reflect its use on a hospital or nonhospital basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the briefs before this court and at oral argument the controversy focused on whether the \u201c16/14 week\u201d cut-off date (for outpatient \u201cD <em>&amp; </em>E\u201d abortions) and the proscription against second trimester outpatient saline abortions constitute reasonable regulations. The evidence offered in this regard, particularly as to medical safety, was at best conflicting. According to one national study, the mortality rates almost double in the transition weeks from first to second trimester, rising from 3.6 deaths per 100,000 at 11\u201413 gestational weeks to 7.0 deaths per 100,000 at 13-15 weeks. The death rate jumps dramatically in the latter part of the second trimester to 19 per 100,000 at 16 gestational weeks or later.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The testimony and documentary evidence, moreover, indicated that abortions by the \u201csaline instillation\u201d method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>presented significantly greater risk frequency for complications, principal among those being hemorrhaging, infection, fever, perforation of the cervix or uterine wall, and retained products of conception (requiring additional surgical procedure for removal). The saline technique presented other extrinsic risks when performed on an outpatient basis. Normally, after instillation of the saline solution at the clinic, the patient is sent home to await the onset of labor. During this period there is neither direct supervision nor monitoring of the patient for complications or symptoms thereof. The patient has no assurances of timely diagnosis of morbid symptoms, no emergency facilities or operating room immediately at hand, and no guarantee of hospital admission if and when necessary. Dr. James Jones, presently affiliated with New Jersey\u2019s medical college, reported from his seven years\u2019 experience with New York State abortion programs that both mortality and complications rates were reduced dramatically after that State began to enforce an \u201cin-hospital\u201d requirement for all abortions beyond the twelfth week. The improvement was directly attributed to the hospital\u2019s superior facilities for early diagnosis of complications, continuity of care and on-site emergency treatment capability.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">By way of contrast, we note the remarkable safety record presented by MMA in its performance of saline abortions. With a <em>zero </em>mortality rate and favorable rates for complications, the record was \u201cimpressive,\u201d in the words of one Board member. Additionally, the experience of an outpatient clinic in the State of Washington reflects a similar impressive mortality rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The Board was therefore faced with competing expert medical opinions and data upon which to make its findings. Obviously, the factual record was not so compelling as was presented in <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>where the safety of first trimester abortions was found to be a \u201cwell established medical fact.\u201d 410 <em>U. S. </em>at 149, 163, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>705. There was, nevertheless, more than sufficient credible evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>upon which the Board could act, and in light of the conflicting nature of the proofs, we are constrained to defer to its expertise in evaluating the testimony. <em>Cf. In re Weston, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>258, 264 (1962), <em>cert. </em>den. 369 <em>U. S. </em>864, 82 <em>S. Ct. </em>1029, 8 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 84 (1964). It further appears that the regulation complies with the directive of <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">* * * Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements * * * as to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status * * *. [410 <em>U. S. </em>at 163, 93 S. Ct. 732]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It is our view that the rule\u2019s limitation on outpatient performance to early \u201cD &amp; E\u201d abortions is reasonably related\u201d to maternal health, especially in light of the unsettled state of medical opinion as to the safety of alternative procedures in the late second trimester.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Appellants\u2019 final argument that the \"in-hospital\u201d restriction will effectively bar many needed second trimester abortions is equally unavailing. We are not unmindful of the estimated \u201cneed,\u201d found by the Board to range from 5,000 to 7,000 second trimester abortions annually. There is also the problem of admittedly higher hospital costs for inpatient procedures, which will restrict young and poor women from obtaining treatment. It does not follow, however, that the Board must advocate a rule which in its opinion would be deleterious to maternal health. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Maher v. Roe, </em>432 <em>U. S. </em>464, 474, 97 <em>S. Ct. </em>2376, 2383, 53 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 484 (1977), \u201c[t]he indigency that may make it difficult \u2014 and in some cases,' perhaps, impossible \u2022\u2014\u25a0 for some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected\u201d by the regulation. In fact, the\" present rule does not effectively inhibit <em>all </em>second trimester abortions. <em>Cf. Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, </em>428 <em>U. S. </em>52, 77, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>2831, 49 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 788 (1976). Rather, it appears that the rule as enacted will allow for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the majority of second trimester abortions, which evidently fall within the early second trimester.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In view of all of the foregoing, it is our conclusion that <em>N. J. A. G. </em>13:35-7.3 is valid in that it was validly adopted by the Board of Medical Examiners and is reasonably related to maternal health.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The full text of the rule, as published in the <em>New Jersey Register </em>on August 10, 1978 (10 N. J. E. 351), reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">13 :35-7.2 Termination of pregnancy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">(a) The termination of pregnancy is a medical procedure which may be performed only by a physician licensed to practice medicine and surgery in the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">(b) Beyond the first trimester and within a period of gestation not exceeding 16 menstrual weeks and/or 14 gestational weeks\u2019 size as determined by a physician, termination of pregnancy using the dilatation and evacuation procedure shall be performed either in a licensed hospital or a licensed health care facility, and if any other procedure is used the termination of pregnancy shall be performed in a licensed hospital on an inpatient basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>(c) Termination of pregnancy by any procedure on patients with a gestation exceeding 16 mentsrual weeks and/or 14 gestational weeks\u2019 size as determined by a physician, shall be performed only in a licensed hospital on an inpatient basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">(d) Failure to comply with this rule may subject the physician to suspension or revocation of license to practice medicine and surgery in this State, pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:9-l et seq., and/or may subject any persons, association, corporation or institution to the sanctions and remedies set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:9-22, 45:9-26 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:9-27.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The rule was filed and became effective on June 23, 1978 as <em>B. </em>1978 d. 213.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The age or duration of a given pregnancy is measured in terms of weeks by either of two methods. By the first (and more widely used method), the physician counts the number of weeks from the date of the woman\u2019s last menstrual period. By the second, or \u201cgestational weeks\u201d method, the physician counts the number of weeks from the time of \u201cgestation\u201d which means that the woman actually became pregnant approximately two weeks after her last menstrual period. This latter determination is generally made through examination by ultrasonography. Thus, a pregnancy of \u201c16 menstrual weeks\u201d corresponds directly to one of \u201c14 gestational weeks.\u201d According to Dr. Michael Burnhill, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, the \u201cmenstrual weeks\u201d method is subject to considerably greater error than \u201cgestational weeks\u201d measurement, as the former depends for its accuracy upon the patient\u2019s recollection of when her last menstrual period occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Paragraph (d), which was deleted by the Board on the Attorney General\u2019s recommendation, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">(d) Hospitals and licensed outpatient facilities shall submit to the State Department of Health quarterly reports listing the number and type of procedures performed during first and second trimester pregnancy, including morbidity and mortality for each trimester. All such reports must observe patient anonymity. Licensed outpatient facilities shall submit to the department a current listing of the name and location of affiliated hospital(s).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The other recognized methods for second trimester abortions include saline instillation, delatation and curettage, hysterectomy, hysterotomy and injection of prostaglandin hormone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">According to a 1974 study by the Center for Disease Control, saline abortions accounted for 53% of abortions performed in the second trimester, <em>i. e., </em>at 13 menstrual weeks or later. We also note that in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, </em>428 <em>U. S. </em>52, 77, 96 <em>S. Ct. </em>2831, 2845, 49 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 788 (1976), the Supreme Court found that saline amniocentesis is an \u201caccepted medical procedure in this country\u201d and \u201cis employed in a substantial majority (the testimony from both sides ranges from 68% to 80%) of all post-first trimester abortions.\u201d Neither source provides a breakdown between hospital and nonhospital performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
