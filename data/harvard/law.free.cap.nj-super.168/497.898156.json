J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AsUM\">(retired and temporarily assigned). The Board of Education, Township of Wyckoff (Board) appeals from an order confirming an arbitration award in favor of Wyckoff Education Association (Association) and dismissing the board\u2019s complaint which sought vacation of said award.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>This ease involves the nonrenewal oif contracts of two nontenured teachers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the board decided not to renew those contracts the teachers filed a grievance, claiming that the hoard\u2019s actions violated the policies and procedures regarding teacher evaluation and, specifically, Article XVI of the collective bargaining agreement between the Association and the board concerning \u201cEvaluation Process.\u201d The grievance ultimately came before an arbitrator who decided in favor of the teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The arbitrator held: (1) as the Association conceded, it was the board\u2019s prerogative not to renew the grievant\u2019s contracts; <em>(2) </em>however, since the agreement between the parties provides a certain method of evaluation of probationary teachers, that procedure must be literally followed, and (3) since the board, after conducting its evaluations of the various nontenured teachers, provided that they should be \u201cranked\u201d (i. e., in the order in which the school administrators deemed them to be least effective), this was a deviation from the evaluation procedure as outlined in Article XVI of the labor contract and constituted a violation thereof. The arbitrator directed that the teachers received the yearly amount of wages they would have received if they had been reemployed, less any money earned by way of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We reverse. We conclude that to award the nontenured teachers the amount of wages they would have received if their contracts had been renewed, while at the same time recognizing that the board had the right not to renew them, amounts to compelling the board to pay damages for doing what it had the legal right to do. See <em>Union Cty. Bd. of Ed. v. Union Cty. Teachers Ass'n, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 74 <em>N. J. </em>248 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We recognize that the Association contends that it did not grieve the right of the board not to renew the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tracts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but rather did grieve the alleged violation of the \"Evaluation Process\u201d set forth in Article XVI of the contract. We conceive that to be a distinction without a difference. To seek damages for nonreappointment \u2014 for whatever reason except denial of due process \u2014 must nevertheless be based on a claim to a right of reappointment. See <em>Winston v. South Plainfield Bd. of Ed., 125 N. J. Super. </em>131, 143 (App. Div. 1973), aff\u2019d 64 <em>N. J. 582 </em>(1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Moreover, Article IV, \u00a7 1 of the contract, concerning the \"G-rievanee Procedure\u201d, expressly provides so far as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\"><em>The non-reappointment of a pretenure teacher is not subject to this grievance procedure. </em>This does not preclude an appeal regarding due process in the reappointment procedure. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Thus it is that only denial of due process in the reappointment procedure is grievable. But the Association agrees in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">In this contract the evaluation procedure is precisely designed to provide \u201cdue process\u201d <em>(i. e. </em>notice and the opportunity to he heard).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">There was no denial of due process here. Each of 'the four teachers was notified in writing that the board had determined not to reappoint them for the 1976-77 school year. As the arbitrator said in his decision: \u201cThe four teachers requested a hearing before the Board after they were told the reasons for their nonrenewal in the latter part of May. The hearing was held on June 10, 1976 after which the Board rehired two of the four.\u201d Thus the board followed the procedure outlined by statute <em>(N. J. S. </em>A. 18A:27-3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) and regulation <em>(N. J. A. 0. </em>6:3-1.20) and even allowed the teachers to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>heard by the board in order to convince the members of the board to oiler reemployment. In fact, two of the four teachers were reappointed. See <em>Donaldson v. North Wildwood Bd. of Ed., </em>65 <em>N. J. </em>236 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The Association contends that the fact that the board \u201cranked\u201d the nontenured teachers was in excess of its power and violated the contract. We disagree. No statute or regulation dictates the criteria the board may use in its evaluation process (as distinguished from procedure). The arbitrator\u2019s reasoning in his finding that \u201cranking\u201d was violative of the contract was expressed in his opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">Simply stated, under the agreed upon [contract] evaluation procedure, the Board says to the probationary teacher: \u201cDo a fine job and we\u2019ll keep you on.\u201d Under the ranking system, the Board says something else to the probationary teacher. \u201cDo a fine job but that may not be enough; because if everybody else does a better job, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We submit that such reasoning would deprive the board of that power which everyone concedes is a management prerogative, namely, the right not to renew the contracts of nontenured teachers. This is so because if the first of the arbitrator\u2019s interpretations is to be followed <em>(i. e. </em>\u201cDo a fine job, and we\u2019ll keep you on\u201d), it amounts to a binding obligation on the part of the board to renew the contracts of all nontenured teachers who do a \u201cgood job.\u201d No such obligation exists. Further, since the board must adopt some criteria upon which to base its decision, ranking seems to be a perfectly logical one. In <em>North Bergen Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. North Bergen Fed. Teachers, </em>141 <em>N. J. Super. </em>97 (App. Div. 1976), it was held that the issue of the school board\u2019s right to select candidates for promotion from either within or without the local system involves major educational policy and as such must be considered managerial prerogative. So here as to the criteria the board shall use in determining whether or not to renew the contracts of nontenured teachers. This accords with the board\u2019s duty that the children of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>district shall receive a \u201cthorough and efficient education.\u201d <em>Ridgefield Park Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Ridgefield Park Bd. of Ed., </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>144, 156 (1978). To ascribe to \u201cranking\u201d an invidious connotation seems to us to be flying to the realm of fantasy. If the board had not expressly established ranking, what would it, in reality, do in reaching the decision to renew or not to renew? Obviously it would subjectively \u201crank\u201d the teachers under consideration to determine which to renew and which not to renew. To express such a process is no less logical, natural or desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">It is clear to us that the arbitrator in substituting his concept of criteria for evaluation for that of the board intruded upon the exclusive managerial prerogative of the board. See <em>Dunellen Bd. of Ed. v. Dunellen Ed. Ass\u2019n, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>17, 25-26 (1973); <em>In re Byram Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>152 <em>N. J. Super. </em>12, 21 (App. Div. 1977); <em>Bernards Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. Bernards Tp. Ed. Ass\u2019n, 79 N. J. </em>311 <em>(1979); In the Matter of Maywood Bd. of Ed., </em>168 <em>N. J. Super. </em>45 (1979). Thus, the award was the result of undue means. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:2A-8. <em>Held v. Comfort Bus Lines, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>640, 641-642 (Sup. Ct. 1948); <em>cf. Local Union 560 v. Eazor Express, Inc., </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>219, 227-228 ,(App. Div. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We therefore reverse the confirmation of the arbitrator\u2019s award and order that it be vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">lnitially four nontenured teachers\u2019 contracts were not renewed.
