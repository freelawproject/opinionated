J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A_i\">(retired; temporarily assigned). This case involves the propriety of an order of the Public Employee Relations Commission (PERC) concerning certain actions taken by the Maywood Board of Education (board) and which the Maywood Education Association (Association) charged were unfair labor practices (hereafter ULP) within the meaning of the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(a) (1) and (5) (hereafter the act).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The thrust of the Association\u2019s complaint is that the board refused to negotiate the reduction of its teaching force when it dismissed one tenured librarian, did not renew the contracts of several nontenured teachers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and expanded the work day of kindergarten teachers and the \u201cpupil contact time\u201d of two physical education teachers. The Association also contends that PERC erred by not awarding a monetary remedy for such violations of the act as PERC found to have been committed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In its opinion reported at 3 <em>NJPEB </em>377 (1977), PERC held: (1) the board\u2019s decision to dismiss Joan Conley, a tenured librarian, was lawful and was not negotiable; (2) however, the board violated the act by refusing to negotiate regarding the \u201cimpact\u201d of dismissing Ms. Conley both as to her and as to the remaining librarian, and the impact of the reduction in force (hereafter RIE) on the terms and conditions of employment of the remaining teachers; (3) the board must, within 60 days of the decision, restore the <em>status quo ante </em>as to the working hours of the kindergarten and physical education teachers and negotiate the impact on those teachers for the period during which their work load was changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The Association appeals, contending that the PERC order was inadequate as to the remedy for the unfair labor practices of the board and that this court should order compensation to the affected teachers for labor performed in excess of preexisting terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The board cross-appeals. It contends that PERC\u2019s order was in error (1) in requiring it to negotiate the \"impact\u201d of its RIF; (2) in requiring it to restore the <em>status quo ante </em>as to the kindergarten and physical education teachers, and (3) in requiring it to negotiate the impact of its action with respect to those teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On its part PERC contends that the board waived its right to appeal the PERC order since it did not take exception to the recommended report of the hearing examiner, most of which was adopted in the PERC decision. PERC seeks enforcement of its order pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A~5.4 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Thus the issues are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">(1) Is the impact of Conley\u2019s dismissal negotiable (as to her) ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">(2) Is the impact of the THE on the remaining librarian and other teachers negotiable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">(3) Is the increase in the work load of the kindergarten teachers negotiable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">(4) Is the increase in \u201cpupil contact time\u201d of the physical education teachers negotiable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">(5) Did the board waive its right to appeal by not filing exceptions to the hearing examiner\u2019s report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-12\">(6) Whether PERO should have made a monetary award for the unfair labor charges which are sustained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">(7) Whether an enforcement order should issue as to matters which are now moot (0. <em>g., </em>by settlement of the issue concerning the kindergarten teachers)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">\n<em>Negotiation of the \u201cimpact\u201d of the RIF on Joan Conley (tenured librarian).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">It is uncontroverted that the RIE by the board was for reasons of economy. Therefore, PERC held the dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>of Conley was lawful pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:38~9. Nevertheless. PERC also held that the \u201cimpact\u201d on Conley from \u201cher discharge to her reemployment\u201d must be negotiated as long as such negotiations do not concern back pay during the period of her layoff. We agree that back pay for Conley would be impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We have some difficulty in understanding just what the Association contends would be negotiated as to Conley, since her dismissal was concededly lawful. Neither PERC nor the Association has specified what would be the subject of such negotiation. She had no employment relationship with, the board as a result of her lawful discharge. Therefore, negotiation of the impact of the RIE on her during the time of her discharge is outside the scope of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34.J3A-1 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In fact, we conceive that it is inherently illogical to hold on the one hand that dismissal of Conley was entirely lawful and on the other to say that the board must, by negotiation, face adverse consequences from that lawful dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The Association\u2019s argument does imply that since Conley was a tenured teacher she has reemployment rights, and negotiation as to terms and conditions of reemployment is mandatory. <em>Cf. Union City Bd. of Ed. v. Union Cty. Teach. Ass\u2019n, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 74 <em>N. J. </em>248 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">PERC has previously held that procedural matters dealing with recall and retention are mandatorily negotiable. <em>Cinnaminson </em>Township, 4 <em>NJPEB </em>4039 (1978); <em>Montville Bd. of Ed., </em>3 <em>NJPEB </em>330 (1975). We disagree. The reemployment rights of tenured teachers are established by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>18A :38-13, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>If any teaching staff member shall be dismissed as a result of such reduction, <em>such person shall be and remain upon a preferred eligible list in the order of seniority for reemployment whenever a vacancy occurs in a position for which such person shall be qualified and he shall be reemployed by the body causing dismissal, if and when such vacancy occurs </em>and in determining seniority, and in computing length of service for reemployment, full recognition shall be given to previous years of service, and the time of service by any such jjerson in or with the military or naval forces of the United States or of this state, subsequent to September 1, 1940 shall be credited to him as though he had been regularly employed in such a position within the district during the time of such military or naval service. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>18A :28-13 the Commissioner of Education is empowered to establish detailed procedures and standards for reemployment. Accordingly, under <em>N. J. A. G. </em>6 :3\u20141.10 he has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The issue as to the negotiability of reemployment rights was recently dealt with by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. State Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>54 (1978). There the union argued that provisions under the Civil Service statute regarding reemployment were terms and conditions of employment. The union wanted to negotiate over the criteria and procedures for reemployment. PERO agreed with the union and issued a negotiation order. The State contended that reemployment proposals were not subject to negotiation since they either concerned managerial responsibilities or were terms and conditions of employment which were controlled and preempted by Civil Service statutes and regulations. The court agreed and reversed PERO\u2019s order requiring negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The test for determining whether the adoption of a specific statute or regulation sets a term and condition of employment, thereby preempting negotiation, depends on whether the statute [s] or regulation[s] \u201cspeak in the imperative * * * [or] permit a public employer to exercise a certain measure of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. State Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>at 81. The court defined mandatory or imperative statutes as \u201cthose enactments which set up a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>particular scheme which \u201cshall\u201d be handled as directed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, n. 7. Where a statute or regulation sets a minimum \u25a0level of rights, negotiation to afford an employee a greater protection is allowable. Where a statute sets down both a minimum and a maximum right, mandatory negotiation is required for a level of protection fitting between. However, where a statute sets a maximum level of rights, \u201cno proposal to affect that maximum is negotiable nor would any contractual provision purporting to do so be enforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In the case at bar, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A :28-12 sets forth a maximum level of rights. It mandates that a RIFed tenured teacher <em>shall </em>be reemployed pursuant to seniority where a vacancy occurs in the future. Pursuant to statute, the Commissioner of Education has established the standards for the determination of seniority for reemployment lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In <em>State v. State Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>the Commissioner of Civil Service, pursuant to statute, adopted a regulation implementing the statutory right to reemployment. The court found that the statutory scheme set out mandatory procedures for dealing with reemployment rights. Hence, \u201cthere is nothing upon which the parties could agree concerning these matters, as they are comprehensively regulated by statute and [agency] rule.\u201d 78 <em>N. J. </em>at 87.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The same conclusion is applicable here. The act lays down a maximum right which is substantively fixed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>statute and proeedurally controlled by the regulation of the Commissioner of Education. There is no indication of an intent of the Legislature to permit negotiation and agreement to supplant the reemployment statute and regulation. Therefore, an order to negotiate the- impact of the discharge on the reemployment of Conley is impermissible. And since no employment relationship existed between the board and herself during the period of her dismissal, the order to negotiate the impact of the RIF on her during the time of her discharge is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\n<em>Negotiation of the \u201cimpact\u201d of the reduction in term-red and nonienured staff on the remaining librarian and teachers.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"> Reduction in force (RIF), whether of tenured or nontenured teachers, if done for reasons of economy, is entirely within the authority of the board. The relevant statutory provision so ordains. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>18A :28-9. However, PERO ordered the board to negotiate the impact of RIF on the terms and conditions of employment of the remaining librarian and teachers. We disagree and reverse the order to that effect. Again, how can the board be logically confronted with possible adverse consequences from an action which was incontrovertibly lawful?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">PERO has held that if the effect of a managerial decision impacts on terms and conditions of employment, the impact on the terms and conditions of employment must be negotiated. See <em>Oinnaminson, </em>4 <em>NJPWR </em>4039 (1978). Accord, <em>In re Rutgers, the State University, </em>2 <em>NJPER </em>13 (1976), where it was said that where managerial decisions relate to terms and conditions of employment they are negotiable if they \u201chave an effect or impact upon the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d Here the board contends that to negotiate the RIF is useless, since the only way to restore the <em>status quo ante </em>of other teachers is to rescind the lawful reduction in personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The theory behind the notion that \u201cimpact\u201d is negotiable is based on the premise that it is a \u201cpermissive\u201d subject of negotiation. See, <em>e. g., Burke v. Bowen, </em>49 <em>A. D. </em>2d 904, 373 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 387, affd. 40 <em>N. Y. </em>2d 264, 386 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 654, 353 <em>N. E. </em>2d 567 (Ct. App. 1976), where the New York court recognized three categories of negotiable subjects: mandatory, permissive and illegal, and held that the \u201cimpact\u201d of a reduction in force on work load is a <em>permissive </em>subject of negotiation. See also, Annotation, \u201cBargainable or Negotiable Issues in State Public Employment Labor Relations,\u201d 84 <em>A. L. R. </em>3d 242, 291 (1978). But New Jersey has'not recognized a \u201cpermissive\u201d area of negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The New Jersey courts have held that decisions of educational policy or managerial responsibilities are illegal <em>subjects </em>for negotiation. No case recognizes a permissive area of negotiation. See <em>Dunellen Bd. of Ed. v. Dunellen Ed. Ass\u2019n, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>17 (1973) (decision to consolidate departments matter of education policy) (hereafter <em>Dunellen) ; Ridgefield Park Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Ridgefield Park Bd. of Ed., </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>144 (1978) (teacher transfers and assignments not negotiable) ; <em>Chappell v. N. J. Ed. Comm\u2019r, </em>135 <em>N. J. Super. </em>565 (App. Div. 1975), certif. den. 69 <em>N. J. </em>84 (1975) (initiation and dissemination of student tests matter of managerial prerogative); <em>Burlington Cty. Col. Fac. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>10 (1973) (school calendar not negotiable) ; <em>North Bergen Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. North Bergen Fed\u2019n Teachers, </em>141 <em>N. J. Super. </em>97 (1976) (right to select management candidates from within school system not negotiable); <em>Union Cty. Bd. of Ed. v. Union Cty. Teach. Ass\u2019n, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>435 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 74 <em>N. J. </em>248 (1977) (decision to reduce personnel not negotiable) ; <em>Bernards Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. Bernards Twp. Ed. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 <em>N. J. </em>311 (1979) (decision to withhold teachers\u2019 salary increment not negotiable).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In <em>In re Byram Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>152 <em>N. J. Super. </em>12 (App. Div. 1977), the parties requested PERC to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>certain decisions were mandatory subjects for negotiation. PERC held that several of the topics were permissive subjects of negotiation. The board of education did not take issue with the question of whether there was a category of permissive negotiation as opposed to mandatory and illegal subjects for negotiation. However, the <em>amicus curiae </em>brief maintained that there was no \u201cpermissive\u201d area and matters were either negotiable or nonnegotiable. The <em>amicus </em>alleged that <em>Title </em>34 of the Revised Statutes provides only for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment and that managerial decisions which possibly \u201cimpact\u201d on terms and conditions are not subject to negotiation. The court refused to deal with the issue since it was presented in the <em>amicus </em>brief. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">The subject-matter of permissive negotiation is not germane to the Board\u2019s appeal, which requires only a resolution of whether certain matters were correctly determined by PEItC to be mandatorily negotiable. We therefore decline to consider at this time whether nonmandatory subjects may be negotiated on a permissive basis, or whether the issue is within the jurisdiction of PERO in a scope of negotiation proceedings. An <em>amicus curiae </em>must accept the case before the court with the issues made by the parties. <em>4 Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Amicus Curiae, </em>\u00a7 3 at 111 (1962). We doubt that it may raise an issue not raised by them. See <em>Endress v. Brookdale Community College, </em>144 N. <em>J. Super. </em>109, 123 (App. Div. 1976). In any event, we prefer that the difficult and possibly controversial implications of permissive negotiations should await a case in which the issue is squarely presented, [at 18],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">However, the court in <em>By-ram </em>recognized that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>84:13A-1 <em>et seq. </em>only requires that \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of employment be negotiated. It does not provide that <em>impact </em>of managerial decisions be negotiated. The court noted that it was \u201cnot yet evident that the standard evolved by PERO is necessarily inconsistent with the Dunellen standard * * 152 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">But in <em>Ridgefield Park Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Ridgefield Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>at 162, the Supreme Court held that there were <em>only two </em>categories of negotiable subjects, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cmandatorily negotiable terms and conditions of employment and non-negotiable matters of governmental policy,\u201d and that only the Legislature could create a permissive category of negotiation. See, <em>e.g., N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-16 (h). There the court went on to reject PERC\u2019s contention that it could order that the issue of teacher transfers and assignments be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the collective negotiation agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, unless the Legislature recognizes \u201cpermissive\u201d negotiation, the impact of a managerial decision on terms and conditions is not negotiable. To allow such impact to be negotiated would indirectly contravene the <em>Dunellen </em>analysis which was so strongly reaffirmed in <em>Ridgefield Park.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Applying that conclusion to this case, there is no doubt but that the decision to reduce teacher personnel was based on a managerial prerogative. Therefore, the impact on the remaining teachers is not negotiable. Hence, the order directing the board to negotiate the impact of the reduced manning on the remaining librarian and teachers is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\n<em>Negotiability as to the increased work load of the Kindergarten teachers.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Effective in the 1975-1976 school year the board increased the working hours of the kindergarten teachers by 20 minutes per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Although motivated by a concern for students\u2019 safety, the increase in the teachers\u2019 work day was a unilateral change in terms and conditions of employment. While a change in the students\u2019 school day is permissible, a change in the length of the teachers\u2019 work day is mandatorily negotiable. <em>In the Matter of North Brunswick Tp. Bd. of Ed., </em>4 <em>NJPER </em>4205 (1978); <em>Galloway Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. Galloway Tp. Ass\u2019n of Ed. Sects, </em>78 <em>N. J. 1 </em>(1978); <em>Ridgefield Park Ed. Ass\u2019n, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>144 (1978); <em>In re Byram Tp., supra, </em>152 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Therefore, the order of PEEC requiring negotiation over the change in the kindergarten day is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\n<em>The increase in \u201cpupil contact time\u201d for physical education teachers Alino and Peters.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In 1975-1976 the board assigned extra \u201cpupil contact time\u201d duties to two physical education teachers, Alino and Peters. There were other such teachers in the system but the record is unclear as to how many there were. However, the record does show that such other teachers had 90 minutes a week more of such time than Alino and Peters. And it is the board\u2019s contention that the increase in pupil contact time for Alino and Peters was ordered to equalize their teaching load with that of the other physical education teachers. PEEC held that the expansion of the contact time of Alino and Peters was a <em>per se </em>violation of the terms and condition of employment and as such was negotiable. It ordered that within 60 days the board (1) restore the <em>status quo ante </em>of Alino and Peters and (2) negotiate in good faith concerning the \u201cimpact\u201d on these teachers during the period when the work load of those teachers was unilaterally increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\"> It is well established that the extent of teacher pupil contact time is mandatorily negotiable. <em>Middlesex Cty. Coll. Bd .of Trustees, </em>4 <em>NJPER </em>4023 (1978); <em>In re Byram Tp. Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>152 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 26. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>board contends that if the increase in time of the two. teachers is within the negotiated terms of the contract between the parties, or accepted past practices, it is not impermissible. Rather, says the board, if it is within the terms of the contract or past practices, it is not a violation of the terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We agree. In <em>Red Bank Bd. of Ed. v. Warrington, </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>564 (App. Div. 1976), the board unilaterally ordered the primary school teachers to teach classes during periods that were previously free periods. Since the order was a direct violation of the \u201cpast practice clause\u201d of the contract, the court held that the additional assignments were arbitrable. The primary consideration, therefore, is whether the additional assignment of pupil contact time to Alino and Peters exceeded the terms of the contract and the past practices of the physical education teachers in the district. See <em>In the Matter of North Brunswick Tp. Bd. of Ed., supra, </em>4 <em>NJPER </em>4205 (1978). This is also the rule of law followed by .the national Labor Relations Board (ULRB). A change in terms and conditions of employment is lawful when consistent with past practices or authorized by a collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Gorman, Labor Law, </em>400 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The record before PERC is devoid of any consideration of the terms of the contract between the parties or past practices concerning the mutually accepted pupil contact time. This issue must therefore be remanded to PERC for hearing and findings with respect to the relevant terms and conditions of the contract and past practices. Additionally we note that if PERC finds no change in the pupil contact time as set forth in the contract or past practices, an order to negotiate impact of increased pupil contact time would be erroneous. Therefore, the order herein appealed from is reversed and the matter is remanded to PERC for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\n<em>Whether the Board waived its right to appeal by not filing exceptions to the Hearing Examiner\u2019s report.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On this appeal PEEC strenuously argues that by failing to take exception to the hearing examiner\u2019s report, under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the hoard has waived its right to appeal from PEEC\u2019s decision. Initially, we note that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has no place in this appeal. The board had argued all the positions it now urges on appeal before the hearing examiner, and therefore it exhausted its administrative remedy. PEEC, nevertheless, in support of its position, cites its own regulations which provide that any party may file exceptions to the hearing examiner\u2019s report <em>(N. J. A.'C. </em>19:14-7(a) and further, <em>N. J. A. 0. </em>19:14^7(b), which provides that \u201cAny exception which is not specifically urged [before the hearing examiner] shall be deemed to have been waived.\u201d) PEEC thus contends that the board\u2019s arguments on appeal must be addressed only to the propriety of the restoration of the <em>status quo ante </em>of the work loads of the kindergarten and physical education teachers, and to those arguments of the Association seeking a remedy beyond that which the hearing examiner recommended. With these modifications it is said that the hearing examiner\u2019s order became the final order of PEEC. It is further argued that its regulations are \u201cessentially identical\u201d to the effect of the National Labor Eelations Act (29 <em>U. 8. C. A. </em>\u00a7 160(a) <em>et seq.). </em>PEEC then cites several decisions of the federal courts which preclude parties from appealing a decision of the NLBB if no exception had been taken to the report of the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">We reject PEEC\u2019s reliance on the federal sphere under the National Labor Eelations Act (NLBA) for its argument that the hearing examiner\u2019s report can become the decision of the Commission. The provisions of NLEA and the New New Jersey Employer-Employee Eelations Act are fundamentally distinct from one another. Under the former the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>statute expressly provides that the report of the \u201cexaminer\u201d (or member of the Board who may hear the evidence), if no exceptions are taken to his recommendations, \u201cshall become the order <em>of the Board * </em>* 29 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 160(e), emphasis supplied. On the other hand, no provision of the act under which PERC operates grants adjudicatory power to a hearing examiner or provides that his order may become the order of the Commission. Under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4 (c) the Commission is to decide an unfair labor- practice charge. The statute also provides that the Administrative Procedure Act <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>52:14B-1 <em>et seq.) </em>shall be applicable. Thereunder, a hearer\u2019s report is to be filed with the agency involved and the \u201chead of the agency\u201d shall adopt, reject or modify the recommended report. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:14B-10(c). Thus, it is the Commission which decides the matter. It does so on a review of the entire record. It is therefore axiomatic that the hearer\u2019s report is not the final decision, whether or not exceptions are taken thereto. It would be an unreasonable construction of the act to conclude that the Commission should be bound by a report if it contained a clear mistake of law. For example, in this case the hearing examiner found that Ms. Conley, the tenured librarian, could not be dismissed without prior negotiations. S-ucli a holding is contrary to existing law, and. PERC itself held so here as it has in prior decisions. See also, <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>18A:28-9. Further, to accept PERC\u2019s contention in this respect would prohibit this court from reviewing the hearer\u2019s decision, however erroneous it may be. We cannot thus emasculate this court\u2019s power to review actions of an administrative agency. We conclude that PERC\u2019s adoption of its regulation <em>(N. J. A. G. </em>19:14-7(b)) purporting to insulate the hearer\u2019s erroneous decision in the absence of exceptions is beyond its power and contrary to the statute under which it ioperates. We therefore hold that failure to except to the report of the hearing examiner does not constitute a waiver of the board\u2019s right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Whether there should ham been a monetary award for those unfair labor charges which ham been sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In <em>Galloway Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. Galloway Tp. Ass\u2019n of Ed. Sec\u2019ts, supra, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1978), the Supreme Court determined that PERC has the power to order reinstatement and back pay as a remedy for unfair labor practices. Accordingly, where PERC finds that a party has violated <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(a), it can \u201cmake the affected employees whole for their <em>actual </em>losses sustained by reason of the commission of an unfair practice * * <em>Id. </em>at 16; emphasis supplied. Accord, <em>N. L. R. B. v. Martin Gleason, Inc., </em>534 <em>F. </em>2d 466, 479 (2 Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">See also, <em>In re Galloway Bd. of Ed., </em>157 <em>N. J. Super. </em>74 (App. Div. 1978)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, where the court affirmed a PERC back pay award. However, the court reversed a monetary award to split session teachers who worked an extra 15 minutes for the reason that none of the affected teachers actually suffered a loss of income by reason of the increase in the teachers\u2019 work day. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">* * *\u25a0 split session teachers here suffered no <em>loss of income </em>by reason of the 15-minute increase in their work-day. Their salary remained the same as that of teachers working a seven-hour day. The award did not make them whole; rather, it gave them more than they were actually entitled to. We therefore modify PERC\u2019s decision and order by vacating so much thereof as orders the payment of l/200th of the 1975-1976 annual salary to the split ses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>sions teachers in question. [157 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 84; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The only unfair labor practice which we have sustained in this case relates to the increase in work day of the kindergarten teachers. However, those teachers did not actually lose money thereby. Accordingly, the Association\u2019s request that monetary \u201cmake whole\u201d damages be awarded is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">YII</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>PERG\u2019s request for cm enforcement order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">PERO now asks this court, pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(f), to issue an enforcement order with respect to the unfair labor charges it sustained. Since we have sustained such charges only with respect to the kindergarten teachers, such request must now be limited to that area. PERC ordered the board to negotiate with the Association concerning the impact of the increased work day and also ordered the <em>status quo ante </em>be restored within 60 days.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The board objects to the issuance of an enforcement order concerning the kindergarten teachers since the underlying issues are moot. Specifically, the board argues: (1) the Association has withdrawn its objection to the increase in kindergarten hours, and (2) the board and the Association have reached a subsequent collective negotiation agreement concerning the kindergarten teachers\u2019 work day and compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">However, PERO still seeks enforcement of its order below, which requires negotiation as to the impact of the increased work day pursuant to <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>In <em>Galloway Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. Galloway Tp Ed. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>tho court noted that mootness does not necessarily prevent PERO from seeking an enforcement order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">The judicial enforcement of PERG\u2019s nonself-executing orders directed by that statute will serve as a pointed deterrent against resumption of the practices PERO found to be violative of the Act. There can be no guarantee that a party charged with an unfair practice, having voluntarily ceased its unlawful conduct, will not at some future time disavow its adherence to the Act\u2019s requirements. The imposition of a continuing obligation on that party to conform its conduct to law is the best means of diminishing the likelihood that it will repeat its demonstrated disdain for employee rights and statutory mandate. [78 <em>N. J. </em>at 46]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In that case the hoard unilaterally withheld a salary increment from the teachers. Subsequent to the institution of appellate proceedings the board and the Association ratified an agreement concerning tho salary increments. The Supreme Court held that mootness of issues, resulting from a collective negotiation agreement, occurring after the commission of unfair labor practices but before decision in appellate proceedings, does not vitiate PERC\u2019s discretionary authority to seek judicial enforcement of its prior order. In <em>Galloway Tp. Bd. of Ed. v. Galloway Tp. Ass\u2019n of Ed. Sec\u2019ts, supra, </em>six of the seven secretaries in the Association charging the unfair labor practices left the Association before appellate review. The Supreme Court held that the fact that most of the charging parties had left did not constitute a dissolution of an association. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">The Association remains a potentially viable entity so long as the jobs encompassed in the unit it represents continue to exist. In such circumstances, compliance with PERG\u2019s negotiating order could be possible, depending upon post-enforcement events. [78 <em>N. J. </em>at 23-24]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Accord, <em>Red Bk. Reg\u2019l Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Red Bk. Reg\u2019l High School Bd. of Ed., </em>78 <em>N. J. 122 </em>(1978), wherein the court held that an Association has an independent right, separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>from its members, to file a labor grievance. Mootness does not vitiate PERC\u2019s authority to seek an enforcement order if there is a \u201cconceivable likelihood of repetition of the Board\u2019s unlawful conduct * * <em>Galloway Tp. Ass\u2019n Ed. Sec\u2019ts, supra, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>at 24. This is because the \u201cexistence of a continuing relationship between the parties * * * provides the opportunity and thus increases the possibility that unlawful conduct will be repeated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>Galloway Tp. Ed. Ass\u2019n, </em>78 <em>N. J. </em>at 34, the court sets forth the charging party and PERC\u2019s role in an unfair labor practice proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">However, this role changes as the unfair practice proceeding progresses. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(c) directs that all cases in which an unfair practice complaint has issued \u201cshall be prosecuted before [PERC] * * * by the representative of the employee organization or party filing the charge or his authorized representative.\u201d Consistent with the statutory mandate, PEEC\u2019s regulations state that \u201cthe charging party * * <em>* </em>shall prosecute the case and shall have the burden of proving the allegations of the complaint by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>N. J. A. 0. </em>19:14-6.8. The decision as to whether the party charged in the complaint has committed an unfair practice and, if so, the determination of the appropriate remedy therefor are to be made by PERC. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>34:13A-5.4(c). PERC\u2019s role at this stage of the unfair practice proceeding is an adjudicative one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">PERC\u2019s involvement in the proceedings is independent of that of the charging party once there is a determination that an unfair practice has been committed. Therefore, the fact that a charging party withdraws its objection to a change in terms and conditions after a decision that an unfair practice has been committed does not divest PERC of its discretion to seek an enforcement order. Therefore, even though the issue as to the kindergarten teachers is moot so far as the parties are concerned, PERC\u2019s order which mandates negotiation of the issue is still viable. In that respect its application for such an order is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\n<em>Conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We conclude that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">(1) PEKC\u2019s decision is <em>affirmed </em>insofar as it holds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">(a) that Ms. Conley\u2019s dismissal was lawful and is not negotiable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">(b) the increase of the work day of the kindergarten teachers is negotiable and an enforcement order shall issue with respect thereto even though the issue may be moot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">(c) a monetary award is not appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">(2) PEKC\u2019s decision is <em>reversed </em>insofar as it holds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">(a) the \u201cimpact\u201d of its reduction in force (RIE) of tenured and nontenured staff is negotiable as to Conley and the remaining teachers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">(b) the increase in \u201cpupil contact time\u201d of the physical education teachers is negotiable and the <em>status quo ante </em>shall be restored as to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">(3) The issue as to the increase in pupil contact time of the physical education teachers is remanded to PEKC for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
