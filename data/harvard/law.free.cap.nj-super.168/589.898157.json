The only contention on appeal is that the trial judge erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized in a car driven by defendant after it was stopped for a routine \u201clicense and registration check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">At 11:30 a.mi. on November 13, 1976 defendant was driving northwardly on the New Jersey Turnpike. Defendant was driving a full-sized sedan bearing Florida license plates. A trooper ordered appellant to stop. His explanation for doing so was \u201cI was observing traffic. I observed his vehicle go by. It appeared to be weighed down in the rear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The trooper asked for defendant\u2019s license and registration. While checking them the trooper testified that he smelled marijuana \u201cemanating from the interior of the car.\u201d He emphasized that it was not coming from the rear of the car. However, he requested defendant to open the trunk and defendant did so. The State conceded that it was not contending that this was a consensual search. In any event, inside the trunk the trooper found and seized three Dog Chow bags containing 99 pounds of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The State seeks to justify the search on the heretofore recognized ground that the police have a right to stop vehicles at random and demand production of the operator\u2019s driver\u2019s license and motor vehicle registration. <em>State v. </em>Gray, 59 <em>N. J. </em>563, 567 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The Fourth Amendment issue thus implicated is now controlled by the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>State of Delaware v. </em>Prouse, - <em>U. S. </em>-, 99 <em>S. Ct. </em>1391, 59 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 660 (1979). There it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">[W]e hold that except in those situations in which there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver\u2019s license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. [99 <em>8. Ot. </em>at 1401]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In our view the fact that, according-to the trooper, the trunk was weighted down did not amount to a reasonable suspicion that either the vehicle or its occupant was subject to seizure for violation of law. This was nothing more than a \u201crandom stop\u201d and search. Therefore, under <em>Prouse, </em>it was unreasonable under the Eourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">However, in supplemental memoranda the State contends that since the search here occurred prior to the <em>Prouse </em>decision it can have no retroactive effect and therefore cannot dictate the rightness or wrongness of the search involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We disagree. In <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 <em>U. S. </em>618, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1731, 14 L. <em>Ed. </em>2d 601 (1965), the court discussed the issue as to \u201cretroactive\u201d effect of the new principle of search and seizure law established in <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U. S. </em>643, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>1684, 6 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1081 (1961). The court quoted from Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Schooner Peggy, </em>1 <em>Cranch </em>103, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>49 (1801) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201c \u2018It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied * * \u201d [381 <em>U. S. </em>at 626, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1736, 14 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 606]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>Linkletter </em>concluded that, in general, a change of law will be given effect while a case is on direct review, citing <em>Schooner Peggy, supra. </em>However, since Linkletter\u2019s case had been finally decided before <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>its ruling was not to govern in the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On the other hand, in two cases which had not been finally decided on appeal at the time of the <em>Mapp </em>decision, its principles were applied to those cases. See <em>Ker v. California, </em>374 <em>U. S. </em>23, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1623, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 726 (1963) ; <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 <em>U. S. </em>85, 84 <em>S. Ct. </em>229, 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>L. Ed. </em>2d 171 (1963); <em>Stoner v. California, </em>376 <em>U. S. </em>483, 84 <em>S. Ct. </em>889, 11 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 856 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">However in later years the United States Supreme Court held that the direct appeal/collateral review distinction was not an ironclad rule and that \u201c There are no jurisprudential or constitutional obstacles\u2019 to a different cut-off point.\u201d <em>Desist v. United States, </em>394 <em>U. S. </em>244, 252, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>1030, 1035, 22 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 248 (1969); <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>719, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1772, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 882 (1966). Eather, the obligation to determine the retroactivity of constitutional decisions lies within the province of the state court. See <em>State v. Lueder, </em>74 <em>N. J. </em>62, 70 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In Hew Jersey the cases concerning retroactivity suggest the distinction between cases pending on direct review and those on collateral review. Compare <em>State v. Smith, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>481 (1962), <em>cert. </em>den. 374 <em>U. S. </em>835, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>1879, 10 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1055 (1963), and <em>State v. Evans, </em>78 <em>N. J. Super. </em>437 (App. Div. 1963), with <em>State v. Smith, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>67 (1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 379 <em>U. S. </em>1005, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>731, 13 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 706 (1965), and <em>State v. McNulty, </em>84 <em>N. J. Super. </em>30 (App. Div. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Therefore, since this appeal was still pending at the time of the <em>Prouse </em>decision, its principle of exclusion of seized material effected on a \u201crandom stop\u201d and search is applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
