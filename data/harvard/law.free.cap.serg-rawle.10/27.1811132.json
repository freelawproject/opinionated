This <em>scire facias </em>was originally brought by <em>James Jilrichs, </em>who married one of the daughters of the intestate, for her share, and was subsequently assigned to <em>James Williams, </em>and in the action entitled <em>Jilrichs </em>for the use of <em>Williams, </em>the jury was sworn. The parties went to trial, on the plea of payment, with leave to give the special matters in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">There was no attempt to prove a direct payment. Other estate of the intestate had been taken by several of his children. <em>Jllricks </em>and <em>Kean </em>took one estate, and <em>Jilrichs </em>alone, another in <em>Mifflin </em>county. <em>Kean </em>likewise took a farm in <em>Dauphin </em>county, valued at <em>\u00a33,125, </em>part of which he sold to Mr. Fisher,\u2022 the residue was sold by the sheriff, as the estate of <em>Kean, </em>at the suit of <em>Moses Mc Lean, </em>who had married a daughter of the intestate, and had obtained a judgment for his purpart out of the tract. A feigned issue was directed by the Court of Common Pleas to ascertain what was due on the recognizance binding this tract, to each of the distributees; in which <em>Jilrichs </em>was made a party. He disclaimed of record, and disavowed the authority to make him a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">The defendants on the trial in the court below, contended, <em>first, </em>that <em>Jilrichs </em>had permitted this property to be sold without any notice to the purchaser. <em>Second, </em>that he and <em>Kean </em>took land in <em>Mifflin, </em>and he conveyed his interest to <em>Kean. Third, </em>that he released to <em>Kean </em>all his interest in the farm in <em>Dauphin </em>county. <em>Fourth, </em>that suit was brought by Mr. <em>McLean, </em>for his wife\u2019s distributive share in the farm, and <em>Jilrichs </em>disclaimed on record, all interest in that recognizance. The defendants, after giving a variety of evidence, gave in evidence the record of the action brought by <em>MiLean </em>against <em>Kean, </em>the feigned issue, and the disavowal of <em>Jllricks. </em>This action was brought to <em>May, </em>1812: the feigned issue was entered of <em>May, </em>1818. The plaintiff then gave in evidence a release of the 26th <em>October, </em>1806, from <em>Jllricks </em>to <em>Kean, </em>of all the <em>Dauphin </em>tract, and offered a letter from <em>Kean </em>to <em>Jilrichs, </em>dated in 1805, requesting him to release his interest in the land sold to Mr. <em>Fisher, </em>as he would not pay the purchase money with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>out releases, and stating that there was some other property to make him safe. This evidence was objected to by the defendants, and admitted by the court, who sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\">The plaintiff offered in evidence an assignment of his claim in this action to <em>James Williams, </em>dated 19th <em>June, </em>1807. This was also objected to by the defendants, and admitted by the court, and an exception taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-5\"><em>Fisher, </em>for the plaintiffs in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">1st. That the letter was not evidence, because it was written after <em>Kean </em>had conveyed the property: and the declarations or acts of the vendor, after parting with the property, are not evidence to affect the purchaser. 5 <em>Johns. </em>412, 426. <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Gonzalus, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>536.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">2. The assignment after the action brought, was inadmissible. It was an act of the party himself, and in no respect relevant to the merits of the cause. It may have had an improper effect on the jury, as it brought forward the claim of a party as assignee instead of the original party to the transaction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-8\"><em>Elder, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">1. Before the letter was offered, , the defendants had given evidence of sundry matters, from which they inferred that <em>Jllricks </em>had received full payment of his wife\u2019s share. They proved that <em>Jllricks </em>had disclaimed taking any share of the money raised by the sale of the <em>Dauphin </em>farm, and we had shown a release. The evidence was offered to explain the cause of this release. It was all part of one transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">2. The evidence on the other point went only to show who was the real plaintiff. The jury were sworn in a suit entitled for the use of <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b29-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b29-12\">Duncan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVa\">after stating the facts. The objection is, that as this title was subsequent to the conveyance from <em>Kean </em>to <em>Orth, </em>no acts or declarations of <em>Kean </em>could affect a purchaser. It is to be observed, that <em>Orth </em>bought with full notice of this recognizance. The title to <em>Kean </em>could only be deduced through these proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-13\">The decision of this court, when the cause was brought up on a former occasion, that no declaration of <em>Kean, </em>subsequent to his conveyance, could be given in evidence to affect a put chaser, has no relation to the question now raised. For one of the grounds of defence is, the disclaimer on record of <em>Jllricks </em>to any thing out of the <em>Dauphin </em>farm: and evidence of this was given by the plaintiffs in error, to raise a presumption that <em>Jllricks </em>had been paid all his claims on all the estate of <em>John Hamilton </em>taken by <em>Kean. </em>With no other view .could this evidence have been given. Now, it would be most unjust, to preclude <em>Jllricks </em>or his assignee from explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>this transaction, from showing why this release' had been given,- and why he disclaimed of record, and that so far from his receiving his wife\u2019s share out of the whole estate of her father taken by <em>Kean, </em>he had not even received her portion of this tract, but relied on <em>Kean\u2019s </em>declaration, that there was oth\u00e9r property sufficient to pay him. This would fully account for .the entry on the record, and show that it was quite consistent with his retaining his lien on the\u2019 house. The plaintiffs in error gave evidence of a transaction subsequent to the conveyance to <em>Orth, </em>between <em>Kean </em>and <em>Mricks* </em>To deny to' <em>Mricks </em>all means of rebutting the presumption of payment from this circumstance, by evidence of <em>the </em>whole transaction, its origin, the leaving notice, and the consideration, would have been a perversion of justice, and every rule of evidence. It would be suffering one party to select one link in the chain of a transaction, while it was denied to the other to produce the whole chain,to show what the transaction really was. It was evidence direct, to do away all indirect inference which a partial statement might have raised, and which a full disclosure would dissipate. The assignment to <em>Williams </em>was proper evidence. It was -referred to in-the record of the action; a paper in- the cause. The jury was sworn-in a cause in which <em>Williams </em>had been substituted as the real party in interest, and the assignment became a part of his title. If it was attempted to be used for any other purpose, to give to <em>Williams </em>an additional equity, by means of this assignment, superior to what <em>Mricks </em>had, at the time of the assignment, the court should have been called on to instruct the jury, that <em>Williams </em>stood in the shoes of <em>Mricks. </em>The abuse of evidence, after it has been read, can be no objection to its admission. If it was evidence.for any thing it was properly admitted. And though afterwards, an attempt might be made, in argument, to use it to prove that for which it was not competent eyidence, this could not, by relation, affect the exception, nor by matter <em>ex post facto, </em>vitiate that which was properly received, though improperly used. It was notvery important evidence, but it was not impertinent. The evidence was properly received in both instances. The letter being important to the defendant in error, rendered necessary by the introduction of evidence relative to a transaction between <em>Kean </em>and <em>Mricks, </em>subsequent to the grant by <em>Kean, </em>which by garbling the circumstances, giving evidence of what was done, thus raise the presumption, that from the act so done, another act might reasonably be inferred, which a full disclosure would remove. The assignment, though not necessary to be given in evidence, to support the claim of <em>Williams </em>as the substitute of <em>Mricks, </em>yet was not so totally irrelevant, as to justify its rejection, referred to, as it was, in the record, and sworn as the jury were, in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
