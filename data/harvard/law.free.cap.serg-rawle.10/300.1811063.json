The two events in view here were, 1st, the death of <em>C. Stayman </em>before her husband; in such case her estate was to go to her representatives. 2d. The death of her husband before her.

This is the plain meaning of the agreement, though not well expressed. The last part of the agreement is plainly to this effect, and the first part is not inconsistent. \u201cThey shall remain at her, disposal at the day of her death.\u201d Consider the situation of the. parties at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the time of making the agreement. The plaintiff was a widow about to marry. The object was to secure her separate property for her children in case she died first. But if he died first, there was no occasion for this. They would be provided for out of his estate. Wherever the agreement speaks of the property going to the wife, her heirs are. mentioned. But when the husband is spoken of, there is no mention of his executors. There is no provision that if he died first she shall have no part of his estate. This construction will do justice to the plaintiff who is entitled to one half of her husband\u2019s property, he having died intestate, and without issue: and it would be unjust that she should first take her own personal property, and then half of her husband\u2019s.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-5\"><em>Ramsey, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">According to the defendant\u2019s construction, \u00a3665 4s. <em>6cl., </em>the amount of the personal property, might remain in the hands of the administrator of her husband, and in consequence of it she might starve. This never could have been the intent. The instrument should, as far as it is possible, be construed in her favour. He drew it and executed it, alone. It is, moreover, a marriage article, which is always to be liberally construed to effectuate the intent. 3 <em>Atk. </em>91, 93. 69. 103. Her great object was to save her own personal property for herself. According, to the plaintiff\u2019s construction, there was no security at all if the husband died first: for he might have bequeathed the whole personal estate to other persons.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b302-8\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQeM\">I refer to the case stated by the parties to this suit, on which the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Cumberland </em>county was given. <em>Catharine Bosler, </em>and her. late husband <em>Jacob Bosler </em>deceased, entered into articles of agreement previous to their marriage, on the construction of which the pre- . sent suit depends. The question is, whether the personal property mentioned in the articles, which belonged to the plaintiff at the time of the marriage, was to be enjoyed by her immediately after her husband\u2019s death, in case she survived him, or whether she was only to have the right to dispose of it by her will, but no enjoyment of it during her life. The agreement is very badly drawn. Almost every sentence is not only bad grammar, but obscure. On \u25a0reading the first part, one would think, that the wife was intended to have no more than .the right of disposing of her personal estate by her will, but the latter part seems to show a different intention. The plaintiff had some real estate, which her intended husband was to enjoy during her life, and upon the whole, the understanding appears to have been, that he should have the use both of the plaintiff\u2019s real, and personal estate, <em>during their joint lives, </em>and no longer; if she died first, it was to go to her devisees, if she made a will, otherwise to her heirs and personal representatives; but if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>she survived her husband, she was to take it on his death. He binds himself in the penalty of <em>\u00a3 </em>1200, to deliver both real and personal estate <em>to the plaintiff, Or her heirs at the day of her death. </em>That is, as I construe it, to herself in case she survived her husband, or to her heirs, on the day of her death, if she died before him. To deliver the property to her on the day of her death; would be of no service to her; and therefore, the delivery to her, and the delivery to. her heirs on the day of her death, referred to two different events. If she survived her husband, the delivery was to be to her, immediately on his death. But if she died before him, it was to her heirs on the day of her death.- After all, I will not say, that the meaning which I give to this instrument, is clearly expressed. But it is the best I can make of it, taking all <em>its </em>parts into consideration.. I am of opinion <em>therefore, </em>that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas should be reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Duncan, J. gave <em>no </em>opinion not having heard the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment entered for the plain-tiff in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
