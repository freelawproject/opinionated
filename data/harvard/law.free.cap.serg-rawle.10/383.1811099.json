A motion was now made on behalf of the defendant for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-11\">The plaintiff claimed under <em>William Oxley, </em>who derived his title from <em>Thomas Howard. </em>A patent was issued to <em>Thomas Howard </em>on the 26th <em>September, </em>1687, and another patent to <em>William Oxley, </em>on the 22d <em>April, </em>1706, which contained a recital of the mesne conveyances bringing down the title from <em>Thomas Howard, to William Oxley. William Oxley, </em>died in the year 1717, leaving a son <em>John, </em>(who removed to the Island of <em>Barbadoes, </em>where he remained until his death,) and a daughter <em>Honoria </em>married to <em>George Harmer. George Harmer </em>died in the year 1732, and his wife <em>Honoria, </em>in the year 1742, leaving children. The plaintiff claimed through the descendants of <em>John Oxley </em>in the male line, and contended that from the evidence in the case, the jury might <em>presume </em>that the title of <em>Honoria Harmer </em>was vested in those under whom he claimed, either by deed of conveyance, or by descent. If the plaintiff was right in these pretentions, he would be entitled to two-thirds of the premises. He also claimed the other third through the descendants of <em>John Oxley </em>in the female line. The defendant showed no title but stood upon his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-12\">To raise the presumption contended for ,by the plaintiff, that the title of <em>Honoria Harmer </em>was vested in those under whom he claimed, either by deed of conveyance or by descent, the plaintiff relied on the following facts which appeared in evidence. <em>William </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Oxley, </em>the patentee, died in 1717, and from that time to the year 1746, there was no positive evidence in whom the possession was. But there was proof, of possession in <em>John </em>and his descendants, by an inclosure of the lot, receipt of the rents, and the payment of the taxes, from the year 1746 to the year 1783, when <em>Captain Mason, </em>the father of the real defendants entered: and there was no evidence whatever, that <em>Honoria Harmer </em>or her issue ever had exercised or claimed any possession, received or claimed any part of the rents, or paid or was called on to pay any part of the taxes. There was no evidence what had become of her children, from the time of her death to the period of trial. <em>John </em>lived in <em>Barbadoes, </em>and received the rents, and paid the taxes by his agents here. <em>Honoria </em>lived here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">On the trial, the plaintiff for the purpose of proving an ancient possession in <em>William Oxley, </em>offered in evidence a paper, certified by the surveyor general to be a true copy of a <em>list of the first grantees or renters from the proprietaries </em>extracted from book No. 31, remaining in his office. To this evidence the defendant objected, but the objection was overruled, and. the paper admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">The plaintiff also offered in evidence the deposition of <em>John William Sober </em>taken with others by virtue of a commission issued out of this court to commissioners in the Island of <em>Barbadoes. </em>This commission was returned under an envelope, to which the names and seals of the commissioners were affixed. The return by the commissioners was made on the commission in the following form. <em>\u201c The execution of this commission appears by the examinations hereto annexed.\u201d </em>The examinations however were not strictly annexed or fastened to the qommission, but were detached papers. The commission required the commissioners to reduce the testimony to writing and return it <em>\u201c closed up under their seals, plainly and distinctly set:\u201d </em>but did not order them to annex the testimony. Each deposition was subscribed by the commissioners. This evidence was objected to by the defendant, and received by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">The plaintiff also offered in evidence a copy of the register of marriages, baptisms and burials of the parish of <em>St. Michael, </em>in the Island of <em>Barbadoes, </em>certified to be a true copy by the rector of the parish, and proved by the oath of <em>Samuel Beresford </em>taken before <em>John Jl. Beckle, </em>deputy secretary of the Island and notary public. It was proved that <em>Beckle </em>was deputy secretary and notary public and his handwriting as well as the handwriting of the rector were also proved. The certificate of <em>Beckle, </em>was given under his hand and the notarial seal of office. To this paper the defendant objected, the court however admitted it, reserving the point whether it was legal evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">On the subject of the presumption relied on by the plaintiff, the Chief Justice stated and remarked on the evidence, and declared, that he would not say the jury were bound by law to presume a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>conveyance to <em>John Oxley </em>of the right of <em>Honoria Harmer, </em>but he left it to them to decide, whether from the circumstances of the case they were satisfied, that her right must have been conveyed to or descended on the male branch of the family.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-6\"><em>Broome, </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">1st.

This copy was admitted upon the authority of the case of <em>Hyam\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>2, in which it is stated, that in 1759, a copy of the register of births and deaths of the people called <em>Quakers, </em>in England, proved to be a true one before the Lord Mayor of London, was allowed to be given in evidence to prove the death of a person. This is a very loose note, assigning no grounds for the decision. There is no reason why <em>ex parte </em>evidence should be received of a parish register, rather than of any other paper. If this case be good law, it ought not to be extended: the seal of <em>London </em>might be recognised by this court for particular reasons; but that is no ground for recognising any other seal. The present seal is that of a notary public, but the act was not properly a notarial act. In <em>England </em>the parish register is evidence of births, deaths, and marriages: and, as far as relates to marriages, is provided for by an act of parliament, which enacts several precise regulations. 1 <em>Phill. </em>Evid. 306. But a copy of a register of baptisms kept in the Island of <em>Guernsey </em>is not admissible in their courts of law: nor is the copy of a register of a foreign chapel admitted there as a proof of a marriage abroad. <em>Ib. </em>308. 2 <em>Phill. Evid. </em>148. The admission of the registry kept by religious societies in this state, of marriages, births and burials, depends on an act of assembly, passed in 1700, which provides for their admission in evidence. 1 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws, </em>20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-10\">4th. There is no ground for a legal presumption that <em>Honoria Harmer\u2019s </em>interest had been conveyed to the male branch. Presumption is matter of law. <em>Stoever v. Whitman\u2019s Lessee, 6 Binn. </em>419. It is dangerous to trust the jury with presumptions. In 1722, this lot was vacant, because the deed for the adjoining lot from <em>G. Harmer </em>to <em>John Oxley </em>of <em>Barbadoes, </em>is said to be bounded on the west by a vacant lot, which is the lot in dispute. The first appearance of actual possession after <em>William Oxley\u2019s </em>death is a receipt by <em>J. Oxley\u2019s </em>agent, in <em>1748, </em>for two years rent. In 1742 <em>Honoria </em>died. There can be no presumption without adverse possession, and none such existed during <em>Honorin\u2019s </em>life time. Legal seisin carries with it the possession unless there is adverse possession. <em>Mather v. Trinity Church, </em>3 <em>Serg.&amp; Rawle, </em>514. Besides if <em>J. Oxley </em>had possession, he had itas tenant in common with <em>Honoria </em>and after her death with her children. Now it is well established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>that the possession of one tenant in common is the possession of all: if one enters it enures to the benefit of all. <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Dunning\u2019s Lessee, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>385. Bare perception of profits is no ouster of a tenant in common. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Vanderen, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>67. The entry or possession' therefore of <em>John </em>gave him no exclusive right which could divest that of <em>Honoria </em>or her children, To ground a presumption of a conveyance, it is not only ne, cessary there should be exclusive possession but also acquiescence in the other party. <em>2 Browne\u2019s Rep. 292, 2 Cruise, </em>558.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-6\"><em>J.

The extract from the book No. 31, contained the whole of the list. It was evidence upon the same principle that the list of names of such persons as were original purchasers was admitted in 1774 in the case of <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Dippo, </em>l <em>Dall. </em>20, and 1782 in the case of <em>Morris\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Vanderen, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-8\">2d. The objection to the deposition was, that it was not annexed, but the .commissioners were not required to annex the examinations. It was enclosed in a cover under the seals of all the com, missioners and was verified by their subscriptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-9\">3d. As to the <em>ex parte </em>proof of the parish register of <em>Barbadoes,. </em>The copies of parish registers are evidence. <em>Dike </em>v. <em>Polhill, </em>1 <em>L. Ray, </em>744. Whenever an original is of a public nature and would would be evidence if produced, an immediate sworn copy thereof is evidence. <em>Lynches. Clerk, </em>3 <em>Salk. </em>154, <em>King </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Gordon, <em>2 Doug. 593, </em>note. 4 <em>Dall. 415. </em>The handwriting of the deputy secretary, and that of the rector, were proved by a witness on the trial: and also that <em>Beckles </em>was deputy secretary and a notary. The only objection of any weight is, that the proof was <em>ex parte, </em>but the case of <em>Hyam\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>1 <em>Dall. 2, </em>is analogous. In <em>Douglas\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Sanderson, 2 Dall. </em>116, 1 <em>Yeates, </em>15, a leaf said to be cut out of a family bible, annexed to and proved by a notarial certificate from another state was admitted to prove pedigree. In 1 <em>Yeates, </em>17, is cited the ease of <em>Fogler\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>occuring since the Revolution, where the Supreme Court held an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit made in <em>England </em>good evidence in case of pedigree. So <em>Winder </em>v. <em>Little, </em>1 <em>Yeates, </em>152, is an authority that an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit is good evidence to prove the identity of a person so far as respects his marriage or pedigree. In <em>Montgomery\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Dickey, 2 Yeates </em>212, the court remark that the rules of evidence as to pedigree as well as boundary are very lax from the* nature of the two cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-11\">4th. The charge of the court ought not to be complained of by the defendant. In truth it was more favourable to him than he had a right- to expect: and the presumption of law was decidedly in ourfavour. It was not the case of tenants in common. Wecontended that <em>Honoria Harmer </em>was in no respect owner of any part of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>lot. Her will makes no mention of it. There was no evidence of any children of <em>Honorio, </em>heard of for 78 years, and if they were all extinct, the title descended to the male branch. There was no evidence of any kind of possession by her of any part of this lot, or by any deriving title under her, or of any Claims by them. But possession was proved in 1746 in <em>John Oxley, </em>and always after till <em>Captain Mason </em>took possession. There were 60 years and upwards from the death of <em>William, Oxley </em>to <em>Mason\u2019s </em>entry. From all the circumstances of the case the presumption was strongly in our favour that the title had been transferred: for otherwise it was impossible to account for their existence. In <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Hepburn, 5 Cranch, </em>263, a deed of partition was presumed after possession in severalty about 35 years. In <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Baxter, 2 W. Bl. </em>1228, there, was possession 72 years under a lease for 1000 years, and it. was held that the court might recommend it to the jury to presume the mesne assignments so as to bring the title down to the plaintiff. He also cited 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>196. 2 <em>Inst. </em>118. 10 <em>John. </em>377. 12 <em>Rep. 5. </em>2 <em>Hen. &amp; Mun. </em>370. 1 <em>Bay, 26. 1 Phill. Evid. </em>124. <em>2 Sm.

There was no evidence whatever that her children died without issue.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b387-8\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3Tv\">(after stating the case.) Several questions of law arose on the evidence, in the course of the trial, which are now to be considered, as well as one on the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">1. The plaintiff in order to show an ancient possession in <em>William Oxley, </em>offered in evidence, a paper, certified by the surveyor general, to be a true copy of <em>a list of the first grantee or renters from the proprietaries, </em>extracted from book No. 31, remaining in his office. This evidence was objected to by the defendant, but the objection was overruled. The book which contains the list in question, is among the public books preserved in the land office, and the list itself, it must be presumed, was made out, from ancient papers, many of which may now be lost, or perhaps not in existence. It may be presumed too, that it was made out, as a matter of public convenience, and not with a view to private disputes. Under such circumstances it ought to be evidence, and a paper of a similar kind has been decided to be evidence. There is in the land office, an ancient list <em>o\u00ed first purchasers from William Penn. </em>This was admitted in evidence, in the case of <em>Morris\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Vandwin, </em>(1 <em>Dall. </em>64.) and has often since been received without opposition. One of the defendant\u2019s objections to this evidence was, that the <em>book itself </em>should have been produced. But this was unnecessary, as copies of all public papers remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>in the land office, are, by act of assembly, as good evidence as the originals. The copy, in this case, was a copy of <em>the whole list. </em>Ah extract containing only <em>part </em>of it, might have been objectionable: If, for any particular reason, either party had chosen to have the book itself produced, it might have been had, by issuing a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>directed to the surveyor general. But this course ought not to be taken, without special cause, because it may produce public inconvenience, by obliging the principal officers to leave their stations, in order to attend the trial. I am of opinion, therefore, that it was proper to admit its evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AVo\">2. The 2d exception was to the deposition of <em>John William Sober, </em>taken on a commission issued to <em>Barbadoes, </em>and offered in evidence by the plaintiff. The commission was returned under an envelope, to which the names and seals of the commissioners were affixed. The return itself was in th* \u00bfblowing form, \u201c the execution of this commission appears by the examinations <em>hereto annexed.\u201d </em>The objection' is, that the examinations were not annexed, that is, fastened to the commission. In strictness of speech, they were not annexed. But it sufficiently appeared, that they were the genuine depositions, not only from their being inclosed in a cover under the hand and seal of the commissioners, but because each deposition was subscribed by them. These commissions are extremely expensive, and should not be overthrown on slight grounds. It certainly is best, that the depositions should be actually annexed to the commission, and I would recommend it to the gentleman of the bar, to give directions in all cases to attend to this matter. B\u00fct, as I am satisfied, that no fraud or imposition was practised in the present instance, I\" think the evidence ought not to have been withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">3. The 3d exception was to the admission of a copy of the register of marriages, baptisms, and burials, of the parish of <em>Si. Mi- ' chael, </em>in the Island of <em>Barbadoes, </em>certified to be a true copy, by the rector of the parish, and proved by-the oath of <em>Samuel Beresford, </em>taken before <em>John ./l. Beckles, </em>deputy secretary of the Island, and notary public. It was proved that <em>Beckles </em>was deputy secretary, and notary public, and his hand-writing, as well as the handwriting of the rector wer ealso proved. \u25a0 The certificate of <em>Beckles, </em>was given under his hand and notarial seal of office. This paper was ob jected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and as I thought it worthy of consideration, I admitted it in evidence, reserving the point for the court in bank. When the evidence was offered, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel cited the case of <em>Hyam </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>(I <em>Dall. </em>2.) in which it was decided, that a copy of the register of births and deaths of the people called Quakers in <em>England, </em>proved to be a true copy by an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit before the lord mayor of <em>London, </em>was good evidence in cases of pedigree. That case is very much in point, and although I did not approve of its principle, I Would not overrule it at <em>NisiPrius, </em>especially as I thought it pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>bable, it might have been followed by subsequent decisions l\u00a3 now appears that it has been followed in several cases. In <em>Fogler\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>(cited in 1 <em>Yeates, </em>17,) it was held, that an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit made in <em>England, </em>was evidence in cases of pedigree. And in the <em>Lessee </em>of <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Sanderson </em>(1 <em>Yeates, </em>15,) an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit, made at <em>Wilmington, </em>in the state of <em>Delaware, </em>before a notary public, was admitted in evidence to verify a leaf torn out of a family bible, in which the birth of children was entered. Mr. <em>Bradford, </em>who opposed the evidence, contended, that affidavits of that kind should be confined to cases where the evidence was brought from beyond sea, and Shippen, J. was of opinion, that in general it should be so confined, although in that case he agreed to the admission of the evidence, from the particular circumstance of the case (the original leaf being produced in court.) I said before, that I was not satisfied with the rule established in these cases, because there is no more reason to admit <em>ex parte </em>affidavits in cases of pedigree, than in other cases, where it appears that better evidence is in your power. Where it is known that a register exists, a copy may always be regularly proved by sending a commission. There are some vague and loose reasons assigned in <em>Yeates\u2019s </em>reports, for the admission of the evidence, such .as, the necessity of relaxing the rules of evidence in cases of pedigree, without drawing any line for the regulation of the rule. I take it, that the real motive which induced the court to admit the evidence, was, the difficulty and expense of procuring evidence from beyond sea. That appears to have been Me. Ship-pen\u2019s opinion, for he says, in the case of <em>Douglass\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Sanderson, \u201cit must not be understood that ex parte affidavits, made in other states are admissible in evidence in eases of pedigree.\u201d </em>Considering all the authorities then, we must take it, that the case of <em>Hyam </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>is law, and I do not see how the present case can be distinguished from it. In both, the evidence came from beyond sea, and in some respects the case before us is the strongest of the two, because besides the affidavit of <em>Beresford, </em>the copy was certified by the rector of the parish, whose hand-writing was proved, as was also the hand-writing of the notary.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">4. The last reason assigned for. a new trial, is, that the jury were left at liberty to presume a conveyance from <em>Honoria Harmer </em>to the male branch of the <em>Oxley </em>family. In my charge, I repeated theeyidence; and made some remarks on it, and in conclusion, told the jury, that although I would not absolutely <em>direct </em>them to presume a conveyance, yet they were at liberty to do so if they thought the evidence warranted it. Upon subsequent reflection, it appears to me, that if either party has reason to complain of this charge, it is the plaintiff; because I might without invading the rights of the jury, have <em>recommended to them </em>to make the presumption. Where the facts are plain, the judge may with great propriety tell the jury, either that they <em>ought, </em>or <em>ought </em>not, to make the presumption. But in th e present case, I did not think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the evidence so clear on the point of possession, as to call on me for a peremptory charge, in favour of a presumption of a conveyance. It was proved that <em>William Oxley </em>the patentee, died in the year 1717, and there was no positive evidence who had the possession from that time to the year 1746. Yet there were circumstances from which the jury might perhaps be inclined to think, that from the time of <em>William Oxley\u2019s </em>death the exclusive possession had been in his son <em>John, </em>and his descendants. There was positive' proof, however, of possession in <em>John, </em>and his descendants, by an <em>inclosure </em>of the lot, receipt of the rents, and payment of the taxes, from the year 1746 to the year 1783, when captain <em>Mason, </em>the father of the real defendants, entered. And there was no evidence whatever that <em>Honoria Harmer, </em>or her issue, ever had exercised or claimed any possession, received or claimed any part of the rents, or paid, or was required to pay any part of the taxes. Indeed there was no evidence, what had become of her children from the time of her death to the moment of the trial. Now, from <em>Honoria\u2019s </em>death to the trial, was a period of 81 years; during 37 of which the male branch of the <em>Oxley </em>family had the absolute possession. How is this to be' accounted for but by a presumption that the title of <em>Honoria Harmer </em>had been vested in the' male branch of the family? In eld times, it was not customary to put deeds on record, although there was a law authorising the recording. It was not till the year 1775, that an act was passed <em>requiring </em>them to be recorded. It is true, that,- supposing the title of <em>William Oxley </em>to have descended to his son <em>John) </em>and daughter <em>Honoria, </em>the entry of <em>John </em>would have enured to the benefit of Honoria. They would have been tenants in common, and the bare perception of the profits by <em>John, </em>would.not have been an ouster of <em>Honoria. </em>But there were strong circumstances, added to the perception of the profits. <em>John </em>lived in <em>Barbadoes, </em>and received the rents, and paid the taxes, by his agents here. <em>Honoria </em>lived on the spot, and so it must be presumed, did her children. Now it is out of the usual course of human affairs, that under such circumstances, neither <em>Honoria Harmer, </em>nor her children, should have made any manner of claim, supposing them to have title. It is true, that prior to the year 1785, it required 60 years to bar a title by the statute of limitations. But since the year 1785, twenty-one years adverse possession is a bar. So that for ought that appears the descendants of <em>Honoria, </em>if any there are in existence# would be bound by the adverse possession of the defendant. Indeed the counsel for the plaintiff contended, that inasmuch as there was no evidence of the existence of any issue of <em>Honoria </em>it should be presumed that they were extinct, in which case if they died before the year 1794, there title would have descended to the male' branch. The law is so, and the fact of there being extinct was left to the jury. I do not know, that there is any positive rule defining the time necessary to create a presumption of conveyance. In case of easements# and other incorporeal hereditaments# which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>do not admit of actual possession, the period required by law for a bar by the statute of limitations is usually esteemed as sufficient ground for presumption. But that rule is not always applied to cases admitting of actual possession. In such, the period of presumption has been varied according to circumstances. In the case of <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Hepburn, </em>(5 <em>Cranch. </em>263. 276.) a deed of partition was presumed after about 35 years possession in severalty. In <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>(2 <em>Wm. Black, </em>1228,) possession had been held 73 years, under a lease for 1000 years. The party in possession was unable to produce all the mesne conveyances down to himself, and the court decided, that it might be left to the jury, with a recommendation to presume the conveyances. The rational ground for presumption is, when the conduct of the party out of possession cannot be accounted for without supposing that the estate has been conveyed to the one who is in possession. That appears to me, to have been the present case, and therefore, I am of opinion that the verdict should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
