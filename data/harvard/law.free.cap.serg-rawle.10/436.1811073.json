Mrs. <em>Miller </em>died on the 4th <em>March, </em>1819, and her death was suggested in the record. It was proved on the trial, that <em>Hill </em>was in possession of a two story house and stable in the rear of the lot; the remaining part of the property, being a distinct messuage and lot, was in possession of the heirs of <em>Alexander Miller. </em>It was admitted that <em>Alexander Miller </em>on the 6th day of <em>December, </em>1800, had title to the premises, and that on the 6th day of <em>December </em>of the same year he filed his petition in the Court of Common Pleas, of <em>Philadelphia </em>county, praying for thebenefitofthe insolvent laws then ih force, to wit, the act of the 4th <em>April, </em>1798. On the <em>20th December, </em>1800, he was discharged by the court, having mad\u00e9 an assignment to <em>Charles Browne </em>and <em>Alexander Elmslie, </em>in trust, for the use of his creditors, by a short indorsement on his petition. On th\u00e9 26th <em>April, </em>1814, <em>Browne </em>and <em>Elmslie </em>signed a paper, which on the 21st <em>Jamiary, </em>1815, was filed in the Court of Common Pleas, setting forth, that they had never acted as trustees of <em>A. Miller, </em>and declined doing so; and on the 21st <em>January, </em>1815, <em>Gray </em>and <em>Heberton,- </em>creditors of <em>Miller, </em>filed a petition in the same court of Common Pleas, setting forth that <em>Browne </em>and <em>Elmslie </em>had never acted as assignees, and praying the court to appoint others in their place. On the same day, <em>Heberton </em>and <em>Gray, </em>the plaintiffs in this ejectment, were appointed by the'court, in the room of <em>Browne </em>and <em>Elmslie. </em>On the 24th <em>June, </em>1817, the court approved of <em>Philip Justice </em>as security for the assignees, and fixed the bail at 3900 dollars. On the 26th <em>June, </em>1817, the bond of the assignees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and surety was filed. On the 4th of December,' 1817, the court dii\u2019eeted <em>A. Elmslie, </em>who survived <em>Browne, </em>to assign his interest in the estate of <em>Miller </em>to <em>Heberton </em>and <em>Gray, </em>which was accordingly done on the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">A verdict was rendered in favour of the plaintiff for the part of the lot in the possession of <em>Hill, </em>subject to the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-6\"><em>King, </em>for the defendant now contended.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">I.

Where there arises a presumption of assent, it is destroyed by proof of dissent. <em>Wilt </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>503. In the present case all the proof shows a dissent by the assignees at all times to their appointment. Another reason why the title did not pass, is, that the assignees did not give bonds according to the 3d section of the act of 1798.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">9. On the 21st <em>January, </em>1815, when the.Court of Common Pleas appointed the plaintiffs trustees in the room of <em>Elmslie </em>and <em>Browne, </em>the act of 4th <em>April, </em>179S, had expired. This law was originally limited to the 1st <em>May, </em>1801. <em>Read\u2019s Dig. </em>176. 8 <em>Car. </em>4\u2019 <em>Bio. </em>441. On the 26th <em>March, </em>\u20191808, it was revived for one year, and then suffered to expire. 8 <em>Car. </em>4\u2019 <em>Bio. </em>1808. -Proceedings, though begun, cannot be carried on under an act of assembly which has expired, unless there be a special provision made. The principle is the same in relation to an expired as to a repealed statute, in which case, the point has often been decided. - <em>Road in Hatfield Township, Montgomery County, </em>4 Yeates, 392. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Passmore, </em>4 <em>Dall. </em>373. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schooner Peggy, </em>1 <em>Cranch, </em>103. <em>Yeaton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 <em>Cranch, </em>282.

The estate certainly passed to the first assignees, for it is clear that it did not remain in the insolvent. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Willing, </em>2 <em>Dall. </em>276, it was held, that an insolvent after being discharged, cannot maintain a suit in his own name. In <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Row, </em>3 <em>Yeates, 520, </em>the trustees did not give bond, and the insolvent brought an ejectment in his own name, but was nonsuited. To the same effect is the case of <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Innis, 5 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>394. That a refusal to act does not prevent the assigned estate from vesting in the trustees of an insolvent, is clear from the case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>189, where it was determined, that the Court of Common Pleas in such case may appoint new trustees, and compel those first appointed to assign to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">2. The estate which was vested in the first trustees they might assign to others. This is not the case of a repealed but of an expired statute: but even the repeal of a statute does not take away vested civil rights. <em>Bedford v. Shilling, 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>401. <em>Hatfield Road </em>4 <em>Yeates </em>392. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duane, </em>1 <em>Binn. 608. </em>Here the legal estate was vested in.the first trustees: the equitable estate was in the creditors. This legal estate passed by their assignment to the second trustees, the plaintiffs,' and the creditors have never objected. In equity, \u25a0 a trustee who refuses the trust may be compelled by the Chancellor to assign. 2 <em>Com. Dig. Chancezy, </em>4 if. 6.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b438-8\">Gibson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aif\">The original act of 1729 \u2014 30, provides, that the estate of the insolvent debtor shall be vested in the assignees by the mere act of executing the assignment; and \u00e1lthough this provision is not repeated in the act of 1798, under which the proceedings before us took place, there can be little doubt that the variance, in this particular, from the original act, was accidental. On executing the assignment, the person of the insolvent debtor is discharged ; and this is in consideration of his having surrendered his estate to his creditors. But if the estate should not vest in the assignees by the mere act of executing the conveyance, it would necessarily remain in the debtor himself, wherever the assignees should refuse to accept of the trust; and thus the debtor would have all the benefit intended to be extended to him, without the creditors having the benefit of the security intended to be provided for them, as the debtor might, the next moment, dispose of his effects in a way which would put them beyond their reach. It must be' obvious, therefore, that it would be inconsistent with the security of the creditors, which we must suppose to have been a cardinal object with the legislature, to treat the assent of the assignees to the grant, as a circumstance in anywise material. In all the cases cited, the grantee was beneficially interested; but here, independently of their interest as .creditors, the assignees had no interest in the trust, they were merely the instruments of the court in passing the estate to the creditors. Of what importance then can their, assent be to the efficacy of the assignment? If, in consequence of the assignees having neglected to execute the requisite bond, and enter upon the execution of the trust, the title did not vest in them, it has consequently remained all the while in the debtor or his heirs, and thus been subject to his disposition for a period of twenty-three years: a proposition too extravagant to be seriously urged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>By the assignment, therefore, it is clear, that the legal estate passed to the assignees; and it is equally clear, that by their conveyance, it passed to the plaintiffs, subject to the trusts declared in the original assignment; which is all that is necessary to enable them to support this ejectment. This being the only point in the defence, relied on, the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Judgment'for plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
