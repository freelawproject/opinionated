The suit in the Common Pleas is <em>Peter Rough </em>v. <em>James Todd, </em>and the rule of reference is in a suit of <em>Peter Rough </em>v. <em>David Todd, James Todd, </em>and <em>William Martin; </em>the reference is therefore between parties strangers to the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYb\">2. The suit in the Common Pleas is <em>Peter Rough, </em>plaintiff, and <em>James Todd, </em>defendant; and the award and judgment thereon are for <em>Peter Rough, </em>plaintiff, against <em>David Todd, James Todd, </em>and <em>William Martin, </em>defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayd\">3. The submission joined a criminal prosecution with two civil suits in the same reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASJ\">4. The declaration states no cause of action. The suit is slander, and no actionable words are laid; nor is there any count for special damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AS4\"><em>Elder, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ank\">contended that the award was bad. 1. Because the submission was of several suits depending, and the award is only in one. The award settles no more than this suit, whereas it was the intent of the agreement that all the actions depending, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s claim to a right of way, should be determined at the same time. The claim to a right of. way is not determined: so that the referees have not made a full and final award on the matters submitted. Besides, an indictment for a riot is included in the submission: a matter which the referees could not determine, nor could any judgment be given on their award. One rule of court could not authorize a determination of all these matters, and therefore the submission was void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayq\">2. The words stated in the declaration are not actionable. They are, \u00a3\u00a3 <em>Peter Rough </em>moved the line and made a new line;\u201d which he might have done very innocently through mistake or inadvertence. The act against removing land marks, passed in 1700, <em>Purdon\u2019s Dig. </em>367, enacis, \u00a3\u00a3 that no person in this province or counties annexed shall cut, fell, alter, or remove any certain bounded tree or other allowed land mark to the wrong of his neighbour or any other person, under the penalty of any sum not less than ten pounds;\u201d which penalty may be recovered in the Quarter Sessions. Act of 20th <em>March, </em>1810, <em>Purd. Dig. </em>363. But the declaration does not aver, that the defendant charged the plaintiff with removing any bounded tree or other allowed land \u25a0 mark, but only with moving the <em>line. </em>The innuendo cannot help the words. In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Spangler, 2 </em>Binn. 60, it was held not actionable to say of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the plaintiff she swore a false oath, though the innuendo was that she had committed perjury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8B\">\n<em>Douglas, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW\">1. Though the agreement embraced matters, a distinct proceeding in each, and that was the only regular course. Different suits may be determined by the same referees, and it is no objection when no such condition is contained in the submission, that other suits were not determined, if there be a valid report in one. Neither does it appear whether the other suits were or were not determined: or, if they were not, why that was the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az7\">2. As to the words, a <em>colloquium </em>is laid. It is averred, that they were spoken \u201cof and concerning certain bound trees and other allowed land marks, forming the boundary line and the evidence of the boundary line between the plantations of the plaintiff and defendant;\u201d which sufficiently fixes their application, so as to make the act the offence for which punishment is imposed by the act of assembly.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"pA-I\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"pAuI\">Tilghman, C. ,T.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ46\">This is an action of slander, brought by <em>Peter Rough, </em>the plaintiff below, against <em>James Todd, </em>the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"AAi\">1. The first error assigned is, that several suits were submitted to arbitration and only one award was made. It appears that there were several distinct suits between the plaintiff and defendant, all of which they agreed to submit to the arbitration of the same persons. But in the present action, a rule of court was taken out, distinct from any of the others, and an award was made on it, unmixed with any of the others. This is all right. There is nothing improper, in referring several suits to the same persons, any more than in having several causes tried by the same jury. In the one case the <em>awards, </em>and in the other the <em>verdicts </em>are given <em>separately, </em>so that no confusion can ensue. There is no force therefore in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">2. The second exception is to the declaration. It is contended that the words are no't actionable. To judge of that, we must advert to the manner in which they are laid, which is as follows:\u2014 \u201cthat the defendant in a certain discourse which he then and there had with divers good and worthy citizens of the commonwealth of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>of and concerning the plaintiff, and of and concerning certain boundaries and other allowed land marks, forming the boundary line between the plantations of the said plaintiff and the said defendant, then and there, in the presence and hearing of the said citizens, falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the said certain bounded trees and other allowed land marks forming the boundary line and the evidence of the boundary line between the said plantations of the plaintiff and defendant, these false, scandalous, malicious, and defamatory words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>following, that is to say, <em>Peter Rough, </em>(meaning the plaintiff,) <em>moved the line, </em>(meaning the said boundary line between the said plantations, formed of and by the said bounded trees, and other allowed land marks,) <em>and he </em>(the said plaintiff meaning,) <em>made a new line, </em>(meaning thereby, that the said plaintiff had altered and removed the said bounded line, and the certain bounded trees, and other allowed land marks aforesaid,) to the wrong of him the said plaintiff,\u201d &amp;c. &amp;c. We have an ancient law, made in the year 1700, against removing land marks, by which it is enacted, <em>\u201c </em>that no person shall cut, fell, <em>alter, </em>or <em>remove, </em>any certain bounded tree or other allowed land mark, to the wrong of his neighbour or any other person, under the penalty of any sum not less than ten pounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVU\">The words laid in the declaration are actionable therefore, if they charge the defendant with an act punishable by the act of assembly. For, in a conviction under the act, not only would the plaintiff be subject to pecuniary loss, but to loss of character; because the removal of boundaries has always been held in execration. The curse of God was denounced against it by the <em>Mosaic </em>law. The <em>Romans </em>considered it as an infamous offence, and all civilized nations have been of the same opinion. The reason of this general detestation is evident \u2014 without certainty of boundary, there is no certainty of property in land. \u2014 If the words in question had not been spoken in a conversation relating to <em>hound trees </em>and <em>land mm'ks, </em>there might have been some doubt of their being actionable. It might have been said, that the <em>moving of a line </em>is an expression of uncertain import. But when these' words are taken in connexion with a discourse concerning <em>hound trees </em>and <em>land marks, </em>it may be fairly understood, that by the <em>moving of a line, </em>and <em>making a new line, </em>was meant the removal of a <em>post </em>of <em>stone, </em>set up as a boundary, and fixing it in some other place, which would alter the course of the line. It is possible that the defendant might have had some other meaning, (such as the removal of a fence,) but we are not bound, nor would it be right, to resort to probabilities, and reject the obvious meaning of words. If men will speak of their neighbours in such terms as injure their characters, they must take the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"A1r\">It is the opinion of the court, that the words laid in the declaration, spoken in the manner, and forming part of the conversation there set forth, are actionable; and therefore the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Akp\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
