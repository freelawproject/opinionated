J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANf\">This case depends on the will of <em>John Abbott </em>deceased, who being seised in fee, of certain lands and rents, devised them to. his son <em>Thomas, </em>(father of the plaintiff,) for the term of his natural life, and directed, that <em>\u201c </em>after the decease of his said son the said land and rents should be equally divided to and amongst all the lawful issue of the said <em>Thomas, </em>or their legal representatives, share and share alike, and to their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d \u2014 At the date of the will, and at the death of the testator, his son <em>Thomas </em>had two children, and after the testator\u2019s .death he had four children more, all of whom are living and plaintiffs in this suit. After the death of the testator, his <em>son Thomas </em>who is still living, entered on the land devised to him for life, suffered a common recovery to the use of himself in fee, and then sold and conveyed to <em>Leiois Jenkins, </em>the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Two questions are presented \u2014 1st. Was the estate devised to the issue of <em>Thomas, </em>vested, or contingent? 2d. If contingent, was it barred by the common recovery suffered by their father ?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">I have said that there are two questions \u2014 there was indeed a third point made, viz. that <em>Thomas Abbott </em>took an estate tail, in the land devised to him \u2014 but there is no ground for this argument. Because the devise to him was expressly for life, and the remainder was limited to all his issue, not successively, and to the heirs of their bodies, but to take, all, <em>at the same time, equally, </em>and in <em>fee simple. </em>An express estate for life is never enlarged to an inheritance, but for the purpose of effectuating the general interest of the testator. But, to enlarge it in this instance to an estate tail, would be in direct opposition to the intent of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">1. Whether the estate was vested or contingent, will depend on the intent of the testator. For there is no rule of law, which would prevent the remainder in fee, after the death of <em>Thomas Abbott, </em>from vesting immediately after the death of the testator, in the two children of <em>Thomas </em>who were then living, and afterwards opening for the purpose of letting in the other children at the time of their respective births. \u2014 If the testator had said, that after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u25a0death of <em>Thomas, </em>the land should be equally divided among all his issue and their heirs and assigns, without any other words, I should have thought that the remainder limited to the children, was vested, but not to come into possession until their father\u2019s death. But he has added other words, which make the difficulty \u2014 the estate is to be divided among all the issue <em>or their legal representatives, </em>and their heirs and assigns. In construing the will, the words <em>or their legal representatives </em>are <em>not to </em>be rejected, unless they appear plainly to be insignificant, or surplusage. But that is not the case. These words indicate an intent, that the death of <em>Thomas </em>was the time at which the remainder should vest in the children, and that it should vest in those only who were <em>then living, </em>and <em>the children of such as\u2019-were dead. </em>The testator does not appear to have intended that a child of <em>Thomas </em>who might happen to die, during the life of his father,' without issue, should have power to aliene his share, which he would have had, if the remainder had \u2019 been vested. It has been objected, that if the representatives (or children) of a deceased child, took by purchase, then they must, take <em>per capita, </em>and come in each, for an equal share with the children of <em>Thomas Mbott, </em>which never cpuld have been the intent of the testator. If such were the consequence, it would be a strange argument in favour of a vested remainder, but I take the intent of the testator, to be deduced from a comparison of this devise with other parts of his will, to have been, that if any child, of <em>Thomas </em>died in his father\u2019s life time, leaving issue more than one child, such issue should take among them the share which their parent, if living, would have taken, and no more. What satisfies me of this intent, is, that in a preceding part of the will, the testator devised certain land to his son <em>Edward </em>for life, and after his death <em>\u201c </em>to all his lawful issue, share and share alike,\u201d after which he thus expresses himself; <em>u </em>and should it happen that any of the children of my said son <em>Edward </em>should die before him, leaving lawful issue, then it is my will, that the said issue inherit the share of their parent so deceased, to them and their heirs for ever.\u201d Immediately after, follows, a devise to <em>Edward </em>of cert\u00e1in ground rents, for life, <em>u </em>and at his decease to be equally divided amongst his lawful issue and <em>their legal </em>representatives.\u201d Now it cannot be doubted, that the testator intended to give to the children of his son <em>Thomas, </em>the same estate in the <em>rents, </em>which he had given them in the <em>lands. </em>Hence it appears, that by the words <em>legal representatives </em>was meant <em>children, </em>and those children were to take the share of their deceased parent. It had been so explained by the testator in his devise of the land, and he did not think it necessary to repeat the same words. This furnishes a key to the devise to <em>Thomas, </em>which follows directly after that to <em>Edward. </em>The words <em>legal representatives </em>must have the same construction in both devises, and then it will be clear, that the remainder after the life estate of <em>Thomas, </em>was not intended to be vested, till his death. The estate was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>to be divided between, the children who should be living, and the representatives <em>(or children) </em>of those who should be dead, provided that the children of a deceased child, should not take among them, more than the share which their parent would have taken, if living. This was a very natural intention, and a very just disposition of the estate. For, as to the defeating of the contingent remainder, by a common recovery, it was what never entered into the head of the testator. If no recovery had been suffered, this estate would have been divided among the posterity of the testator, with as much equity as he could have desired. And I confess that I have felt a strong inclination in favour of a vested remainder, in order to preserve the estate to the children. Bui our duty is to <em>construe </em>the will,- and not to <em>make </em>it. We have no right to reject words, because they lead to inconvenient consequences. The inconvenience here, however, does not arise from the will, but from the act of the testator\u2019s son <em>Thomas, </em>to the prejudice of his own children. If he had suffered the will of his father to take complete effect, all would have been well. What his reasons were for suffering the common recovery, I know not, nor is it proper^ at present to inquire into them.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">2. As to the second point, it is sufficient to say, that it was decided by this court in the case of <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>that the suffering of a common recovery is a forfeiture of an estate for life. Consequently, the remainders devised to the children of <em>Thomas JLhbott, </em>which remained in contingency during his life, fell for want of support, the moment the life estate was forfeited. The plaintiffs therefore have no title, and the judgment for the defendant must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
