In <em>Moses </em>v. <em>M'Farlan, 2 Burr, </em>1010, though there was a special agreement, the plaintiff was allowed to recover in <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received, and it was held to be the same thing, whether the plaintiff recovered on the agreement, or on the equity of the defendant\u2019s refunding the money. In many instances, a party may elect as to different remedies for the same wrong; as covenant or debt for rent, <em>2 Bac. Ab. </em>67, waste or covenant, after the expiration of the term. 1 <em>Bac. Ab. 98. 2 Bl. Rep. </em>1111. In cases of partnership by sealed articles, after an account stated, and balance struck, <em>assumpsit </em>lies. <em>2 Bac. Ab. </em>67, 257. Deeds which are only inducement to the promise, may be read in evidence. 4 <em>Dall, </em>429. In <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 <em>Dall. </em>257, an action was brought against the husband after the death of his wife, on his express assumption to pay a debt on a bond given by his wife <em>dum sola, </em>he having received considerable, property by his wife, and the bond was admitted in evidence, and the plaintiff recovered. Assets have been held a sufficient consideration for a promise by executors to pay a legacy, and the judgment is to be <em>de bonis proprius, Clark </em>v. <em>Herring, 5 Binn. </em>33. 4 <em>Dall. </em>147. And the widow may sue in <em>assumpsit </em>for -the undisposed residue of the personal estate. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>557. 8 <em>Mass. </em>340, <em>Appleton </em>v. Crown<em>insheld. </em>12 <em>Johns. </em>227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">It is well established, that general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>lies' after services have been performed under a special contract. 2 <em>Binn. </em>4. If an executor promise to pay a debt barred by the statute, it is a new promise raised on the footing of the old, and he' is liable <em>de bonis testatoris.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-8\"><em>Hamilton </em>and <em>Carothers, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aay\">contended, that the articles were not evidence in this action, the only remedy of the plaintiff being in an action on the articles themselves. Though one bound by specialty promises to pay it, yet it still remains a specialty, and <em>assumpsit </em>never lies on a promise by deed. 1 <em>Chitt. Plead. </em>95. 1 <em>Com. Dig. </em>145. 12 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>199, In an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>a sealed note cannot be given in evidence. <em>January </em>v. Goodman, 1 <em>Dall. </em>208. So, in an anonymous case, <em>Cowp. </em>128, A. had judgment against B. for 10, which, with costs, amounted to 17, which 17 B. promised to pay, in consideration that A. would stay the <em>execution; </em>it was held, that <em>assumpsit </em>did not lie, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the whole, debt and costs, are. a debt by judgment. Lord Mansfield said, \u201c it was a new species of action \u2014 an attempt to turn a judgment into a debt by simple contract.\u201d In <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>67, it is said to have been adjudged, that when one assumeth .to another, that if he can show him an obligation in which he was bound to him, he would pay him, and he did show the obligation, that no action lies on this assumpsit, which was afterwards affirmed by the justices. These cases show, that a promise to pay a security of a higher nature, such as a specialty or judgment, is no foundation for an action of assumpsit; but the party must resort to the remedy on the instrument or record itself. But there is a further objection to this evidence: that the promise, if made, was without consideration. The executors stood in the place of the testator, and were bound as executors by the articles: but they could not be made personally liable: yet if liable at all, though declared against as executors, they must be liable personally. The case of executors being liable personally for a distributive share in their hands is different, for there no action lay on any obligation by which the testator was bound. In 8. Johns, 121, the narr was on a promissory note, by which the defendant as administrator of A. promised to pay 61 dollars to B. for value received by A., and on demurrer, there was judgment for defendant, the court holding that it was <em>nudum </em>factum.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The -opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b320-5\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApaW\">The foundation of this action is a sealed instrument. The contract is a specialty. The party\u2019s remedy is on that instrument. In \u00e1 course of administration it is a debt of a higher grade than simple promise or assumption. This is an action against the defendants in error in their representative character, and not in their private capacities. Their liability to the plaintiff and their promise is by them as executors. The judgment would be <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>and not <em>de bonis propriis. </em>There' is no consideration moving from the plaintiff to the defendants. There is no injury to the plaintiff, or disadvantage, nor any benefit to the defendants. There is \u00f1o promise by a third person to discharge the obligation, for it is a promise not changing the debt, \u00f1or giving \u00e1 new debtor.' It creates no new responsibility. It is distinguishable from <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Herring, 6 Binn, </em>which lays the promise by the executor not as executor, but a personal promise of the exec\u00fctor in consideration of assets, in which the judgment was <em>de bonis propriis; </em>but where the promise is laid to be by the defendant, executor as aforesaid, in such case a promise' made by the testator, may be joined in a separate count, because the judgment in both cases would be the same. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Boileau, </em>decided at the last session of this court, at <em>Pittsburg, </em>and this is the hinge on which this c[\u00fcestio\u00f1 turns. For did the assumption create a\u00a3 new responsibility, the action could be supported; but the promise here is laid by the executors as aforesaid. Their plea of <em>non a\u00e9* </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>sumpserunt </em>is, that they did not promise as executors. They might have pleaded <em>plene adrninistraverunt, </em>and the judgment would be <em>de bonis testatoris. Whitaker </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>8 <em>Johns. </em>112. So that in fact, this action is on the sealed instrument of the testator, is against the executors as executors. The promise n\u00e9ither changes the nature of the debt, nor gives any new responsibility; the declaration, pleas, and judgment, demonstrate this. In the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>there is a general <em>dictum </em>of Mr. Justice Yeates, that <em>\u201c </em>where one is bound in an obligation, and after-wards promises to pay the money, <em>assumpsit </em>will lie on this promise.\u201d The authorities to which the learned judge refers are, <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>240, and <em>Cro.- Car. </em>343. As a general position, I cannot assent to thi\u00a7, unless there is a new consideration, as forbearance, and the verdease in <em>Cro. Car. </em>takes this distinction, and .the law is well settled, that if the obligor in a bond, without any new consideration, promises to pay the money, <em>assumpsit </em>will no\u00a3 Jie, but the obligee must still pursue his remedy by action of debt, for a naked assumption made by a man to pay his own bond, cannot change a specialty into a simple contract; the promise made by a third person would be sufficient. <em>Cowp. </em>129.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The action for use and occupation lies on a parol demise, or agreement, for a certain rent, not being by de\u00e9d, but that remedy is given by statute, 11 <em>G. </em>2 <em>c. </em>19, <em>s. </em>14. and even before the statute, when there was no stipulation for any express sum, that action was maintainable. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Welland Skinn. </em>238. 3 <em>Mod. </em>73, and in <em>Lev. 179, </em>it was decided, that <em>assumpsit </em>will lie on an express promise to pay rent, where there is no deed. So where,the obligor of a <em>respondentia </em>bond by indorsement thereon, agreed to pay it to any assignee, it was determined that the assignee might bring <em>assumpsit. Fenner </em>v. <em>Meares, </em>2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>1269. So, on a bond not assigned according to the act of assembly, a promise by the obligor to pay the assignee, would support <em>assumpsit, </em>because there is introduced a third person, who has no cause of action in his own name; the contract to pay him is by parol.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The Court of Common Pleas properly rejected the bond. In no stage of the cause could it be evidence on a declaration framed as this was. There was neither new consideration, nor responsibility. It is that which an executor would do when called on. <em>\u201c </em>I will pay you this debt out of the assets of my testator.\u201d This cannot change the nature of the debt, and sink a bond or judgment into simple contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The promise by these defendants as executors left the contract just as it found it. They entered into no new contract. The undertaking between the plaintiff and their testator was by deed, on which covenant must be brought. The general issue is <em>non assumpserunt, </em>which denies that they took upon them to pay that with which they are charged in the declaration. This action does not charge them with any debt: for if a man on a simple contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>was charged with a debt, he would discharge it by law wager, and for this reason it was, recourse was had to the action of <em>assumpsit. </em>That charges a person with damages for not performing that promise on which the plaintiff depended, and this being a charge that supposes a deceit or injury, there was no law wager allowed. But upon an <em>assumpsit, </em>framed on no new consideration, introducing no responsibility of a third person, the covenant under hand and seal was no evidence. There was no new consideration, the introduction of no new promisor; for the executors\u2019promise was merely representative: there was no benefit to the promisors: there was no detriment to <em>the </em>promisee, which is the definition of the consideration necessary to support an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
