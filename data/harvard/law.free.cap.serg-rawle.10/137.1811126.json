Held, that from that rao\u00bb ment the plaintiff was damnified, and might sue on the engagement,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b137-10\"><em>Query, </em>whether an assignment by an assignee of all his interest in land, indorsed on the original articles of agreement for the purchase of it, dispenses with the ne, cessitv of proving the articles, or any previous assignment, indorsed thereon.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b137-11\">At all events, a subsequent assignment by his assignee, must be proved in the or\u00bb dinary way by a subscribing witness. A reference to such subsequent assign\u00bb ment, in a contract signed by the defendant, is not sufficient to dispense with the ordinary proof j if it refers to it generally, and contains nothing to identify it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-12\">This was a writ of error to the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Centre </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-13\"><em>Sarah Grove, </em>the plaintiff below, brought this action against <em>Cornelius Gardner, </em>on a written agreement, by which <em>Gardner </em>promised, to keep her clear of back interest on that piece of ground that he purchased of <em>Alexander Morrison, </em>till the day she bought it of <em>Christopher Ha,rlung.,3 </em>These were the words of the contract. It appeared by the evidence, that the land alluded to in the agreement had been sold by <em>Griffith </em>and <em>George Carr </em>to <em>Alexander Morrison, </em>who sold to <em>Cornelius Gardner, </em>the de\u00bb fendant, who sold to <em>Christopher </em>Hartung\u00bb who sold to the plaintiff, <em>Griffith </em>and <em>George Carr </em>brought a suit against <em>Sarah Grove, </em>the plaintiff, before a\u2018 justice of the peace, and not being able to defend she confessed for 115 dollars, <em>Hi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>cents, the amount of the balance of principal and interest of the purchase money. The defendant, <em>Gardner, </em>had notice of the suit before the justice, but whether he consented to the confession of judgment was matter of dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">On the trial of the cause, the plaintiff having given in evidence the record of the judgment before the justice, and some parol evidence, by which she endeavoured to prove that the defendant had acknowledged the justice of that judgment, and had also acknowledged a paper containing the articles of agreement between-t?. and <em>G. Cg,rr </em>and <em>A. Morrison, </em>offered that paper in evidence, in which were the following writings. First, the articles of agreement, dated the 1st <em>May, </em>1798, by which <em>G. </em>and <em>G. Carr </em>sold to <em>Morrison. </em>Second, <em>Morrison\u2019s </em>assignment of all his interest to the defendant. Third, the defendant\u2019s assignment to <em>Christopher Hartung. </em>Fourth, <em>Hartung\u2019s </em>assignment under hand and seal, attested by two witnesses, to <em>Sarah Grove, </em>the plaintiff. The defendant objected to the admission of this paper, unless the several instruments of writing should be proved. The court decided, that it was sufficient if the assignment by the defendant were proved; and accordingly that was proved by the plaintiff, and then the whole paper was admitted in evidence. ' To this admission the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">The evidence being concluded, the court below charged the jury, that the plaintiff might recover against the defendant, although the plaintiff had not paid <em>G. </em>and <em>G. Carr\u2019s </em>judgment. The defendant excepted to the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-8\"><em>Burnside, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-9\">1. That the court erred in admitting the different instruments of writing without due proof, by the subscribing witnesses. The rule is general, that subscribing witnesses to a written agreement, must be called upon to prove its execution, and that whether the instrument is the foundation of the suit, or comes in collaterally. The engagement of indemnity of the 14th <em>August, </em>1811, contained no reference to the articles or assignments, by which they could be identified: and it was necessary to produce them, because without the articles, it could not be known what the interest was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-10\">2. The writing of the 14th <em>August, </em>1811, was a contract of indemnity against the payment of money, and till the plaintiff' below actually paid something, she was not damnified within the terms and meaning of it. A mere'judgment without execution or payment, is not such a damage as imposes on the defendant the necessity of reimbursing her any thing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-11\"><em>Potter, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-12\">1. It is material that this'suit is not brought on the articles, but on a distinct undertaking by the defendant. It could not be necessary to prove the instruments which preceded the defendant\u2019s assignment, because by that assignment, he recognized and adopted them. As to the assignment by <em>Hartung </em>to the defendant, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>sufficient to justify the admission of that without proof by any subscribing witness, that the defendant refers to the assignment by <em>Hartung </em>in his engagement of the l'4th <em>August.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\"><em>2. </em>The plaintiff was damnified by the judgment, and had a cause of action immediately. The authorities to this point are numerous and conclusive. 1 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>449. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>264,369. <em>Sheriff of Norwich </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, Cro. Eliz. </em>53. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Ambler, </em>Cro. <em>Car. </em>349. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M'Anulty, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>364. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Rittenhouse, </em>1 <em>Yeates, </em>460. 13 <em>Johns. </em>75.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"pAb2\">Tilghman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1c\">Two errors are assigned in this record., 1st, That no action lies before the plaintiff pays <em>Carr\u2019s </em>judgment, 2d, The admission of the evidence mentioned in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">1. I am of opinion, that the charge of the court was right. The defendant engaged to keep the plaintiff clear of the back interest, but he did not do so. Judgment was obtained against her for that interest: From that moment she was damnified, because her body and property were liable to execution. The cases cited by the counsel for the defendant in error, are in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">2. The paper offered in evidence contained several different writings. 1st, The articles between <em>G. </em>and <em>G. Carr, </em>and <em>Morrison</em>. 2d, The assignment of <em>Morrison </em>to Gardner. 3d, <em>Gardner\u2019s </em>assignment to Hartung. There might be some plausibility in the argument, that <em>Gardner, </em>by his assignment, recognized the preceding writings on the same paper. I give no opinion on that. But, the assignment from <em>Hartung </em>to the plaintiff afterwards.written on the same paper, ought to have been proved. It was an essential part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, because it showed at what time she had purchased of <em>Hartung, </em>and consequently, the time to which she should be discharged from the back interest. The writing in which the defendant assumed to keep the plaintiff clear of back interest, refers to the purchase from <em>Hartung, </em>but contains nothing which could identify the paper given in evidence. There was no reason, therefore, why that proof should be dispensed with. The subscribing witnesses should have been called. I am of opinion, that in the admission of that writing there was error. The judgment is, therefore, to be reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
