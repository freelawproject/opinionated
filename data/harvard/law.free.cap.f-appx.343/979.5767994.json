We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Hodge contends that he advised Officer Williams that another prisoner, Deryl Ware, \u201csaid I couldn\u2019t pray no more and if I did we would fight.\u201d According to Hodge, Williams stated that no one could keep him from praying, and he would look into it. Hodge then went to a visitation. Upon his return, Ware allegedly confronted him, saying Williams had advised Ware of Hodge\u2019s complaint. Ware then assaulted Hodge, who alleges that he suffered cuts on his hand, a cut lip, and a sore neck, though he says he has no continuing injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Through the prison discipline system, Hodge was ultimately found guilty of disciplinary violations of fighting and reckless conduct arising from the fight and received a sanction of \u201c15 days no visitation.\u201d His grievance against Williams was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-18\">Hodge filed a \u00a7 1983 action against Officer Williams alleging that he failed to protect Hodge from Ware and was deliberately indifferent in doing so. The district court requested a more definite statement, and Hodge responded. The district court then conducted a screening under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The court concluded that Hodge\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted, and dismissed under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Although the court found that Ware\u2019s threat to Hodge constituted a substantial risk of harm, it found insufficient allegation of facts to support Hodge\u2019s contention that Williams was deliberately indifferent to that risk. Alternatively, the court found that only de min-imis injuries were alleged and dismissed on that ground as well.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-19\">On appeal, Hodge contends that Williams failed to follow policy in how he handled Hodge\u2019s allegations. He abandons his claim for compensatory damages, stating \u201cMr. Hodge is only seeking punitive damages.\u201d Hodge argues that <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986), supports his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-20\">After reviewing the record, we agree with the district court that Hodge has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a finding of deliberate indifference. <em>See id. </em>at 347-48, 106 S.Ct. 668 (\u201cRespondents\u2019 lack of due care in this case led to serious injury, but that lack of care simply does not approach the sort of abusive government conduct that the Due Process Clause was designed to prevent.\u201d) While Williams\u2019s handling of the situation by talking to Ware ultimately was ineffectual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Hodge\u2019s allegations do not support a finding that it was deliberately indifferent. Hodge has not alleged facts sufficient to support recovery of punitive damages against Williams. <em>See Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1002-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-21\">. Because we affirm on the first ground, we need not reach the alternative ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
