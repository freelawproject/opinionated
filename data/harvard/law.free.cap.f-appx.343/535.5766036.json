On appeal, Aruanno argues that the district court erred in dismissing his wrongful imprisonment claim as time-barred because his status as a prisoner entitled him to tolling of the statute of limitations. Aruanno also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his denial of access to the courts claim because his complaint adequately alleged such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>an appeal from a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) sua <em>sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, taking all factual allegations as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir. 2003). The same standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) also govern \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissals. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). <em>\u201cPro </em>se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, the district court shall dismiss a case filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>\u201cat any time if the court determines that ... the action or appeal ... fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim when it appears that the plaintiff has little or no chance of success, i.e., when the complaint on its face makes clearly baseless allegations or relies on legal theories that are indisputably meritless. <em>Carroll v. Gross, </em>984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(citing Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1832, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-19\">A cause of action for a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues when \u201cthe plaintiffs know or should know (1) that they have suffered the injury that forms the basis of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>complaint and (2) who has inflicted the injury.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003). In Florida, the statute of limitations period for \u00a7 1983 claims is four years. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">With respect to Aruanno\u2019s first issue on appeal, there is no dispute that Aruanno filed his wrongful imprisonment claim well beyond the Florida\u2019s four year statute of limitations period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His status as prisoner, standing alone, does not entitle Aruanno to tolling under Florida law, nor does the record reveal any legitimate reason to equitably toll the statute of limitations in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing the wrongful imprisonment claim and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Turning to Aruanno\u2019s second claim, an individual\u2019s right of access to the courts is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Tennessee v. Lane, </em>541 U.S. 509, 523, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 1988, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004). However, plaintiffs must show actual injury by demonstrating that their efforts to pursue a nonfrivolous claim were frustrated or impeded by an official\u2019s action. <em>Bass v. Singletary, </em>143 F.3d 1442, 1445 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Aruanno has failed to allege any set of facts that shows how state officials prevented or deterred him from pursuing his action in court. Indeed, Aruanno alleges just the opposite: that he had been active in pursuing his claim despite the alleged actions by state officials. Although Aruan-no describes certain conduct by his former lawyer as obstructive, the lawyer was not a state official. Therefore, Aruanno has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The district court correctly dismissed Aruanno\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">. The imprisonment that forms the basis of this lawsuit occurred in 1994, when Aruanno spent approximately 30 days in Martin County Jail. He did not file his \u00a7 1983 suit until 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-9\">. Florida law does allow for tolling in certain instances, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.051, but that list is exhaustive, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 95.051(2); <em>Hearndon v. Graham, </em>767 So.2d 1179, 1185 (Fla.2000). In Florida, equitable tolling may be available when there is no misconduct on behalf of the defendants and \u201cmay delay the running of the limitations period based on the plaintiff\u2019s blameless ignorance and the lack of prejudice to the defendant.\" <em>Major League Baseball </em>v. <em>Morsani, </em>790 So.2d 1071, 1077 n. 11 (Fla. 2001). It may also be used when \u201ca plaintiff has been misled or lulled into inaction and has in some extraordinary way been prevented from asserting his rights.\" <em>Alachua County v. Cheshire, </em>603 So.2d 1334, 1337 (Fla. 1992). Nevertheless, \u201c[equitable] tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.\" <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
