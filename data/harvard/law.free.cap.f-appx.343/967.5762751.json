He asserts that the evidence showed only the <em>'possibility </em>that he brandished a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The information in the PSR revealed that Mendoza and his co-defendant Leo-bardo Ayala-Diaz (Ayala) performed a staged kidnaping of a group of smuggled aliens who were aware that Mendoza was armed during the drama. One of the smuggled aliens, Antonio Cruz Tercero-Aguilera, reported that two vehicles sandwiched the vehicle that the aliens were in \u2014 and that an armed Mendoza and Ayala entered the aliens\u2019 vehicle and absconded with them. A second alien, Edbin Marin, described how Mendoza had worn a black mask and had had a gun during the kid-naping. Marin further stated that \u2014 after the kidnaping \u2014 Mendoza and Ayala acted as guards at the apartment where the smuggled aliens were kept. A third smuggled alien, Juan Manuel Linares-Medina, stated that he did not feel free to leave the apartment where he was held after the kidnaping and that Mendoza had participated in the kidnaping. Ayala (the co-defendant) later admitted that he and Mendoza had committed the kidnaping and guarded the smuggled aliens at the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">At sentencing, the district court enhanced Mendoza\u2019s offense level pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B), which provides: \u201cIf a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was brandished or otherwise used,\u201d the base level should be increased by four levels. The Guidelines define \u201cbrandished\u201d as making a dangerous weapon \u201cknown to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court overruled Mendoza\u2019s objection that he had not used \u201cthe weapon in a way that intimidated.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s determination that Mendoza brandished a firearm during the offense is a factual finding, so we review it for clear error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a futile effort to increase our level of scrutiny over the district court, Mendoza urges that the brandishing enhancement requires a specific intent element. But, assuming without deciding that Mendoza is correct, our focus merely becomes whether Mendoza had made the dangerous weapon known to the aliens <em>in order </em>to intimidate them\u2014 still a <em>factual </em>issue. Consequently, if the district court\u2019s findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole, then there is no clear error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Although we are unable to locate binding authority directly addressing what constitutes \u201cbrandished\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we determine \u2014 given the totality of the circumstances surrounding this offense and the plain language of the Guideline \u2014 that the district court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement. Indeed, the information in the PSR showed that Mendoza \u2014 while wearing a black mask and displaying a firearm \u2014 participated in a roadway kidnaping. He subsequently imprisoned the kidnapped aliens. It was reasonable for the district court to infer that Mendoza had \u2014 in these volatile situations \u2014 made his weapon known to the smuggled aliens in order to intimidate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Mendoza also half-heartedly argues that the statements of the smuggled aliens found in the PSR are unreliable as a matter of law, because the smuggled aliens were potential criminal defendants (based on their illegal entry into the United States). We review this question deferentially \u2014 for either plain or clear error. First, Mendoza failed to raise this argument in the district court \u2014 triggering plain error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, the alleged unreliability of the smuggled aliens\u2019 statements has to do with credibility \u2014 a factual question triggering clear error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mendoza fails \u2014 under either standard of review \u2014 to meet the heavy burden of showing that the district court erred in relying upon the statements of the smuggled aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b989-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
