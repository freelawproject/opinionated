Kim pled guilty to all of the charges without a written plea agreement. On appeal, Kim argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of his history and characteristics and the nature of his offense. In addition, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it resulted in unwarranted sentencing disparities between himself, his co-defendants, and money laundering defendants in general. It is somewhat unclear whether Kim argues only that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, or whether he also argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. Either way, we find no error by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this Court reviews a defendant\u2019s sentence for procedural or substantive unreasonableness using the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 45-47, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2008). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will reverse only if the district court made \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">\u201c[A] sentence may be substantively unreasonable, regardless of the procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>used.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ]3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Where the court imposes a sentence that is within the Guidelines range, we ordinarily expect that sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Where the sentence imposed is outside the Guidelines range, we may not presume the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51,128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">We have held that a defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable in light of \u00a7 3553(a)(6)\u2019s command to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities where, although the defendant\u2019s sentence was greater than the sentences his co-defendants received, factors such as the defendant\u2019s role in coordinating a scheme or his co-defendants\u2019 substantial assistance to the government caused the disparity to be reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable, even though a co-defendant received a substantially shorter sentence, because the co-defendant\u2019s sentence reflected his substantial assistance to the government); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1350, 1357 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the defendant\u2019s 121-month sentence was reasonable even though his co-defendants\u2019 sentences ranged from 41 to 53 months\u2019 imprisonment because the defendant had coordinated the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">At sentencing, Kim stated that he had no objections to his sentence, the Guidelines calculations, or the manner in which the court pronounced sentence. He now argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, even though his sentence was below his Guidelines range. Kim contends that the district court failed to sufficiently consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, gave insufficient consideration to his history and characteristics, and created an unwarranted sentencing disparity between Kim and his co-defendants, who received sentences ranging from 12 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Kim\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable because the district court: (1) correctly calculated his Guidelines range, a conclusion that Kim does not dispute on appeal; (2) clearly articulated its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (3) treated the Guidelines as advisory; and (4) articulated its reasoning for imposing Kim\u2019s sentence. Contrary to Kim\u2019s assertion, the record demonstrates that the district court considered Kim\u2019s history and characteristics, including his ties with his friends and family, as well as the sentences that Kim\u2019s co-defendants received. The district court specifically explained that though Kim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sentence was substantially longer than those of his co-defendants, the disparity was appropriate because Kim led his co-defendants into participating in criminal activity. The district court did not discuss each and every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, but it was not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Kim\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable. His 96-month sentence was a downward variance from his guideline range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment: Kim was the organizer or leader of a multi-year scheme to launder drug trafficking proceeds, and he and his co-defendants attempted to conceal them crimes by creating fraudulent documents and failing to comply with federal reporting requirements. The disparity between Kim\u2019s sentence and his co-defendants\u2019 sentences was reasonable because, as the district court noted, Kim was (1) the organizer or leader; (2) responsible for over $600,000 in laundered funds; and (3) convicted of 8 counts of money laundering and 8 counts of failure to report a business transaction, in addition to Count 1 of the indictment. In contrast, Kim\u2019s co-defendants each pled guilty to only Count 1 and were responsible for only a fraction of the laundered funds. Thus, the disparity between Kim\u2019s and his co-defendants\u2019 sentences was reasonable. Kim fails to point to any additional factors that demonstrate that his sentence was unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Accordingly, after thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. We have held that where a district court elicits objections to its sentence and the defendant fails to object, the defendant has waived any objection to his sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136, 1137 (11th Cir.1993). Even assuming, however, that Kim was not required to object to the reasonableness of his sentence to preserve the issue for appeal, Kim\u2019s sentence was reasonable under the abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
