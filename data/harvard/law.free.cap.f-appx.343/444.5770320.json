On appeal, Burke argues his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court enhanced his sentence based on a prior conviction, which was neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Burke concedes that his position is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219,140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and this Court\u2019s precedent, but \u201craises the issue and preserves it for further attacks on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>his conviction and sentence should the state of the law change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Whether a prior conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), is a question subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">This Court is obligated to adhere to Supreme Court precedent unless and until abrogated by the Supreme Court, <em>Motorcity of Jacksonville, Ltd. v. Southeast Bank N.A., </em>120 F.3d 1140, 1143 (11th Cir.1997) (en banc), and <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>controls the outcome in this case, see <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Even if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>were to be abrogated, the district court did not err in enhancing Burke\u2019s sentence. Burke failed to lodge any factual challenge to his prior conviction set forth in the PSI. Thus, Burke effectively admitted to having a pri- or conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense, which constituted an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) \u00a7 101(a)(43).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1251 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that, because the defendant did not object to the factual recitations in the PSI, he effectively admitted the facts in the PSI); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that failure to object to matters contained in the PSI constitutes an admission of those facts for purposes of <em>Booker). </em>Therefore, the district court did not err in enhancing the statutory maximum to 10 years, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or by applying the eight-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), based on the prior conviction. <em>See Marseille, </em>377 F.3d at 1257. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">. Section 2L1.2 of the Guidelines provides that the base offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States is eight, and that an eight-level increase applies if the defendant was previously deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for an aggravated felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), (b)(C); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), INA \u00a7 276(a). The commentary provides that an aggravated felony has the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(43) of the INA. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.3). Under the INA, \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance\u201d constitutes an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(43)(B), INA \u00a7 10 l(a)(43).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-23\">. The district court determined Burke had been found to be unlawfully in the United States after having been convicted of an aggravated felony and deported, which would have subjected him to a 20-year maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because the indictment charged Burke under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), he was subject to a 10-year maximum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
