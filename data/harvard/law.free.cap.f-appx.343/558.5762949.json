Rivera appeals his 60-month sentence, imposed after he pled guilty to attempted bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2118(a). At sentencing, the district court applied a six-level increase to his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) for the \u201cotherwise use[]\u201d of a firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rivera raises three arguments: (1) the district court clearly erred by finding that he used a firearm during the offense, arguing that he actually possessed a cigarette lighter that resembled a gun; (2) the district court erroneously concluded that he \u201cotherwise used,\u201d as opposed to \u201cbrandished,\u201d the firearm, because he did not make any threats during the robbery and merely pointed the weapon in the teller\u2019s direction; and (8) the district court plainly erred by resolving these issues under a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than a reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">I. Firearm versus dangerous weapon</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Rivera contends that the district court erred in finding that he used an actual firearm during the attempted bank robbery. \u201c[W]e review the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1247 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">If a defendant challenges one of the factual bases for his sentence, the government must prove the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999). The district court may consider reliable hearsay evidence at sentencing, so long \u201cas the evidence has sufficient indicia of reliability, the [district] court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Zlatogur, </em>271 F.3d 1025, 1031 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (quotations marks and citation omitted). In addition, \u201cthe appellate court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the sentencing court to judge the credibility of the witnesses .... \u201d <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1259 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Pursuant to the Guidelines, the term \u201c[f]irearm\u201d means a weapon that is designed \u201cto expel a projectile.\u201d U.S. SentenCing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(G). The term \u201c[d]angerous weapon\u201d encompasses \u201can object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(D) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">The evidence presented during sentencing included: (1) testimony from the bank teller that the object Rivera held during the robbery appeared to be a real gun and that Rivera, an employee of the bank, previously boasted of owning a gun; (2) testimony from the investigating officer that Rivera\u2019s co-defendant asserted that the gun was real and that Rivera stated, en route to the robbery, that he hoped to be able to shoot a particular bank employee; and (3) recent receipts documenting Rivera\u2019s purchases from a hunting/fishing shop with a shooting range. Given this evidence, Rivera has failed to meet his burden and to establish that the district court clearly erred by finding that Rivera possessed an actual firearm during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>II. Otherwise use versus brandished or possessed</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Rivera next contends that the district court erred in concluding that his conduct constituted \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d a firearm as opposed to \u201cbrandishing]\u201d a firearm. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(C), (I). Our review is <em>de novo. See United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In calculating a defendant\u2019s robbery offense level, Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">(B) if a firearm was otherwise used, increase by 6 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">(C) if a firearm was brandished or possessed, increase by 5 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">(D) if a dangerous weapon was otherwise used, increase by 4 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">(E) if a dangerous weapon was brandished or possessed, increase by 3 levels....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B)-(E). The Guidelines provide that \u201cotherwise used\u201d means that \u201cthe conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(1). \u201cBrandished\u201d means \u201cthat all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(C). We have held that \u201cthe use of a firearm to make an explicit or implicit threat against a specific person constitutes \u2018otherwise use\u2019 of the firearm.\u201d <em>Cover, </em>199 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">The evidence showed that Rivera pointed his gun at the bank teller while instructing her to get the keys to the bank\u2019s vault and escorting her to the vault area. Accordingly, Rivera did more than make the presence of his gun known to the teller \u2014 he used it to obtain her compliance with his requests. The district court correctly concluded that Rivera used the gun to implicitly threaten the teller, and it properly increased his offense level for his \u201cotherwise use[ ]\u201d of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">III. Standard of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">Lastly, Rivera contends that the district court applied the incorrect standard of proof. Because Rivera did not raise this issue before the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170, 1173 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">Pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>facts that would increase a crime\u2019s penalty beyond the statutory maximum must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Post-<em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held, in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 232-44, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-56, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). We have held that \u201c[w]hen the district court applies the Guidelines in an advisory manner, nothing in <em>Booker </em>prohibits district courts from making, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, additional factual findings that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMoreover, the district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, ... evidence presented during the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">As Rivera acknowledges, his argument is foreclosed by precedent because his 60-month sentence was less than the statutory maximum, and the district court applied the Guidelines in an advisory manner. Accordingly, there was no <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">. The Probation Officer recommended a four-level enhancement pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) for the \"otherwise use[]\u201d of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
