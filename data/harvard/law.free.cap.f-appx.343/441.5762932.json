On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court plainly erred in failing to resentence him during his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), had the effect of retroactively stripping the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over his original sentence; and (2) the district court abused its discretion in denying him a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, pursuant to Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels associated with certain crack cocaine offenses. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). When an issue presented involves a legal interpretation, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). We review sentencing issues not raised before a district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e may exercise our discretion to correct a forfeited error where there is (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights (which usually means that the error was prejudicial), and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Mangaroo, </em>504 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">First, we find no merit in Smith\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred in failing to resentence him during his \u00a7 3582 proceedings. The district court has limited jurisdiction in the context of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10 \u201cdo not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3), or <em>de novo </em>resentencing, <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence are the sort of \u201cextraneous\u201d issues that are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>(declining to consider defendant\u2019s Eight Amendment claim because \u201csuch a collateral attack on [a] sentence\u201d should be brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 3582(c)). Thus, the district court lacks authority to re-examine the other sentencing determinations made at the original sentencing. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">In addition, we have held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (applying plain error). Specific to Amendment 706, we have applied <em>Moreno </em>to reject an argument, made by a defendant sentenced <em>pre-Booker </em>under mandatory Guidelines, that he was entitled to application of <em>Booker </em>in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792-93 (11th Cir.2009). We reasoned that <em>Booker </em>did not afford the district court a basis for granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In light of this case law, the district court here did not commit any error, much less plain error, by failing to consider whether <em>Booker </em>had the effect of stripping the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s original sentence, thereby rendering his original sentence void, and requiring the district court to impose a new sentence. Indeed, the district court could not address that argument in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. And even if a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding was the proper context to raise the issue, we have repeatedly recognized that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Next, we reject Smith\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by denying Smith a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction. A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir. 2008). However, if a defendant\u2019s base offense level is determined under the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), rather than the drug-quantity guideline in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), Amendment 706 has no effect on the applicable guideline range. 541 F.3d at 1327-28. Where Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range because the defendant\u2019s offense level was determined by the career offender guideline, the defendant is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Because Smith\u2019s original sentence was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 and was unaffected by \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his sentencing range, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not afford him relief. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. Smith\u2019s argument that we are not bound by <em>Moore </em>because <em>Moore </em>violates <em>Booker </em>is unavailing as we are bound to follow prior binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2825, 174 L.Ed.2d 556 (2009). There is no dispute that <em>Moore </em>has not been overruled by either this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court, and we are therefore bound to follow it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Finally, Smith\u2019s argument that <em>Moreno </em>is inapplicable here also fails, given our holding in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
