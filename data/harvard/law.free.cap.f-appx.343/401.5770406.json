On appeal, the government argues that the district court erred in refusing to qualify Duppins as a career offender by concluding that Duppins\u2019s prior conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) (2004) is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.2006). A crime is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline if it is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or federal law and \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). A crime \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d if it is \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the enumerated crimes. <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">In <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>we held that a violation of \u00a7 316.1935(2) is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). 558 F.3d 1280, 1296 (11th Cir.2009). Because we use the same analysis to determine whether a crime is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline or a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, <em>Harrison </em>is controlling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Begay </em>decision regarding the ACCA is instructive here because of the similar definitions of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 in the Guidelines and of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 in [the] ACCA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. In light of <em>Harrison, </em>addressing a similar provision of the same code section, the district court did not err in concluding that Duppins\u2019s prior conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1) is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the career offender guideline under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Harrison </em>is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">. <em>Hairison </em>was published after the briefs were filed in this appeal, but each party submitted <em>Harrison </em>as supplemental authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\">. We need not address whether a more serious crime under \u00a7 316.1935, using language regarding driving at high speeds and demonstrating \"a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property,\u201d would qualify as a \"crime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-16\">.The government's request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
