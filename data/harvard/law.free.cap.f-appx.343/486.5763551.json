Saldana based his motion on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. He contends that the court lacked jurisdiction to impose a sentence of life imprisonment because the government filed an inadequate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notice of enhancement before his original sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">The district court correctly denied Sal-dana\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his term of life imprisonment was based on the statutory mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Thus Saldana was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because that amendment does not lower his applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337,1339-40 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant sentenced the to statutory minimum was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 had no effect on his statutory minimum term of imprisonment); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(A) (noting that a defendant is not eligible for a reduction if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of [a] statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d). Saldana\u2019s attempt to avoid this fact by attacking the sufficiency of the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 notice fails because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not <em>de novo </em>resentencings and, therefore, are not the proper avenue to present that type of challenge. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ing\u201d and that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-17\">. Saldana also argues that the district court (1) erred by refusing to consider his post-sentencing conduct when deciding whether to reduce his sentence and (2) violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by finding him responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine when the superseding indictment in his case alleged only a \"detectable amount.\u201d These arguments are aimed not at whether Saldana is eligible for a reduction under Amendment 706 but instead at what amount of reduction would have been appropriate had he been eligible for one. Because he was not, however, <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40, we do not address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
