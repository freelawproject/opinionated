Melo Rueda\u2019s alleges that, in an unfortunate coincidence, her uncle is also named Gustavo Rueda Diaz. She argues that she is eligible for asylum because she has been harassed and attacked by people seeking information about her uncle under the mistaken belief that he is the FARC leader. The IJ found that Melo Rueda\u2019s testimony was not credible and rejected her claims for relief. The BIA agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.Bd 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning on the adverse credibility finding, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Chen v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual determinations under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under that test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). We will reverse only when the record compels us to, and \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">A credibility determination is a factual finding reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>The IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, when an applicant submits evidence in addition to his or her testimony, the IJ may not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination to deny relief. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Melo Rueda makes two arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. First, she argues that the IJ did not make an explicit finding that she was not credible. <em>See id. </em>(holding that the IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). That argument fails. In the IJ\u2019s oral decision, it stated that \u201cthe Court finds that the respondent\u2019s testimony was not credible.\u201d That is a clean and explicit adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Second, Melo Rueda argues that the IJ\u2019s decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons. That argument also fails. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. Melo Rueda has not done that. The IJ\u2019s opinion identified numerous inconsistencies between Melo Rueda\u2019s testimony and the documents contained in her application for asylum. Those inconsistencies included that 1) a medical document contradicted Melo Rueda\u2019s sworn testimony that she never had problems with her hand prior to an alleged abduction on July 12, 2002; 2) she had failed to introduce any medical evidence to support her testimony that she was injured on July 12, 2002; 3) a letter from Melo Rueda\u2019s employer stated her problems arose in 2004 or 2005, not in 2002 as she had testified. Those are specific cogent reasons that support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The record shows that the IJ considered all of the evidence submitted by Melo Rue-da. Some of it the IJ found incredible. Some of it, such as the letter from her employer, contradicted her claim instead of supporting it. Given the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, substantial evidence supports the denial of Melo Rueda\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Additionally, because Melo Rueda \u201chas failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, [s]he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\">. In the court docket, the petitioner\u2019s name is hyphenated (\"Melo-Rueda\u201d), although in her asylum application it is not. We will defer to the spelling petitioner used in her asylum application and use the unhyphenated spelling in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
