We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-26\">(1) Whether, in light of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>the district court was required to address all of the claims raised in Ferrell\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-27\">If so, whether the district court failed to address Ferrell\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective with regard to the jury\u2019s inquiry regarding the number of plants involved, as well as the jury instructions regarding that evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-28\">Ferrell argues that <em>Clisby </em>applies to \u00a7 2255 motions, and that the district court disregarded Clisby\u2019s holding by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>failing to address his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s inquiry about drug quantity. In <em>Clisby, </em>we held, in the context of a petition filed by a state prisoner under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, that the district court was obligated to resolve all constitutional claims in a habeas proceeding. 960 F.2d at 936. We specified that \u201ca claim for relief ... is any allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude that <em>Clisby </em>applies to \u00a7 2255 motions. Here, Ferrell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, construed liberally, raised a claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the district court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s inquiry regarding drug quantity. Because the district court failed to address this claim on the merits in its order denying \u00a7 2255 relief, the court failed to obey Clisby\u2019s holding. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with the instruction that the court address the following claim: Whether Ferrell received ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in connection with the district court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s inquiry regarding drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
