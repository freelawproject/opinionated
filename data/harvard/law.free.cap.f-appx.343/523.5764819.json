On appeal, Frazier argues the district court erred by stating that he was accountable for over 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine in the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the sentencing court only found him responsible for an amount over 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. He contends that the district court\u2019s inaccurate factual findings violated his due process rights and Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c). Further, he requests that we remand, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), for the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding the drug amount because the drug amount was neither listed in the indictment nor found by the jury. Frazier contends that the district court, pursuant to Amendment 706, should have determined whether his sentence, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, was unconstitutional and that Amendment 706 re-opened this preserved argument. Lastly, he argues that the district court should have applied a two-level reduction to his base offense level and should have considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, along with <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been retroactively lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Although it is not clear from the record on appeal whether the sentencing court found Frazier responsible for more than <em>4.5 </em>kilograms of crack cocaine, the Presen-tence Investigation Report stated that the drug quantity was \u201csubstantially\u201d more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Even if the district court erred in stating that Frazier was sentenced based on 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, it ultimately reached the correct conclusion. Frazier was ineligible for a sentencing reduction because, although Amendment 706 would reduce his base offense level, it would not affect his guideline range of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Moore, 541 F.3d 1323, </em>1325 (11th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (holding that \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">In applying Amendment 706, the district court would have begun with the offense level of 38 and applied the 2-level reduction, making Frazier\u2019s offense level 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). In leaving all other guideline application decisions unaffected, the district court then would have applied a 2-level firearms enhancement, a 4-level role enhancement, and a 2-level obstruction of justice enhancement, resulting in an offense level of 44. The Sentencing Guidelines instruct that an \u201coffense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, pt. A, comment, (n. 2). With an offense level of 43 and a criminal history category of I, Frazier\u2019s \u201camended guideline range\u201d would be the same as his original guideline range, life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">Moreover, the district court could not have resentenced Frazier based on <em>Ap-prendi, </em>the crack-to-powder sentencing disparity, or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, because they do not provide an independent basis for reconsideration of his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (only authorizing a court to reduce a sentence where a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>dant\u2019s original sentencing range has been reduced by the Sentencing Commission). Additionally, the district court could not have recalculated the drug quantity amount because a sentencing adjustment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d). Further, <em>Booker </em>itself did not render Frazier eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-17\">.
