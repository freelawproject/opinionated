He argues that \u00a7 111 does not apply to his conduct in assaulting an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) employed by the West Baton Rouge Parish Detention Center, which had contracted with the United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, as predecessor to Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Detention and Removal Operations, and Border Patrol, to hold federal detainees pending their removal. Wences\u2019s argument is unavailing in light of <em>United States v. Jacquez-Beltran, </em>326 F.3d 661, 663 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
