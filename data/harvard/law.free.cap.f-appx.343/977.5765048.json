We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Hardnett was originally sentenced to 97 months in prison, consisting of three concurrent 37-month terms for drug and firearms offenses (counts I, II, and III), and a mandatory consecutive 60-month term for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (count IV). Hard-nett\u2019s guideline range for counts I, II and III was 70 to 87 months, but the court granted the Government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, which yielded a range of 37 to 46 months. If the amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack offenses had been in effect at the time of Hard-nett\u2019s sentencing, the guideline range would have been 57 to 71 months. A similar \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction to Hardnett\u2019s offense level would have further lowered the range to 30 to 37 months. Hardnett argues that the district court committed procedural error and abused its discretion by refusing to reduce his sentence by changing the counts I, II, and III terms to 30 months, instead of 37 months, which would have meant a reduced sentence of 90 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion only. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir. 1997). \u201c[Reductions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory; this section merely gives the district court discretion to reduce a sentence under limited circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). When a sentencing range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the district court may reduce a previously imposed term of imprisonment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">The Guideline policy statements provide that the district court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\u201d had the amended guideline been in effect at the time of sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). The court substitutes only the amended guideline provision and leaves all other guideline application decisions unaffected. <em>Id. </em>The policy statements further provide that \u201c[i]f the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">Here, the probation office\u2019s report correctly advised the district court that Hard-nett\u2019s amended guideline range would have been 57 to 71 months had the crack of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>fense amendment been in effect at the time of Hardnett\u2019s sentencing. The district court also properly noted that Hard-nett\u2019s original term of imprisonment was lower than the guideline range at the time of sentencing because of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Hardnett argues that under \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) a \u201creduction comparably less than the amended guideline range\u201d required the district court to lower his sentence to 30 months, and he cites the example of a comparably lower sentence in the guideline commentary. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 3. But \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) is itself discretionary, stating only that a comparable reduction <em>\u201cmay </em>be appropriate.\u201d \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Furthermore, the district court applied the same \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction to the amended guideline range that had been applied to the original guideline range. This resulted in a range of 30 to 37 months, and the court determined that Hardnett\u2019s sentence did not warrant a further reduction. We see no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">As part of its decision, the district court is required to consider the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c). The court also \u201cshall consider\u201d any public safety concern that a reduction may pose and \u201cmay consider\u201d any post-sentencing behavior by the defendant. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1 (B)(ii), (iii). Here, the district court expressly noted its consideration of \u201cpublic protection\u201d and the \u201ctotality of circumstances.\u201d The court considered Hard-nett\u2019s extensive criminal history, as evident by his criminal history category V, and the fact that he had been sanctioned with the loss of good time for assaultive behavior while in prison. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hardnett relief. We also conclude that the district court did not erroneously fail to hold an evidentiary hearing. Hardnett not only failed to object to the probation office\u2019s sentencing report, but he also never requested a hearing despite being advised of the procedure to do so under the district court\u2019s plan for considering cases affected by the retroactive cocaine base guideline amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Because we conclude that Hardnett cannot prevail on the merits of his claim, we need not reach the Government\u2019s contention that Hardnett\u2019s appeal is barred by an appeal waiver in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
