Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. On appeal, Desravines argues that the BIA abused its discretion and violated his due process rights by denying him CAT relief. Specifically, he argues that he was entitled to CAT relief because he would more likely than not be tortured if returned to Haiti. Lastly, Desravines also references his asylum and withholding of removal claims without any substantive argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">\u201cWe review only the [BIAj\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s decision but instead provided its own analysis, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA\u2019s legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">First, as to his CAT relief claim, \u201c[wje lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). This is so even \u201cwhen an alien, without excuse or exception, fails to exhaust that claim, but the BIA nonetheless considers the underlying issue <em>sua sponte.\u201d Id. </em>Here, we lack jurisdiction to consider his due process claim and CAT relief claim because Desravines failed to raise the issues before the BIA and exhaust his administrative remedies, notwithstanding the fact that the BIA <em>sua sponte </em>considered those claims. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">Second, as to his asylum and withholding of removal claims, \u201c[w]hile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (citations omitted). <em>See also Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n. 1 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam); <em>Tedder v. F.M.C. Corp., </em>590 F.2d 115, 117 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (deeming abandoned an issue raised in the statement of issues but not anywhere else in the brief). Here, Desravines abandoned any issue regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of his claims for asylum and withholding of removal by failing to make a substantive argument regarding the issues in his appellate brief. In fact, the \u201cARGUMENT\u201d section of his appellate brief addressed only CAT relief, with passing references to asylum and withholding of removal. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
