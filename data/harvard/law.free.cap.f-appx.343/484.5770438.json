He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the judge, citing Lopez\u2019s prior conviction under the same statute, deviated nineteen months above the applicable guideline range of 33-41 months, an increase of roughly 50% of the suggested high end guideline sentence and almost 100% greater than the low end. Lopez claims this is unreasonable because the guideline range already reflected that conviction, specifically pointing to the fact that he received (1) a two-level increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(3)(A) because he had a previous conviction for a felony immigration and naturalization offense and (2) two criminal history points for that conviction, which increased the length of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court is required to consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) [the sentencing guidelines range;] (5) any pertinent policy statement [of the Sentencing Commission;] (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aix\">The district court shall then impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the district court may choose[.]\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). A district court may impose a variance if it determines that \u201cthe case at hand falls outside the \u2018heartland\u2019 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply, perhaps because the Guidelines sentence itself fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, or perhaps because the case warrants a different sentence regardless.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (citation omitted). The Supreme Court has rejected \u201can appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. U.S., </em>552 U.S. 38, 47, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Court clarified, however, that \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50,128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In this case, the district court upwardly departed from the guideline range, giving the following justification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">One would have thought, hoped, that a period of incarceration for smuggling activity would be sufficient to the ordinary criminal to refrain from engaging in similar activity in the future. Obviously it wasn\u2019t in this case. So, I think it\u2019s appropriate to impose a sentence above the guideline range in order to protect the public and provide adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law. Obviously recidivism of similar activity does not demonstrate that type of respect for law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Beyond Lopez\u2019s criminal history and the general need for more effective deterrence, the district court considered other \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the upward variance, including the seriousness of the offense and the nature and circumstances of the conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">By focusing only on Lopez\u2019s criminal history, without providing <em>any other </em>justification as to the need to deviate almost fifty percent above the high end of the guideline range,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we believe the district court abused its discretion in concluding that this 60-month sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\">. During a colloquy with the judge, Lopez's counsel acknowledged that it was within the court's discretion to consider the previous conviction in deviating above the guideline range, despite the conviction\u2019s role in helping to dictate that range. However, the judge\u2019s ability to do so does not then give free rein to impose any sentence above without first adequately justifying that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-21\">.
