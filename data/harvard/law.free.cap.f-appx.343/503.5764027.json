On appeal, Gooden, who was sentenced as career offender, argues that, contrary to our holding in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-30 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) requires the district court consider the sentencing range established for the offense committed, which cannot be the career-offender range, as that range is an enhancement that applies to many different types of offenses. Accordingly, he argues, he meets the requirement of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a range that subsequently has been lowered.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, prohibit a reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Finally, we are bound to follow our prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>dent unless it is overruled <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Gooden\u2019s sentence was based on the career-offender provisions in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Becaus\u00e9 Goo-den\u2019s sentence did not rest on the provision regarding the quantity of crack cocaine in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which was amended under Amendment 706, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range. Thus, Gooden was ineligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. As to his argument that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided, we must follow our own precedent. <em>See Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
