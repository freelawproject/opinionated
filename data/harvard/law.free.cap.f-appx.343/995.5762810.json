We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction the part of his petition that seeks cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, and we deny the part of his petition that seeks asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">We generally have authority to review only the BIA\u2019s decision unless it is influenced by that of the IJ, in which ease we review both decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the instant case, the BIA offered its own analysis in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision; we therefore review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">Cua-Tumax contends that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) because he meets all of the statutory requirements, including that his removal would cause his daughters, United States citizens, to suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress, however, has stripped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>us of jurisdiction to review claims for discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b except when a petition involves a constitutional claim or question of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cua-Tumax alleges no constitutional violation and we cannot recast as an issue of law his claim based on the cumulative effect of financial and educational hardship that his family would suffer. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erred in denying cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Cua-Tumax next urges that the BIA erroneously denied his asylum claim because it failed to recognize his status as a member of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d-\u2014 \u201cyoung men who have been actively recruited by gangs and have refused to join them.\u201d We review the BIA\u2019s legal holdings <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, in his discretion, may grant asylum to \u201crefugees\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). To qualify as a refugee, a petitioner must establish persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution in his country on the basis of any of five categories of which membership in a particular social group is one.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Members of a particular social group \u201cshare a common immutable characteristic that they either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We, like the BIA and IJ, hold that Cua-Tumax has failed to establish that he is a member of any particular social group.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The categories of youth and gang recruitment are overly broad and offer no meaningful basis for distinguishing Cua-Tumax from other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

In a series of recent unpublished \u2014 and therefore non-precedential\u2014 opinions, we have rejected claims that petitioners belong to a particular social group based on their resistance to gang membership. <em>See, e.g., Cruz-Melgar v. Holder, </em>327 Fed.Appx. 513, 513-14 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>332 Fed.Appx. 202, 203-04 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam); <em>Rivera-Barrera v.

Although we are not bound by any of these decisions, we agree with their results, concluding that \"Guatemalan youths who resist gang recruitment\u201d does not constitute a particular social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
