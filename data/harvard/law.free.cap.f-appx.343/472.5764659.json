After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a distinct court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Here, Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to certain crack cocaine offenses. However, at his original sentencing, Jackson was subject to a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), in light of his three previous felony drug offense convictions. Thus, his sentencing range was not based on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), but on the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). As such, Amendment 706 had no effect on Jackson\u2019s sentencing range of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Jackson\u2019s argument that his original sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to cases in which a retroactive amendment affects the applicable sentencing range); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 994, 121 S.Ct. 486, 148 L.Ed.2d 458 (2000) (explaining that, in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, all original sentencing determinations remain unchanged except the guideline range affected by the amendment). His arguments regarding the applicability of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), are foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009); (concluding that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>United States v.

Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and -U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
