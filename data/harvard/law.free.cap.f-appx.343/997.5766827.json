He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence, because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed in that it is not supported by \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d Rubio-Marchan additionally contends that the guidelines produce unwarranted disparities because of the random availability of \u201cfast track\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-17\">As Rubio-Marchan concedes, the argument that his sentence is unreasonable because it results in an unwarranted disparity among defendants to whom the \u201cfast track\u201d program is available and those to whom it is not is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Accordingly, this court need not consider it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-20\">We have consistently rejected the \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not question the presumption of reasonableness and does not require district or appellate courts independently to analyze the empirical grounding of each guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Because the sentence is within the advisory guidelines range of 30 to 36 months, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Rubio-Marchan has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>that presumption. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
