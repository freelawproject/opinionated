After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">Wall was arrested as part of an undercover operation by Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents. DEA agents recorded several telephone conversations between a confidential source and defendant Wall\u2019s codefendant, Robert Allan, in which the confidential source offered to sell Allan eight kilograms of cocaine. Allan agreed to travel from Georgia to South Florida to buy the cocaine for $148,000. During the trip, Allan indicated to an undercover DEA agent, posing as the cocaine supplier, that Allan was traveling with another person. While Allan was driving, the DEA agent spoke with the unnamed individual on the phone, giving him directions to the meeting location and taking a description of the vehicle they were driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">At the pre-arranged meeting location, Allan arrived in a truck driven by defendant Wall. Wall dropped Allan off and parked a distance away. While meeting with the undercover DEA agent, Allan received a series of phone calls from Wall and eventually directed Wall to drive the truck over to the meeting location. Once the truck arrived, Allan opened the back of the truck to show the DEA agent the money to purchase the cocaine. At that point, DEA agents arrested both men.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">During a search, DEA agents found nine plastic bags containing a total of $148,000 in the back of the truck. Later, during an inventory search, DEA agents found an additional plastic bag containing $24,000 in a storage compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-17\">Shortly after their arrest, Allan and Wall were transported to a nearby DEA office. Allan cooperated with DEA agents and admitted that the two men had traveled from Georgia to South Florida to purchase drugs, although he identified the drug as marijuana. After being advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, Wall made a brief statement to the effect that he had to pay the bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">A grand jury indicted Allan and Wall on charges of conspiracy and attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Allan pled guilty to the conspiracy count and agreed to testify against Wall at trial. Pursuant to Allan\u2019s plea agreement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>government agreed to recommend guidelines reductions in Allan\u2019s sentence for acceptance of responsibility and safety-valve relief, which would yield an advisory guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, Allan received a 70-month sentence, which was later reduced to 39 months upon the government\u2019s Rule 35 motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Prior to trial, defendant Wall filed a motion to suppress his post-arrest statements and the evidence seized from his truck. Wall argued that there was no probable cause to arrest him and that the evidence and post-arrest statements should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal seizure. At a suppression hearing, three law enforcement officers testified about the undercover operation and the arrest of Allan and Wall. Afterward, the district court concluded that probable cause supported the arrest and denied Wall\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found in Wall\u2019s vehicle and his post-arrest statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">During a two-day jury trial, the government presented testimony from three DEA agents and an officer with the Bro-ward County Sheriffs Office who participated in the undercover investigation and arrest. The government also called code-fendant Allan, who testified about how he and Wall borrowed money and traveled from Georgia to South Florida to purchase cocaine. According to Allan, Wall actively participated in the planning of the drug transaction and procured the money for the transaction in Vero Beach during the trip from Georgia to South Florida. The government introduced (1) a videotape of the meeting between the undercover DEA agent and Allan and Wall, and (2) a hotel receipt indicating Wall had paid cash for a room in Vero Beach the night before the meeting. After the government rested, Wall rested without presenting any evidence. Wall\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. After jury deliberations, the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Wall\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended an advisory guidelines range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Wall did not object to the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations. At sentencing, Wall\u2019s wife spoke on his behalf. Wall then requested that the district court impose the mandatory minimum 120-month sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Denying his request, the district court imposed a 144-month sentence. In pronouncing the sentence, the district court noted that, after considering the parties\u2019 statements and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it concluded that a midrange sentence was \u201csufficient to deter future criminal conduct, to provide sufficient punishment, and hopefully to promote respect for the law.\u201d Wall filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ApS\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Wall argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized incident to his arrest, including his post-arrest statements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Wall contends he was mei\u2019ely present at the time of the offense and DEA agents never heard him discussing or negotiating for the cocaine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Under the Fourth Amendment, officers may effectuate a warrantless arrest in public where there is probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred. <em>United States v. Goddard, </em>312 F.3d 1360, 1362-63 (11th Cir.2002). Law enforcement officers have probable cause to arrest when the facts and circumstances within their collective knowledge, \u201cor of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.\u201d <em>Craig v. Singletary, </em>127 F.3d 1030, 1042 (11th Cir.1997) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cFor probable cause to exist, ... an arrest must be objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1305 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted, alternation in original). While presence alone is not sufficient to constitute probable cause, \u201cpresence and additional factors that would lead a prudent person to believe that an offense has been or is being committed is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Irurzun, </em>631 F.2d 60, 63 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In determining if such a reasonable belief exists, we may consider the involved officers\u2019 experience, because \u201c[cjonduct innocent in the eyes of the untrained may carry entirely different \u2018messages\u2019 to the experienced or trained observer.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>969 F.2d 999, 1003-04 (11th Cir.1992) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Here, the district court correctly concluded there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to arrest Wall. Testimony at the suppression hearing showed that during the course of the DEA\u2019s operation, the officers collectively learned that: (1) Allan was traveling to South Florida with a companion on a drug-buying venture; (2) Allan\u2019s companion received the directions to the transaction location and gave agents identifying information about his truck; (3) once Allan and Wall arrived at the meeting location, Wall sat in the truck approximately 200 yards away, apparently exchanging a series of telephone calls with Allan while Allan made contact with the undercover agent; (4) Allan subsequently directed Wall to drive the truck, which contained the drug money, to the transaction site; (5) when Wall arrived, Allan told Wall he was showing the money to the undercover agent; (6) Wall was looking in the direction of the money as Allan displayed it to the undercover agent; and (7) it is a common practice during drug transactions to keep drugs and money separate in order to prevent theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Given the totality of the circumstances and the officers\u2019 experience, the agents were justified in believing that Wall was not simply an unwitting companion, but a knowing and willing participant in the drug transaction. Accordingly, there was probable cause to arrest Wall, and the district court did not err in denying Wall\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>motion to suppress the evidence and post-arrest statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Wall argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. Wall contends that the evidence showed that he was merely present when Allan committed the drug offense and not that he was an active participant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if a reasonable jury could conclude that it established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir. 2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 5.Ct. 2962, 171 L.Ed.2d 886 (2008). Therefore, we will reverse only if no reasonable trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">To convict a defendant for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) that the defendant knew of the essential objectives of the conspiracy, and (3) that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1326 (11th Cir.1997). Likewise, to sustain a conviction for attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the government must prove that the defendant \u201c(1) acted with the kind of culpability required to possess cocaine knowingly and willfully and with intent to distribute it; and (2) engaged in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the crime under circumstances strongly corroborative of [his] criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and the jury\u2019s verdict, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Wall was a knowing and active participant in the conspiracy and attempt to purchase more than five kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute. According to codefendant Allan\u2019s testimony, Wall was not only aware of and intimately involved with the decision to purchase narcotics, but he facilitated the venture by acquiring the necessary funds and delivering those funds to the transaction site. Moreover, Allan\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted by the other evidence offered at trial, and was substantiated in part by the audiovisual recordings made by the officers and the hotel receipt indicating that Wall rented the hotel room in Vero Beach. Ultimately, the jury was entitled to credit Allan\u2019s testimony and infer that Wall was complicit in the charged offenses. <em>See Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1285; <em>Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1324. Contrary to Wall\u2019s suggestion, Allan\u2019s testimony was not facially unbelievable or incredible as a matter of law. In addition, the fact that Allan personally benefited from his cooperation with the government does not negate the jury\u2019s prerogative to believe or disbelieve his testimony. <em>See Calderon, </em>127 F.3d at 1324-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>In addition, a reasonable jury could have inferred Wall\u2019s knowledge and intent from the circumstances surrounding his presence at the scene of the crime. The evidence showed that Wall was not only present at the transaction, but that he drove the vehicle containing the drug money to the meeting location, he personally exchanged information with the undercover agent regarding the designated location and means of identifying one another, and he was present when his codefendant displayed the money after being notified that it was going to be revealed to the undercover agent. In light of the surrounding circumstances, Wall\u2019s actions further permit a reasonable jury to infer knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy and attempt to possess the narcotics. <em>See United States v. Lluesma, </em>45 F.3d 408, 410 (11th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Bain, </em>736 F.2d 1480, 1485 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">C. Reasonableness of Wall\u2019s Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We ordinarily expect that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Wall argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Procedurally, Wall contends that the district court failed to give sufficient reasons for a mid-range sentence, as required by \u00a7 3553(c)(1), failed to consider mitigating circumstances, and failed to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. Substantively, Wall claims that the district court\u2019s procedural errors resulted in a sentence that was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Here, Wall has not met his burden to show that his 144-month sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Wall does not dispute that his advisory guidelines range was properly calculated. In selecting a sentence, the district court expressly acknowledged that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements and all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court explained that it determined that a midrange sentence was necessary to deter future criminal conduct, provide sufficient punishment, and promote respect for the law. Thus, the district court did not fail to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(1). Contrary to Wall\u2019s assertions, \u00a7 3553(c)(1) did not require the district court to articulate its consideration of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">We also reject Wall\u2019s argument that his 144-month sentence, in the middle of the advisory guidelines range of 121 to 151 months, is substantively unreasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The difference between Wall\u2019s sentence and Allan\u2019s sentence reflects that Allan pled guilty and received reductions arising from his acceptance of responsibility and the safety-valve provision. Plus, Allan cooperated with the government in prosecuting Wall. The district court was within its discretion to conclude that the mitigating factors Wall points out \u2014 his personal history, characteristics and role in the offense \u2014 were outweighed by the need to provide just punishment for such a serious offense, to deter him from future criminal conduct and to promote respect for the law. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence in the middle of the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-13\">. <em>Miranda v.

We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, construing all facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo.
