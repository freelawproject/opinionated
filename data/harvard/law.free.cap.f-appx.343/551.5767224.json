Williams argues that the district court abused its discretion in both denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and refusing to hold a hearing on the motion. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">In July 1991, a jury convicted Williams of conspiracy to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 (\u201cCount 1\u201d); possession with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201cCount 2\u201d); and traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1952(a)(3) (\u201cCount 3\u201d). <em>See </em>Rl-1 at 1-3; Rl-133. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Williams a base offense level of 36, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (Nov.1988). The parole officer compiling the PSI recommended a four-level increase for Williams\u2019s role as an organizer or leader in criminal activity that involved at least five participants. Williams\u2019s criminal history category was set at V, based on 10 criminal history points for prior convictions of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm, and aggravated assault, <em>inter alia. </em>With a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of V, Williams\u2019s recommended guideline range was 360 months of imprisonment to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">At sentencing, the district court did not apply the four-level aggravating role increase to the offense level, but instead applied a two-level aggravating role enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>See </em>R10 at 3, 7-8. This brought Williams\u2019s offense level to 38. Williams\u2019s guideline range remained 360 months of imprisonment to life imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>at 12. As to Counts 1 and 2, the district court sentenced Williams to 360 months of imprisonment for each count, and as to Count 3, the court sentenced Williams to sixty months of imprisonment, all terms set to run concurrently. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>See id. </em>We affirmed Williams\u2019s sentence in 1993. <em>See </em>Rl-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In February 2008, Williams filed the present <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction, in which he sought a two-level reduction to his offense level based on Amendment 706. <em>See </em>R2-239 at 3. He claimed that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), entitled him to a full sentencing rehearing. <em>See id. </em>at 6-7. Williams also contended that the district court should depart below his amended guideline range based on his post-conviction rehabilitation. <em>See id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The district court, without conducting a hearing, denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>R2-244. The court concluded that under Amendment 706, Williams\u2019s base offense level was reduced to 34 and his guideline range became 292 to 365 months of imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>at 4. Nevertheless, the court denied the motion based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, the court found that a sentence reduction was not warranted because the offenses \u201cwere very serious in nature and were indicative of Williams\u2019s violent nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the district court determined the 360-month sentence to be \u201cin line with similar sentences imposed by [it] and by other courts for similar crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that, even if the Guidelines had been advisory when Williams was originally sentenced, it would have imposed the same sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>\u201c[T]he decision whether or not to grant an evidentiary hearing generally is committed to the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Yesil, </em>991 F.2d 1527, 1531 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under the first part of the analysis, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as public safety considerations, under the second part of the analysis, regardless of whether it ultimately denies or grants \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per cu-riam). The district court <em>\u201cmay consider </em>the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct ... in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cWhile the district court must undertake this two-step analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>sis, its decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In regard to the second part of this analysis, the district court need not specifically articulate the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, \u201cas long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range; (5) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants with similar records; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">As an initial matter, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a hearing on Williams\u2019s motion. Nothing in \u00a7 3582(c) requires a district court to hold an evidentiary hearing, and there were no new factual determinations to be made. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that \u201cthe district court is to leave all of its previous factual decisions intact when deciding whether to apply a guideline retroactively\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In this case, Amendment 706 reduced Williams\u2019s guideline range from 360 months of imprisonment to life imprisonment to a range of 292 to 365 months of imprisonment. Nevertheless, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reduce Williams\u2019s 360-month sentence. First, the district court explicitly followed the steps in <em>Bravo </em>by recalculating Williams\u2019s base level and amended guideline range under Amendment 706. Second, the court specifically considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in deciding to retain the original sentence. In its order, the court cited the serious nature of the offense, Williams\u2019s characteristics, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities as reasons for retaining the original sentence. The district court also considered the public safety factors, finding that an earlier release date was not warranted based on Williams\u2019s violent nature. The district court\u2019s findings were supported by Williams\u2019s prior convictions for attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm, and aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The court was permitted to consider Williams\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in determining whether to apply a sentence reduction, but despite Williams\u2019s contentions, it was not required to consider such conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)) (stating that the court \u201cmay consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant\u201d). Furthermore, the district court was not required to consider <em>Booker </em>or <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (observing that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Williams\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Williams appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>that the district court abused its discretion in both denying the motion and refusing to hold a hearing on it. We conclude that Williams\u2019s contentions are without merit and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
