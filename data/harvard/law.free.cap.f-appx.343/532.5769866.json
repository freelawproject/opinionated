For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">White, an African American, filed this <em>pro </em>se employment discrimination action against FDHSMV, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He generally alleged that FDHSMV discriminated against him on the basis of race by failing to hire him as a Florida State Trooper. White subsequently filed a second amended complaint, in which he alleged that, in response to filing this lawsuit, FDHSMV retaliated against him by refusing to allow him to re-apply for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">After approximately two years of litigation, the parties each filed a motion for summary judgment. In his motion, White asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that several white males were hired by FDHSMV, despite adverse information in their backgrounds. Specifically, he asserted that some individuals had credit issues, some had arrest records or driving records, some had been terminated from past employment, some had poor military records, some had drug problems, and others lacked education and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">Relying on White\u2019s employment application and admissions in his deposition testimony, FDHSMV responded by emphasizing the significant adverse information in White\u2019s own background, including the facts that he: was disciplined while in the Marine Corps three times under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for disobeying orders and convicted by Court Martial on the fourth such charge; was dismissed from the Mississippi Highway Patrol Academy based on his attitude; \u201cfixed\u201d traffic tickets and asked other officers to do the same; had been involved in several traffic accidents and received several vehicular citations; had financial problems; and omitted information on his employment application. As a result, FDHSMV argued that White had not made out a <em>prima faeie </em>case on his racial discrimination claim because he did not point to any similarly situated non-minori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ty individuals who were hired. In this respect, it relied on an affidavit by a Lieutenant Castleberry, indicating that FDHSMV did not hire White due to the numerous issues in his background.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The magistrate ultimately issued a report, recommending that summary judgment be granted in FDHSMV\u2019s favor. With respect to White\u2019s racial discrimination claim, the magistrate found that White failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case because he could not show that any similarly situated non-minority applicant was treated differently. In this regard, the magistrate found that, while White presented evidence \u201cthat particular persons had issues with credit problems, an arrest or criminal history, a problem in the military, no college degree and the like,\u201d he had not \u201cpointed to one person\u201d who was hired that had the same \u201cnumber of problems in [as] many areas\u201d as he had. Alternatively, the magistrate also concluded that, in light of White\u2019s background, FDHSMV had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for not hiring him, none of which were shown to be pretextual. The magistrate also dismissed White\u2019s retaliation claim on the ground that White had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as the events giving rise to the claim occurred after the commencement of the instant lawsuit. Overruling White\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and granted summary judgment to FDHSMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSummary judgment is rendered \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). \u201cIn making this assessment, the Court must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and must resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-mov-ant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u201cTitle VII prohibits employers from discriminating \u2018against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir.) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 404, 172 L.Ed.2d 286 (2008). Where, as in this case, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff is required to \u201cprove discrimination through circumstantial evidence, using the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">A plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>ease of racial discrimination by showing that: 1) he belongs to a protected class; 2) he was qualified to do the job; 3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and 4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his class more favorably. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cUnder this framework, if the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 976 (quotation omitted). \u201cIf the employer does this, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>son is not [a] pretext for discrimination unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Com\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">White\u2019s only argument on appeal attacking the merits of the district court\u2019s summary judgment order is that FDHSMV \u201chired individuals outside [his] protected class that had greater background issues\u201d than he did.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For support, White asserts, as he did below, that there were \u201cindividuals that had arrest records, individuals that had actually been disciplined as law enforcement officers, individuals with drug use issues, individuals that had bankruptcy issues, and finally, individuals that were not even qualified to perform the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">However, White\u2019s assertion is insufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>ease of discrimination, as he has not identified any non-minority individual who was hired with a background \u201cnearly identical\u201d to his. <em>See Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cWe require that the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical....\u201d). As the district court correctly explained, this is so because, while White may have shown that some non-minority individuals had isolated issues in their backgrounds, he failed to identify any such individual that had the same \u201cnumber of problems in [as] many areas\u201d as he had. For this same reason, the district court also correctly found that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that White did make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, he failed to show that FDHSMV\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for failing to hire him \u2014 the adverse information in his background \u2014 was a pretext for discrimination. <em>See Silvera v. Orange County School Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1259-62 (11th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to FDHSMV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-14\">. Although White also invoked the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in his original complaint, he later voluntarily dismissed that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">. White has abandoned any argument on appeal challenging the dismissal of his unlawful retaliation claim. See <em>Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1128, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (arguments not raised by a <em>pro se </em>litigant on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-19\">. White also raises a number of miscellaneous arguments in his brief relating to the underlying litigation, but we conclude that they are all plainly without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
