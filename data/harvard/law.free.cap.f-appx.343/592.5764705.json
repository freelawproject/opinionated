The district court reduced Jennings\u2019s sentence under Amendment 706<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Sentencing Guidelines. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">On appeal, Jennings first argues that the district court had the authority to sentence him below the amended guidelines range based on <em>United States v. </em>Booker; 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In the light of our decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664), we reject Jennings\u2019s argument. In <em>Melvin, </em>we concluded that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not apply to section 3582(c)(2) proceedings and that a district court is bound by the limitations imposed on its discretion by section 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 1192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">Jennings next argues that his sentence procedurally and substantively is unreasonable because the district court did not calculate correctly his amended guidelines range or consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. \u201cOnce it is established that [section] 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">A \u201cdistrict court must make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under\u201d section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range and holding constant all other guidelines determinations made at the original sentencing hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ing. <em>Id. </em>Then, the court must consider the factors in section 3553(a) and determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">In addition, we review an ultimate sentence for procedural error and substantive reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (2008) (in the context of original sentencing). Procedural error occurs when, among other things, the district court fails to calculate correctly the guidelines range or fails to consider the section 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The district court originally assigned Jennings a base offense level of 36 based on his possession of 530.4 grams of crack cocaine. With sentencing adjustments for possession of a dangerous weapon, obstruction of justice, and acceptance of responsibility, Jennings had an adjusted offense level of 38. With a criminal history category of VI, Jennings had a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court sentenced Jennings to 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In the section 3582(c)(2) proceedings, the district court reduced Jennings\u2019s sentence to 324 months. In a form order, the court noted that Jennings\u2019s original adjusted offense level was 41 and that his amended offense level was 35 with a guidelines range of 292 to 365 months. But Jennings\u2019s base offense level would be reduced to 34 after applying Amendment 706 to his case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (corresponding to quantities of 500 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine). Keeping all other guidelines determinations intact, Jennings would have an adjusted offense level of 36 and a guidelines range of 324 to 405 months. The court\u2019s order also made no mention of the section 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The district court abused its discretion under either section 3582(c)(2) procedure or reasonableness review by calculating incorrectly the amended guidelines range and failing to consider the section 3553(a) factors. But we will not remand based on a harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). And we conclude that the district court\u2019s error here was harmless: the guideline calculation error benefitted Jennings as his 324-month sentence was the lowest possible he could have received under Amendment 706. As noted, the district court had no discretion to sentence Jennings below the correctly calculated amended guidelines range. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. No remand is necessary. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 670-71 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that an error in applying an upward departure from criminal history category I to II was harmless where a correct calculation of the defendant\u2019s criminal history would have placed him in criminal history category II); <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>998 F.2d 1571, 1579 (11th Cir. 1993) (concluding that a remand was unnecessary where defendants received the lowest possible terms of imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Because Jennings received the lowest possible sentence he could have received under the correctly calculated amended guidelines range, his substantial rights were unaffected by the district court\u2019s procedural errors. <em>See Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d at 670 (\u201c[t]o find harmless error, we must determine that the error did not affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>substantial rights of the parties\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3K\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-13\">.
