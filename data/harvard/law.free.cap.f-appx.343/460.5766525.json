On appeal, Nor-kute argues substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding, or the denial of her asylum claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA issued its own decision but also adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion, so we will review both. Issues of legal interpretation are reviewed <em>de novo, Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001), and administrative fact findings, including adverse credibility findings, are reviewed \u201cunder the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Under this test, we will not reverse the BIA\u2019s factual finding unless the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Norkute argues substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Specifically, she argues (1) her oral testimony was consistent with her written asylum application and the background reports on Lithuania, and (2) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based solely on \u201cmere conjecture and opinion\u201d and his \u201cethnocentric perspective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">To be considered an adverse credibility determination, the IJ or BIA must state explicitly the applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, and the IJ and BIA \u201cmust offer specific, cogent reasons\u201d for that finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An adverse credibility determination \u201cdoes not alleviate the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">The IJ and BIA made explicit adverse credibility determinations, finding Nor-kute\u2019s testimony was not credible based on its implausibility. We have held con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>cerns about an applicant\u2019s credibility on \u201ckey elements of the claim,\u201d combined with the applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure to rebut these with sufficient corroborating evidence and explanation,\u201d supported the denial of asylum. <em>See Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1369 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the IJ and BIA provided specific, cogent reasons for doubting Norkute\u2019s veracity, including concerns regarding the believability of key events in her testimony and the lack of corroborating police and medical reports. Norkute\u2019s only attempt to rebut these findings comes from her con-clusory statements labeling the determinations as \u201cethnocentric\u201d and \u201cmere conjecture and opinion.\u201d Her response provides an insufficient explanation to compel reversal. <em>Nrelca, </em>408 F.3d at 1369. Accordingly, we deny Norkute\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-11\">. Because Norkute does not challenge the denial of CAT relief on appeal, she has abandoned any claim in this respect. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding issues not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned). Likewise, she has abandoned her withholding-of-removal claim by failing to make any substantive arguments pertaining to this issue, even though she mentions it in passing in her brief. <em>See Bayro v. Reno, </em>142 F.3d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir. 1998) (\u2018\u2018[W]hen a parly lists an issue for appellate review but does not discuss that question in their argument, they have abandoned it.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
