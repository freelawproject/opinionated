More than three years later, in October 2006, Cala filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Cala\u2019s application, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the request for asylum was time-barred and that Cala\u2019s allegations did not rise to the level of persecution. Cala appealed the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding that Cala had not proven that exigent circumstances justified the failure to timely file his asylum application and that Cala had not met his burden of proving eligibility for withholding of removal. Cala moved for reconsideration, arguing that (1) the BIA should have permitted him to file an out-of-time asylum application due to extraordinary circumstances; and (2) given the record, the BIA erred by finding that he did not suffer past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution. The BIA denied this motion to reconsider. Cala now petitions, <em>pro se, </em>for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider its previous order denying his petition for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">We \u201creview subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We review \u201cthe BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">In his petition, Cala first argues that the BIA erred by finding that his untimely asylum application was not justified by extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">An asylum application must be \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application may be considered if the alien can demonstrate the \u201cexistence of changed circumstances which materially affect\u201d his eligibility or \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d relating to the delay in filing his application. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). However, \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d made pursuant to \u00a7 1158(a)(2). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), (a)(3). We have held that this language precludes federal court review of determinations regarding the timeliness of an asylum application or the \u201cchanged or extraordinary circumstances\u201d exceptions. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Because we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the extraordinary circumstances exception did not excuse the untimeliness of Cala\u2019s asylum application, we dismiss this part of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">Cala next argues that the BIA erred by failing to reconsider its finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>that Cala did not establish past persecution in support of his petition for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">A motion to reconsider must \u201cstate the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and [must] be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). We have held that \u201cmerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA\u201d fails to satisfy this standard. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In his motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s denial of his appeal, Cala argued that the BIA erred in finding that Cala did not establish that he had been persecuted in Venezuela or that it was more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution upon returning to Venezuela. Cala pointed to evidence in the record indicating that Cala was detained, beaten, and sprayed with tear gas after being taken by MVR members for protesting against them. However, these arguments offered nothing more than a reiteration of the arguments and evidence set forth in his appeal. The BIA already considered and rejected these arguments in its original order. It is well established that a motion for reconsideration is intended to \u201ceontest[ ] the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record\u201d and will be denied if it is based on arguments that were or could have been made in an earlier proceeding. <em>In re O-S-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Cala\u2019s motion for reconsideration, because that motion merely restated the arguments Cala had previously raised before the BIA and did not specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s original order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, we deny this part of Cala\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\">.
