He moves to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Hawkins leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Hawkins is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-17\">Hawkins challenges his sentencing as a career offender and argues that \u00a7 3582(c) is applicable to his sentences based upon the amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines. Hawkins may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a challenge to the appropriateness of the district court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement in its calculation of his original sentences. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, because Hawkins\u2019s sentences were based upon his prior convictions and not upon a quantity of crack cocaine, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-18\">Hawkins has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b997-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
