Andrew<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals his 60-month sentence, imposed after he pled guilty to attempted bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2113(a). On appeal, he argues that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence because it applied a six-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, based on his co-defendant Sergio Rivera\u2019s \u201cotherwise use[ ]\u201d of a firearm. Specifically, he contends that (1) the district court clearly erred by finding that Rivera used a firearm during the offense, arguing that the evidence was insufficiently speculative; and that (2) the district court erroneously concluded that Rivera \u201cotherwise used,\u201d as opposed to \u201cbrandished,\u201d the firearm, because he never used it to make any kind of threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Both arguments raised by Andrew concern the application of the same enhancement, Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2). In calculating a defendant\u2019s robbery offense level, Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">(B) if a firearm was otherwise used, increase by 6 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">(C) if a firearm was brandished or possessed, increase by 5 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">(D) if a dangerous weapon was otherwise used, increase by 4 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">(E)if a dangerous weapon was brandished or possessed, increase by 3 levels....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B)-(E). The district court applied a six-level increase based on Rivera\u2019s \u201cotherwise use[ ]\u201d of a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Andrew contends that the district court should have applied one of the other enhancements listed above. Significantly, Andrew does not argue that his co-defendant\u2019s use of a weapon was not reasonably foreseeable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">I. Firearm versus dangerous weapon</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">Andrew contends that the district court committed clear error by finding that his co-defendant used an actual firearm during the attempted bank robbery. Andrew argues that his co-defendant did not have a firearm, and therefore the enhancement for a dangerous weapon pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) or (b)(2)(E) is appropriate. \u201c[W]e review the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1247 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-17\">The Guidelines provide that the term \u201c[fjirearm\u201d means a weapon that is designed \u201cto expel a projectile.\u201d U.S. SENTENCING Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(G). The term \u201c[djangerous weapon,\u201d however, encompasses \u201can object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument-\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(D) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>If a defendant challenges one of the factual bases for his sentence, the government must prove the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999). The district court may consider reliable hearsay evidence at sentencing, so long \u201cas the evidence has sufficient indicia of reliability, the [district] court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Zlatogur, </em>271 F.3d 1025, 1031 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (quotations marks and citation omitted). In addition, \u201cthe appellate court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the sentencing court to judge the credibility of the witnesses .... \u201d <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1259 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Andrew\u2019s argument that the evidence was speculative is without merit. Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent John MacVeigh testified at sentencing regarding the contents of the defendants\u2019 post-arrest statements, including Andrew\u2019s later-recanted assertion that the gun was real, Andrew\u2019s assertion that the object resembled the real gun that Rivera owned and Rivera had previously shown him, and Andrew\u2019s assertion that Rivera, en route to the robbery, expressed his desire to shoot a particular bank employee. Furthermore, the bank teller testified at sentencing that the object Rivera held during the robbery appeared to be a real gun, and that Rivera, a former employee of the bank, had previously boasted to her that he owned a gun. Surveillance photos further confirmed the teller\u2019s account of the robbery, and recent receipts from \u201cGator Guns\u201d suggested that Rivera purchased a firearm (or firearms) before the attempted bank robbery. As such, Andrew has failed to establish that the district court clearly erred by finding that Rivera had an actual firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">II. Otherwise used versus brandished or possessed</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Andrew next contends that the district court erred in concluding that his co-defendant\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d a firearm as opposed to \u201cbrandishing]\u201d a firearm. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(C), (I). Our review is <em>de novo. See United States v. Cover) </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">\u201c[Otherwise used\u201d means that \u201cthe conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\u201d U.S. Sentenoing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(1). \u201cBrandished\u201d means \u201cthat all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(C). We have held that \u201cthe use of a firearm to make an explicit or implicit threat against a specific person constitutes \u2018otherwise use\u2019 of the firearm.\u201d <em>Cover, </em>199 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The evidence showed that Rivera pointed his gun at the bank teller while instructing her to retrieve the keys to the bank\u2019s vault and while escorting her to the vault area. Accordingly, Rivera did more than make the presence of his gun known to the teller: he used it to obtain her compliance with his requests. The district court correctly concluded that Rivera used the firearm to, at a minimum, implicitly threaten the teller. Therefore, the district court properly increased his offense level for \u201cotherwise use[ ]\u201d of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly increased Andrew\u2019s offense level by six levels because his co-defendant \u201cotherwise used\u201d a firearm. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\">.
