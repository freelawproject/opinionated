For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">In 2001, El-Amin pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to three counts of submitting fraudulent W-2 forms to the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 287 and 2. On May 30, 2001, the district court entered a judgment of conviction, sentencing El-Amin to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release, and ordering him to pay $1,032 in restitution. The terms of El-Amin\u2019s supervised release required that he, <em>inter alia, </em>refrain from committing another federal, state, or local offense, report to the probation officer as directed, work regularly at a lawful occupation, and pay any restitution ordered by the court. On June 4, 2001, El-Amin filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for appointment of appellate counsel, but the district court denied the motion, and no direct appeal was ever taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">In January 2008, El-Amin began serving his term of supervised release, but, in August 2008, he was arrested for violating the conditions of his supervision. The probation officer alleged that El-Amin had violated his supervision by: 1) failing to pay restitution, as ordered by the court; 2) failing to work regularly at a lawful occupation; 3) failing to report to the probation office, as directed, on four separate occasions; and 4) committing new criminal conduct, namely, aggravated assault by threatening his son with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">At the revocation hearing, the court first reviewed the allegations against El-Amin, noted that the aggravated-assault allegation was a Grade A violation, and explained that, if it revoked his supervised release, it could impose the statutory maximum sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of his three original underlying offenses, to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">The government called Officer P.J. Bou-da of the Jacksonville Police Department, who testified that, on July 14, 2008, he responded to a call from El-Amin\u2019s 18 year old son, Paul, who stated that El-Amin threatened to stab him with a knife. When Bouda arrived at the scene, Paul told Bouda that he and El-Amin had argued, they had each punched each other in the face, and, during the fight, El-Amin grabbed a knife from the kitchen and came at Paul. At that point, Paul ran back into his bedroom and locked the door, and El-Amin \u201cstarted stabbing at the door trying to get into the door.\u201d Paul then climbed out of his bedroom window, called the police, and met Bouda outside the gate of the apartment complex. At the time Paul and Bouda met, Paul told Bouda that he was \u201cafraid\u201d of El-Amin, and he acted \u201cvery afraid\u201d as well. Bouda later spoke with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>El-Amin and his wife, both of whom stated that, although El-Amin had come at Paul with a knife, El-Amin did so only to scare Paul, not to harm him. After El-Amin admitted that he intended to scare Paul with the knife, Bouda placed El-Amin under arrest for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. During Bouda\u2019s investigation of the incident, he \u201cobserved five knife marks in the bedroom door of Paul El-Amin, one of them being so strong that it actually went through the door to the other side and you could see where the knife came out the other side.\u201d When asked if he thought the knife incident might have been a prank, Bouda responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">By the way the victim was scared, I do not believe that it was a prank. You don\u2019t stab at someone\u2019s door for a prank. With the force that he used to stab through that door, to make it to the other side of the door with the knife, I do not believe that it was a prank. I believe that he intentionally meant to scare the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Bouda clarified that, although he did believe that El-Amin meant to scare Paul, he did not believe that El-Amin actually intended to harm him.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The government called the probation officer, Joseph Pinto, and, although he testified mostly about the other six alleged supervision violations, Pinto noted that he had spoken to El-Amin\u2019s wife, who told him that El-Amin \u201cactually went after his son ... with a knife, but in her opinion he didn\u2019t want to physically harm him, he just wanted to scare him.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">El-Amin then called his wife, Lula, who testified in a manner generally consistent with the above testimony, emphasizing that El-Amin never intended to harm Paul with the knife, but rather just wanted to \u201cchastise\u201d or \u201cscare\u201d him for disciplinary purposes. Although she initially testified that El-Amin merely \u201cnicked\u201d Paul\u2019s bedroom door with the knife, she ultimately acknowledged that he drove the knife through the door out of frustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The court ultimately found that El-Amin had committed all of the alleged violations of his supervision, with the exception of one count of failing to report to the probation officer. With respect to the aggravated-assault allegation, the court rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that El-Amin was merely attempting to discipline Paul through corporal punishment and found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">the defendant got into an argument with his son, Paul El-Amin, and that the defendant Ruben El-Amin went into the kitchen, after an exchange of words, grabbed a knife and started towards Paul El-Amin with the knife. Obviously Mr. Paul El-Amin was concerned and felt threatened by this knife, because he retreated through the apartment into a bedroom, locked the bedroom door. And after the door to the bedroom was locked, Mr. El-Amin took the knife and thrust it into the door at least five times, at one point actually driving the knife through the door. And it appears to me that placing somebody in fear of being stabbed with a knife is exactly what took place, and that\u2019s the crime that was proscribed by the Florida Statutes in this instance. It was enough to scare him, it was enough for him to be worried about the knife, and the knife marks in the door show that the defendant actually would have, if he possibly could, used the knife against his son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">.... If [the] son wasn\u2019t scared, he didn\u2019t have to lock the door and go out the window and call the police. He could have said, mom, tell him to put the knife down and let me know when he does and I\u2019ll come out, but that\u2019s not what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>After the court heard argument from the parties, and El-Amin requested leniency, the court revoked El-Amin\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of his three original underlying offenses, to run concurrently. The court explained its sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">I believe the actual guideline range as to each count is ... 33 to 41 months, but the statutory maximum is the 24 months....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">So that is the sentence that I\u2019ll impose in the case.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">After he\u2019s completed the service of that sentence he\u2019ll be discharged from any jurisdiction of the Court. I don\u2019t believe that the defendant is supervisable, taking into consideration not only the underlying violations, but what\u2019s happened during the period of his supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">Now, in imposing the sentence, I\u2019ve considered the factors set forth in Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 3553(a), and the advisory guidelines and policy statements that have been issued by the United States Sentencing Commission ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">[T]he problem with you is you blame it on everybody else other than yourself. I mean, how do you pick up a knife in a kitchen? There are so many ways to discipline an 18-year-old that lives in the house with you. The biggest thing is, hey, you\u2019re 18 and you\u2019re graduated from high school, move out next week, you\u2019re on your own....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">Rather than pick up a knife and go running after him. You got to learn to control that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">During the course of the supervised release proceedings, El-Amin, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen the time for filing a direct appeal, arguing that his June 4, 2001 pro <em>se </em>motion for appointment of appellate counsel should have been liberally construed as a timely notice of appeal. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">On appeal, El-Amin first argues that the court erred by not authorizing him to file a belated direct appeal of his original sentence, repeating his argument that his <em>pro se </em>motion for appellate counsel should have been construed as a timely notice of appeal. However, El-Amin does not identify the source of the district court\u2019s authority to do so, and it is well-established under our case law that a supervised release revocation proceeding is not the proper forum in which to attack the underlying conviction, <em>United States v. Francischine, </em>512 F.2d 827, 828 (5th Cir.1975),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the underlying sentence, <em>United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313,1316 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, the underlying conviction and sentence are presumed valid until vacated in a separate proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 317 (11th Cir.1993); <em>Francis-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>chine, </em>512 F.2d at 828. Accordingly, we do not address the merits of El-Amin\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">El-Amin next argues that the district court erred by finding that he committed aggravated assault, a Grade A violation of supervision. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s conclusion that appellant violated the terms of his supervised release for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). The district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release if the court \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Under Florida law, \u201c[a]n \u2018assault\u2019 is an intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to the person of another, coupled with an apparent ability to do so, and doing some act which creates a well-founded fear in such other person that such violence is imminent.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.011. Thus, \u201c[t]he statute requires proof of three elements: (1) an intentional, unlawful threat; (2) an apparent ability to carry it out; and (3) creation of a well-founded fear that the violence is imminent.\u201d <em>Benitez v. State, </em>901 So.2d 935, 937 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005). The assault is \u201caggravated\u201d if, <em>inter alia, </em>it is committed \u201c[w]ith a deadly weapon without intent to kill....\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021(l)(a). Aggravated assault is a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.021(2), 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In this case, it is beyond dispute that El-Amin intended to threaten Paul with a knife. Although El-Amin emphasizes on appeal that he did not actually intend to harm Paul, the statute only requires that the aggressor intentionally commit a threatening act; it does not require that the aggressor actually intend to carry out the threat. With respect to the second element, it is clear that, in coming at Paul with the knife during a heated argument, El-Amin had the apparent ability to carry out his threat. Finally, in coming at Paul with the knife \u2014 and ultimately driving it through Paul\u2019s bedroom door \u2014 El-Amin created a well-founded fear in Paul of imminent violence, as evidenced by the fact that Paul retreated into his bedroom and locked the door, climbed out of his bedroom window, and called the police. Indeed, Officer Bouda testified that, upon meeting Paul at the apartment complex, Paul told him that he was afraid of El-Amin and acted accordingly. El-Amin\u2019s assertion that he was merely attempting to discipline his son in a reasonable manner is legally irrelevant, since his actions constituted aggravated assault under the law. Thus, El-Amin has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Finally, El-Amin argues that the court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable. After <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has since clarified that we review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 39-41, 45-47, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 594, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Upon revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release, the court may \u201cimpose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Under \u00a7 3583(e), the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the court must consider are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the Sentencing Guidelines range and pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), <em>cross referencing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7). In Chapter Seven of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission promulgated non-binding policy statements governing supervised release. <em>See United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that the policy statements in Chapter Seven are non-binding). We have held that because the Chapter Seven Guidelines are advisory, it is \u201cenough that there is some indication the district court was aware of and considered them.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">El-Amin has not met his burden on appeal to show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. First, he states that the district court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unfairly, but he does not explain how. Similarly, El-Amin also asserts that the district court did not take into account his individual history or the nature of the charge against him, but, again, he does not offer any explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In any event, the district court expressly stated that it considered \u201cnot only the underlying violations, but what\u2019s happened during the period of his supervision,\u201d which, notably, consisted of six separate supervised release violations in a period of less than eight months. In this respect, the court specifically discussed the aggravated-assault incident, emphasizing that there were a number of ways to discipline an 18 year child other than threatening him with a knife. Moreover, the court expressly stated that it had considered the statutory factors, the advisory guidelines, and the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. Accordingly, El-Amin has not met his burden, and we therefore affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\">1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(b)(1) (\u201cWhere the statutorily authorized maximum term of imprisonment that is imposable upon revocation is less than the minimum of the applicable range, the statutorily authorized maximum term shall be substituted for the applicable range.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\">.
