Lee subsequently received two reductions in his sentence pursuant to Fed. R.CRIm.P. 35 that reduced his sentence to 132 months. Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, Lee moved for a further reduction in his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied the motion, noting that Lee already had received two reductions in his sentence pursuant to Rule 35 and that his sentence of 132 months was below the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-23\">Lee now appeals. He primarily argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the district court erroneously had believed that it did not have authority to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range. Lee, however, misreads the district court\u2019s denial. Nothing on the face of the district court\u2019s order denying Lee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>motion suggests that the court concluded that it was without authority to impose a sentence below the amended range. Moreover, both Lee and the United States informed the district court that it had discretion to reduce Lee\u2019s sentence; there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Lee also contends that \u2014 because the district court stated in its order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that it had considered <em>his </em>submissions concerning his post-sentencing conduct but did not state in its order that it had considered the <em>Government\u2019s </em>submissions concerning his post-sentencing conduct \u2014 the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the Government\u2019s post-sentencing submissions. This argument has no merit. Indeed, the district court stated in its order that it had considered the Government\u2019s response to Lee\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and that response included a section detailing Lee\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. Therefore, the district court did in fact consider the Government\u2019s submissions concerning Lee\u2019s post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Lee has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
