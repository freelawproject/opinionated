After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-23\">Milton pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than fifty kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>grams of crack. Milton faced a mandatory minimum of life imprisonment for this offense. After the government filed a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, which permitted the court to sentence Milton below the mandatory minimum provided by statute, the court sentenced Milton to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Milton has now filed a motion for a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), asserting that he was entitled to a reduction based on Amendment 706 and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. The district court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a guideline range that has been lowered subsequently by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Where the original sentencing range was based on factors other than \u00a7 2D1.1, such as the application of a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, the court is not permitted to reduce the sentence under Amendment 706 because the amendment would not lower the applicable guidelines range. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-42. Further, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s downward departure to a sentence ... [does] not make Amendment 706 applicable\u201d where the defendant was sentenced based upon a statutorily required minimum sentence, but received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. <em>Id. </em>at 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Because Milton\u2019s sentence was based upon the applicable statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment, he was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based upon Amendment 706. The fact that he received a downward departure based on \u00a7 5K1.1 does not alter this conclusion. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Milton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
