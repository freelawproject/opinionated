McDonald asserts he should not have received a two-level vulnerable-victim enhancement because the SSA was the sole victim of his crimes, and the district court erred in determining that his elderly mother was also a victim of his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-23\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3Al.l(b) in determining whether a \u2018vulnerable victim\u2019 enhancement is warranted is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Frank, </em>247 F.3d 1257, 1259 (11th Cir.2001). The vulnerable-victim enhancement applies if a defendant \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). A \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is any person \u201cwho is a victim of the offense of conviction and any conduct for which the defendant is accountable under 1.3 (Relevant Conduct); and ... who is unusually vulnerable due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, comment. (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The district court did not err in applying the vulnerable-victim enhancement. Undisputed facts from the PSI show McDonald received $37,502 of his mother\u2019s SSA benefits, which he improperly used for his own benefit rather than to pay her nursing home bills. His failure to pay those bills with the SSA benefit money caused her nursing home account to become delinquent in an amount of $219,142.67 because the nursing home was unable to bill Medicaid without first receiving the SSA benefit payments. Thus, the record demonstrates McDonald\u2019s mother was a victim of his offense because she suffered monetary loss, and there is no dispute that, as an elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease living in a nursing home, she was vulnerable for the purposes of \u00a7 3Al.l(b). <em>See United States v. Yount, </em>960 F.2d 955, 957 (11th Cir.1992) (holding trust account holders who were \u201cvery old, infirm, and no longer capable of managing their own financial affairs\u201d were vulnerable victims); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Accordingly, McDonald\u2019s assertion the SSA was the sole victim of the offense is belied by the record. Even though the SSA was a victim of the offense, the district court was also permitted to find his mother was a second victim. <em>See Yount, </em>960 F.2d at 957-58; (holding the -victims included elderly account holders even though \u201cultimately the bank was the victim\u201d). Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the vulnerable-victim enhancement, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
