The district court thereafter sentenced Darden to imprisonment for the following terms: concurrent terms of two years on Counts 1 and 3, a consecutive term of seven years on Count 2, and a consecutive term of 25 years on Count 4, for a total of 34 years. Darden now appeals his convictions on Counts 1, 2, and 4, and the sentences he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">Counts 1 and 2 relate to the armed robbery of Kris and Pamela\u2019s market on June 4, 2007. Darden took $300 from a store clerk at gunpoint. Counts 3 and 4 relate to the armed robbery of Kwik Stop Food Mart on July 3, 2007. Darden and another man entered the store; Darden approached the cashier with a revolver, forced the cashier to open the cash register, and stole cash, cigarettes, and lottery tickets valued at $1,200. Darden challenges his convictions on Counts 1 and 2 on the ground that the Government failed to prove that Kris and Pamela\u2019s Market engaged in interstate commerce during the time of the robbery. He challenges his convictions on Counts 2 and 4 on the ground that the court refused to have the jury, rather than the court, decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the crimes charged in Counts 1 and 3 were crimes of violence. Darden challenges his sentences on Counts 2 and 4 on the ground that the court erred in making the sentences consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We review the sufficiency of evidence to prove interstate commerce <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir.2000). A district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal is due to be affirmed if a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Section 1951 of Title 18 of the United States Code, the Hobbs Act, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acr\">Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). The Hobbs Act\u2019s jurisdictional language \u201cspeaks in broad language, manifesting a purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence.\u201d <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 272, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960). As such, the government need only establish a minimal effect on interstate commerce to support a violation. <em>Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d at 1244. In determining a minimal effect on commerce, we decide each case on its own facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The prosecution sought to prove the interstate commerce element by introducing evidence of a contract Kris and Pamela\u2019s Market made with J. J. Taylor for the purchase of out-of-state goods. The contract covered the entire month of June 2007, and, in our view, sufficed to establish that Kris and Pamela\u2019s Market engaged in interstate commerce prior and during the June 4th robbery. We therefore reject Darden\u2019s challenge to the Counts 1 and 2 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">We review the legal correctness of a jury instruction <em>de novo. United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir. 2000). A conviction will not be reversed on the basis of a jury charge unless the issues of law were presented inaccurately, or the charge improperly guided the jury in a substantial way as to violate due process. <em>Id. A </em>\u201ccrime of violence\u201d determination is a question of law for the court. <em>See United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1340 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a court decides, as a matter of law, whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions constitute crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1). The court therefore did not err in deciding that a Hobbs Act robbery constituted a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">We review the interpretation of a criminal statute <em>de novo. United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 2004). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime of violence or drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>trafficking crime during which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asf\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(D)(ii). In <em>United States v. Wright, </em>33 F.3d 1349 (11th Cir. 1994), we held that the plain language of the statute expressly states that a term of imprisonment imposed under \u00a7 924(c) cannot \u201crun concurrently with any <em>other term </em>of imprisonment, period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350. Multiple offenses under \u00a7 924(c) results in multiple sentences with multiple terms\u2014 one term for each offense. <em>Id. </em>In short, the court did not err in sentencing Darden to consecutive terms of imprisonment on Counts 2 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
