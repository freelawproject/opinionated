Handy. This holding should lay to rest that misbegotten ghost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    The Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On this appeal, the appellant raised two contentions. He claims\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. that the State's evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the convictions, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. that Judge Handy erroneously imposed separate sentences for second-degree burglary and for the malicious destruction of property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    An Unadorned Motion For Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The only significant one of those contentions is that the State's evidence was not legally sufficient to support the convictions. We hold, on the contrary, that it was abundantly sufficient. At the end of the State's case (which was also the end of the\n   entire case), the appellant's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal was unenlightening. The argument was baldly conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Your Honor, at this time I'll make a motion for judgment of acquittal. I'll submit on argument,\n   <em>\n    it's really based on credibility on Mr. Dowling\n   </em>\n   the way I see it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It's a circumstantial case but\n   <em>\n    it's still\n   </em>\n   , you know,\n   <em>\n    based on his credibility\n   </em>\n   . So I'll submit on argument other than that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. I'll deny your motion then.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Overwhelmingly Sufficient Evidence Of Guilt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Not a word was said to substantiate that challenge to the witness's credibility. The trial itself had been equally uneventful. The burglary and theft victim, Michael Shawn Dowling, lived at 2132 Maisel Street in Baltimore City. He rented a garage at the rear of that property from his neighbor, Joel Navarro. He regularly kept the garage locked and he kept some valuable tools inside the garage, including 1) a large black toolbox with between $300 and $400 worth of tools in it; 2) a pressure washer; and 3) a generator. Mr. Dowling and the appellant were well acquainted with each other. The appellant lived in a \"pop-up camper,\" which Mr. Dowling permitted him to park in his driveway at 2132 Maisel Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The burglary occurred on March 8, 2018, in the mid-afternoon. At approximately 2:30 p.m., Mr. Dowling went to pick up his daughter from school. Along the way, he saw the appellant walking up Hollins Ferry Road. They chatted briefly. The appellant asked Mr. Dowling where he was going. Mr. Dowling explained that he was on his way to pick up his\n   daughter at school. When Mr. Dowling returned home with his daughter at approximately 3:30 p.m., he noticed that the door to his garage had been kicked in. The lock at the bottom was gone. All of Mr. Dowling's tools, moreover, were missing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That testimony would have placed the burglary within the hour of 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Actually, the time frame was tighter than that. Detective James Frauenhoffer of the Baltimore City Police Department was assigned to the Regional Auto Theft Task Force. He was aware of an outstanding arrest warrant for the appellant. On March 8, 2018, at about 3:00 p.m., he received a phone call from someone at the Real Scrap scrapyard, indicating that the appellant was then at that location. Detective Frauenhoffer immediately responded. Real Scrap was just about a block away from 2132 Maisel Street. Detective Frauenhoffer explained the nature of the scrapyard business:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE WITNESS: Scrap yards take metal and they purchase it from people when they deliver to the location, again, it could be any type of metal, roofing material, tools, cars, half cars, anything, but they take it there to drop off so they can receive money for the weight of metal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When the appellant saw Detective Frauenhoffer approaching, he turned and ran. A foot chase by several Baltimore City and Baltimore County officers through some nearby heavily wooded areas followed, ultimately ending after the appellant and one of the pursuing officers fell together into a stream. The appellant had brought to Real Scrap and Detective Frauenhoffer recovered all of the property that had shortly before been taken from Mr. Dowling's garage. The property was subsequently identified by Mr. Dowling. At Mr. Dowling's, Detective Frauenhoffer also noted where the garage door had been kicked in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kucharczyk\n    </em>\n    's Attack On Legal Sufficiency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The appellant did not take the stand, nor did he offer any witnesses or other evidence. He never so much as offered an explanation to the police as to what he was doing at Real Scrap with Mr. Dowling's property. It is difficult to imagine a\n   burglary and theft case more open and shut than this. It was at this point in the analysis that the ghost of\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2297943\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/235/334/\">\n    235 Md. 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20A.2d%20683\">\n    201 A.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964), was invoked in the appellant's brief. The challenge was to the legal sufficiency of the evidence, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    The evidence is insufficient to sustain the convictions.\n   </em>\n   The State's circumstantial case relied entirely on Mr. [D]owling's claim that the garage had been broken into and that appellant did not have his permission to enter the garage and take the items. However,\n   <em>\n    Mr. [D]owling's testimony was inherently incredible, and was therefore insufficient.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk v.

State\n   </em>\n   , with its microscopically narrow holding that has never been repeated, and the so-called\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, a bloated attack on the legal sufficiency of evidence generally and based ostensibly on the\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   case. In the actual case, the State's entire case of guilt had consisted of the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness whose testimony was rent by unresolved contradictions about the very happening of the crime itself. The issue was not credibility\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . It was rather the utter absence of any plausible assertion that the crime had even taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the years since 1964, however, the defense bar has created a wildly exaggerated\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine that has taken on a mythic life of its own. The doctrinal mantra is that any significant attack on the credibility of a State's witness will serve to exclude that witness's testimony from evidence and thereby erode the legal sufficiency of the State's case by diminishing it to nothing. In his brief, albeit not before Judge Handy, the appellant argued that Mr. Dowling's testimony was subject to such exclusion by virtue of various \"inconsistencies, weaknesses, and deficiencies,\" and, therefore, could not be relied upon to prove the appellant's guilt. The appellant argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   After purportedly finding the garage door kicked in, Mr. Dowling did not call the police on March 8. He testified, however, that within an hour, that same day, the police went to his home. Detective Frauenhoffer, on the other hand, testified that he had tried, \"with negative results,\" to contact Mr. Dowling on March 8, and was only able to speak with Mr. Dowling the next day, March 9. Additionally, Mr. Dowling testified that he never gave appellant permission to enter the garage. But he also told police that the camper in which appellant was staying obtained electricity from an electrical outlet in the garage.\n   <em>\n    In the face of all these inconsistencies, weaknesses, and deficiencies, Mr. Dowling's testimony cannot be relied on\n   </em>\n   to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant broke into the garage and took the tools without Mr. Dowling's own involvement and permission.\n   <em>\n    As such, reversal is required.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk v. State\n   </em>\n   , however, never held any such thing and the so-called\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, of course, has no provenance beyond\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk v. State\n   </em>\n   itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The heart of the problem has become one not of dealing with the\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   case itself but with its post-\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   mantra. The so-called\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine has never actually prevailed, but its propaganda impact has remained a force to be reckoned with. In the caselaw, it has become an unusual phenomenon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bailey\n    </em>\n    's Counterattack On\n    <em>\n     Kucharczyk\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This larger\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   phenomenon was before this Court in 1972, with its exaggerated notion that witness credibility was not an issue of fact for the jury or even the trial judge but could easily be transformed into a foreclosing issue of law for the reviewing appellate court.

Although the victim ultimately testified that the crime had occurred, he had testified on no fewer than three other occasions that it had never occurred. The Court of Appeals characterized those sworn denials of the very occurrence of the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   of the crime by the only witness to the very occurrence of the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    On direct examination the boy twice testified that nothing happened\n   </em>\n   in the public lavatory after the appellant gave him two drinks.\n   <em>\n    On cross examination, he testified that nothing happened\n   </em>\n   in the garage.

These inexplicably persistent reappearances could readily provide a theme for Bram Stoker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    The Source Of The Problem\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The protracted life of the\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine may, however, have served a useful purpose. In law it can sometimes be helpful if a perplexing problem is allowed to marinate. Only then, sometimes, does its essential nature become clear. Look past the details. They can be distracting. In most basic terms, what are the fundamental principles in play? From time immemorial, the assessment of testimonial credibility has always been the fundamental responsibility of the factfinder, jury or trial judge, as a matter of fact. It is not and never was the function of appellate review, as a matter of law. We begin with that as an axiomatic truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In 1964, the extreme factual circumstances in a rare case that has not been replicated in 55 years was the occasion for what seemed to be a limited and narrow departure from that basic allocation of responsibility. In\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   , moreover, the Court of Appeals was not really assessing credibility as such. It was analyzing, rather, whether a single shred of contradictory testimony could qualify as a piece of probative evidence. That, of course, is a proper appellate function, as a matter of\n   law. The problem was that the analysis was operating right at the borderline between an issue of fact and an issue of law. A blurred boundary is by its very nature ambiguous and one should be very cautious about making unambiguous pronouncements from such an unsure launching pad. The very discussion of the proper legal issue inevitably and necessarily included some mention of credibility, ordinarily a factual issue. From such a line-straddling context, it is inevitable that resourceful attorneys will cherry-pick a word here or a phrase there and then reinsert those words and phrases into far different and opportunistic contexts. It is a rhetorical stratagem that comes with the territory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In an extreme situation such as\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   , something that was accepted as inherently or intrinsically incredible did not even call for an assessment of credibility by a factfinder. The Court was measuring legal sufficiency, as a matter of law. It\n   was not deciding credibility, as a matter of fact. The clever rhetoricians who have since promulgated the so-called\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, however, were able to take any passing allusion to or mention of credibility out of a context, where credibility was not the issue, and to create out of those very words a so-called doctrine dealing basically with credibility. In the course of taking any reference to inherent credibility out of context, they sought to transform any significant attack on credibility into a question of law for the appellate court rather than leave it as a question of fact for the factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It has been a fallacious effort, but a clever one. What was posited as a proper legal question of what to do with inherent incredibility was misused to embrace a wide variety of unspoken factual questions determining what actually is inherent incredibility. That is the essential disconnect between\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk v. State\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine. The disconnect can easily be missed, however, because it is subtle. The\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine blithely assumes that damaged credibility is inherent incredibility and proceeds automatically to the exclusionary sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The insidious impact of the\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine has been in its attempt to take any significant impeachment of testimonial credibility, of a dozen possible variations, and then to take the assessment of that challenged credibility out of the hands of the factfinder, who ordinarily assesses it as a matter of fact, and to transfer it to the appellate courts, as they measure the legal sufficiency of the evidence, as a matter of law. That is a tectonic shift in the allocation of adjudicative responsibility. The determination of what is inherently incredible should remain with those whose primary job it is to assess testimonial credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   More broadly, what are we saying? Unanchored words and phrases can make for a treacherously unstable launching pad. Even modest shifts on the lift-off platform can produce widely divergent trajectories. The \"inherent incredibility\" in\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk v. State\n   </em>\n   is not the \"inherent incredibility\" the appellant urges upon us in the present case and they do not, therefore, propel us to the same destination. They might each be labeled \"inherent incredibility\" but they are not the same \"inherent incredibility,\" and that is the critical flaw in the appellant's argument. It is, moreover, the essential flaw in most evocations of the so-called\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine. The implicit major premise of that doctrine is not a constant. The launching pad is, in a word, unstable.\n   <em>\n    Stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , like the Aristotelian syllogism, requires exactitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Requiescat In Pace\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The simple message of this opinion is that the so-called\n   <em>\n    Kucharczyk\n   </em>\n   Doctrine, if it ever lived, is dead. It has been dead for a long time. Forget it. Damaged credibility is not necessarily inherent incredibility. That is all that needs to be said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    An Unpreserved Contention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Immediately after the jury announced its verdicts, Judge Handy proceeded to sentencing. For his crime of second-degree burglary, the appellant received a sentence of twelve years. The appellant was also sentenced to a term of 60 days for the malicious destruction of property. That sentence\n   was to run concurrently with the twelve-year sentence for burglary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The appellant now contends that the conviction and the sentence for the malicious destruction of property\n   should have merged into the conviction for second-degree burglary. He predicates his brief argument in support of that contention not on the theory that the two offenses are the \"same offense\" pursuant to the required elements test and not upon the \"rule of lenity.\" His predicate is based exclusively on the highly questionable and essentially ambiguous notion of \"fundamental fairness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At sentencing, the appellant raised no question with respect to merger or non-merger. Ordinarily, the lack of any objection would mean that nothing has been preserved for appellate review and that would end our consideration of this contention. Appellant's counsel, moreover, affirmatively agreed that merger was not called for. In speaking first with the prosecutor, Judge Handy noted, \"Malicious destruction, that wouldn't merge.\" The judge then addressed defense counsel, who agreed that the burglary and malicious destruction of property counts did not merge.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [Defense counsel],\n   <em>\n    do you agree count that the only count that merges is Count 2 [fourth-degree burglary]\n   </em>\n   merges into Count 1 [second-degree burglary]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\n   <em>\n    Yes\n   </em>\n   , I believe that's --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: -- I believe that's true, Your Honor, because\n   <em>\n    there would be elements in malicious destruction and theft that aren't\n   </em>\n   --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: --\n   <em>\n    necessary for the burglary.
