Brouillette, Representative James Christiana,\n   and Benjamin Lewis (collectively, Petitioners) challenging the constitutionality of some of the actions taken by Respondents with regard to the state budget for fiscal years (FY) 2016-17 and FY2017-18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Senate Respondents have also filed an Application to Dismiss for Mootness (Application). We overrule the POs in part, sustain the POs in part, grant the Application, and dismiss the Amended Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioners filed the three-count Amended Petition alleging that Respondents have violated various constitutional provisions by establishing unbalanced budgets and authorizing loans to cover deficits that extended beyond the relevant fiscal years. With regard to FY2016-17, Petitioners allege that the General Operating Fund Budget closed with a $1.55 billion deficit in violation of Article 8, Section 12(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Section 13(a) of the Pennsylvania Constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Section 618(a) of the Administrative Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   To fulfill the Commonwealth's debt obligations, Petitioners claim that the Governor, Treasurer, and Auditor General\n   approved a $750 million line of credit in August 2017, which was used, in part, to address the $1.55 billion deficit from the prior fiscal year. Because of this borrowing, Petitioners contend that Respondents violated Article 8, Section 7(a)(2)(ii) of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Petitioners claim that as revenues failed to materialize, the General Assembly and the Governor had a duty to cut spending to ensure a fully funded budget. This resulted in a deficit, which Petitioners refer to as an \"unfunded loan\" that \"illegally followed the Commonwealth\" into the current fiscal year. Amended Petition \u00b651.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally, Petitioners assert that this deficit was then compounded by the enactment of the budget for the FY2017-18 when the General Assembly passed a $31.38 billion General Appropriations Bill, which became law when the Governor failed to act on it. At the time of its passage, there was no revenue package in place to fund it. Petitioners maintain that the expenditures exceeded actual and estimated revenues in violation of the Constitution. Finally, Petitioners argue that the Governor had the authority and the duty under Article 4, Sections 15\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to veto the budget, in whole or in part, but failed to do either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Count I, Petitioners seek declaratory judgment against the Governor on the grounds that he violated Article 4, Sections 15 and 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and Section 618 of the Administrative Code, by not vetoing all or part of the $31.38 billion General Appropriations Bill for FY2017-18 that exceeded estimated revenue thereby \"authorizing the Commonwealth to appropriate and spend funds that exceeded actual and estimated revenues.\" Amended Petition at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Count II, Petitioners seek declaratory judgment against the Governor, Senate Respondents, House Respondents, and the Commonwealth generally on the grounds that they violated Article 8, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because \"the Commonwealth ended [FY2016-17] with a $1.55 billion deficit,\" and \"the General Appropriations Bill for [FY2017-18] violates [ Article 8, Section 13 ] because, at the time of enactment, appropriations contained therein 'exceed[ed] the actual and estimated revenues and surplus available in the same fiscal year[ ]' by $600 million.\" Amended Petition at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, in Count III, Petitioners seek declaratory relief against the Governor, the Treasurer, the Auditor General, and the Commonwealth generally for violating Article 8, Sections 7 and 12 of the Pennsylvania Constitution \"by authorizing lines of credit to fund a $1.55 billion deficit accrued in [FY2016-17] ... that spanned across multiple fiscal years,\" and \"[t]hat the General Appropriations Bill for [FY2016-17] violated the Pennsylvania Constitution by appropriating funds in excess of anticipated revenues, thereby saddling the Commonwealth with a debt of $1.55 billion without the explicit approval of the General Assembly.\" Amended Petition at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondents filed a joint motion to dismiss for mootness alleging that the subsequent passage of legislation eliminating any deficit from the past and current fiscal years' budget and appropriations bills rendered Petitioners' claims moot. This Court denied the joint motion on the basis that there are factual matters in dispute, such as whether the General Operating Fund Budget is currently balanced, and because Respondents did not explain how the subsequent legislation mooted the claim that they engaged in long-term borrowing in violation of Article 8, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Brouillette v. Wolf\n   </em>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 410 M.D. 2017, filed December 28, 2017), slip op. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Respondents also filed four sets of POs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondents variously object on the following bases: (1) Petitioners lack capacity to sue (standing); (2) the Amended Petition is insufficiently specific; and (3) the Amended Petition fails to conform to the law or rule of court. In addition, Respondents demur on the following grounds: that the Amended Petition (1) presents a non-justiciable political question; (2) fails to meet the standard for declaratory judgment; (3) fails to state a claim against the Commonwealth or the Treasurer; (4) is moot; and (5) is barred by the doctrine of laches. Respondents also assert that the Senate and House Respondents are protected by legislative immunity and/or sovereign immunity. Subsequently, on September 6, 2018, the Senate Respondents filed the instant Application to dismiss Count II of the Amended Petition for mootness because no practical relief may be granted for the legal claim presented therein based on a change in circumstance and the requested relief is not precluded\n   by our prior opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Respondents first claim that Petitioners Brouillette and Lewis do not possess standing to prosecute the instant matter. In general, the question of standing relates to whether a party is entitled to have the court decide the merits of a dispute or of particular issues.\n   <em>\n    Warth v.

There is no administrative agency which can provide relief and the legislators themselves are unlikely to provide a meaningful mechanism for redress. Lastly, there are not other persons better situated to assert the claim because all those who are\n   directly and immediately affected by the [Public Official] Compensation Law are beneficially affected and have not brought, and will not bring a cause of action.

The Amended Petition simply fails to allege or demonstrate that the Governor's proposed Executive Budget that was submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to the foregoing provisions for FY2016-17 and FY2017-18 was the same as the purportedly unbalanced General Appropriations Bills that were enacted by the General Assembly for those fiscal years, or that the Treasurer or Auditor General played any role in the actions enumerated in these provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, these Petitioners do not ask for any relief with respect to the Governor's, the Treasurer's, or the Auditor General's purported violation of these provisions.

Again, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has summarized the Governor's general veto power under Article 4, Section 15, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   By conferring upon the Governor the authority to nullify legislation that has passed both legislative houses, Section 15 entrusts him with the obligation both to examine the provisions of the legislation within the ten days allotted by Section 15 and to either approve it or return it, disapproved, for legislative reconsideration. Disapproval requires the Governor to furnish the legislature with his specific objections in order to enable the legislature to fulfill its reciprocal obligations to record the Governor's objections upon the legislative journal and reconsider the bill. This procedure is enshrined in our organic charter, and ensures that the legislature and the public receive notice of the Governor's veto and the resulting status of the legislation. The Governor is thereby an \"integral part of the lawmaking power of the state.\" No bill may become law without first being submitted to the Governor for approval or disapproval. Although legislative power is vested in the General Assembly pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, we have described the Governor's authority to veto a bill as a form of \"limited legislative power.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The Pennsylvania colony inherited the Governor's veto power from the King of England. Notably, the monarch's frequent use of this lawmaking authority, which was vested in him as a \"constituent if not a controlling third body of the parliament, in which he might and not infrequently did sit in person,\" was set forth as first among the grievances of the colonies in the Declaration of Independence. From the colonies, the veto power passed into nearly all of the American constitutions, state and federal. However, \"[u]nlike the royal prerogative,\" the executive veto is \"exercised by a democratically elected leader pursuant to a clearly defined constitutional procedure.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Moreover, in Pennsylvania, the Governor's veto power is more constrained than that enjoyed by a number of his peers or by the President of the United States, in that the Governor does not have the luxury of inaction.

To this end, the HFAL created the Housing Finance Agency (Agency) to administer programs involving housing purchases and rentals under which the Agency was empowered to lend funds to a mortgagor to construct or rehabilitate housing units for sale to qualifying individuals or families. After the unit was sold, the original mortgagor's obligation to the Agency was released, and the purchaser assumed the mortgage obligation to the Agency. Accordingly, the HFAL authorized the Agency to issue loans directly to qualifying individuals. Additionally, under the rental program, the HFAL authorized the Agency to provide mortgages for projects supplying housing units to qualifying individuals, which subject the mortgagors to regulation and limitation in the rents charged and the permissible profits earned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   To finance the foregoing programs, the HFAL empowered the Agency to issue bonds and notes to be payable out of the Agency's revenue, including the proceeds of the mortgages. However, the HFAL specifically provided the Agency's notes and bonds did not constitute a debt of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision and that it was not a pledge of its credit or taxing power. Moreover, the Agency was required to establish a fund equal to all the principal and interest due on its outstanding bonds and notes from the succeeding calendar year. In the event of a deficiency in the fund, or a default in the payment of principal or interest, the Agency was required to submit a request to the Governor who was then required to request the General Assembly for funds in the executive budget to cover the shortfall; however, the General Assembly was not required to approve such an appropriation. The HFAL also provided that the Commonwealth would not impair the rights and remedies of the holders of Agency obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The taxpayer alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the HFAL was \"unconstitutional in that it authorizes a debt to be incurred by or on behalf of the Commonwealth in violation of Article [8], Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and permits an improper loan or pledge of the Commonwealth's credit in contravention of Article [8], Section 8.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20528\">\n    309 A.2d at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After each House of Congress approves a bill, it must be presented to the President. If the President signs the bill, it is law. A bill may become law without the President's approval, but only under two circumstances. If the President vetoes the bill, two-thirds of each house may override his objection and make the bill law. Alternatively, if the President simply does not act on the measure within ten days after presentment, excluding Sundays, and Congress does not adjourn before the ten-day period ends, the bill becomes law without the President's approval.

Moreover, Congress does not reconsider a pocket vetoed bill in the same manner as it would a return vetoed bill.

Section 6 (municipal indebtedness) contains no definition of the term \"indebted.\" But the definition of \"debt\" contained in section 1 should be equally applied to the term \"indebtedness\" as used in section 6.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n    The history of article VIII reveals that \"debt\" and \"indebtedness\" were intended to mean the same thing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Theodore L.

Q. 281, 284 (1913) (by adopting article VIII, the framers were concerned about the misuse of \"borrowed money\" by state and local governments). Indeed, the title of article VIII-\"State, County, and Municipal Indebtedness\"-reveals that the drafters used debt and indebtedness interchangeably. As does the section 6 definition itself. Wash. Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 1(d) (debt requires \"evidences of indebtedness\"). The terms are also used interchangeably in article VIII, section 3, which permits the state to incur \"[s]pecial\n    <em>\n     indebtedness\n    </em>\n    \" in certain circumstances, notwithstanding the limitation on \"debt\" set forth in article VIII, section 1. (Emphasis added.)
