DeWolfe, Public Defender, on the brief), Baltimore, MD, for Appellant.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-6\">\n  Argued by: Todd William Hesel (Brian E. Frosh, Atty. Gen., on the brief), Baltimore, MD, for Appellee.\n </attorneys>\n <judges id=\"p-7\">\n  Panel: Berger, Leahy, Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Berger, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Based on evidence recovered during a warrantless search at the scene of a traffic stop, the Circuit Court for Frederick County, in a bench trial, convicted Shawna Lynn Faith (\"Faith\"), appellant, of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute. Faith contends that the suppression court erred in\n   denying her request to exclude \"the evidence recovered from a warrantless strip search ... conducted on the side of Interstate 70 in the presence of two civilians and other police officers in which her underwear was pulled from her body and her vaginal area exposed[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This appeal requires us to decide whether such a visual body search, in which a female officer conducted a \"look-in\" at Faith's genital area, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, given the public manner and location in which that search occurred. Because the State failed to establish any exigent reason to perform this inspection on the shoulder of a highway in the presence of onlookers, instead of a more private setting that would lessen the intrusion into Faith's personal privacy, we shall reverse her conviction. In doing so, we revisit the constitutional limits on sexually invasive searches like the one at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before trial, Faith moved to suppress both the controlled dangerous substances (\"CDS\") recovered and the statements she made during and after the challenged search, on the grounds that (a) this was a \"visual body cavity\" search that is unreasonable under constitutional standards, and (b) her statements were obtained from a custodial interrogation that occurred before she received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisements. The suppression court denied the motion as to the drug evidence but granted it as to Faith's statements before she was Mirandized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because the sole issue in this appeal is whether the court erred in failing to suppress the drug evidence, our focus is on the suppression record summarized below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852994\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/349/#p358\">\n    398 Md. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852994\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/349/#p358\">\n    920 A.2d 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At 7:18 p.m. on April 21, 2017, Frederick County Sheriff's Deputy Douglas Storee\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"was doing traffic enforcement\" in a marked police vehicle \"on Interstate 70 at Route 144, the New\n   Market Inn,\" which is \"at Exit 55.\" Storee observed Faith's vehicle \"following too closely, within a car and a half length\" of another vehicle traveling westbound at the 70 mph speed limit in \"moderate to heavy traffic[.]\" When Storee initiated a traffic stop, Faith's vehicle pulled over on the right shoulder of the highway \"at South Street[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Faith was in the driver's seat, a female companion was in the passenger seat, and Faith's three-year-old son was in the back seat. Faith was wearing cut-off jean shorts and a top that did not cover her arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While informing Faith of why he made the stop, Deputy Storee noticed track marks on her arms, which \"is common for someone that's administering CDS intravenously.\" The deputy asked where Faith was coming from. She answered that they were returning home to Cumberland, after taking \"someone else's child down to Baltimore[.]\" Storee considered a five-hour round trip for that purpose to be \"odd.\" During the conversation, he observed that the two women \"seemed to be squinting, which appeared ... that maybe they were under the influence of drugs\" because \"[s]ometimes eyes can be sensitive to light.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Storee returned to his vehicle and requested a K-9 unit at the scene. A marked cruiser occupied by Deputy Miller Yackovich and K-9 Officer Ike arrived two minutes later, at 7:22 p.m., while Storee was still completing paperwork regarding the stop. In accordance with standard procedures, the occupants were asked to vacate the vehicle before the canine scan began. After pat-down searches yielded no suspected weapons, all three individuals were \"walked back\" from Faith's car to Storee's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The dog alerted at the doors of Faith's car. Deputy Storee, having called for an officer to \"conduct a female search[,]\" proceeded to search the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Storee's search yielded drug paraphernalia and crack cocaine. A \"glass pipe\" with burnt residue that Storee believed to be crack cocaine was found under the driver's seat. A \"metal spoon\" commonly used to mix and inject heroin was \"in\n   the driver's compartment door\" with \"a whitish-tannish residue\" that Storee, \"based on [his] training and experience,\" believed to be heroin. In a purse \"on the floorboard\" by the front passenger seat was \"a bag of crack cocaine[,]\" divided into Ziploc packets. That purse contained identification belonging to Faith's passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While Storee was searching the vehicle, Faith, her companion, and her child stood with Deputy Yackovich \"on the bumper along the passenger side of\" Storee's vehicle, which was \"lined up behind the suspect vehicle.\" Yackovich's cruiser was next in line behind Storee's vehicle. Both police cars had their lights flashing throughout the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While that vehicle search was underway, Sergeant Amanda Ensor arrived, parking her marked vehicle, also with lights flashing, as the fourth car lined up along the\n   shoulder of Interstate 70. Deputy Storee had done \"multiple\" \"female searches\" with Sergeant Ensor \"[i]n the field[.]\" The sergeant also had \"done female searches on [Deputy Yackovich's] traffic stops[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Yackovich, he did not know whether Sergeant Ensor routinely \"looks underneath females' clothes\" because \"[t]he way she searches is up to her.\" According to Storee, \"typically we - especially if it's a female, they'll take them to the rear of the vehicle, away from everybody else.\" Storee explained that during Sergeant Ensor's searches, he does not \"look because things happen .... from people doing things on their own, not necessarily just because of a search.\" Although he claimed that he \"never expect[s] someone's vagina is going to be exposed on the side of the road[,]\" he acknowledged that in the past, \"things happened where people have pulled their clothes off in their own excitement[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While it was still daylight outside, Sergeant Ensor searched Ms. Faith. As moderate to heavy traffic passed on the highway, and Faith's companion and son stood with Deputy Yackovich at the front of Deputy Storee's vehicle, Sergeant Ensor \"took Ms. Faith back to the rear of\" that vehicle, a car-length away. According to Deputy Storee and Deputy Yackovich,\n   Faith was searched while standing \"between [Storee's] vehicle and Deputy Yackovich's vehicle[,]\" while \"facing into oncoming traffic,\" with her back to the male officers and vehicle passengers. During the search, both deputies testified, they were \"facing away\" from Faith because \"obviously there's a privacy issue.\" Yet Storee did \"try to keep an eye as best [he could] on Sergeant Ensor[.]\" And Faith's companion, who was holding her son, was next to Deputy Storee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sergeant Ensor testified that her search of Ms. Faith was consistent with her routine practice for roadside searches involving suspected CDS. On direct, she recounted that during her fifteen years as a police officer, she had been \"frequently called to conduct female searches.\" She had \"[s]everal hours at the academy in the detection of deception and behavior\" and \"too many\" trainings \"to name[,]\" \"in addition to conducting numerous arrests [herself] and assisting and aiding with other arrests for deputies.\" She estimated that she had conducted \"[t]housands\" of \"female searches[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When asked about her typical approach to such a search, she detailed her standard operating procedure, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And what's your procedure when you arrive on the scene to conduct a female search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Systematically for an incident like this where we're on a heroin interdiction operation and we are specifically looking for criminal behavior. I have a systematic approach to my searches. Basically, I do take the person's - their feelings, everything into account. Their reaction to me, their behaviors, their statements, their inconsistencies in stories; and my searches stem from there, but they're always systematic.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I initially ask them if they have anything on them. I let them know specifically if they do and I'm typically very confident that they do have something on them that I will find it. I ask if they have anything that's going to poke me, stick me, anything like that. Sometimes they will be honest and say yes. Others, they won't tell you. And in this specific\n   case, the defendant had obvious track marks on her arms, which are consistent with intravenous needle drug use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   So my initial search, I start with the upper body and - let me back up. I'll take - if it's a female, I take them away\n   from the male deputies and anyone else that's in the vehicle, and I either position them behind the first police vehicle w[h]ere the public can't see them or what I'm doing in my search. And the other deputies can't see them, because obviously I'm the only female on the scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    They call me there for a reason. I'll search their waistband. I'll ask them to unbutton their pants and pull their pants away from them. At no point in time do I touch them or their private areas. I ask them to pull their pants away from them.\n   </strong>\n   If I don't see anything obvious, that would be secreted or, you know, in their underwear, I'll move up and I'll say I want you to leave your shirt down so no one else can see you, but if you're wearing a bra, pull it away from you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   And I will bend down and look up underneath their shirt. So I'm not touching them. Again, I'm not touching them. I've hand [sic] instances where women will hold one side of their bra in and pull the other out, which would tell me that they're hiding contraband in that area. And again, that's where I find it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    In this specific situation, I pull her underwear, her shorts out away from her.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, we'll get to that. But first of all, so now when you ask them to do this, are you in any way exposing their intimate parts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: No, absolutely not.\n   <strong>\n    I say pull them away from you and I specifically say do not pull them down, just pull them away from you, because I will be honest. I have people on the side of the road that have been arrested and they know the process of strip searches and being in detention, and they have absolutely no problem flashing the entire highway.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    And I specifically say, don't pull your shirt up. Leave it down. Just hold it away from you. And I'm going to look up underneath your shirt to make sure you don't have anything. And some will just expose everything and not - you know, and it's no big deal to them. And others, it's just like I said - I use a systematic approach for the searches.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and do you at any point during this, touch the female at all? When you're looking either - like when you ask them to pull their waistband away or when you're looking up underneath their bra?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: No, in those two instances, absolutely not.\n   <strong>\n    I don't touch them. In some instances, depending on what they're wearing, if I feel like they haven't - you know, they haven't pulled them out away from them enough or that I couldn't really see if they have large breasts, I will use the back of my hand to search the outside of their breasts in the interior.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Do you - when you ask someone to pull their pants out, do you see - you said nothing is exposed to anybody else, but you can actually see?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    I can see. And typically, the portion that I can see is whether or not - I mean, I can see if they have a pad on. I can see basically the front portion. If they're pulling their underwear away from the, I can see like the front of their vagina.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: And obviously if something is exposed, I mean, the strangest things. Like people say, I'm on my period. Or you know, I don't have anything and this instance you pull them away from you, don't pull them down.\n   <strong>\n    I specifically say that - just pull them out\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    away from your body. And in this specific instance, there happened to be a condom hanging out.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, so basically when you said no one could see, nobody else could, but you could, but that's the\n   purpose, you have to see because you're conducting the search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <strong>\n    You ask them specifically to pull their pants away from their body?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    I do.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: You look in there. You've taken them away from the male deputies, the public and any other people that might be - that privacy might be invaded -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: Absolutely.\n   <strong>\n    I'm very respectful. I'm a female. I know what it's like. It is, it's an intrusion of their privacy. And if I wasn't 99 percent sure and confident by their reactions and their behavior to my questions and me interacting with them, that they were concealing something on their person, then I would handle it differently.\n   </strong>\n   But 99.9 percent of the times with these searches, especially with the influx in heroin and fentanyl coming through, I have found contraband on them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    And that's not looking in their private area. That's something that's clearly exposed when they hold their pants away from their body and not pull them down. I move them - for their safety and well-being and their privacy, I move them away for my officer safety and take myself to another situation where I'm moving them behind the vehicle and I'm by myself and leaving the other male deputies up at the vehicle so that they can't see anything.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, so this is not a strip search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: No, absolutely no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]:\n   <strong>\n    And when you look down, when they pull their pants away, can you see their vaginal cavity?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Not the cavity, no.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And so now have you testified - have you been qualified as an expert in female searches?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: In Frederick County?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Turning to the specifics surrounding the search of Ms. Faith, the prosecutor elicited from Sergeant Ensor that she had observed the traffic violation while she and Deputy Storee were both positioned \"in the crossover\" on \"I-70 facing westbound traffic[.]\" After receiving a call from Deputy Storee to come perform \"a female search,\" Sergeant Ensor followed her routine practice by positioning Faith between two police vehicles for the search, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And what did you do when you did that search?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Again, my systematic search. I asked her to come back behind Deputy Storee's car.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And so when you asked her to come back behind Deputy Storee's car, where was the passenger and the child?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    They were still up at the vehicle, because the child needed to be held by her friend. So they were still up at her vehicle in that vicinity on the grass area of the shoulder with Deputy Storee and Deputy Yackovich.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And where did you take Ms. Faith?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: Behind Deputy Yackovich's canine car.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: And my car was behind his.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And approximately how much space was between the two vehicles, Deputy Storee's and Deputy Yackovich?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: I would say maybe three feet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And did you take her - where did you take her between the two vehicles?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Basically, right at the trunk. And I had them - I will put my back to the other units and what I'll do is I'll have them position themselves so that their back is to traffic but they're also hidden by the vehicle, so none of the other deputies or occupants in the vehicle can see me do my search.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Did you do that with Ms. Faith?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]: Yes.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The prosecutor then inquired about Sergeant Ensor's statements to Ms. Faith before the search began, eliciting the following description of her tactical approach to that conversation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]:\n   <strong>\n    And did you have a conversation with her?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Absolutely. I do with everyone.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]:\n   <strong>\n    And what was the nature of the conversation?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Well, obviously, the track marks that were present on her arms,\n   </strong>\n   she had a child in the vehicle. I'm a mom myself, and one of my conversations was about her taking her child down the road to Baltimore and she explained that she knew she needed to get clean.\n   <strong>\n    She had obvious track marks on her arms. I asked her how long she's been using, because I genuinely care about them and getting clean, we have a conversation about that initially. And that's also my way of detecting their behavior and whether or not they're nervous.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Inconsistencies in their stories with the passengers - because they'll say the last exit that they passed. She did\n   not in this case, but they'll use reference points. And the other passenger will have a completely different story.\n   <strong>\n    So I use that, you know, that talking point to build my suspicion, my reasonableness and talking to her about getting clean and her using needles and addicted to heroin.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   She was wearing extremely short shorts. And one of the things I look for is whether or not their body is shaking. Because typically when I'm asking personal questions about their drug use, you know, they lie constantly to their families. They lie to their friends about they're going. So when I ask questions about their drug use, they start to become increasingly nervous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   So you know, I was watching her legs and her demeanor. And when I started to ask the other questions about how long have you been using, who got you hooked on that? Like how long? And she said, I know, I need to quit. I and [sic] reached up and looked at her arm. You know, very softly, like turned her arm around to look at the track marks. And I noticed that her arm was shaking really bad. Fast.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   You know, but almost - you know, obviously not a cold shake, but she was shaking.\n   <strong>\n    So that's when I told her that I'm going to search you. I've been doing this for 15 years, and if you're hiding something on your person or in your vagina - I said that to her - or in your vagina, I will find it.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    And it's a tactic that I use to get them to talk to me about, you know, what's going on, what they might have on them. And she still - she still denied the fact that she had anything on her.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Next, the prosecutor focused on Sergeant Ensor's inspection of Ms. Faith's vaginal area, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And so what did you do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    That's where I start my systematic search. And I start with her shorts, not pants at the time - and I'll say unbutton your shorts. Don't pull them\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    down. I'm very specific. Unbutton your shorts, don't pull them down. I want you to pull them away from your body. And when she did that is when I saw the condom protruding.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And what did you do at that point? Did you touch her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    No. I looked at her and I said, come on. You know, like - I saw it, come on. And we actually had an intelligible conversation about the fact that, you know, she said it's not mine. I don't do coke. Dealer is in Cumberland. I carry it back for them. They give me heroin.\n   </strong>\n   It was an honest conversation that we had about what she was holding. I didn't touch her. I asked her to walk back up to the car and I asked Deputy Yackovich to grab me a bag.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and when she told you about the - going up to Cumberland and all that, was that in response to a question you asked?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    No. It was conversation because she knew that I saw it.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: So you looked at her and said come on, and she said what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [SGT. ENSOR]:\n   <strong>\n    Right, because I said, tell me if you have anything on you. I'm going to find it. And as soon as she pulled her pants away from her body and her underwear, there was a clear condom that would be the shaft portion of the condom hanging out like down in her underwear. It was very obvious. So of course I looked at her, and I said, come on. Like - you just lied to me. I see it. And then it was a conversation.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   It wasn't me questioning her - whose is it? Where did you get it? You know, I didn't ask her any questions because I knew it was there. I saw it. So I asked Deputy Yackovich for a bag and\n   <strong>\n    she elected not to go back to be stripped searched and said no, I can just get it myself.\n   </strong>\n   Fully clothes [sic]. Shorts up, underwear up. She said she could\n   retrieve it herself and did so, with only me watching her after Deputy Yackovich handed me the bag.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]:\n   <strong>\n    And did you offer her to go back to the Law Enforcement Center to retrieve it?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [SGT.

At that point, Faith \"was placed under arrest]\" handcuffed, and \"read ... her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\" Her companion was also arrested and handcuffed \"after the female search.\" Thereafter, Faith\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   admitted that she went up to Baltimore to get drugs from a supplier for a drug dealer back in Cumberland. That drug dealer gets fronted drugs from a supplier in Baltimore and she takes them back and gives them to that drug dealer in exchange for her own personal getting drugs back from that dealer in Cumberland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The State argued that the search did not violate Fourth Amendment protections because \"[t]he amount of intrusion on the defendant was extremely minimal\" given that Ms. Faith \"was not exposed to anyone other than Sergeant Ensor[,]\" who \"took every step possible to try and ensure this defendant's privacy.\" Pointing to cases in which \"the intrusion was far greater[,]\" the prosecutor emphasized that there was no touching or \"manipulation\" of the body, no removal of clothing, and \"no testimony ... that the passenger or her child could see anything\" or \"that vehicles were stopping and looking.\" To the contrary, the prosecutor argued, this roadside search \"led to a benefit of the defendant, a lesser intrusion\" in that Faith did not have \"to go back to the Law Enforcement Center and have a full strip search.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Defense counsel challenged the constitutionality of both the roadside search and the custodial interrogation. Counsel argued that \"[w]e have a strip search\" under the Court of Appeals's definition, which expands that term beyond removal of clothing to include any \"rearrangement of some or all clothing to permit the visual inspection of the skin surfaces of the genital areas, breast, and/or buttocks.\" According to defense counsel, because Faith was required \"to unbutton her pants, to pull her pants out, to expose her vagina[,]\" allowing Sergeant Ensor \"to visually observe ... the genital vaginal cavity of Ms. Faith\" where she saw \"a condom coming out[,]\" the scope of the search was \"a visual body cavity search[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Disputing the justification for that type of search, defense counsel insisted that even though \"[t]he sergeant may think that she's concealing drugs, ... you can't strip search somebody on a hunch.\" In support, counsel argued that the search could not have been incident to arrest because \"there has been no testimony that\n   the dog hit or that they found evidence in the car prior to this strip search taking place.\" At best, he maintained, the \"dog hit\" gave police \"probable cause to search the car, not the former occupants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Moreover, defense counsel objected that Sergeant Ensor had no \"reason to conduct it now as opposed to in a different manner at the Law Enforcement Center or at the detention center[.]\" Regarding the manner and location of the search, counsel argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   It was on side of 70 in front of the former occupants of the vehicle, in front of the other deputies. And it's in a position where there's three marked patrol vehicles all with their lights flashing, moderate to heavy traffic. I think it's a fair inference that every single person that passes by is watching and looking at what's going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In these circumstances, counsel contended that the search was unconstitutional:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   So for all of these reasons, I think every one of these factors cuts in favor of suppression. I think that\n   <strong>\n    the entire public policy surrounding the exclusionary rule is to\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    deter this kind of behavior by the police. What you have is a police officer systematically conducting strip searches on the side of the road. And that's a bad place for us to be.\n   </strong>\n   And ... if you exclude the evidence, sure, in this particular case, a potential criminal may go free. But that's the price that we pay to make sure that this kind of behavior doesn't continue on and I believe that that's the place where we are here today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   With respect to Faith's incriminating statements, defense counsel argued that the unlawful search was compounded by unlawful custodial interrogation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   What we have is\n   <strong>\n    an interrogation during the strip search.\n   </strong>\n   She made incriminating statements. Then Ms. Faith was Mirandized and then she gave an incriminating statement. It's a classic two-step interrogation procedure that should be suppressed in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , in violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The suppression court denied Faith's motion to exclude the evidence recovered in the search but questioned the admissibility of her statements made without a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. In response, the State argued that after Faith was placed under arrest by Deputy Storee and Mirandized, \"it's a break\" with subsequent incriminating statements made to \"a separate officer.\" The court then took the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   issue under advisement and allowed counsel to submit authority on the issue. At a later hearing, the suppression court ruled that Faith's statements before she received\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   advisements were inadmissible but declined to exclude subsequent statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   After the drug evidence obtained from the roadside search and the admissible statements were presented via an agreed statement of facts, the trial court, sitting as fact-finder, convicted Faith of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute. Ms. Faith was sentenced to twenty years with all but eighteen months suspended, plus three years of probation. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Faith contends that \"the trial court erred in denying [her] motion to suppress the evidence recovered from [the] strip search conducted in the open on the side of Interstate 70 in the presence of two civilians and other officers in which her underwear was pulled from her body and her vaginal area was exposed.\" Applying lessons from\n   <em>\n    Paulino v.

The Suppression Court's Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Here, the suppression court concluded that the roadside search of Faith was reasonable, ruling as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   [T]he Court is here considering a fourth amendment argument from defense that narcotics that were found on the defendant's person were found in violation of the fourth amendment. The Court recognizes in this instance the narcotics were\n   found on the defendant's person, and\n   <strong>\n    the heavy scrutiny the Court puts on the search of somebody's person is certainly present in this case\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    because that's probably the area a person has the most expectation of privacy that the Court can possibly consider is their private parts of their body.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-261\">\n   In this instance,\n   <strong>\n    the defense argues that it was unreasonable for the search to take place that took place on the roadway.\n   </strong>\n   The testimony is that the deputy pulled the vehicle over for a proper reason. It was following too closely. He noticed track marks on the defendant's arm and some other indications in her eyes and demeanor, I guess, is the testimony, that there may be personal drug use. The track marks, he didn't say whether they appeared to be fresh or not, but he did notice them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   For those reasons, he called the canine officer to come in to search or at least sniff the outside of the vehicle which is proper. It was done within a reasonable period of time, which the law requires. He also called in a female sergeant who, according to the testimony, happened to be out on the road as well and was actually in the median when the vehicle passed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   The dog did hit on the car. The car was searched. Certain items of contraband were found in the car, including a spoon and some items of drugs were found in the car itself. At that point, the female officer sergeant begins to search the person of the defendant in this case.\n   <strong>\n    And the question the Court has to decide then is that search reasonable, because it did involve the search of her body parts, her personal body parts.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   So before the Court can decide whether a search is reasonable, it does have to factor the four factors that\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   requires under the Supreme Court case\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Wolfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/#p559\">\n    441 U.S. at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/#p559\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], which basically outlines the four\n   factors of whether the Court determines something is reasonable or not. The scope -- and the Court did consider all of those things. In this case,\n   <strong>\n    the scope of the search was considered.\n   </strong>\n   The two cases that I think are most likely to follow along in this case are\n   <em>\n    Paulino v. State\n   </em>\n   , which the defense submitted, which is a Court of Appeals case from 2006 [sic]. The Court also considered the State's case that they submitted, which is\n   <em>\n    Partlow v. State\n   </em>\n   , which is a Court of Special Appeals case from 2009 [sic]. The Court considered both of those cases as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-265\">\n   In this case,\n   <strong>\n    the female officer that was going to conduct the search was cognizant of the defendant's privacy in this case. She certainly took that into consideration according to her testimony and tried to limit this as unobtrusively towards her as she could.\n   </strong>\n   She brought her around at least one or two vehicles away from the other occupants of the vehicle. She had her face away from the highway. According to the uncontroverted testimony, at no time did she place her hands on the defendant other than to gently look at the track marks of her arm. But not in conducting the search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   She asked the defendant to pull her underwear and pants - after she unbuttoned them - away from her body, and at that time, she saw what she believed to be a condom protruding from the front of the defendant's vagina. So that was the scope, basically. She was not asked to remove any items of clothing.\n   <strong>\n    She was simply asked to pull her clothing away from her body, and it was done outside - even though it was done outside, it was done away from anybody else and turned away from the highway. So she was certainly taking\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    into consideration the defendant's privacy.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   <strong>\n    The justification for initiating the search\n   </strong>\n   the Court considered and the track marks on her arms - it's unclear when the items were found actually in the car, but there were narcotics found in the car, and the statements that the defendant made were all used as justification for initiating the search and the Court does find that to have been reasonable under the circumstances as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    The Court considered the place of the search. It was out on the highway, and certainly that takes more scrutiny from the Court, because it's not a private area. However, the Court is convinced from the testimony of the sergeant that she had done everything she could to make this as private as possible. There were no body parts exposed in any way other than the deputy herself could see. And it was again, just the top of the genital area.\n   </strong>\n   There was not what this Court would determine as the defense argues, to be a body cavity search, which would involve seeing the defendant's genitalia from a different angle - it could have been considered a body search. But the way this angle was considered from above, the Court does not consider that to be a body cavity search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   <strong>\n    The manner of the search again was done on the side of the highway, but it was done in such a manner to take into consideration the defendant's privacy as much as was possible under the circumstances of the case.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   So the Court does find the search in this case was reasonable under all of the circumstances, the totality of the circumstances, and considering the factors in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , and therefore the motion to suppress that evidence is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   As far as the statement goes, .... the defendant was in a custodial situation when the sergeant asked her certain questions ... in reference to what might be on her person at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-272\">\n   Those were done prior to the deputy making the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and since she was in custody, I would suppress those statements ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   Come on. Because you're basically saying, come on, admit this. So while that's not a posed question, the cases are pretty clear that any statement that could be foreseen to potentially elicit a statement is considered a question[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Bell\n    </em>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   A search that permits a police officer to view a suspect's private areas \"is not the type of search that automatically\n   is allowed as a search incident to arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.
