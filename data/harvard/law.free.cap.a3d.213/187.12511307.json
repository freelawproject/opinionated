Because the potential consequences of those proceedings are of significant magnitude, we agree that, in this setting, counsel should be made available for indigent parents and guardians both at the administrative level and in any appeal of right to this court. Because that opportunity was denied defendant, we reverse the final agency decision and remand for a new administrative hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The child at issue - Carolyn (a fictitious name) - was born in 2002. The record reveals that her parents, Steven and defendant Lola (also fictitious names) never married but began living together at the time of Carolyn's birth. Their separation in 2009 triggered\n   an acrimonious family court custody battle; Lola also obtained a domestic violence final restraining order against Steven, and he was criminally convicted for assault arising from the same domestic violence event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2011, the family judge presiding over the custody litigation ordered reunification therapy to improve Steven's relationship with the child. Dr. S.-W. was appointed for this purpose and first saw father and daughter in May 2012. Their sessions, however, were limited because of assertions that Carolyn was too ill to attend. Dr. S.-W. soon formed the belief that Lola was the cause of Carolyn's emotional and physical stress, which was standing in the way of the reunification sessions; the doctor suspected what she referred to as \"Munchausen By Proxy Syndrome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In light of Dr. S.-W.'s communications to and testimony before the family judge in the custody litigation, the judge temporarily changed \"physical and residential\" custody to Steven on March 12, 2013. The next day, Dr. S.-W. wrote to the family judge, emphasizing that her \"original diagnosis of Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome is\n   <em>\n    a correct characterization\n   </em>\n   of what has been going on with [Carolyn]\" (emphasis added), and that there \"is strong evidence that [Lola] is the cause of [Carolyn's] anguish, stress and physical symptoms\"; a few days later, the family judge awarded Steven \"temporary sole legal custody and temporary residential custody\" of the child and limited Lola to one hour of visitation per week to be supervised at a Division of Child Protection and Permanency office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The inflammatory nature of the Munchausen charge - even though that diagnosis was later largely disowned or found to\n   be an improper or inaccurate label - appears to have been the impetus for the wedge driven between Lola and Carolyn. At the time Dr. S.-W. was urging her Munchausen diagnosis in mid-March 2013, the judge referred the matter to the Division for investigation. On June 19, 2013, the Division gave written notice to Lola that its investigation resulted in a substantiation of abuse or neglect; in his later testimony before the administrative law judge (ALJ), Division Investigator Kevin Buck acknowledged that Dr. S.-W.'s assertion that her Munchausen diagnosis was \"a correct characterization\" was \"one piece of evidence the [D]ivision used to support [its position] that [Lola has] a mental health issue.\" The family judge entered an order continuing the new custody arrangement indefinitely, and Lola's supervised visitation was later suspended altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lola appealed the substantiation finding, and a hearing was scheduled and conducted before an administrative law judge (ALJ) in October 2014. The ALJ heard testimony from Buck, Dr. S.-W., and two Division experts, Drs. Stephanie Iacopelli and Colin Gass. The Division also had Lola evaluated by Dr. Michael Gentile, whose report was considered by the ALJ. Lola was not offered counsel and was left to conduct her own defense. She had no experts and only provided her own testimony in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2015, the ALJ rendered her initial decision, rejecting the Division's substantiation of abuse or neglect. The ALJ found that the Division failed to demonstrate Carolyn \"was actually a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy\" and that the Division had been \"[s]elective\" in its focus on Lola's behavior. For example, the ALJ determined that the Division \"shrewdly\" quoted portions of Dr. Gentile's report to justify abuse when, in fact, Dr. Gentile's \"entire medical opinion ... casts doubts\" on that finding. According to the ALJ, Dr. Gentile found \"no criteria of major depressive disorder or panic disorder\" and instead\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   rendered a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with symptoms of anxiety and depression. [Lola] also exhibited \"mild symptoms of depression and anxiety,\" which Dr. Gentile attributed to \"the acrimony of the divorce and the separation from her 10-year-old daughter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ALJ particularly pointed out that Dr. Gentile found that Lola:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   has full insight into her condition and any allegations of Munchausen by proxy behavior is more related to an attempt to manipulate the system, so that decisions are made in her favor versus the underlying psychopathology characteristic of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Her pattern of overreacting in times of stress may qualify her for a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder. Her attempts at manipulation are more suggestive of an antisocial personality disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Gentile drew a conclusion, which the ALJ adopted, that Lola \"does not suffer from psychiatric illness that would require psychotropic medication\"; instead, according to the ALJ, Lola \"would benefit from individual supportive psychotherapy to help her adjust and cope with her current situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In light of these and other findings, the ALJ determined that Lola's \"behavior was the result of an ongoing acrimonious marital breakup and custody battle over her daughter\" and the credible evidence did not preponderate to show \"that [Lola] created a substantial risk of harm to [Carolyn's] health and safety based on [Lola's] mental-health issues or emotional impairment.\" The ALJ concluded that Lola's behavior, \"while inappropriate, did not rise to the level of gross or wanton neglect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Division filed exceptions, to which Lola responded, albeit out of time. The Assistant Commissioner accepted Lola's late submission but rejected the ALJ's initial decision and reinstated the substantiated finding that Lola emotionally abused the child. The Assistant Commissioner determined: that Carolyn had suffered actual harm and that Lola's conduct was deliberate because she \"knew or should have known that her actions were having an impact\" on the child; that Lola's conduct - including the canceling of multiple therapy sessions with no attempts to reschedule - was not to Carolyn's benefit; and that Lola's conduct caused the child anxiety, gastrointestinal issues, and panic attacks, all of which disappeared once Lola's unsupervised contact with the child was\n   cut off. This final decision directed the inclusion of Lola's name in the Child Abuse Registry pursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Still without counsel, Lola appealed this final agency decision in August 2015. She immediately moved in this court for: the appointment of counsel; permission to proceed as an indigent; permission to supplement the record; and a determination that she was entitled to free transcripts of the evidentiary hearing before the ALJ. We granted the indigency motion but denied Lola the right to counsel, free transcripts and supplementation of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lola forthwith moved for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court. In January 2018, the Court granted leave to appeal in part, directed the Division to order and pay for the transcripts, and appointed current counsel to represent Lola in this court. The Supreme Court also authorized appointed counsel \"to argue the general and recurring issues of the right of indigent appellants like movant to free transcripts and the assignment of counsel to prosecute an appeal from an administrative proceeding that substantiates findings of abuse and neglect and directs the listing of\n   their names in the child abuse registry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The matter was remanded to this court for\n   disposition of Lola's appeal and our consideration of the broader question about the right to counsel in this setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the parties filed their merits briefs, the matter was listed for disposition without oral argument on January 23, 2019. Upon review of the parties' written submissions, this court scheduled oral argument and invited the New Jersey State Bar Association (the State Bar), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Public Defender's Appellate Section of the Office of Parental Representation (OPR-A) to file amicus briefs on the right-to-counsel argument. The State Bar and ACLU filed briefs. OPR-A declined the invitation but its managing attorney wrote to this court to explain OPR-A's position, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Both due and fundamental fairness suggest appointed counsel is the equitable outcome for indigent parents faced with State investigatory findings that may alter their livelihoods, reputation, or aspects of custody and visitation of their children now, or future born. Unfortunately, until the [L]egislature acts to fund this representation through the Office of the Public Defender, this office is unable to ease the burden to those parents in these situations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In her merits brief, Lola argues that indigent parties should have the right to appointed counsel in administrative proceedings in light of the severe consequences that result from the finding itself as well as inclusion in the Child Abuse Registry, which imposes limitations on employment and other relationships. In response, the Department of Children and Families argues, among other things, that because the Child Abuse Registry is cloaked in confidentiality, it is of no great consequence when a parent or guardian is listed; the Department also argues that administrative\n   proceedings like that which occurred here have been conducted for years without an indigent being given the right to appointed counsel and, because the legal landscape has not since changed, there's no need for this court to take the drastic step urged by Lola. The ACLU agrees with Lola's position on the right to counsel and further emphasizes the need for that same right to attach at the appellate level. The State Bar sides with the Department and further argues that if this court were to find a right to counsel, the burden of representing indigent parties similarly situated should not fall upon the Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree with Lola and the ACLU and hold that: (1) the consequences of a child-abuse substantiation are of sufficient magnitude to warrant the appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant; (2) that right attaches not only to the administrative proceedings commenced when the government agency provides the parent or guardian with written notice that an investigation has substantiated abuse or neglect, but also when a final agency decision has been appealed to this court as of right and it further includes the right to free transcripts; and (3) until such time as the Legislature makes provision, the right to counsel shall be enforced by courts and agencies through the appointment of pro bono counsel from the\n   <em>\n    Madden\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   list. As a result, we reverse and remand for a new substantiation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   New Jersey has a long and proud tradition of recognizing and vindicating the right to counsel in criminal proceedings dating back to the State's 1776 Constitution. In 1971, the Supreme Court noted\n   that the right to appointed counsel in petty criminal matters had not previously been recognized but concluded \"no indigent defendant should be subjected to a conviction entailing imprisonment in fact or other\n   <em>\n    consequence of magnitude\n   </em>\n   without first having had due and fair opportunity to have counsel assigned\n   without cost.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Although further interference or termination has not been sought here, we are mindful that the substantiation appears to have played a role in the family judge's suspension of Lola's visitation rights - a circumstance that continues even now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   If all this were not enough to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez's\n   </em>\n   \"consequences of magnitude\" standard, one cannot help but be struck by the simple injustice that arises from the fact that an indigent parent or guardian facing a child abuse charge in Superior Court is entitled to counsel but not when similarly charged at the administrative level. As things now stand, the Division's choice of forum determines whether indigent parents and guardians will or won't receive the assistance of counsel. That this is where the line has been drawn is not in doubt; in describing the status quo ante - the state of things up until now - in the availability of counsel for indigent parents or guardians in child abuse and neglect matters, the Department accurately asserts that \"[h]ad the Division sought care, custody, or supervision of [Lola's] children, a Title 9 complaint would have been filed and [Lola] would have been appointed counsel under N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.43(b) [,] [but] [n]o such mandate attaches to administrative challenges to abuse and neglect findings.\" So, had the litigation about this child taken a different turn - if, for example, there was no pending custody suit - the Division may very well have sought to invoke the Superior Court's jurisdiction\n   and that would have allowed for the appointment of counsel for Lola; because the Division proceeded administratively, Lola was\n   left to fend for herself. We reject the notion that this artificial distinction should be determinative of the targeted parent's right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There is no valid or logical reason for maintaining the distinction between the existence of a right to counsel in a Superior Court child abuse action and the denial of the same right at the administrative level; the present distinction further reveals that simple justice requires today's ruling. All things considered, the substantiation of child abuse carries \"consequences of magnitude\" that compel our determination that indigent litigants at the administrative level are entitled to the inestimable right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To summarize, the consequences threatened or likely to result in matters like this seem to us greater than those that have been found sufficiently dire to warrant the constitutional right to counsel in other settings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pasqua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951524\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/186/127/#p149\">\n    186 N.J. at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951524\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/186/127/#p149\">\n    892 A.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that brief incarceration to coerce payment of a willful refusal to pay child support is a consequence of magnitude that necessitates the appointment of counsel for indigents facing that potential);\n   <em>\n    State v.

She was also faced with the unusual circumstance of having to deal with Dr. S.-W.'s attorney-husband's interference during the hearing. Lola complained about his signaling to Dr. S.-W. during cross-examination; rather than halt this interference, the ALJ allowed Dr. S.-W.'s husband to lodge objections to Lola's earnest but ineffective cross-examination.\n   Lola attempted but failed to successfully move sixty-three documents into evidence.

In such matters, the State has, at considerable expense, provided the Division with the services of the Attorney General's office. Yet the State has not provided representation for indigent parents and guardians on the other side of these contests; to ensure a process that renders trustworthy outcomes, the right to counsel must be offered to indigent parents and guardians. Indigent litigants are asked to climb a steep hill in these settings. They are faced with the stress caused by the circumstances themselves (here a hotly contested custody battle) and the potential for a child abuse or neglect substantiation, which carries additional significant consequences. In attempting to avoid these consequences, the litigant must take on the Attorney General's office and the Division's witnesses and experts. The litigant must also navigate all the procedural and substantive hurdles of litigation that are by no means as simplistic as, for example, those involved in a municipal trial over a speeding ticket.

Lola's appointed counsel here argues to great effect that the Assistant Commissioner may have overstepped her authority when taking judicial notice of the family judge's opinion that may have been influenced by the Munchausen misstep. Other later proceedings before another administrative agency based on Lola's claim that Dr. S.-W. engaged in professional misconduct in this matter - apparently centering on her Munchausen diagnosis - led to entry of a November 2017 consent order which enjoined Dr. S.-W. from performing forensic psychological services and memorialized her voluntary and permanent retirement of her license to practice marriage and family therapy when her license expired in June 2016.
