The plaintiff, who is self-represented, brought the present case against the defendants, who are (1) the state of Connecticut, numerous current and former Superior\n   Court judges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Appellate Court (state defendants); (2) Roberta's treating psychiatrist, Bassam Awwa, and his employer, Connecticut Behavioral Health Associates, P.C. (Awwa defendants); and (3) Robert Knowles and Neil Knowles, and their business, Advanced Telemessaging (Knowles defendants). The plaintiff now appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Moll, J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rendered in accordance with its granting of the defendants' motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which requires a plaintiff to\n   append a good faith certificate and supporting opinion letter to the complaint in cases of medical negligence, is unconstitutional. Although the plaintiff fully briefed his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 52-190a, we cannot reach the merits of that claim because of his failure to challenge the trial court's threshold conclusions that his claims against all of the defendants are barred by, inter alia, the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record reveals the following facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim on appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as pleaded in his complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the complex procedural history of this case. Beginning in 2002, Awwa and his employer, Connecticut Behavioral Health Associates, P.C., provided psychiatric treatment to Roberta. In 2002, the plaintiff attended a treatment session with Roberta, at which time Awwa became aware of her suicidal thoughts. In early 2004, Awwa prescribed medication for Roberta to treat her major depressive disorder, despite the existence of manufacturers' warnings that (1) the medications should not be prescribed to anyone with suicidal thoughts, (2) \"the possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until [a] significant remission occurs,\" and (3) \"[c]lose supervision of high risk patients should accompany initial drug therapy.\" Awwa changed Roberta's medication on several occasions during the period of time leading up to March 1, 2004. The plaintiff contacted the Awwa defendants on nine different occasions to inform them that Roberta was having adverse reactions to the medications that Awwa had prescribed. Roberta also sent Awwa a letter dated December 23, 2003, to that effect. Awwa did not return the plaintiff's telephone calls or otherwise indicate that he appreciated the danger of the situation. On March 1, 2004, Roberta tragically committed suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 2, 2006, the plaintiff, acting as a self-represented party, filed a medical malpractice action in New\n   London Superior Court against the Awwa defendants in his own name and as administrator of Roberta's estate, claiming wrongful death, medical malpractice, loss of chance, and loss of consortium. See\n   <em>\n    Traylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Awwam\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. CV-06-5001159-S (2006 action). At the time the plaintiff filed the complaint, he had not attached the certificate of good faith and written opinion of a similar health care provider, which are required by \u00a7 52-190a. On July 27, 2006, the Awwa defendants moved to dismiss the 2006 action for lack of personal jurisdiction; the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. D. Michael Hurley\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, denied that motion on December 14, 2006. Subsequently, on October 19, 2006, the plaintiff filed a certificate of good faith and supporting written opinion letter authored by Howard Zonana, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University\n   School of Medicine, opining that there was a good faith basis for the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 26, 2006, the plaintiff, now represented by counsel, filed a request to amend the complaint pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-60. On December 29, 2006, the Awwa defendants objected to the request, and Judge Hurley sustained their objection on January 16, 2007. On January 8, 2007, the Awwa defendants moved to dismiss the 2006 action, claiming that the complaint as originally filed lacked the certificate of merit and written opinion of a similar health care provider required by \u00a7 52-190a. Subsequently, on June 1, 2007, Judge Hurley denied that motion to dismiss and thereafter issued numerous discovery orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Awwa defendants did not comply with Judge Hurley's discovery orders. Eventually, counsel for the Awwa defendants stated in court that his clients had destroyed all relevant medical and telephone records that were within their exclusive possession and control, despite their knowledge of their obligation to preserve those records given a pending or impending civil action\n   dating back to Roberta's death in March, 2004. Similarly, the Knowles defendants, acting at the direction of the Awwa defendants, destroyed relevant records in their possession. The plaintiff and his expert witnesses never had an opportunity to examine those records. Subsequently, the case was reassigned to Judge Thomas F. Parker, judge trial referee, who the plaintiff later named as a defendant in the present case. See footnote 5 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 12, 2010, the plaintiff, represented by counsel, filed an amended complaint that became the operative complaint in the 2006 action, adding claims of spoliation and violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., arising from the destruction of the records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 16, 2010, the Awwa defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that the plaintiff's original June 1, 2006 complaint initiating the action failed to comply with \u00a7 52-190a because the required certificate of good faith and opinion letter had not been\n   attached. Judge Parker granted the Awwa defendants' motion, concluding that, although Judge Hurley had denied an earlier motion to dismiss filed by these defendants, that denial preceded the Appellate Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Rios\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    CCMC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4051144\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/106/810/\">\n    106 Conn.

Relying on\n   <em>\n    Rios\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Votre\n   </em>\n   , Judge Parker concluded that the plaintiff's failure to obtain and file the written opinion letter required by \u00a7 52-190a (a) at the initiation of the 2006 action was not remedied by the eventual filing of Zonana's letter, and that Judge Hurley's ruling to the contrary was inconsistent with this appellate precedent. Id., *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Judge Parker next determined that Judge Hurley's earlier decision was not entitled to preclusive effect under the doctrines of law of the case or collateral estoppel. Id., at *5-6. Judge Parker then concluded that other specifications in the complaint against Connecticut Behavioral Health Associates, P.C., were barred by the statute of limitations in General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 (a). Id., at *9-10. Accordingly, on August 11, 2010, Judge Parker rendered judgment dismissing counts one through six of the complaint in the 2006 action. Id., at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 27, 2010, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court under docket number AC 32641; the Appellate Court subsequently\n   granted the Awwa defendants' motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on January 5, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a subsequent memorandum of decision, Judge Parker rendered judgment dismissing the two remaining counts in the 2006 action, namely, spoliation and CUTPA violations, concluding that the earlier dismissal of the underlying medical malpractice claims for failure to file a good faith certificate and opinion letter meant that the defendants had rebutted the presumption that the plaintiff could have prevailed on those claims in the absence of the acts of spoliation. See\n   <em>\n    Traylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Awwam\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. CV-06-5001159-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201025029\">\n    2011 WL 1025029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *9-10 (February 15, 2011). Accordingly, Judge Parker rendered judgment for the defendants in the 2006 action. Id., at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 23, 2011, the plaintiff, as a self-represented party, appealed from that judgment to this court under docket number SC 18754; that appeal later was transferred to the Appellate Court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-4. The Appellate Court docketed the plaintiff's appeal under docket number AC 33038, along with another appeal, docket number AC 33039, which had been filed by the plaintiff's then attorney in this case on behalf of the estate. The appeal in docket number AC 33039 subsequently was withdrawn as derivative. After the plaintiff's counsel was granted leave to withdraw from the case on June 30, 2011, the Awwa defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of a justiciable controversy between the parties, on the ground that the plaintiff's claims were derivative\n   of those of\n   the estate, with the estate's appeal having previously been dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellate Court granted that motion to dismiss on December 16, 2011. On December 29, 2011, the plaintiff filed a petition for certification to appeal from that judgment of dismissal, which this court denied on January 25, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Traylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Awwa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176281,12176301\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/931/\">\n    303 Conn. 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20A.3d%20242\">\n    36 A.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2011, the plaintiff filed a new action in New London Superior Court against the Awwa and Knowles defendants, their attorneys and insurers, then Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, court officials, and several New London prosecutors.\n   <em>\n    Traylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Awwa\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. CV-11-5014139-S (first 2011 action). The first 2011 action, which was later removed to federal court, included in its fifteen count complaint a claim that \u00a7 52-190a violated the state and federal constitutions.

The plaintiff's lengthy complaint pleaded claims for relief under six separate counts, namely (1) violations of his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws by the state defendants in connection with their handling of his previous actions, (2) fraudulent concealment by the Awwa and Knowles defendants, (3) spoliation by the Awwa and Knowles defendants, (4) violation of CUTPA by Advanced Telemessaging and Connecticut Behavioral Health Associates, P.C., (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress by the Awwa and Knowles defendants and Judge Parker, and (6) loss of consortium as to the Awwa and Knowles defendants. The case subsequently was transferred to the Danbury judicial district, and later to the Complex Litigation Docket in the judicial district of Hartford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the case was transferred to the Hartford Complex Litigation Docket, the Awwa defendants moved for summary judgment, and the Knowles defendants and the state defendants each moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiff did not oppose these motions or appear at the February 6, 2017 hearing on them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to the Awwa defendants' motion for summary judgment, the trial court agreed with their argument that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law under the doctrine of res judicata. After comparing the complaints, the trial court concluded that res judicata barred the plaintiff's claims of fraudulent concealment, CUTPA violations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress because they previously had been raised and litigated to conclusion in the first 2011 action. The trial court concluded similarly with respect to the plaintiff's claim of loss of consortium because he had\n   an adequate opportunity to raise that claim in the first 2011 action. The trial court further determined that the plaintiff could have challenged the lower courts' conclusions on these issues by way of appealing the first 2011 action. Accordingly, the trial court granted the Awwa defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court addressed the state defendants' motion to dismiss as follows. The trial court first observed that the plaintiff's complaint sought no monetary damages against either the state, the Appellate Court, or any individual state defendant in his or her official capacity. The court further concluded that any claim against any state defendant in his or her individual capacity was, in effect, against the state and, therefore, barred by sovereign immunity. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Spring\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Constantino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"568889\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/168/563/#p568\">\n    168 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568-69,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20A.2d%20871\">\n    362 A.2d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to the plaintiff's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the state defendants, the trial court concluded that these claims were barred by sovereign immunity because the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts showing that he had suffered a substantial violation of his constitutional rights or that the defendants had acted in excess of their statutory authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Specifically, the trial court observed that these claims were identical to those raised by the plaintiff in the second 2011 action, and the trial court relied on the Appellate Court's holding in that case that the plaintiff had not sufficiently pleaded \"a substantial claim that the state or one of its officers [had] violated [his] constitutional\n   rights.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The trial court reasoned that, in this context, the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief was \"barred on the independent grounds of sovereign immunity and collateral estoppel.\" The trial court also concluded that \"the plaintiff [lacked] standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 52-190a because he, in fact, obtained the opinion letter required by the statute.\" The trial court next determined that the plaintiff's claims against the individual judges were barred by absolute judicial immunity, and that his claims were nonjusticiable to the extent that they sought an order to overturn or reverse the decisions of the Appellate Court or the Superior Court. Accordingly, the trial court granted the state defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the trial court granted the Knowles defendants' motion to dismiss. The trial court agreed with their argument that the plaintiff's spoliation and CUTPA claims against them were barred by the prior pending action doctrine because they also were raised in the first 2011 action. The trial court determined that dismissal was warranted given that the actions are \"virtually alike\" and that the first 2011 action could have provided the plaintiff with the same remedy, given that \"the claims in the two actions so obviously overlap that the plaintiff moved to consolidate the matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court rendered judgment for all of the defendants in accordance with its decisions on their motions for summary judgment and dismissal. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff has filed a brief claiming that \u00a7 52-190a is unconstitutional because the \"certificate of merit requirement burdens access to the courts by\n   imposing an expensive and unnecessary prerequisite to having one's day in court.\" Arguing that access to the courts is a fundamental right under both the state and federal constitutions, the plaintiff contends that the certificate requirement \"creates an improper and often impossible obstacle to access to the courts,\" citing internal pressure from within the medical community not to support plaintiffs in general, as well as the expense of obtaining the relevant medical records and hiring an appropriate expert to review them. In particular, the plaintiff relies heavily on a line of decisions from the Oklahoma Supreme Court invalidating various iterations of that state's certificate of merit statute. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    John\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saint Francis Hospital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345722\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/681/#p691\">\n    405 P.3d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691 (Okla. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Wall\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marouk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975577\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/302/775/#p778\">\n    302 P.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 778 (Okla. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Zeier\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zimmer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8331045\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/152/861/#p874\">\n    152 P.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874 (Okla. 2006). The plaintiff further argues that \u00a7 52-190a violates his right to equal protection under the state and federal constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, the defendants contend that review of the merits of the plaintiff's constitutional claims is precluded by his failure to brief challenges to the trial court's threshold conclusions that his claims in the present case are barred by the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and sovereign and judicial immunity, as well as the prior pending action doctrine.

The trial court,\n    <em>\n     Cosgrove, J.\n    </em>\n    , denied two of these applications pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-259b (c) after a hearing, on the ground that the plaintiff \"has repeatedly filed actions with respect to the same or similar matters; that these filings demonstrate an extended pattern of frivolous filings that have been without merit; that this filing is consistent with the [plaintiff's] previous pattern of frivolous filings; and that the granting of the fee waiver would constitute a flagrant misuse of [J]udicial [B]ranch resources.\"\n    <em>\n     Traylor\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Awwa\n    </em>\n    , Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. CV-06-5001159-S,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20823033\">\n     2016 WL 823033\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (February 5, 2016). Ultimately, however, Judge Povadator, sitting in the Stamford-Norwalk judicial district where this case originally was filed, granted the fee waiver on March 14, 2016, which allowed the plaintiff to pursue the present action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    We note that the plaintiff's conduct in responding to the motions and appearing in court was at issue before the trial court. After giving the plaintiff an additional month of time to file responsive briefs, in addition to a previous ninety day extension before its assignment to the case, the trial court then granted the plaintiff an extension of an additional sixty days, ultimately setting January 23, 2017, as a due date for briefs and February 6, 2017, as the hearing date. On February 1, 2017, the plaintiff moved for continuance of a \" 'February 23' status conference\" on the ground that he needed more time to prepare and represented therein that he had contacted the defendants' attorneys regarding his request but they had not responded to him. The plaintiff also indicated in a separate filing that he required a continuance because he had vision problems resulting from medication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Because there was no status conference scheduled for February 23, 2017, the trial court presumed that the plaintiff sought a continuance of the only scheduled event, namely, the February 6 hearing. On February 2, 2017, the trial court issued an order denying a continuance of the February 6 hearing, but directed the plaintiff to appear at that hearing to argue in support of his request for more time to respond, and to submit for in camera review medical documentation supporting his arguments that he \"was physically unable\" to participate. On February 3, 2017, the plaintiff obtained his medical records from a Veterans Affairs (VA) office and then had them sent from the New London courthouse to a court officer in Hartford via e-mail. The plaintiff then filed a \"notice of compliance\" stating that he would not attend the February 6 hearing, \"claiming for the first time that he was unable to drive as a result of prescribed medication.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    At the February 6 hearing before the trial court, the court officer confirmed on the record that, on the afternoon of February 3, the plaintiff had \"called him and said that he had\n    <em>\n     driven to a VA office\n    </em>\n    that day to obtain his medical records and that he had\n    <em>\n     driven to the New London courthouse\n    </em>\n    that day to have those records e-mailed to [Judge Moll's] chambers.\" (Emphasis in original.) Given that the plaintiff had driven a car that day and his medical records did not support any claims of vision problems, the trial court found that the plaintiff was \"flagrantly disregarding the court's deadlines and the court's February 3, 2017 order denying his request to continue the February 6, 2017 hearing. Accordingly, the [trial] court proceeded with the February 6, 2017 hearing, which [the plaintiff] failed to attend.\" The plaintiff has not challenged that finding or the denial of additional extensions in this appeal.

We disagree with the trial court's reliance on this reasoning as applied to the present case. Having reviewed the operative complaint in this case, we conclude that the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint, taken as true-and particularly the allegation that \u00a7 52-190a creates an \"economic barrier\" to access to the courts, given that \"[t]he average burden of cost for the prelitigation certificate of merit is $10,000 to $20,000,\" with a disproportionate effect on African American litigants like the plaintiff-are sufficiently specific allegations of economic injury to demonstrate an incursion upon constitutionally protected interests.

Given the significant expense allegedly incurred by the plaintiff, and the fact that his failure to obtain the letter at the outset of the 2006 action led to its dismissal, we also disagree with the trial court's conclusion that \"the plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 52-190a because he, in fact, obtained the opinion letter required by the statute.\" Nevertheless, the plaintiff's failure to challenge the state defendants' other grounds for dismissal renders this standing conclusion harmless error not requiring reversal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    We further note that, because the plaintiff's standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 52-190a emanates from his interests in the claims relating to the 2006 action, his opportunity to assert this constitutional challenge was in the lengthy proceedings before the trial court in the 2006 action and during the subsequent appeals. \"[I]t is well settled that [f]inal judgments are ... presumptively valid ... and collateral attacks on their validity are disfavored.... The reason for the rule against collateral attack is well stated in these words: The law aims to invest judicial transactions with the utmost permanency consistent with justice....
