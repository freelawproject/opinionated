On appeal, the petitioner argues that the court improperly dismissed his claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for the failure to state a claim upon which habeas relief can be granted. Specifically, the petitioner argues that the court improperly dismissed his claims that (1) he\n   relied on \"governmental representations\" that he would receive risk reduction credit when he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, (2) the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, misconstrued and misapplied several statutes pertaining to the petitioner receiving a parole suitability hearing, earning risk reduction credit in the future, and applying risk reduction credit toward the advancement of the petitioner's parole eligibility date, and (3) the respondent's customary practices have created a vested liberty interest in receiving a parole suitability hearing, earning future risk reduction credits, and applying risk reduction credits to advance his parole eligibility date. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On April 2, 2012, the petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a, which he committed on or about September 24, 1999,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for which he was sentenced to twenty-eight years of imprisonment. Thereafter, the then self-represented petitioner commenced this action by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On November 15, 2017, the petitioner, after obtaining counsel, filed an eighteen count amended habeas petition. On March 19, 2018, the court, sua sponte, dismissed the amended petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for the failure to state a claim upon which habeas relief may be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   Practice Book \u00a7 23-29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of addressing the petitioner's claims individually, the court broadly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the habeas petition and that the petition had failed to state a claim upon which habeas relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted the petitioner's\n   petition for certification to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner timely filed the present appeal, challenging the dismissal of ten of his claims. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before addressing the petitioner's individual claims, we first set forth the standards of review and relevant legal principles applicable to the petitioner's appeal. \"Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it ....

For ease of discussion, we next provide a brief summary of the relevant laws pertaining to the petitioner's ability to receive a parole suitability hearing, to earn future risk reduction credit, and to apply his earned risk reduction credit toward the advancement of his parole eligibility date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to No. 04-234 of the 2004 Public Acts, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a (e), the Board of Pardons and Paroles (board) was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to hold a parole suitability hearing for any person eligible for parole who had completed 85 percent of his or her sentence. General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 54-125a (e) subsequently was amended by No. 13-247 of\n   the 2013 Public Acts (P.A. 13-247), to make the board's parole suitability hearing discretionary, rather than mandatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the board declines to hold a hearing, however, \u00a7 54-125a (e) requires the board to document specific reasons for declining to hold a hearing and to provide those reasons to the person denied a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to risk reduction credits, our Supreme Court has summarized the relevant statutes as follows: \"In July, 2011 ... General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   became effective, pursuant to which the respondent had discretion to award risk reduction credit toward a reduction of an inmate's sentence, up to five days per month, for positive conduct. General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e (a) and (b). The respondent also was vested with discretion to revoke such credit, even credit yet to be earned, for good cause. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-98e (b). At the same time, the legislature amended the parole eligibility provision to provide: 'A person convicted of ... an offense ... where the underlying facts and circumstances of the offense involve the use, attempted use or threatened\n   use of physical force against another person shall be ineligible for parole under subsection (a) of this section until such person has served not less than eighty-five per cent of the definite sentence imposed\n   <em>\n    less any risk reduction credit earned under the provisions of section 18-98e\n   </em>\n   .' ... General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), as amended by Public Acts 2011, No. 11-51, \u00a7 25 (P.A. 11-51). The subsection of \u00a7 54-125a addressing parole hearings was similarly amended to account for earned risk reduction credit. General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 54-125a (e), as amended by P.A. 11-51, \u00a7 25. Accordingly, under the 2011 amendments, earned risk reduction credit was to be applied to an inmate's definite sentence to advance the inmate's end of sentence date, and the parole eligibility date calculated as a percentage of the sentence would advance in similar measure ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Under the 2011 amendments to \u00a7 54-125a and \u00a7 18-98e, any risk reduction credit earned by an inmate, and not subsequently revoked, would have both reduced his sentence and rendered him eligible for a hearing to determine whether he should be granted parole after he had served 85 percent of that reduced sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Effective July 1, 2013, the legislature again amended \u00a7 54-125a. Specifically, with regard to offenses like one of those of which the petitioner was convicted, the legislature eliminated the language that permitted the parole eligibility date to be advanced by the application of any earned risk reduction credit.

Indeed, the legislature has made it clear in its amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 54-125a and 18-98e that the respondent is no longer authorized to utilize risk reduction credits to advance an inmate's parole eligibility date and that he may no longer issue risk reduction credits to inmates such as the petitioner. In other words, if we were to hold in this case that a liberty interest has been created in the earning of future risk reduction credit, the application of risk reduction credit to advance\n   the petitioner's parole eligibility date, and in receiving a parole suitability hearing, we would usurp the power vested in the legislature, which broadly dictates to the respondent, a member of the executive branch, how to administer\n   and apply risk reduction credit and conduct parole suitability hearings. \"Because the ultimate power rests in the people and has been allocated to the separate branches of government, it is our duty to ensure that each branch, including the judiciary, does not usurp the power of its coequal branches.

The petitioner simply distinguishes a substantive statute from a procedural statute and concludes that the relevant public acts are substantive statutes without providing any analysis of the language at issue in the statutes and without citing to any legislative history to evince the legislature's intent.
