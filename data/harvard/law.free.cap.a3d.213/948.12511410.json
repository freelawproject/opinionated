(temporarily assigned).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Charles L. Bove, appeals from an order granting summary judgment to defendants, AkPharma Inc. and its CEO, Alan Kligerman, and denying his motion to strike defendants' affirmative defense under the Workers' Compensation Act (WCA), N.J.S.A. 34:15-1 to -146. Bove also appeals from an order entering judgments for sanctions against his attorneys under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:4-8. We affirm the two rulings granting summary judgment and denying Bove's motion to strike, but reverse the order imposing sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2013, Bove filed a workers' compensation claim and then in August 2014, he filed a companion civil suit against AkPharma Inc. and Kligerman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both actions involved claims arising from Bove's use of a nasal spray product called \"NasoCell.\" Bove's civil complaint was dismissed without prejudice so the parties could explore alternative dispute resolution, but when attempts at settlement failed, Bove refiled his civil complaint in April 2015. In his complaint, Bove alleged defendants were liable for fraudulent concealment, battery, and prima facie tort, based on Bove's use of NasoCell. In response to the refiled complaint, on May 5, 2015, defendants' counsel sent Bove's counsel a \"safe harbor\" letter, per\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:4-8(b)(1). That letter made no mention of Bove's separate workers' compensation petition nor the exclusivity bar under the WCA. Instead, the letter generally indicated Bove's factual allegations about his use of NasoCell were contrary to the evidence and that there was no scientific evidence linking his alleged injuries to NasoCell. The \"safe harbor\" letter also\n   contended Bove's legal claims were contrary to New Jersey law and were \"governed exclusively by the New Jersey Product Liability Act\" (PLA), N.J.S.A. 2A:58C-1 to -11. In response to this letter, Bove's counsel filed an amended complaint, outlining five causes of action, namely, fraudulent concealment, battery, prima facie tort, strict products liability/design defect, and strict liability/failure to warn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2015, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment based on the WCA bar. On April 19, 2016, the court dismissed the prima facie tort action, denied dismissal as to the other counts and denied, without prejudice, defendants' motion for summary judgment. Shortly thereafter, the trial court ordered discovery limited to the application of the WCA litigation bar. In October 2016 and March 2017, supplemental orders were entered to extend discovery and to allow Bove's counsel time to engage a scientific expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June 2017, Bove filed a motion to strike defendants' affirmative defense of the WCA's litigation bar. Defendants opposed this motion and renewed their request for summary judgment. The trial court then conducted a five-day evidentiary hearing in July 2017, to determine whether Bove could proceed with his civil suit or was barred from doing so under the WCA. The trial court heard testimony from Bove, Kligerman, and their respective experts during this hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the trial court denied Bove's motion to strike defendants' affirmative defense of the WCA's litigation bar and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Defendants then timely moved for a frivolous litigation award, seeking reimbursement in the sum of $702,819.87 for counsel fees, costs and expert fees. On December 13, 2017, the trial court partially granted defendants' request for sanctions and entered judgments against Bove's attorneys amounting to $205,147.82. Each firm representing Bove was directed to pay half of this award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bove appeals from the August 4, 2017 and December 13, 2017 orders. The New Jersey Association for Justice (NJAJ) joins in his appeal, as amicus curiae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The two opinions accompanying the orders at issue reflect extensive fact-findings, which we need not repeat here. Instead, we highlight only those facts salient to our analysis and note the trial court accurately captured the testimony of the parties and their experts, including the error committed by Bove's expert in misreading the content and meaning of a Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) public notice about \"Nasal Moisturizer Drug Products.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the testimony from the evidentiary hearing, Bove was hired by Kligerman in 2003 on a part-time basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Soon, he became a full-time employee and the Director of Clinical Studies at AkPharma. By 2007, he was engaged in discussions with Kligerman about NasoCell, the nasal spray product Kligerman had developed. NasoCell was comprised of calcium glycerophosphate (CGP) and distilled water. Kligerman used this product personally and decided to put the mixture into a spray bottle. He claimed NasoCell helped him with his asthma and that several of his family members also used NasoCell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The testimony from the evidentiary hearing confirms Kligerman suggested Bove and other AkPharma employees use NasoCell spray. It is uncontroverted that some employees declined to use NasoCell but Bove agreed to try it. He used NasoCell from 2007 to as late as 2010, documented the effects he observed while using this product, and submitted his observations to Kligerman. The record reflects Bove often used NasoCell outside the workplace and in his home, and he provided many positive reviews about his use of NasoCell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When NasoCell's ingredients were modified and the product became known as \"NasoCell-S,\" Bove continued to use this modified product. The record shows Bove's use of NasoCell-S was unsupervised, except on one occasion when Bove testified he felt pressured to use the product because Kligerman followed him into\n   a bathroom at work to watch him use it. However, on cross-examination, Bove conceded \"nobody had a gun to (his) head\" to use the product and he \"did it for Alan (Kligerman).\" The record also reflects that in January 2008, Bove completed a survey at work, advising he wanted to continue to be a panelist to study NasoCell and to receive another bottle of the spray. Bove was unsure when he stopped using NasoCell, but did not believe he used it after defendants received a \"full clinical hold letter\" from the FDA in 2010, testifying, \"I pretty much washed my hands of it after that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For his part, Kligerman denied pressuring Bove at any time to use NasoCell and testified Bove was enthusiastic about the product. Kligerman also testified he personally used NasoCell several times a week, starting in 2007, and as of the time of the evidentiary hearing, he and his family members continued to use NasoCell on a regular basis with no negative effects. Kligerman was unwavering in his testimony that NasoCell was safe and that Bove voluntarily used the product. Further, there was no evidence presented at the hearing of any adverse action taken against Bove or other employees at AkPharma who declined to use NasoCell or started but then stopped using NasoCell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2010, AkPharma received a full clinical hold letter from the FDA, essentially placing a hold on any further clinical study of NasoCell as a drug until certain stated deficiencies were cured. There is no dispute Bove knew NasoCell did not have FDA approval before he used the product. Concerned about incurring additional expenses, AkPharma discontinued development of NasoCell as a drug and explored its development as a cosmetic. However, NasoCell never got past the early planning and development stage, it was not marketed to the public, and ultimately, it was abandoned by defendants altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2011, AkPharma terminated Bove and other employees as part of a workforce reduction. Then, in 2013, Bove was diagnosed with permanent endocrine failure and a colon tumor. Following these diagnoses, Bove researched the ingredients that had been\n   used in NasoCell, such as CGP and parabens, and concluded his use of NasoCell had caused his health problems. He also asserted a number of medical professionals had connected his\n   use of NasoCell to his ailments, but did not present any reports to support this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on these facts, the trial court granted defendants summary judgment in August 2017, finding Bove did not \"vault\" the exclusivity provision of the WCA. It explained Bove's proofs did not show that: (1) Kligerman knew his actions were substantially certain to result in injury or death to plaintiff; or (2) Bove's injuries and the circumstances of their infliction were more than a fact of life of industrial employment and beyond what the Legislature intended the WCA to immunize. The trial judge also stated that as AkPharma's Clinical Studies Manager, Bove's \"involvement in the early stages of new products was apparently part of his duties.\" The trial judge found Bove: used NasoCell at work and at home; he made positive findings regarding its effectiveness; and then ceased using it, years prior to his initial workers' compensation petition. Moreover, the trial court noted that several years after Bove stopped using NasoCell, he had no medical evidence to support his claim that NasoCell caused his health problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the other hand, the trial court found Kligerman \"was, and remains, very confident of the safety of the conduct he asked plaintiff to engage in. Not only has [Kligerman] used NasoCell regularly for the past several years, he has encouraged his family members to do so.\" Based on these and other observations, the trial judge concluded that \"[s]uch are not the circumstances to support a civil claim for personal injuries by an employee against an employer\" and there is no basis to waive the \"cloak of immunity afforded an employer under the WCA.\" Additionally, the trial court determined \"there are no facts in dispute that might support a finding by a reasonable jury that AkPharma knew with virtual certainty that Mr. Bove had been required to engage in conduct that would be harmful to him,\" adding, \"the evidence is so one-sided\n   that it is inconceivable that a jury would find that [d]efendant was substantially certain that [p]laintiff would suffer harm from his use of NasoCell.\" Thus, the trial court granted summary judgment in defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review the trial court's decision granting summary judgment de novo, using the identical standard that governs the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Townsend v.

Instead, Bove admitted to using NasoCell at work\n   and at home and on cross-examination, he conceded no one \"forced\" him to use NasoCell. Bove also acknowledged he participated in the study \"for Alan (Kligerman),\" and Kligerman never said \"if you don't try it, you're going to lose your job.\" Moreover, in 2008, after having used NasoCell repeatedly and aware it had not been approved by the FDA, Bove signed a form indicating he wanted to continue as a panelist in studying the effects of NasoCell and wanted another bottle of NasoCell. The proofs similarly confirmed, without contradiction, that Bove continued to be employed by defendants after he stopped using NasoCell, and that other employees who declined to use or stopped using NasoCell suffered no negative repercussions from defendants. Further, Kligerman used NasoCell before he asked Bove to try it and Kligerman used NasoCell long after Bove stopped using the product. As the trial court noted, these were not the type of circumstances demonstrating Kligerman was \"substantially certain\" that injury or death would be suffered by Bove from using NasoCell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Turning to Bove's claim of fraud, he had to prove: \"(1) a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact; (2) knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity; (3) an intention that the other person rely on it; (4) reasonable reliance thereon by the other person; and (5) resulting damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Gennari v.

As correctly determined by the trial judge, no fraud was committed in this instance because no material misrepresentation was made-the ingredients in NasoCell were generally regarded as safe and were not among the FDA's list of unsafe cosmetic ingredients. Bove presented no evidence to the contrary. Moreover, the trial court's determination that Kligerman was, and remains, very confident in the safety of NasoCell was overwhelmingly supported by the record. Indeed, it was uncontroverted Kligerman and his family members used NasoCell for years, with no injuries reported from its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   While Bove sought to equate defendants' intentional acts to the more egregious acts referenced by the\n   <em>\n    Van Dunk\n   </em>\n   Court, we find the trial court's rejection of his claims amply supported by the record. That is to say, we find no error in its analysis of the conduct prong under\n   <em>\n    Millison\n   </em>\n   regarding defendants' acts, for purposes of exposure to a civil suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To the extent Bove complains the trial court erred when citing to his failure to provide medical causation testimony, we disagree. Indeed, the first prong of the two-prong substantial certainty test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Millison\n   </em>\n   confirms an employer\n   must know its actions are \"substantially certain\" to result in injury or death to the employee.\n   <em>\n    Millison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1359607\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/101/161/#p171\">\n    101 N.J. at 178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20A.2d%20505\">\n    501 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, if a plaintiff cannot demonstrate the employer was aware the conduct at issue was substantially certain to result in injury, that plaintiff cannot satisfy the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Millison.\n   </em>\n   Bove was properly held to this same standard by the trial court. However, his proofs fell far short of satisfying the conduct prong, as he presented no evidence to support his contention defendants were substantially certain his use of NasoCell would result in injury or death. Moreover, Bove provided no proofs his alleged injuries resulted from defendants' actions. On the other hand, defendants addressed the conduct prong and presented evidence the ingredients in NasoCell were generally regarded as safe by the FDA and that the use of such ingredients in consumer products was widespread. Additionally, they presented expert testimony accepted by the trial court that it was highly unlikely NasoCell's ingredients caused any of the ailments complained of by Bove. Thus, we are satisfied that when the trial court mentioned Bove's lack of medical proofs, it did so, cognizant of its central inquiry, i.e., whether defendants were substantially certain death or injury would result from Bove's use of NasoCell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We note that whether NasoCell was a cosmetic or a drug while Bove used the product was extensively addressed by the parties' experts. However, a review of the lengthy expert testimony provided on this issue was of little assistance to us in resolving\n   whether defendants \"knowingly exposed plaintiff to a substantial certainty of injury,\" i.e., the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Millison\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <em>\n    Millison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1359607\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/101/161/#p171\">\n    101 N.J. at 178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20A.2d%20505\">\n    501 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At any rate, we find no error in the trial court's assessment of how defendants developed and then abandoned NasoCell before it could be marketed as a drug or cosmetic. Similarly, the record supports the trial court's conclusion that Bove's own expert erred in relying on a misunderstanding of the FDA's 2003 \"Call for Data,\" in an effort to support Bove's claims of defendants' liability for intentional wrongs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As there was no evidence to suggest defendants were substantially certain death or injury would result from Bove's use of NasoCell, it is unnecessary to analyze the second prong of the \"substantial certainty\" standard, i.e. the resulting injury must not be a \"fact of life of industrial employment\" and must be plainly beyond anything the Legislature intended the WCA to immunize.\n   <em>\n    Millison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1359607\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/101/161/#p171\">\n    101 N.J. at 178-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=501%20A.2d%20505\">\n    501 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nonetheless, the motion judge found Bove's complaint \"was frivolous as defined in both [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 1:4-8, and N.J.S.A. 1A:15-59.1, and that plaintiff's counsel [was] obligated under [the] Court Rules for payment of counsel fees to defendants.\" The trial court declined to award sanctions against Bove, finding he did not act in bad faith nor should he have known his complaint \"was without a reasonable basis in law or equity.\" However, the trial court specifically determined Bove's complaint should have been withdrawn when he received defendants' \"safe harbor\" letter, or, alternatively, his counsel should have investigated whether his claims had merit. The trial judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   How plaintiff's counsel could proceed for another 19 months without retaining an expert bespeaks a lack of appreciation for the issues raised by the Complaint and defendants' \"safe harbor\" letter. Had plaintiff's counsel informed the [c]ourt that\n   he wished an initial period to consult with a scientific expert, such time would have been granted. But no such request was made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   That would have been the prudent course because [plaintiff's counsel] needed to determine whether he could prove: (a) that plaintiff did indeed suffer injury; (b) that plaintiff's injuries were directly linked to his exposure to NasoCell[ ]; and (c) that [Kligerman] knew with \"substantial certainty\" that [plaintiff] would be injured. In lieu of focusing on a coherent explanation of how NasoCell[ ] caused plaintiff's alleged injuries, this litigation continued for more than [two] years; resulted in significant expense to\n   the parties; and plaintiff never produced a single piece of evidence to support his contention that he was injured, that defendants were the cause of the injury, or that defendants committed an intentional wrong, thereby vaulting the WCA litigation bar. Equally puzzling to the [c]ourt is the history of the plaintiff's WCA claim which has been pending for more than four years, wherein plaintiff has repeatedly cancelled [independent medical examinations] scheduled by defendants and has yet to proffer proofs in support of the WCA Petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The motion judge also pointed out that prior to the evidentiary hearing, he warned Bove's counsel that he would \"not hesitate to award counsel fees when a proper\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:4-8 letter had been served, and a claim is found to be meritless.\" We note, however, that defendants'\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:4-8 \"safe harbor\" letter did not raise the issue that Bove lost on following the evidentiary hearing-the WCA exclusive remedy bar. Notwithstanding the defendants' failure to mention the WCA exclusivity bar in its \"safe harbor\" letter, the trial court found Bove's attorneys continued to pursue Bove's claims, even though no \"credible, tangible\" evidence was presented to show defendants knew, with substantial certainty, Bove would be injured from his use of NasoCell and Bove, in fact, was injured by defendants' actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The trial court then analyzed defense counsel's affidavit of services and calculated a \"lodestar figure,\" for what he deemed a reasonable fee, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Rendine v. Pantzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306069\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/292/\">\n    141 N.J. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306069\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/141/292/\">\n    661 A.2d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1:4-8(b)(2) and\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:42-9(b) and (c) (allowing for an award based on reasonable expenses and fees as detailed in an affidavit of services). Rather than simply accepting the figure presented by defendants, the trial court carefully scrutinized defense counsel's billing entries, the hourly rate of defendants' lead counsel, and defendants' request for reimbursement of expenses, including expert witness fees, before adjusting the amount of the award to a figure it deemed reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Notwithstanding the trial court's painstaking analysis, we find it erred by awarding sanctions against Bove's counsel, without accounting for the temporal limitation governing such an award. Certainly, when the court issued its order of April 19, 2016, initially denying defendants' motion for summary judgment, the date of that order provided a \"cut-off\" date and sanctions should not have been awarded for litigation fees and expenses incurred prior to that date. This is particularly true where, after summary judgment was denied and discovery orders entered, Bove's counsel was allowed to retain an expert in March 2017, and to proceed to an evidentiary hearing. Bove's counsel might have been hard-pressed to surmise Bove's complaint was frivolous in light of this procedural and factual history. At any rate, because summary judgment was denied on all but one of Bove's causes of action on April 19, 2016, we see no basis to conclude Bove's attorneys violated the frivolous litigation rule as early as May 5, 2015 or that they continued to pursue litigation frivolously in the months leading up to the initial summary judgment ruling. Although some of the allegations made at the outset of the litigation later proved to be unfounded, this outcome does not render Bove's complaint frivolous.\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915752\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/419/482/#p498\">\n    419 N.J.

As we find no indication that the trial court \"backed out\" fees or expenses prior to the date of its summary judgment ruling in 2016, the award cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It next bears repeating that the May 5, 2015 \"safe harbor\" letter made no mention of the WCA's exclusivity bar, even though that bar was the basis on which defendants prevailed. This lack of specificity constituted a failure to properly alert Bove and his\n   counsel to the alleged frivolous nature of Bove's claim. Contrary to the position taken by defendants on appeal, even if a non-prevailing party does not complain about a deficiency regarding a safe-harbor notice, the judiciary itself has an institutional interest in assuring that the safe-harbor prerequisite to fee-shifting is strictly enforced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Toll Brothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025004\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/190/61/#p71\">\n    190 N.J. at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025004\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/190/61/#p71\">\n    918 A.2d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the safe-harbor mechanism helps preserve, among other things, judicial resources).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trocki Plastic Surgery Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"242034\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/344/399/#p406\">\n    344 N.J.
