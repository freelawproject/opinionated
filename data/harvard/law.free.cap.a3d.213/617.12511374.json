Belliveau argues that the court erred by declining to adopt the putative spouse doctrine or the doctrine of marriage by estoppel. We affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The following facts were found by the court following a hearing on September 17, 2018, and are fully supported by the record. In May 1992, Belliveau and Whelan traveled to England to be married. Upon arriving, they attempted to obtain a marriage license from the local town hall, but were denied a license because they did not meet the residency requirement. Despite this, Belliveau and Whelan went ahead with their planned wedding ceremony, which was officiated by a friend who was neither a minister nor an official authorized to solemnize marriages there. Upon their return to Maine, Belliveau and Whelan held a \"wedding reception,\" but did not seek or obtain a marriage license in Maine, nor did they take any other steps to create a valid marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] Over the next twenty-six years, Belliveau and Whelan held themselves out to others as a married couple. Their son, now twenty, has believed, and continues to believe, that Belliveau and Whelan are married. Belliveau and Whelan filed joint\n   income taxes, signed medical insurance documents as a married couple, and signed and had notarized a \"Property Ownership Agreement\" that characterizes them as \"husband and wife.\" This agreement indicates that, in the event of a divorce, Whelan would retain exclusive ownership of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] In March 2017, Belliveau filed a complaint for divorce. In response, Whelan asserted that the parties were never legally married and sought a dismissal of the complaint. After holding an interim hearing, the court agreed with Whelan and dismissed the complaint. Belliveau timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] In Maine, the requirements for a valid marriage are provided by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 650 - 753 (2018). On this basis, we have declined to recognize common law marriage and have continuously left policy decisions regarding marriage and divorce to the Legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9238096\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/851/521/\">\n    2004 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9238096\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/851/521/\">\n    851 A.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Maine does not recognize common law marriage.\");\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.

Belliveau asks us to create an end-run around those requirements by adopting one, or both, of two equitable doctrines-the putative spouse doctrine or the doctrine of marriage by estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.
