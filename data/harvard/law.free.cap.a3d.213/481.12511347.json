The defendant, Stevan Spivey, responds that the Appellate Court properly applied the abuse of discretion standard and also correctly concluded that, in determining that the appellate claims lacked color, the trial court improperly assessed the conduct of the defendant's attorney rather than that of the defendant. The defendant claims that the amount of the award was unreasonable and excessive because (1) the plaintiff's success in the appeal for which fees were awarded was not due to the efforts of the plaintiff's counsel, and (2) the defendant's attorney charged him a significantly lower amount of fees for representing him in that appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of the fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Appellate Court opinions in the present case have set forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \"The parties were married in Darien on December 31, 1998. One child was born of the marriage in 2000. Thereafter, the marriage broke down irretrievably, and, in March, 2005, the plaintiff commenced an action seeking to dissolve the marriage. On May 2, 2007, the court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., rendered a judgment of dissolution [2007 decision]. As part of this decision, the court acknowledged the plaintiff's claim that she needed to move to Virginia in order to remain competitive in her employment with Lexmark, and found that it was in the best interest of the child to relocate with her to Virginia. The defendant appealed from the judgment, arguing, inter alia, that the court improperly permitted the plaintiff to relocate with their minor child to Virginia. [The Appellate Court] affirmed the judgment of the court, and [the] Supreme Court denied certification to appeal.\n   <em>\n    Lederle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spivey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708800\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/113/177/\">\n    113 Conn.

According to the defendant, [t]he plaintiff had a continuing duty to disclose the status of her job situation with Lexmark after [the May 2, 2007] judgment [of the trial court], and before the Appellate Court issued a ... decision in [March] 2009.... The defendant further argued that the plaintiff's failure to disclose the status of her job situation with Lexmark constituted fraud with respect to a material fact or facts which ultimately led to [the trial] court's conclusion that [the] plaintiff and the minor child should be permitted to relocate from the state of Connecticut to the state of Virginia for primarily employment purposes....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The court,\n   <em>\n    Emons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   ., heard oral argument on the motion and, after receiving a memorandum of law from counsel for each party in support of their position, issued a memorandum of decision denying the motion to open on January 28, 2013 [2013 decision]. In reaching its decision, the court found that [a]fter the May 2, 2007 judgment, on June 5, the plaintiff lost her employment at Lexmark.... On or about August 20, 2007, the plaintiff relocated to Virginia and at or about the same time, began a new job at Xerox, also located in Virginia. The court noted that Judge Abery-Wetstone found numerous reasons why relocation was in the best interest of the minor child and that no single factor controlled the decision of the court. On the basis of the foregoing, the court held that while the plaintiff did have a duty to disclose that she lost her Lexmark job and procured a new one at Xerox, prior to the Appellate [Court's] decision, her failure to disclose [did] not constitute fraud.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lederle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spivey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490380\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/636/#p594\">\n    174 Conn.

The requirement of an independent finding that the challenged actions or claims are entirely without color ensures that \"fear of an award of [attorney's] fees against them will not deter persons with colorable claims from pursuing those claims ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/#p844\">\n    269 Conn. at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The requirement of that independent finding means that, if a court concludes that a claim is colorable, it cannot award attorney's fees, even if the court were to conclude that the person against whom sanctions are sought acted in bad faith. When, as in the present case, the actor's bad faith is predicated on the theory that he knowingly brought claims entirely lacking in color, colorability and bad faith are, by necessity, closely linked. For that reason, we take the opportunity to clarify the distinction between colorability and bad faith.\n   Colorability is measured by an objective standard, whereas bad faith is measured by a subjective one. Colorability focuses on the merits of the claim. A \"colorable claim\" is defined as one \"that is legitimate and that may reasonably be asserted, given the facts presented and the current law (or a reasonable and logical extension or modification of the current law).\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009) p. 282. Put another way, a claim is colorable if, given the facts presented and the current law (or a reasonable extension thereof), the claim arguably has merit. Although we have stated that the standard for colorability varies depending on whether the person against whom sanctions are sought is a party or the party's attorney; see\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/#p844\">\n    269 Conn. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we now clarify that the inquiry is the same in either case. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has explained, \"[a] claim is colorable, for the purpose of the bad faith exception, when it has some legal and factual support, considered in light of the reasonable beliefs of the individual making the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Nemeroff\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372564\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/620/339/#p348\">\n    620 F.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (2d Cir. 1980). Put simply, the colorability inquiry asks whether there is a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   basis, given the facts, for bringing the claim, regardless of whether it is brought by an attorney or a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A determination of bad faith, by contrast, rather than focusing on the objective, reasonable beliefs of the person against whom sanctions are sought, focuses on subjective intent. We have emphasized that, in determining whether a party has engaged in bad faith, \"[t]he appropriate focus for the court ... is the conduct of the party in instigating or maintaining the litigation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Maris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458934\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/834/#p844\">\n    269 Conn. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From that conduct, the court may infer the subjective intent of the person against whom sanctions are sought. Some examples of evidence that would support a finding of bad faith\n   include \"a party's use of oppressive tactics or its wilful violations of court orders\"; id., at 845-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%20133\">\n    850 A.2d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; or a finding that the challenged actions \"[are taken] for reasons of harassment or delay or for other improper purposes ....\"\n   <em>\n    CFM of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chowdhury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300288\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/375/#p394\">\n    239 Conn. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20A.2d%201108\">\n    685 A.2d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), overruled in part on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237183\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/147/#p155\">\n    250 Conn. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20333\">\n    735 A.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). When, as in the present case, the claim that an individual has brought or maintained an action in bad faith is predicated on the individual's personal knowledge that there is no factual support for the claim or claims at issue, in order to infer that the individual acted in bad faith, the court must make a finding\n   that the individual knew of the absence of that factual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Applying these principles to the present case, we disagree with the Appellate Court's conclusion that the trial court, in its 2015 decision, abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to the plaintiff.

The trial court predicated its ultimate findings on the following subordinate factual findings. As to the defendant's claim on appeal that the trial court improperly held a portion of the hearing on the motion to open in chambers and off the record, the court found that nothing in the record provided support for that claim. The trial court found that the record demonstrated only two instances in which the court conducted any business related to this matter in chambers: first, prior to the start of the hearing to discuss procedural issues with counsel for both parties and, second, to read two decisions as requested by counsel. The court further found that, although the defendant was physically present at all court proceedings, neither he nor his attorney raised any objection on the basis that the court was holding a portion of the hearing in chambers and off the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the defendant's claim on appeal that the trial court, in its 2013 decision, abused its discretion by ruling on the motion to open-which was predicated on the basis of a claim of fraud-without hearing testimony or taking evidence, the court, in its 2015 decision, predicated its ultimate determination that the claim lacked any indicia of color on two independent findings, either of which on its own would support the court's ultimate finding. First, the court found that the parties agreed to a two part procedure by which the court would first determine whether, but-for the plaintiff's job with Lexmark, the trial court, in its 2007 decision, would not have granted her motion for permission to relocate with the minor child to Virginia. If, and only if, the court answered that question in the affirmative, would it consider whether an evidentiary hearing would be required to resolve the motion to open. The court\n   found that it had explained the proposed bifurcated procedure not only to counsel, but also to both the plaintiff and the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the court\n   found that the transcript of the October 24, 2012 hearing clearly revealed that, in lieu of an evidentiary hearing, the parties agreed to proceed by filing simultaneous briefs with factual stipulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court's subordinate findings were sufficiently specific to support its ultimate findings that the defendant acted in bad faith in knowingly bringing appellate claims that were entirely lacking in color.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the defendant's first appellate claim-that the court conducted part of the hearing in chambers and off the record-the court's findings were sufficiently specific to support the conclusion that the claim was entirely lacking in color. The court found not only that there was no evidence to support the claim, but also found that the record reflected the purpose of the two instances during the hearing when the court retired to chambers. The first instance was prior to the hearing and related to purely procedural matters and the second instance was when the court retired to chambers to\n   read decisions provided to it by counsel. It is difficult to imagine what more\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be said, once a court has found that no evidence supports the claim and that the only relevant evidence in the record expressly contradicts the claim. The court further found that the defendant was physically present to observe that lack of evidence. That finding establishes the defendant's firsthand knowledge and supports the ultimate finding that the defendant knew that his claim lacked merit and, therefore, acted in bad faith in pursuing the claim on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the defendant's second appellate claim-that the trial court, in its 2013 decision, improperly denied the motion to open without hearing testimony or taking evidence-the court found, in its 2015 decision, that, during the hearing on the motion to open, the parties had agreed that the court would first resolve the threshold legal issue of materiality and would subsequently hold an evidentiary hearing only if it concluded that the plaintiff's employment with Lexmark was a material fact. Excerpts of the transcripts of the October 24, 2012 hearing on the defendant's motion to open were attached in an appendix to the trial court's 2015 decision. During the October 24, 2012 hearing, after some initial colloquy regarding disputed facts, counsel for both parties proposed that the court decide the motion to open in two steps. As the attorney for the plaintiff explained to the court, they proposed \"a methodology [that] perhaps [would result in the court]\n   <em>\n    not having to sort through these and other important facts\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.) The parties had engaged in a series of discussions in an attempt to \"boil this down to a nut.\" As a result of those discussions, they agreed that the defendant could prevail on his motion to open the judgment only if the trial court would not have granted the plaintiff's motion for permission to relocate-and the Appellate Court would not have upheld that ruling-if\n   she had not been employed by Lexmark in Virginia. Accordingly, they both agreed that the court should first resolve the purely legal determination of whether the plaintiff's employment with Lexmark was the \"but-for\" cause underlying both the trial court's decision granting the plaintiff's motion for permission to relocate and the Appellate Court decision upholding that ruling. The trial court would proceed to the evidentiary phase only if it answered that legal question in the affirmative. The parties therefore requested that, prior to hearing any evidence, the court first review both the 2007 decision rendering final judgment of dissolution and granting permission to the plaintiff to relocate to Virginia and the Appellate Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Lederle I\n   </em>\n   that affirmed the judgment of the trial court. See\n   <em>\n    Lederle I\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708800\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/113/177/\">\n    113 Conn.

To the contrary, the court explained, the plaintiff's employment was only one among \"numerous reasons\" that the\n   2007 decision had determined that relocation was in the best interest of the minor child. The court quoted from the 2007 decision, which specifically stated that \"[n]o single factor has controlled the decision of the court\" and that the court had weighed \"all the evidence\" and considered \"all the factors relevant to the child's best interest\" in determining to grant the plaintiff permission to relocate. The 2007 decision also noted that, in granting permission to relocate, the court had considered \"the body of case law regarding best interest, the specific facts of this case, the testimony and credibility of the various witnesses here, and the court's assessment and evaluation of the best interest of this specific child. The court has considered the recommendations of both the [guardian ad litem] and the family relations counselor of sole custody to the mother and approval of the relocation.\" On the basis of its review of the Appellate Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lederle I\n   </em>\n   , the trial court also concluded that the plaintiff's employment with Lexmark was not material to that court's affirmance of the trial court's 2007 decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court's findings as to the defendant's second appellate claim are sufficiently specific to support its ultimate findings that the claim lacked any colorability, and that the defendant acted in bad faith by knowingly pursuing a claim entirely lacking in color. The essence of the defendant's claim on appeal in\n   <em>\n    Lederle II\n   </em>\n   was\n   that the court improperly decided the motion to open without taking any evidence. As to the colorability of that claim, the trial court found that the parties expressly agreed in open court to the bifurcated procedure by which the court would hear evidence only if it\n   determined that the plaintiff's employment with Lexmark was a fact that was material to both the trial court's 2007 decision and the Appellate Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lederle I\n   </em>\n   . The trial court also found that it concluded, in its 2013 decision, that the plaintiff's Lexmark employment was not material to either of those decisions. The trial court's resolution of the motion to open, therefore, rested entirely on a legal conclusion and did not require any evidence-which is precisely how the parties had agreed to proceed. Those findings support the trial court's ultimate determination in its 2013 decision that this claim lacked any indicia of color.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further found that it had clarified in open court, in the presence of the parties and their attorneys, that this procedure was in accordance with the agreement between the parties. The defendant therefore had firsthand knowledge that his appellate claim lacked any indicia of color. That finding supports the court's ultimate finding in its 2013 decision that the defendant acted in bad faith in pursuing this claim on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the foregoing\n   reasons, we conclude that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in awarding\n   attorney's fees to the plaintiff on the basis of the bad faith exception to the American rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, we address the defendant's claim that, even if the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that an award was warranted under the bad faith exception to the American rule, the amount of the award was unreasonable and excessive because (1) the plaintiff's success at the Appellate Court in\n   <em>\n    Lederle II\n   </em>\n   was not due to the efforts of plaintiff's counsel, and (2) the fees sought by the plaintiff were significantly higher than the fees charged by the defendant's attorney for his work on the appeal. We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \"[T]he amount of attorney's fees to be awarded rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion: A court has few duties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing counsel fees. The degree of delicacy increases when the matter becomes one of review on appeal. The principle of law, which is easy to state but difficult at times\n   to apply, is that only in case of a clear abuse of discretion by the trier may we interfere.... The trier is always in a more advantageous position to evaluate the services of counsel than are we.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Schoonmaker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lawrence Brunoli, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913303\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/210/#p258\">\n    265 Conn. 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258-59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20A.2d%2064\">\n    828 A.2d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"It is well established that a trial court calculating a reasonable attorney's fee makes its determination while considering the factors set forth under rule 1.5 (a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n   <em>\n    Sorrentino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    All Seasons Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"102081\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/245/756/#p775\">\n    245 Conn. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%20150\">\n    717 A.2d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ] ('[r]ule 1.5 [a] of the Rules of Professional Conduct lists the factors that ordinarily determine the reasonableness of an attorney's fee');\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gorby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200357\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/237/12/#p24\">\n    237 Conn. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20A.2d%20449\">\n    675 A.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) ('[t]ime spent is but one factor in determining the reasonableness of an attorney's fee').

The trial court began the hearing on October 30, 2013, but postponed the proceedings until the resolution\n   of the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Lederle II\n   </em>\n   . The final three days of the hearing were held in February, 2015, at which time the court heard testimony and took evidence concerning the amount of the plaintiff's attorney's fees. The court heard the testimony of the plaintiff's attorney, Norman A. Roberts II, who was questioned extensively regarding his fee affidavit as well as the attached, detailed invoices for his firm's services. Roberts claimed that his reasonable fees for the services rendered as a result of the defendant's bad faith claims\n   on appeal amounted to $61,625.90. Included in that total were fees for services rendered by two associate attorneys and a paralegal employed by the firm. Slightly less than one half of the total fees were for services rendered directly by Roberts, who asserted in the fee affidavit that he rendered 60.3 hours of service at a rate of $500 per hour, resulting in fees of $30,150.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant's examination of Roberts and testing of the fee affidavit were thorough. He questioned Roberts concerning the propriety of charging for the services of the paralegal, on the basis that some of those services could be classified as clerical. He also highlighted portions of each of the twenty attached individual invoices, probing the necessity of the time spent on various tasks. For example, with respect to the invoice dated May 31, 2013, the defendant questioned the need to charge for two attorneys, Roberts and an associate, to attend a preargument conference, resulting in a bill for more than ten hours of time. The defendant further questioned Roberts concerning the charges for services rendered in connection with the plaintiff's attempt to recover attorney's fees from the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant focused particular attention on two issues in his questioning of Roberts. First, he challenged the propriety of the plaintiff's recovering attorney's fees from him for the appeal on the basis that the Appellate Court granted the defendant's motion to strike the portions of the plaintiff's appellate brief that referenced and relied on the October 30, 2013 hearing. In closing argument to the trial court, the defendant contended that, because the Appellate Court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the basis of theories other than those advanced by Roberts, and because the court granted the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's brief, Roberts did not actually \"win\" the appeal for the plaintiff. Accordingly, the defendant argued, he should not be charged for the time that Roberts spent on the appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the defendant introduced evidence of the fees charged by the defendant's previous appellate counsel, Paul Greenan, which amounted to $9700. The trial court admitted that evidence, over the plaintiff's objection, on the ground that it was relevant to the question of the reasonableness of the plaintiff's fees. The defendant later asked Roberts why his fees were six times higher than his counsel's fees. Roberts explained that the difference was due, in part, to the different rates charged: Roberts' rate is $500 per hour, whereas the defendant's counsel charges $200 per hour. Roberts also testified that the discrepancy was due, in part, to the conduct of the defendant's counsel, which required Roberts to expend more time on the appeal than he otherwise would have. For example, Roberts testified that the defendant's counsel \"would come to court and have other business and [Roberts] was forced to stand there and wait while [the defendant's counsel] attended [to] other business ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During the course of the fee hearing, the trial court stated its view that it considered the amount that Roberts sought, approximately $61,000, to be \"way ... too much.\" At one point, the court stated that it \"had a hard time figuring out\" how it\n   was possible to justify that amount of fees in connection with the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ultimately, the court awarded the plaintiff approximately one half of what Roberts had claimed, $30,000. Although the court did not specify the particular facts on which it relied, it is evident from the record that, in awarding the plaintiff less than one half of the fees requested, the court considered Roberts' detailed testimony regarding the fee affidavit, the fee affidavit itself, the relative rates charged by Greenan and Roberts, and the challenges raised by the defendant regarding certain charges. A reasonable reading of the transcripts and the fee affidavit supports the conclusion that the trial court discounted all but the fees for the services rendered directly by Roberts himself. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in awarding the plaintiff $30,000 in attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the trial court's award of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This court granted the plaintiff's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \"Did the Appellate Court properly apply the abuse of discretion standard of review in holding that the trial court's memorandum of decision lacked 'factual findings with a high degree of specificity' when the trial court found that the defendant's claims on appeal lacked any indicia of color?\"\n    <em>\n     Lederle\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Spivey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491085,12491086\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/327/954/\">\n     327 Conn. 954\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491083,12491084,12491085,12491086\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/1050/\">\n     171 A.3d 1050\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Pursuant to the American rule, \"except as provided by statute or in certain defined exceptional circumstances, the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable [attorney's] fee from the loser.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     CFM of Connecticut, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Chowdhury\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300288\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/375/#p394\">\n     239 Conn. 375\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 393,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20A.2d%201108\">\n     685 A.2d 1108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996), overruled in part on other grounds by\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Salmon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237183\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/147/#p155\">\n     250 Conn. 147\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 155,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20333\">\n     735 A.2d 333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1999).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Although the defendant's claim is outside the scope of the certified issue, the plaintiff has had the opportunity to brief that issue.

Our conclusion that the trial court's finding that the parties agreed to the bifurcated proceeding-which resulted in the motion to open being resolved under the purely legal question-renders it unnecessary for us to consider the alternative ground for affirmance relied on by the defendant, namely, that the trial court's second subordinate finding in support of its ultimate finding of lack of colorability-that the parties entered into a stipulation of facts-was clearly erroneous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    We observe, however, that our review of the October 24, 2012 transcript suggests, to the contrary, that there was no agreement between the parties in court that they would proceed by way of stipulation in lieu of an evidentiary hearing.

In fact, the transcript of the October 24, 2012 hearing suggests that, if the trial court had concluded that the plaintiff's employment with Lexmark was material to the 2007 decision granting her permission to relocate, the court would have proceeded to an evidentiary hearing. The court expressly stated that expectation to the parties, and neither party contradicted the court. Moreover, during the course of the hearing, the parties identified various issues that remained contested, including credibility issues, the date when the plaintiff learned that she no longer had a job with Lexmark, and whether she had left that position voluntarily. Because, however, it is clear from the record that the parties agreed to the bifurcated proceeding, it is immaterial that the record does not support the court's finding that the parties entered into a stipulation of facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    We reject the defendant's suggestion that we should not accord deference to the trial court's decision because the fees incurred were in connection with proceedings before the Appellate Court.
