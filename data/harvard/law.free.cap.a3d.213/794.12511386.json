He had worked for many years for the Huntingtown Volunteer Fire Department (\"Huntingtown\"), an appellee, as a volunteer firefighter. He had filed a claim with the Workers' Compensation Commission (\"the Commission\") against Huntingtown and two of its insurers, Chesapeake Employers Insurance Company (\"Chesapeake\") and Selective Insurance Company of America (\"Selective\"), also appellees, on the ground that his heart disease and hypertension were an occupational disease. That claim was settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The appellant in this case is Peggy Collins, Mr. Collins's widow. After her husband's death, she filed a claim in the Commission against the appellees for death benefits, alleging that his death resulted from his occupational disease. The Commission ruled that Mrs. Collins's claim was barred by the release of claims Mr. Collins had given in settling his own claim. In the Circuit Court for Calvert County, Mrs. Collins petitioned for judicial review of that decision. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed and, after a hearing, the circuit court agreed with the Commission and granted summary judgment in favor of Huntingtown and the insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mrs. Collins noted this appeal, posing one question, which we have rephrased as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Did the release in the settlement agreement between Mr. Collins, Huntingtown, Chesapeake, and Selective operate to bar Mrs. Collins's claim for death benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the following reasons, we hold that the release did not bar Mrs. Collins's claim for death benefits. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court with instructions\n   to enter summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Collins and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The pertinent facts are undisputed. On February 13, 2012, Mr. Collins, then age 67,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a workers' compensation claim with the Commission, alleging that he had developed heart disease and hypertension caused by his firefighting work for Huntingtown. The Maryland Workers' Compensation Act (\"the Act\") creates a presumption of compensability for firefighters who develop heart disease and hypertension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2011 Supp.), \u00a7 9-503(a) of the Labor and Employment Article (\"LE\"). Mr. Collins claimed that as of May 6, 2011, when Huntingtown was insured by Chesapeake, he became disabled due to his occupational disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Huntingtown and Chesapeake contested the claim. Chesapeake disputed the May 6, 2011 date of disablement, contending the correct date was December 12, 1998, when Mr. Collins underwent surgery for an aortic dissection. It successfully interpleaded Selective, which insured Huntingtown in 1998.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 19, 2014, following an evidentiary hearing, the Commission found that Mr. Collins had sustained an occupational disease (heart disease and hypertension ), arising out of and in the course of his employment as a firefighter; that his last injurious exposure was with Huntingtown; and that he was temporarily totally disabled as of May 6, 2011, for one day, and from July 7, 2011 through July 24, 2011. Later, the Commission found that Mr. Collins's average weekly wage was $152.50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the Circuit Court for Calvert County, Huntingtown and Chesapeake filed petitions for judicial review of the Commission's decision. They both contested compensability generally and Chesapeake contested the Commission's finding that the date of last injurious exposure occurred in 2011. In a cross-petition, Mr. Collins disputed the calculation of his average weekly wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While the petitions were pending, Mr. Collins and the appellees agreed to settle the claim and filed a stipulation of dismissal in the circuit court, which on March 13, 2015, dismissed the case and remanded the matter to the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 14, 2015, Mr. Collins entered into an \"Agreement of Final Compromise and Settlement\" (\"the Agreement\") with Huntingtown, as employer, Chesapeake, as the insurer for Huntingtown, and Selective, as the \"alleged insurer\" of Huntingtown. After reciting the procedural background of Mr. Collins's claim, the Agreement provided that, as part of the settlement, the parties agreed that Mr. Collins's average weekly wage as of his date of disablement was $526.87; that Selective would pay him the lump sum of $100,000; and that Chesapeake would pay him the lump sum of $50,000 and fund a \"Medicare Set Aside\" annuity in the total amount of $47,192. The annuity would be funded with an initial lump sum payment of $9,438.08, followed by annual payments of $4,194.88 for nine years during Mr. Collins's lifetime. Huntingtown and Chesapeake further agreed to pay Mr. Collins's \"causally related medical expenses\" for \"up to 45 days after the date [the Agreement was approved by the Commission], or until the initial [payment funding the Medicare Set-Aside was made], whichever date [came] first[.]\" Mr. Collins otherwise released Huntingtown, Chesapeake, and Selective from any responsibility for medical expenses incurred beyond 45-days from the date the Agreement was approved by the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At Paragraph 11 of the Agreement, Mr. Collins, as \"the Claimant,\" agreed to the following language of release (\"the Release\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Claimant hereby accepts this Agreement and the aforesaid payment(s) in final compromise and settlement of any and all Claims which the Claimant, his personal representative, dependents, spouse and children or any other parties who might become beneficiaries under the Workers' Compensation Law, might now or could hereafter have under the provision of the said Law, arising out of the aforesaid injury or disablement or the disability resulting therefrom, and\n   does hereby, on behalf of himself and all of said other parties, release and forever discharge the Employer [Huntingtown], Chesapeake and Selective, their personal representative, heirs, successors and assigns, from all other claims of whatsoever kind which might or could hereafter arise under the Law from the said injury, disablement or disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Agreement was signed by Mr. Collins, his attorney, and representatives of Huntingtown, Chesapeake, and Selective. It was filed with the Commission on May 19, 2015, along with a \"Settlement Worksheet,\" a \"Claimant's Affidavit in Support of Settlement,\" a \"Medicare Set-Aside Allocation Recommendation\" prepared by a third-party firm, a letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approving the Medicare Set-Aside, and copies of medical bills for treatment Mr. Collins already had received. In the \"Claimant's Affidavit,\" which must be submitted with a settlement agreement, Mr. Collins asked the Commission \"to approve the settlement of [his] claim\" and stated that he was \"voluntarily settling [his] claim.\" He acknowledged that by doing so, he was giving up the right to future hearings before the Commission; to \"vocational rehabilitation services and to payment during [his] lifetime for any medical treatment related to [his] claim, except as provided [in the Agreement]\"; to compensation from the Subsequent Injury Fund, except as provided in the Agreement; to seek to reopen his claim if his condition worsened; and to appeal to the circuit court, this Court, or the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 4, 2015, the Commission approved the Agreement pursuant to LE section 9-722.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Just over two years later, Mr. Collins died from a cardiac arrest secondary to his heart disease and hypertension. On July 11, 2017, Mrs. Collins filed a \"Dependent's Claim for Death Benefits\" with the Commission, pursuant to LE sections 9-683.1 through 9-683.5. On the claim form, she gave May 6, 2011 as Mr. Collins's \"Date of Injury\" and $1,800 as his average weekly wage. She sought dependency benefits and reimbursement for Mr. Collins's funeral expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Commission held a hearing on Mrs. Collins's claim on September 7, 2017. The issues in dispute were whether the Release barred Mrs. Collins from receiving death benefits; Mr. Collins's date of disablement; his average weekly wage; and whether Mrs. Collins was partially or wholly dependent upon Mr. Collins when he became disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By order of September 25, 2017, the Commission ruled that due to the Release, Mrs. Collins had \"no[ ] right to survivorship/death benefits[,]\" and denied the claim without reaching the other issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the Circuit Court for Calvert County, Mrs. Collins filed a timely petition for judicial review and prayed a jury trial. Huntingtown and Chesapeake opposed the petition and moved for summary judgment on the issue of release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. Collins opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 1, 2018, after a hearing on the motions, the circuit court entered an opinion and order determining that the Release barred Mrs. Collins's claim, and granted summary judgment in favor of Huntingtown and Chesapeake. It subsequently entered an order clarifying that judgment also was granted in favor of Selective. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As in any \"typical administrative agency appeal ... we ... look through the circuit court judgment to review the decision of the Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Stine v.

Gilbert, Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., et al.,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Workers' Compensation Handbook\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.01 (4th ed. 2013 &amp; 2018 Supp.) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   \"). As we shall discuss below, if a \"worker dies\n   <em>\n    as a result of\n   </em>\n   an accidental injury or occupational disease, the death is a separate compensable event\" and any dependents \"are entitled to recover, as of the date of death, the death benefits.\" Theodore B. Cornblatt, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Workers' Compensation Manual\n   </em>\n   29 (18th ed. 2017) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Subtitle 6 of the Act, governing \"Benefits,\" is divided into thirteen parts. Parts II through V establish categories of disability compensation benefits for the injured worker: temporary partial disability (Part II); temporary total disability (Part III); permanent partial disability (Part IV); and permanent total disability (Part V).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-614 - 9-640 ;\n   <em>\n    Gilbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   \u00a7 9.03. Parts IV and V each include a \"Survival of compensation\" provision. Those provisions state that if a worker dies of a cause\n   <em>\n    unrelated\n   </em>\n   to his workplace injury or disease when permanent disability benefits awarded still remain payable, the right to those benefits \"survives to the surviving dependents\" of the worker. LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-632 &amp; 9-640.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Part IX governs medical benefits, which, unlike most disability benefits, are not time-limited and have no maximum cap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-660 - 9-664 ;\n   <em>\n    see also Gilbert\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.01[2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Part XII governs death benefits. As pertinent, it provides that if there are \"individuals who were dependent on a deceased\n   covered employee at the time of death resulting from an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, the employer or its insurer shall pay death benefits ....\" LE \u00a7 9-683.3(b). The amount of the death benefits payable to the dependents of a deceased worker is calculated based upon the average weekly wage of the worker as of the date of the accidental injury or, in the case of an occupational disease, the date of the last injurious exposure, as a percentage of the family income of the worker's dependents. LE \u00a7 9-683(c). Benefits \"shall be paid for a minimum of 5 years after the covered employee's death\" and, if that minimum has been met, otherwise terminate on what would have been the deceased worker's 70th birthday, unless certain exceptions are met. LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-683(d) &amp; (e). Finally, Part XIII requires an employer or its insurer to pay \"reasonable funeral expenses of a deceased covered employee\" not to exceed $7,000 if the employee died as a result of an accidental injury (within 7 years) or from an occupational disease. LE \u00a7 9-689.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Subtitle 7 of the Act sets forth the procedures for filing and adjudicating claims. Two provisions are pertinent to this appeal. Under LE section 9-711(a)(1), a dependent of a deceased covered worker is the appropriate claimant in an application for death benefits.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   COMAR 14.09.01.01B(3) (\" 'Claimant' means a person filing a workers' compensation claim and includes: ...

There, the Court of Appeals considered whether the Commission (then known as the State Industrial Accident Commission) erred in calculating the death benefits payable to the widow of a\n   covered worker. The worker suffered an accidental injury and had received temporary total disability compensation. He later died from his injury, and his widow filed a claim for death benefits. The worker's employer acknowledged that the widow was entitled to death benefits but argued that the amount of her benefits should be reduced by the amount of temporary total disability benefits paid to her husband during his lifetime. The Commission rejected that argument and awarded the widow full death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Relying upon the plain language of the statutes governing disability and death benefits under the Act, the Court of Appeals upheld the Commission's decision.

First, relying upon the cases discussed above, she argues that, under the Act, a dependent's claim for death benefits is independent and not derivative of the worker's claim for compensation benefits, and, consequently, the worker may not contract away the dependent's death benefits claim. Accordingly, Mr. Collins did not have the power to release her death benefits claim in his case. Second, because she was not a signatory to the Agreement, and indeed\n   was not a party to her husband's case, the Release in the Agreement did not and could not have had the effect of barring her from bringing a claim for death benefits. Finally, even if Mr. Collins could have released her death\n   benefits claim, the language of the Release did not evidence an intent on his part to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Huntingtown, Chesapeake, and Selective respond that the language of the Release is clear and unambiguous and plainly bars Mrs. Collins's death benefits claim because it releases liability for \"all other claims of whatsoever kind which might or\n   <em>\n    could hereafter\n   </em>\n   arise\" from Mr. Collins's occupational disease. (Emphasis added.) They maintain that a claim for death benefits is wholly derivative of the worker's claim for disability because it arises from the worker's compensable work-related injury or disease; therefore, it is barred by the plain language of the Release. Furthermore, they argue that because LE section 9-722(a) permits a \"covered employee\n   <em>\n    or dependents\n   </em>\n   \" to \"enter into an agreement for the final compromise and settlement of any current\n   <em>\n    or future claim\n   </em>\n   ,\" Mr. Collins was statutorily authorized to compromise Mrs. Collins's potential future death benefits claim and to bind her to the terms of the Agreement, even though she was not a signatory.

The latter class of benefits arises from a compensable injury or disease suffered by a worker during his lifetime but is not derivative of the injured worker's claim for benefits. Rather, a claim for death benefits is distinct from a claim for benefits by a worker during his life. It is brought on behalf of the dependent as claimant and the amount of benefits awarded is calculated based upon the degree of dependency, not based upon the extent of the injury or the length of time that the covered worker was disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When a covered worker suffers a compensable accidental injury or develops an occupational disease, his dependents' entitlement to death benefits is inchoate, as it is not certain ever to accrue. If the injured worker dies of a cause unrelated to the workplace injury or disease, the potential claim for death benefits is extinguished,\n   although a dependent of the worker may be entitled to unpaid disability benefits under the survival provisions of the Act. (Likewise, a dependent of the worker may die before the worker dies). If the worker dies from the compensable injury or disease and leaves a dependent, however, the death benefits claim becomes choate. In that situation, the employer or insurer \"shall pay death benefits\" upon a showing of total or partial dependency at the time of the accidental injury or last injurious exposure. LE \u00a7 9-683.3(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although the law is well settled as to the separate and distinct nature of compensation and death benefits, there are no Maryland appellate cases that have addressed the issue in\n   this case: whether a worker who settles his claim during his lifetime may unilaterally on behalf of his dependents release their independent contingent right to claim death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To answer this question, we begin with LE section 9-722, the \"Claim settlement\" provision of the Act, and the regulations promulgated under it. LE section 9-722(a) states that \"\n   <em>\n    after a claim has been filed\n   </em>\n   by a covered employee\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the dependents of a covered employee,\" a worker\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   his dependents may \"enter into an agreement for the final compromise and settlement of any current or future claim under [the Act.]\" (Emphasis added.) If approved by the Commission, that agreement \"is binding on all of the parties to the agreement.\" LE \u00a7 9-722(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   COMAR 14.09.10.02, governing \"Agreements for Final Compromise and Settlement[,]\" sets out at Section A the terms and conditions that must be included in any settlement agreement filed with the Commission. These include the total settlement amount, the date payment will commence, any past compensation paid, the worker's average weekly wage, and the date of disablement. Section A requires that the \"Settlement Worksheet\" form be completed and attached to the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   COMAR 14.09.10.02A.(13). Section B pertains to future medical expenses and governs Medicare set-aside agreements. Section C governs \"Special Requirements\" and, as pertinent, at subsection C(2), addresses \"Dependency Claims.\" Under that provision, \"[w]hen the settlement arises in connection with a claim involving a surviving dependent, the agreement submitted to the Commission for approval, in addition to complying with \u00a7\u00a7 A and B, shall contain\" certain enumerated information and attachments, including a death certificate and, \"if the claimant is a surviving spouse, a marriage certificate.\" The language of this regulation thus presumes that a settlement of a dependent's claim for death benefits will arise in the\n   context of a claim brought by the dependent after the worker's death, not in the context of the worker's claim for disability benefits during his lifetime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We read LE section 9-722, together with the regulation, to mean that after a worker files a claim for disability, medical, and vocational rehabilitation benefits, he may enter into an agreement to settle that claim, subject to approval by the Commission. In doing so, the worker may settle\n   <em>\n    his own\n   </em>\n   future claims arising from a worsening of his condition\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   may extinguish a potential claim by a surviving dependent under the \"Survival of compensation\" provisions of the Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   LE sections 9-632 and 9-640, by which the dependent \"take[s] under [the worker].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Cline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2246779\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/13/337/\">\n    13 Md.

Likewise, after a dependent of a deceased covered worker files a claim for death benefits, he may settle that claim with the deceased worker's employer or insurer.

No such language or ambiguity appears in the death benefits provisions of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It was the ambiguous language of the Wrongful Death Act that undergirded the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Melitch\n   </em>\n   that an injured party's agreement, in exchange for \"a valuable consideration,\" to release a defendant \"from all and every claim and demand which he might or could possibly have for or on account of his injuries[,]\" barred his widow from suing for his wrongful death after he died as a result of that injury.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2119829\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/121/457/\">\n    121 Md. at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.%20229\">\n    88 A. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After examining cases from other jurisdictions interpreting the same or similar statutory language, the\n   <em>\n    Melitch\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned \"that liability of the wrongdoer exists where the deceased could have recovered if death had not ensued[ ]\" which \"clearly exclude[d] the idea that where the decedent receives satisfaction for his injuries, the condition requisite to the right of surviving relatives may exist notwithstanding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.%20229\">\n    88 A. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court thus held that because the husband's release of his claim would have \"precluded him from recovering 'if death had not ensued,' \" that release likewise barred the widow's claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.%20229\">\n    88 A. 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The same result does not follow under the Workers' Compensation Act. The Wrongful Death Act creates a cause of action in favor of certain surviving relatives of a deceased person. The Workers' Compensation Act establishes a statutory\n   entitlement to benefits in favor of the dependents of a covered worker. If the statutory criteria are met, the benefits \"shall be paid.\" LE \u00a7 9-683.3 The language of LE section 9-683.3 is unambiguous and does not make the liability of an employer or insurer to pay death benefits to dependents of a covered worker who dies from a compensable injury contingent upon the covered worker having not released his separate claim for disability benefits during his lifetime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Even if Mr. Collins could have unilaterally released Mrs. Collins's claim for death benefits, which we have held he could not, the language of the Release does not evince a clear intent on his part to do so. \"Releases are contractual, and they are therefore governed by ordinary contract principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Chicago Title Ins.

He agrees, in consideration for the payment of $150,000 and the Medicare Set-Aside annuity, to a \"final compromise and settlement of any and all Claims which [he], his personal representative, dependents, spouse and children or any other parties who might become beneficiaries under [the Act] might now or could hereafter have under the [Act], arising out of [his heart disease and hypertension ] or the disability resulting therefrom[.]\" He further agrees, \"on behalf of himself and all of said other parties, [to] release and forever discharge the Employer, Chesapeake and Selective ..., from all other claims of whatsoever kind which might or could hereafter arise under Law from the said injury, disablement or disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Notably missing from the language of the Release is any mention of death resulting from Mr. Collins's covered injury or any future claim for death benefits under the Act. Although Mr. Collins purports to release future claims that could \"arise\" from his occupational disease, as we have discussed, a claim for death benefits accrues and arises from a covered worker's\n   <em>\n    death from the disease (or injury)\n   </em>\n   , not from the disease (or injury) itself. Given Mr. Collins's age and medical condition, the possibility that he would die from the heart disease and hypertension he was presumed to have contracted from his work as a firefighter would have been evident to the parties to his workers' compensation case. The failure to specify that claims accruing if Mr. Collins were to die because of his compensable occupational disease were being released by him\n   on behalf of his dependents evinces that the parties did not intend the Release to extend to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For all these reasons, the Commission and the circuit court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the Release barred Mrs. Collins from recovering death benefits under the Act. Accordingly, we shall reverse the circuit court's summary judgment in favor of the appellees and remand this case to the circuit court to enter summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Collins and to remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, on her claim for death benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE APPELLANT AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION COMMISSION FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
