In the underlying action, the plaintiff brought a two count complaint in which she claimed a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.,\n   and fraudulent misrepresentation related to the defendant's failure to refund the plaintiff's $2500 deposit for an attempted sale of a used vehicle. The trial court found in favor of the plaintiff on both counts, and this court affirmed the judgment on appeal.

The court previously found the defendant liable under CUTPA and common-law fraud for misleading the plaintiff about the refund-ability of a $2500 deposit on a used car. (# 132.)

The defendant now argues that it would be unduly punitive to award\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   additional fees for the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court disagrees. CUTPA's attorney's fee provision is intended to enable private parties to obtain counsel to enforce\n   the statutory prohibition on unfair trade practices. That purpose could be thwarted if fees are not awarded for the successful defense of a CUTPA judgment on appeal. In consumer cases under CUTPA, there is often an imbalance of resources between the consumer plaintiff and the business defendant. If statutory fees were not available to such a plaintiff for an appeal, the defendant could exhaust the plaintiff's resources and force the plaintiff to abandon or severely compromise a meritorious claim. The court will therefore award reasonable supplemental attorney's fees for the appeal and for this fee proceeding.\n   The plaintiff was represented at trial by Daniel S. Blinn and on appeal by Blinn and Richard F. Wareing. In an affidavit, Blinn attested that he does not handle appellate work on a regular basis, and his two lawyer office lacks the resources to handle all the appeals arising from judgments obtained against this defendant. Blinn therefore recommended that the plaintiff engage Wareing, an experienced appellate advocate with whom Blinn had previously worked, as cocounsel with primary responsibility for the appeal. Wareing agreed that he would be paid for his services only if the plaintiff prevailed on appeal and that his fees would be limited to the amount, if any, awarded by the court after the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Both Blinn and Wareing submitted affidavits and billing records in support of the motion for supplemental attorney's fees. At the initial hearing on the motion, the defendant did not object to the court's consideration of Blinn's affidavit and billing record but did object to Wareing's affidavit as hearsay. The court subsequently held a hearing at which Wareing testified and was subjected to cross-examination. His billing record was submitted as an exhibit at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the defendant does not argue that the plaintiff unreasonably engaged appellate counsel, the defendant does challenge the amount requested. More specifically, it argues that (1) Wareing's requested hourly rate is too high, (2) the amount requested is excessive and unreasonable in light of the actual damages of $10,000, (3) the plaintiff should not receive attorney's fees for her opposition to the petition for certification, and (4) some of the billing entries are questionable. Before deciding these specific claims, the court addresses the standard that applies to awards of attorney's fees under CUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[T]he initial estimate of a reasonable attorney's fee is properly calculated by multiplying the number of\n   hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Carrillo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767662\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/141/299/#p317\">\n    141 Conn.

The court also takes judicial notice of the appellate pleadings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This includes motions, briefs, appendices, and the petition for certification and opposition thereto, which this court has fully reviewed to determine the reasonableness of the time expended in discrete tasks. The court also considers its own knowledge of appellate practice and procedure and fees customarily charged in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The first step in determining reasonable attorney's fees is deciding upon a reasonable hourly rate for the lawyers involved. Blinn requests an hourly rate of $375, the rate the court previously approved for his work. The defendant does not challenge this rate. The court finds that $375 is an appropriate hourly rate for Blinn, an experienced and skillful consumer advocate, for the reasons stated in the court's decision of March 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Wareing also requests an hourly rate of $375. If the only factors to be considered were his skill, experience, and reputation, that rate would be warranted. He has considerable appellate experience and is respected as\n   an appellate lawyer, reflected in the fact that he has served on the faculty of the Connecticut Bar Association's Appellate Advocacy Institute. The hourly rate of $375 is within the range customarily charged by attorneys in Connecticut and is what Wareing charged at a previous firm, which he left in 2013. But Wareing testified that his usual hourly rate now is $225 to $275, depending on the nature of the matter and the relationship with the client. He explained, on cross-examination, that he and his current partners made a business decision to charge fees that were lower than rates they had previously charged at another firm. Their purpose in doing so was to avoid disputes with clients over fees, to avoid having to write off time to satisfy clients, and to avoid having to \"chase\" clients for fees. He\n   testified that with the lower rates, his firm now requires a substantial retainer, and most clients pay their bills within thirty to sixty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   From Wareing's testimony, the court infers that although higher hourly rates may be charged in the marketplace, such higher hourly rates also lead to disputes with clients about bills and result in some bills being reduced to maintain client relationships. The court concludes that the fees Wareing currently charges to clients-from $225 to $275 an hour-represent a reasonable range of hourly rates for his services in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff argues that Wareing should receive $375 per hour because his fee in this case was both contingent and likely to be delayed. In Wareing's usual practice, at the lower rates he now charges, his fees are generally fixed, not contingent, and he requires both a substantial retainer and prompt payment. In this case, he agreed that he would look solely to an award of statutory attorney's fees. In so doing, he assumed the risk of losing on appeal, the risk of the court denying or reducing his requested fees, and the risk that any\n   fees awarded might be long delayed. The court agrees that the contingent nature of his fees and the delay in recovering them warrant consideration, but it is not persuaded that those factors justify an hourly rate that is $100 to $150 more than the rate he charges to paying clients. In light of Wareing's testimony and the court's own knowledge of the wide range of reasonable rates and billing arrangements in this marketplace, the court concludes that an hourly rate of $275, which is at the upper end of Wareing's current rates, is a reasonable rate for his work on the appeal in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Both Blinn and Wareing have paralegals who performed some tasks related to the appeal. The plaintiff is requesting the rate of $125 per hour for Blinn's paralegal, Lori Miner, the rate of $100 per hour for Wareing's paralegal, Josephine Salafia, who has twenty years experience as a litigation paralegal, and the rate of $40 per hour for Traci Parent, a legal assistant at Wareing's firm since September, 2014. The court finds these rates to be reasonable based on Blinn's affidavit, Wareing's testimony, and the court's own knowledge of fees customarily charged for paralegals and legal assistants. The defendant has not contested the rates sought for these individuals, but has contended that some of their time was not reasonably billed. The court will address those issues in relation to the various tasks challenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court next examines the time reasonably spent on the appeal. The defendant does not challenge any of the time entries by Blinn. Blinn exercised billing judgment to delete charges for duplicative services, such as his attendance at oral argument. The charges he did request are for tasks that were reasonable. He attended the preargument conference, kept the plaintiff apprised of the status of the appeal, consulted with Wareing briefly as issues arose during the appeal, reviewed Wareing's drafts of motions, the brief, and\n   objections, mooted Wareing for oral argument, and prepared and presented the pending attorney's fee motion. Based on his fee affidavit and time records, the court concludes that Blinn reasonably spent 24.5 hours on the appeal and the fee motion. In addition, according to Wareing's testimony, both Wareing and Blinn spent five hours preparing for and attending the evidentiary fee hearing on April 13, 2018. The court finds that the lodestar for Blinn's attorney's fees is $11,062.50, based on 29.5 hours at $375 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendant argues that the time spent by Wareing in motion practice, in\n   preparing the brief, and in preparing for argument was excessive. Wareing's billing record indicates that he spent eleven hours on motions and objections related to the defendant's failure to file its brief on time, 7.5 hours reviewing the trial court record, including the transcript and the court's decisions, 86.3 hours in legal research and writing the appellate brief, 22.8 hours preparing for and attending oral argument, 15.7 hours responding to the defendant's petition for certification, and 2.8 hours preparing his fee affidavit. In addition, he spent five hours preparing for and attending the hearing on this fee motion. His total time spent on the appeal and fee motion equaled 151.1 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The time spent on the appellate motion practice requires some context. The defendant's brief was due on April 20, 2016. On that date, the defendant's attorney moved for an extension of seven days, to April 27, 2016, which was granted. That deadline came and went. The plaintiff's attorneys noted that the defendant's brief had not been filed. On July 7, 2016, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal for failure to file a timely brief. In response, the defendant's counsel filed two improper motions to extend time, which were summarily denied by the appellate clerk, and subsequently filed the proper\n   motion, a motion for leave to file a late brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's attorneys objected to the motion. The court issued a nisi order, stating that the appeal would be dismissed if the defendant's brief was not filed by August 2, 2016. On August 2, 2016, the defendant filed a brief and appendix that was rejected by the appellate clerk for failure to number the pages of the appendix and failure to include a judgment file. The defendant then filed a motion for extension of time to file a corrected brief. The appellate clerk issued a second nisi order, stating that the appeal would be dismissed unless a complying appellant's brief and appendix were filed by August 17, 2016. The defendant filed a complying brief and appendix on August 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Each of the defendant's failures to comply with court rules and deadlines required the plaintiff's attorneys to consider the defendant's procedural misstep and decide whether and how to respond to it. The plaintiff's judgment was automatically stayed by Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (a), and she could not enforce the judgment until the appeal was concluded. The plaintiff's attorneys reasonably moved to dismiss the appeal when the defendant's brief was more than two months late. Each motion subsequently filed by the defendant in an attempt to cure previous defects required the plaintiff's attorneys to read the motion and consider whether to object. The plaintiff's attorneys reasonably decided to object to the defendant's motion to file a late brief to rebut the defendant's assertion, in that motion, that the lapse was caused by a departing associate who had\n   failed to calendar the deadline correctly. As the plaintiff pointed out in the objection, the defendant's lead attorney had himself signed the motion for extension of time that requested the April 27 due date. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant's excuse represented gross negligence, not good cause for relief, because the defendant\n   had offered the same excuse for missed deadlines in at least five other cases in 2016. Although ultimately unsuccessful, these were not frivolous arguments, and they had the effect of moving the appeal forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In total, Wareing spent eleven hours drafting the various motions and objections related to the defendant's failure to file a timely brief. For the objection to the motion to file a late brief, Blinn's paralegal, Miner, also spent an hour on a footnote that documented the five other recent cases in which the defendant had attributed a missed deadline to a departing associate's failure to calendar matters properly. The motion to dismiss is only two pages long and is not complicated. Similarly, the objection to the motion to file a late brief is only three pages long, and the footnote described above is a substantial portion of it. The court will reduce Wareing's time on this motion practice from eleven hours to four hours and Miner's time from one hour to a half hour for drafting the footnote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The time Wareing spent reviewing the trial court record was reasonable, and the defendant does not argue otherwise. The defendant does argue that the time spent drafting the brief was unreasonable, claiming that no one would reasonably spend the time Wareing spent on the brief for a case with damages of only $10,000. The court credits Wareing's testimony to the contrary. He testified that some of his commercial clients are willing to spend substantial sums on appeals, even when the amount of money at issue is small, if the legal principle at issue is important to them. The court further observes that the defendant in this case\n   was willing to incur its own attorney's fees and to risk that it would be required to pay the plaintiff's attorneys as well, even though the amount at issue when the defendant filed its appeal was only $10,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Wareing credibly testified that the time required to research and draft the appellate brief was driven largely by the fact that the defendant raised eight issues on appeal and claimed that there was \"no evidence\" to support the trial court's findings. Wareing had to analyze each of those eight issues, determine the appropriate standard of appellate review, research the relevant law, review the trial record to marshal the evidence that supported the court's findings, and provide a legal analysis of each issue. As Wareing testified, \"the more arguments an appellant makes, the more work the appellee has to do to swat back those arguments.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, our appellate courts frequently remind appellate litigators that \"[w]riting a compelling legal argument is a painstaking, time-consuming task. Good legal analysis is premised on knowing the controlling\n   rules of law. An effective appellate advocate must apply the rules of law to the facts at hand by applying or distinguishing existing legal precedent .... To write\n   a good brief and to comply with the rules of practice, counsel must state the rules of law, [and] provide citations to legal authority that support the claims made ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Buhl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485082\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/868/#p729\">\n    321 Conn. 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485082\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/868/#p729\">\n    138 A.3d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yale-New Haven Hospital, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496960\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/185/665/#p212\">\n    181 Conn.

It was not inherently excessive to spend 86.3 hours performing the \"painstaking, time-consuming task\" of writing persuasive arguments for the eight appellate issues raised by the defendant. It averaged only 10.8 hours per issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the court does not find the time claimed by Wareing to be inherently excessive, there is nevertheless a discrepancy between Wareing's testimony and his time records. Wareing testified that he spent \"just north of\" two hours per page in drafting the brief. Including the counterstatement of the issues and the body of the brief, the brief was just over thirty-four pages. Based on Wareing's testimony, writing the brief would require slightly more than sixty-eight hours, but Wareing's billing records indicate that he actually spent 86.3 hours working on the brief. On cross-examination, he was asked if he would be surprised if his records showed that he spent 100 hours on the brief, and he said that he would be very surprised. The court infers from Wareing's testimony that the time spent on the brief was somewhat greater than he remembered and somewhat greater than he would ordinarily expect to spend. The court further notes that some of his time entries are vague. Taking into account these facts, the court finds that Wareing reasonably spent eighty hours preparing the brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Oral argument in the appeal was originally scheduled for March 20, 2017. Between March 10 and March 17, Wareing reasonably spent about ten hours preparing for oral argument, including time spent with Blinn in\n   mooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two unforeseen circumstances then increased the time attributed to oral argument. First, the Appellate Court issued an order directing the parties to be prepared to address whether the court should dismiss the portion of the appeal challenging the award of attorney's fees because the plaintiff had not amended his appeal, which was filed before the attorney's fee decision was issued by this court, to include an appeal of the attorney's fee decision. This was an issue that all counsel in the case had overlooked, and Wareing spent about three hours on March 19 preparing to address it. Then, on March 20, 2017, while the parties were waiting to present their arguments, the Appellate Court's recording system malfunctioned. The attorneys had to wait while attempts were made to get it working, but eventually the argument was rescheduled for March 28, 2017. Wareing spent 2.7 hours on March 27, refreshing his preparation, and 3.6 hours on March 28, reviewing his notes, attending court, and presenting his argument. The defendant\n   has objected to the time spent on March 27 and 28, claiming that Wareing unreasonably spent an additional 6.3 hours preparing for an argument that he had been prepared to give a week earlier. The court disagrees. The time spent on March 27 to refresh his preparation was reasonable, and the time spent on March 28 was primarily spent attending court, waiting for the case to be called, and presenting the argument. In the circumstances of this case, where an additional issue was raised by the court and where the argument had to be rescheduled through no fault of\n   any party, the time spent preparing for oral argument was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After the Appellate Court issued its decision, affirming the judgment on the merits and dismissing the appeal as to the attorney's fee issue, the defendant filed a petition for certification to the Supreme Court. Wareing spent 15.7 hours preparing an opposition to the petition. The defendant did not challenge the amount of time spent opposing the petition, but it argued that time spent on the petition could not properly be considered because the Supreme Court had not decided the petition when the plaintiff filed the motion for supplemental fees. That argument is unavailing now because the Supreme Court denied certification while the fee motion was pending. The court finds that the time spent drafting the opposition to the petition was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Wareing spent 2.8 hours preparing his fee affidavit. In addition, he spent five hours on April 13, 2018, preparing for and attending the hearing on the fee motion. The defendant has not challenged that time, and the court finds that it was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Adding up all the components of the appellate process, the court finds that Wareing reasonably expended 137.8 hours in defending the judgment on appeal and pursuing this motion. The lodestar for Wareing is calculated to be $37,895.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Paralegals in Blinn's office and in Wareing's office assisted in posttrial work, including the appeal and the fee motion. Blinn's paralegal, Miner, drafted a bill of costs, part of the objection to the motion for leave to file a late brief, and portions of the fee motion. Such tasks are reasonably done by a paralegal. After excluding a half hour for the footnote, the court finds that Miner reasonably spent 4.5 hours on tasks requiring a paralegal's experience and knowledge. Her lodestar figure is $562.50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Wareing claims $200 in fees for two hours spent by his paralegal, Salafia, who retrieved and analyzed pleadings filed in the Appellate Court and drafted correspondence to the court regarding oral argument dates. The defendant has not challenged any of Salafia's time. The court finds that Salafia's lodestar is $200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wareing also claims $260 for 6.5 hours spent by his legal assistant, Traci Parent, in preparing the appellee's appendix. The defendant challenges this time as spent on ministerial tasks. The court disagrees. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 67-2, 67-4, 67-5 and 67-8 prescribe specific standards for the format and contents of an appendix. Failure to follow the rules can result in rejection of the appendix.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Practice Book \u00a7 67-8 (c), the appellee is required to analyze the appellant's appendix and to provide any required documents that the appellant has omitted from its appendix. The appellee may also include \"any other portions of the proceedings below that the appellee deems\n   necessary for the proper presentation of the issues on appeal.\" Practice Book \u00a7 67-8 (c). Wareing testified that the defendant's appendix did not include any of the transcripts and other portions of the record that Wareing deemed necessary to counter the defendant's argument that no evidence supported the trial court's judgment. However, Practice Book \u00a7 67-8 (b) (2) cautions that \"[t]o reproduce a full transcript or lengthy exhibit when an excerpt would suffice is a misuse of an appendix.\" The preparation of an appendix thus requires the exercise of judgment to include enough, but not too much, of the trial court record. It is not unreasonable to assign the task of preparing the appendix to a legal assistant working under the supervision and review of the appellate attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court finds that Parent's lodestar is $260.\n   Combining the lodestars for all the timekeepers, the total lodestar for the appeal and this fee motion is $49,980. The court now considers the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steiger\n   </em>\n   factors to determine whether that lodestar should be adjusted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court has already addressed, in its analysis of the reasonable lodestar, several of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steiger\n   </em>\n   factors, including the time and labor required, the customary fee for similar work in the community, whether the fee is fixed or contingent, and the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys. No adjustment is required because these factors are subsumed within the lodestar. See\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eckerhart\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/\">\n    461 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   434 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to the novelty or difficulty of the questions, Wareing testified that the appeal was \"medium\" in complexity. The defendant argues that the court previously found that the issues presented at trial were not novel or difficult, arguing that the appeal is no more complicated than the trial. Wareing testified, however, that the appeal presented challenges both because of the number of issues presented and because of inconsistencies in the defendant's appellate arguments that he had to address. No lodestar adjustment is needed for an appeal of average complexity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As to the skill required to perform the legal service properly, the court finds that appellate practice requires knowledge of and attention to appellate rules and procedure in addition to knowledge of the substantive areas of law involved. Blinn appropriately sought to cocounsel with Wareing because Wareing had more extensive appellate experience than Blinn and because appeals are time-consuming endeavors. No adjustment is needed for this factor because it, too, is subsumed within the lodestar analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   There was little evidence on the preclusion of other employment, other than the obvious fact that there are only so many hours in a day and time spent on one client's case is time not spent on other clients' cases. Nor was there evidence of any time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances. As to the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, there was no evidence that Blinn had represented the plaintiff in other cases. Wareing testified that he had never met the plaintiff, but communicated with her through Blinn. No adjustment is warranted on the basis of these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The defendant focuses on \"the amount involved and the results obtained,\" arguing that the fees requested are so disproportionate to the damages awarded that a substantial reduction is required. The defendant\n   has made this argument unsuccessfully earlier in this case and in other cases. See\n   <em>\n    Franco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A Better Way Wholesale Autos, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-00422 (VLB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203064051\">\n    2016 WL 3064051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (D. Conn. May 31, 2016) (\"Defendants also argue that the attorney's fees are disproportionate to the damages awarded. This objection lacks an arguable basis in law\"), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=690%20Fed.%20Appx.%20741\">\n    690 Fed. Appx. 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2017). Other than a perfunctory citation to\n   <em>\n    Steiger\n   </em>\n   , the defendant fails to cite any authority in support of its claim that the fee award should be limited in proportion to the award of damages. The failure to brief an argument adequately is, in itself, a reason to reject the argument.

First, it fails to address\n   the text of CUTPA, which expressly provides that a fee award is to be \"based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery.\" General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d). It also fails to address the many cases in which our appellate courts have rejected a proportionality argument. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chaisson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749949\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/319/\">\n    277 Conn. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=890%20A.2d%20548\">\n    890 A.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), the Supreme Court rejected a proportionality argument and affirmed an attorney's fee award of $65,286.80 pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-571c\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a case where two plaintiffs had been awarded only nominal damages of $10 each under that statute. In that case, which involved racial intimidation by the defendants, the Supreme Court determined that \"there is a strong public policy reason for giving courts discretion to award substantial attorney's fees when the plaintiff's claim for damages and recovery is not large. Courts have recognized that the cumulative effect of small violations of one's civil rights may not be minimal to society as a whole.\" Id., at 334,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=890%20A.2d%20548\">\n    890 A.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This principle has been applied to support substantial awards of attorney's fees under other statutes to vindicate the purpose underlying the particular statute. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Costanzo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mulshine\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661951\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/94/655/#p664\">\n    94 Conn.

The trial court had reduced the requested fees in part because the damages awarded were only $1650. The Appellate Court concluded that the court had erred in its \"consideration of the disputed amount as a gauge for the proper amount of attorney's fees\"; id., at 663,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20A.2d%20905\">\n    893 A.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that it had failed to consider the policy underlying \u00a7 52-251a, which\n   allows a prevailing plaintiff to recover attorney's fees if a defendant transfers a matter from the small claims division to the regular civil docket in Superior Court. The Appellate Court commented that the attorney's fee provision served to deter defendants from \"turning a relatively clear-cut case into a pitched legal battle\"; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., at 665,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20A.2d%20905\">\n    893 A.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to \"reward those attorneys who represent small claims plaintiffs even though\n   the monetary value of the representation may be relatively insignificant for the time and effort required.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20A.2d%20905\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 665 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=893%20A.2d%20905\">\n    893 A.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The rationale applies equally to CUTPA cases. The availability of statutory attorney's fees under CUTPA serves both to deter unfair trade practices and to compensate attorneys for taking on small cases to enforce the public policy of protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, the court considers the \"amount at issue\" in conjunction with the \"results obtained.\" The plaintiff prevailed on all issues on appeal and successfully opposed a further appeal to the Supreme Court. The court also considers the economic \"undesirability\" of a case involving such a small monetary claim. Few lawyers are willing to take on such cases because payment for them is uncertain and is likely to be long delayed. The court finds that the success achieved and the economic undesirability of the case counterbalance the factor of the \"amount involved.\" No adjustment to the lodestar is warranted on these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties did not provide evidence about awards in similar cases. The court observes that in a somewhat similar case,\n   <em>\n    Creative Masonry &amp; Chimney, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV-09-5011943,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206131685\">\n    2013 WL 6131685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (October 23, 2013) (\n   <em>\n    Swienton, J\n   </em>\n   .), the court awarded appellate attorney's fees of $46,888,48. In the proceedings leading up to that decision, a jury had awarded the plaintiff $7700 in compensatory damages under CUTPA, and the trial court had awarded $23,100 in punitive damages and $56,380 in trial attorney's fees, as well as costs and prejudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    Creative Masonry &amp; Chimney, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415874\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/142/135/#p138\">\n    142 Conn.

To the extent that awards in similar cases are a factor, no adjustment to the lodestar is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, the court addresses the plaintiff's request for costs. The plaintiff seeks $393.74 for Blinn, consisting of travel expenses for the preargument conference and transcript costs, and $337.50 for Wareing for copying the appeal brief and appendix. Costs on appeal are governed by General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (d) and Practice Book \u00a7 71-2, which requires a bill of costs to be filed with the appellate clerk. The Appellate Court has held that nontaxable costs are not available under CUTPA.
