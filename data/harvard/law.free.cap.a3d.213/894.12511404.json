Therefore, like the Utah Supreme Court, we impose a 150-day suspension of respondent's license to practice law in New Jersey, which we apply retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We briefly summarize the facts and procedural history outlined in the Disciplinary Review Board's (DRB) decision, which relied upon the disciplinary record developed in Utah.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   1:20-14(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In two separate law firm matters handled by respondent while engaged in the practice of law in Utah, respondent traded legal fees earned for his law firm in exchange for construction work performed at his home in Utah; he did so without the knowledge or consent of his law firm and in violation of his law firm's employment contract. Respondent's actions deprived his law firm of more than $20,000 in legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In disciplinary proceedings before Utah's District Court of the Third Judicial District, respondent, in order to explain and justify his conduct, sought to testify about a business dispute he had with his law firm.

As such, respondent testified briefly regarding the business dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the hearing's conclusion, the Utah judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that respondent had knowingly misappropriated law firm funds and imposed a 150-day suspension from the practice of law.

The Utah Supreme Court clarified that \"not all misappropriation is created equal,\" and declined the request \"to hold that disbarment is the appropriate sanction whenever an attorney misappropriates firm funds.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342552\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1031/#p1037\">\n    391 P.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037-38 (Utah 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relying upon Utah's disciplinary rules,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Utah Supreme Court affirmed the 150-day suspension.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342552\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1031/#p1037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342552\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1031/#p1037\">\n    at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following entry of the Utah Supreme Court's order, the OAE moved before the DRB for reciprocal discipline pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   1:20-14(a) and requested respondent's disbarment.

Here, the OAE bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that respondent knowingly misappropriated law firm funds. Respondent is entitled to produce evidence that the purported misappropriation was, in fact, a business dispute. We must then determine whether the OAE has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the facts of the case warrant the imposition of \"greater discipline than that imposed in\" Utah -- namely, the sanction of disbarment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081443\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/141/#p153\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The record of the Utah disciplinary proceedings shows that respondent twice misappropriated funds that belonged to his law firm and thus violated two New Jersey RPCs: RPC 1.15(a), which requires a lawyer to \"hold property of clients or third persons that is in [his or her] possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own property\"; and RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer from \"engag[ing] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" When a New Jersey\n   attorney misappropriates law firm funds, the facts and circumstances of the particular case determine the sanctions warranted, up to and including disbarment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siegel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370672\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/133/162/#p170\">\n    133 N.J. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370672\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/133/162/#p170\">\n    627 A.2d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[K]nowingly misappropriating funds -- whether from a client or from one's partners -- will\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   result in disbarment.\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sigman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081443\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/141/#p153\">\n    220 N.J. at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081443\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/141/#p153\">\n    104 A.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that\n   <em>\n    Siegel\n   </em>\n   's holding \"is not, and has never been, absolute\" and that \"[t]he Court has recognized in other settings that there are cases that warrant discipline short of disbarment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The only evidence produced by the OAE in support of sanctions greater than a 150-day suspension is the record of proceedings before the Utah court. Importantly, in New Jersey disciplinary proceedings, evidence of a business dispute may be a defense to the misappropriation of law firm funds.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sigman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081443\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/141/#p153\">\n    220 N.J. at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081443\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/141/#p153\">\n    104 A.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that disbarment is inappropriate where the underlying misappropriation \"arose in a business dispute between the attorney and his firm\"). As the OAE concedes, Utah has no such business dispute defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the Utah judge did not \"see a huge amount of relevancy\" in testimony concerning respondent's business dispute with the law firm, the judge did allow respondent to touch upon such evidence for the limited purpose of undermining the credibility of the testifying law firm partners. Respondent thus argues that the Utah court excluded evidence relevant to whether the misappropriation at issue arose in the context of a business dispute with his law firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The OAE acknowledges both that the Utah record lacks facts necessary to establish a business dispute defense and that evidence of the existence of a business dispute would be integral, in New Jersey, to defending against a charge of knowing misappropriation of law firm funds. It also\n   concedes that it cannot subpoena witnesses and produce evidence beyond the Utah record to support its request for greater discipline. Nevertheless, the OAE claims that those limitations do not preclude us from relying on\n   the Utah record to support a finding of knowing misappropriation of law firm funds warranting respondent's disbarment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Central to our conclusion is that in Utah, respondent's incentive to produce evidence of a business dispute was far different than what his motivation to produce such evidence in New Jersey would have been. In Utah, the court permitted respondent to elicit testimony regarding a business dispute with his law firm only to assist the court in assessing the testifying law firm partners' credibility. Here, evidence of a business dispute militates against disbarment, notwithstanding an attorney's misappropriation of law firm funds in violation of RPC 8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Respondent claims that if permitted and motivated to do so, he could have produced additional evidence of a business dispute in Utah -- the State where the alleged business dispute occurred. The OAE and this Court agree that any evidence to establish a business dispute that may have been available during the Utah proceedings remains in Utah, outside of respondent's and the OAE's reach. We therefore believe it would be fundamentally unfair and contrary to our established rules to disbar respondent here -- a greater discipline than that imposed in Utah -- based only upon the record of proceedings in Utah.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gallo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1219722,1219718\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/178/115/\">\n    178 N.J. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1219718\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/178/115/1219718/\">\n    835 A.2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (finding that the imposition of discipline premised on an incomplete record \"would not be fair\" absent the opportunity for further testimony);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gipson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356519\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/103/75/#p77\">\n    103 N.J. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20A.2d%20660\">\n    510 A.2d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (imposing discipline where \"the procedures afforded respondent accorded with principles of fundamental fairness\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our constitutional responsibility is to determine the fitness of lawyers to practice law in New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.
