We conclude that, under \u00a7 12-103(a)(1) of the Family Law Article (Repl. 2012; Supp. 2018), a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent is eligible for such an award and an intervening non-parent can be ordered to pay such an award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellants David and Jennifer A. ask us to determine whether the circuit court erred in ordering them to pay the attorney's fees incurred by the appellee, Karen S., in connection with a battle over custody of five-year-old A.W. (\"Child\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The custody battle involved four at least nominally-distinct parties: (1) the A.s, Child's paternal grandparents;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Ms. Karen S., Child's maternal grandmother (\"Ms. Karen S.\"); (3) Matthew W., Child's father (\"Father\"); and (4) Sara S., Child's mother (\"Mother\"). After a custody hearing, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued a comprehensive order in which the court concluded, among other things, that Ms. Karen S. was entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs against the A.s under \u00a7 12-103(a)(1). The court subsequently set the\n   amount of the award at $57,289.32, the entire amount incurred by Ms. Karen S. (the \"Fee Award\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The A.s challenge the Fee Award on five grounds. In addition to their contention that \u00a7 12-103(a)(1) authorizes an award of attorney's fees only by one parent against another, the A.s argue that the circuit court erred in (1) ordering them to pay all of Ms. Karen S.'s attorney's fees and costs, rather than a portion of them; (2) determining that Ms. Karen S. had not waived her claim for attorney's fees; (3) finding that the A.s lacked substantial justification for bringing their claims; and (4) failing to reduce the Fee Award in light of sums the A.s had previously paid to support Child. Finding no error or abuse of discretion as to any of these determinations, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Father initiated this litigation in February 2017 by filing a complaint for sole legal and physical custody of Child, naming as defendants Ms. Karen S. and Mother. Two days later, Ms. Karen S. brought an ex parte emergency custody proceeding in Harford County, through which that court granted her temporary custody of Child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 12-C-17-000450 (Cir. Ct. Harford County). The two actions were later consolidated in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his complaint, Father alleged that Mother was a drug user who \"deliberately committed various acts of destruction ... in the presence of [Child]\" and was unfit to have custody. Father also alleged that Ms. Karen S. had taken Child from his residence, which had deprived Father of his\n   parental rights, and that she refused to allow him or the A.s access to Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 5, 2017, the A.s moved to intervene. In their motion and their cross-complaint for custody, visitation, and child support, the A.s alleged that they had participated in raising Child, that Child had a deep attachment to them, and that they had provided financial support to Child, Father, and Mother. The A.s \"den[ied] that [Father] is not a fit parent,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   but sought \"full legal and full physical custody of [Child], in the event that [Father] is found by this Court to be unfit for custody.\" The A.s also alleged that Ms. Karen S.'s home was not fit for Child and that Ms. Karen S. herself \"is not a fit and proper person to have custody or visitation\" with Child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2018, the court held a four-day trial in which it heard testimony from, among others, Mother, Father, Ms. Karen S., Ms. A., and Mr. A. All parties except Mother were represented by counsel. Testimony revealed that Mother and Father had both abused drugs, had physical altercations with each other, relied on the A.s and Ms. Karen S. for financial support and childcare, and lacked steady employment. Mother testified that she had a drug addiction, but had been clean for 15 months. Father denied having a drug addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The testimony at trial was generally positive with respect to the relationship between Child and both Ms. Karen S. and the A.s., as well as the support the grandparents had provided for and to Child. Notably for our purposes, Ms. A.'s trial testimony contradicted that of her deposition as well as the allegations of her cross-complaint in that she admitted at trial that: (1) Father is not fit to have custody of Child; and (2) Ms. Karen S. is fit to have custody. Ms. A. attributed the change in her testimony to \"something wrong in communication with [her] counsel\" during her deposition, but she acknowledged that she knew she was under oath at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The A.s and Ms. Karen S. each testified at trial regarding the state of their respective finances. Mr. A. testified that he had paid cash for a home he bought for Father's family, that he earned \"about $2,900,000\" in gross income the previous year, and that he owned a beach property and other significant assets. By contrast, Ms. Karen S. testified that she had\n   been forced to \"cash[ ] out\" her retirement assets to pay legal fees of approximately $19,500, and that she had no funds available to pay approximately $23,740 in outstanding legal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In making her\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   closing argument, Mother admitted to her drug addiction and to her current unfitness to have custody over Child. She argued that the A.s should not have custody over Child because of their history of ignoring and enabling Father's ongoing drug addiction, which left Child in a \"dangerous environment for three years,\" and she implored the court to \"protect my son.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Karen S. argued that Mother and Father were both unfit and that it was in Child's best interest for her to have sole custody. Like Mother, Ms. Karen S. argued that the A.s had ignored signs of Father's addiction for years and continued to enable his addiction. Indeed, she observed, the A.s had contended that Father was a fit parent in supplemental interrogatory responses filed just five days earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Karen S. asked for custody of Child \"just until these parents can get on their feet.\" She also requested that the court order the A.s to make \"a contribution to [her] attorney's fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The A.s' closing argument, echoing Ms. A.'s testimony, departed from the positions they had taken leading up to trial in two critical respects. First, they admitted that Father was \"unfit to have custody and there are a whole series of reasons why.\" Second, they admitted that Ms. Karen S. is fit. They also, however, asked the court not to penalize them for having missed the signs of their son's addiction and sought shared custody of Child. The A.s also asked that the court not enter an award of attorney's fees against them, contending that they had been \"very kind and good ... in supporting this family\" and \"that they had substantial justification for participating in this litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before his own counsel's closing argument, Father made a statement in which he admitted, for the first time, that he had a drug addiction and required help to get treatment. His counsel then acknowledged Father's present unfitness and\n   asked the court to implement the shared custody plan advocated by the A.s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the conclusion of trial, the court announced its findings and conclusions from the bench, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Mother and Father both have drug addictions, but were at different stages in their recoveries. Both are unfit to have custody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Mother, who the court found to be credible, had been clean since February 2017 and was on the road to recovery. However, Mother had not \"been clean for long enough\" or established a long enough track record for the court to be convinced that it was in Child's best interest for her to have custody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Father, who the court did not find to be credible except for his belated admission that he was a drug addict, had not yet begun his recovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Karen S. and her husband, Mr. S., were both credible, cared deeply for Child, and were capable of taking care of him. Ms. Karen S. had acted in Child's best interests in removing him from the dangerous environment he had been living in and obtaining a court order allowing her to take over his care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 For the last year, Ms. Karen S. had been Child's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 As a result of the parents' addictions, exceptional circumstances existed to award custody to a non-parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Although the A.s love Child, the court found much of their testimony incredible, which raised doubts regarding their \"character and reputation.\" The court identified a number of inconsistencies in their testimony and in the positions they had taken in the case, including as to their alleged lack of awareness of Father's addiction, their prior claims that Father was fit and that Ms. Karen S. was unfit, and Ms. A.'s testimony regarding signing documents under oath that included statements with which she disagreed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Although the A.s were in position to give Child \"an exceptional financial future,\" Ms. Karen S. and her husband \"can meet his every need ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court reviewed all of the required statutory factors and then awarded Ms. Karen S. sole legal custody and primary physical custody of Child, with the A.s having visitation every other weekend and on certain holidays. The court allowed Mother to have unsupervised visitation with Child as long as she continues to seek\n   treatment and have clean drug tests, and stated that Father would eventually be allowed the same access if he also receives treatment and has consistent clean drug tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Attorney's Fees Award\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In a subsequent written order that restated many of these findings and conclusions, the court also concluded that Ms. Karen S. was entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs. In a simultaneously-filed memorandum opinion, the court identified the three factors it was required to consider: \"(1) the financial status of each party; (2) the needs of each party; and (3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.\" Reviewing each factor in detail, the court made the following findings and conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Father and Mother had both been supported by their respective parents and did not have the financial ability to pay any award of attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 The A.s \"maintain an upper-class standard of living\" and own \"numerous and substantial financial assets.\" Ms. Karen S. \"maintains a middle-class standard of living\" that \"pales in comparison\" to the financial status of the A.s.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Karen S. \"is in need of and is entitled to the reimbursement of the fees incurred in this matter.\" She \"has exhausted most of her retirement savings for this case\" and still owes approximately $23,000 to her counsel. She \"is in need due to the financial burden of defending this case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Ms. Karen S. was justified in defending this proceeding. When the lawsuit was filed, she was Child's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent and there was no evidence that she was unfit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the evidence regarding the dangers to Child if he had been allowed to stay in the custody of Father-even under the supervision of the A.s-Ms. Karen S. \"had more than a substantial basis for defending the action.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 The A.s \"did not have substantial justification for bringing the action.\" Until their opening statement at trial, they claimed that Father was fit to have custody. The court found their testimony explaining that contention to be incredible and so doubted \"the veracity of their stated reason to intervene in this case.\" The court concluded that their intervention had \"led to a substantial amount of additional preparation and work for [Ms. Karen S.]'s counsel.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court concluded that Ms. Karen S. was entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs to be paid by the A.s. The court ordered her to submit an affidavit and memorandum \"with the final statement of account balance and an explanation of all costs, along with a description of the complexity of this case and a summary of her experience.\" The court reserved judgment regarding the reasonableness of the fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ms. Karen S.'s counsel submitted the required affidavit along with a detailed\n   time ledger in support of a final claim for $57,289.32 in attorney's fees and costs. The A.s opposed the request, arguing that Ms. Karen S. failed to preserve her claim for attorney's fees, that she lacked a statutory basis for the claim, that she could not recover all of her fees from them, and that the court should give them a credit for amounts they\n   had previously paid to support Child and Mother. In an order dated August 16, the court awarded attorney's fees and costs in favor of Ms. Karen S. and against the A.s for the full amount sought by Ms. Karen S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The A.s appealed. In their brief, the A.s challenge only the court's Fee Award. They do not challenge the court's decisions regarding custody or visitation or any of its related findings. Ms. Karen S. did not file a brief and has not participated in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"The trial court's award of fees and costs is a matter of discretion and is not subject to change unless clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Guardianship No. 89-CA-9865 in Circuit Court for Howard County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6035771\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/88/191/#p197\">\n    88 Md.

MS. KAREN S. DID NOT WAIVE OR FAIL TO PRESERVE HER CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The A.s contended below and in their appellate brief that Ms. Karen S. waived her claim for attorney's fees and costs by failing to comply with the requirement of Rule 2-703(b) that such a claim be included in a party's initial pleading. At oral argument, however, they conceded that Rule\n   2-703 does not apply here because Rule 2-702(b) expressly provides that the Chapter 700 rules \"do not apply to claims for attorneys' fees [ ] in an action under Code, Family Law Article where an award of attorneys' fees does not depend on the applicant's having prevailed in the action or on any particular claim or issue in the action ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The A.s nonetheless contend that Ms. Karen S. should be precluded from pursuing attorney's fees and costs because she raised her claim too late. We disagree. Although Ms. Karen S. did not expressly seek attorney's fees from the A.s in her answer to their crossclaim, her claim was not a surprise. Both parties had the opportunity to present evidence and arguments regarding her claim at trial and again in post-trial briefing and both parties did so. We discern no abuse of discretion in the circuit court's determination that Ms. Karen S. had not waived or failed to preserve her claim for attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE COURT WAS AUTHORIZED TO AWARD COUNSEL FEES AND COSTS UNDER \u00a7 12-103 OF THE FAMILY LAW ARTICLE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The A.s argue that Ms. Karen S. was not eligible for an award of attorney's fees and costs under \u00a7 12-103(a)(1) of the Family Law Article because such fees may be\n   awarded only as between parents, not grandparents. Determining whether they are right requires an examination of the language of the statute, which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (a) The court may award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in any case in which a person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (1) applies for a decree or modification of a decree concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties; ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (b) Before a court may award costs and counsel fees under this section, the court shall consider:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (1) the financial status of each party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (2) the needs of each party; and\n   (3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (c) Upon a finding by the court that there was an absence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding, and absent a finding by the court of good cause to the contrary, the court shall award to the other party costs and counsel fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Fam.

The A.s would thus have us interpret the legislature's use of \"either\" in \u00a7 12-103(a) as an indication of an intent to limit the statute's applicability to two-party disputes, and to further presume that those two parties must be parents. They bolster that view by reference to the other phrase on which they rely. They argue that by limiting the availability of an award to a situation in which the dispute concerns \"a child of the parties,\" the General Assembly intended to authorize fee shifting only between parents. That, they contend, is because children are only children of their parents, not anyone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Viewing the statutory language in context, however, it is at least ambiguous as to whether it extends to non-parent intervenors.

Parents and non-parents alike advocate, require other parties to respond to their claims, engage in discovery, and generally add to the litigation burden of all other parties. Permitting differences in wealth to drive different outcomes in custody, visitation, and child support cases is equally odious regardless of whether the disadvantaged party is a parent or a non-parent. Section 12-103(a) seeks to avoid that result by allowing the court, at any time, to make a \"just and proper\" award of attorney's fees and costs based, at least in part, on the respective resources and needs of the parties. That provision cannot serve its full purpose if it applies only to a subset of parties to a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Furthermore, the A.s' interpretation of \u00a7 12-103(a) would have the rather odd result of advantaging non-parents over parents in custody, visitation, and child support proceedings by (1) absolving only non-parents of any potential financial responsibility for taking meritless positions and (2) permitting only them to take advantage of their wealth to increase the expense of the litigation for the other parties without the possibility of fee shifting. We see no indication that the General Assembly intended to afford non-parent intervenors such a privileged position over parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, \u00a7 12-103(a)(1) allows a court to ensure that the child who is the subject of a dispute is not further disadvantaged as a result of the dispute by leaving the party or parties who have custody or visitation with inadequate resources to provide for the child.\n   <em>\n    Petrini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993598\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/453/#p468\">\n    336 Md. at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993598\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/453/#p468\">\n    648 A.2d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Ms. Karen S., whose income is modest in comparison to the A.s, had to use her retirement savings to fund a portion of her legal fees.

The A.s did not prevail on either of their two primary\n   requests for relief-that Father retain custody or, in the alternative, that they be awarded sole custody-and the court largely rejected their testimony, including as to the reason for their intervention, and found them to be incredible. The record supports that skepticism.

Instead, they claim,\n   the court was required to \"parse the legal fees attributable to actions by the [A.s], as opposed to other parties,\" and should have ordered them to pay only their share. We disagree that the court was required to engage in that exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As discussed, the three factors the court was required to consider in determining whether to award attorney's fees are: (1) \"the financial status of each party\"; (2) \"the needs of each party\"; and (3) \"whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.\" Fam.

And while the A.s had \"substantial financial assets,\" Ms. Karen S. \"works hard to maintain an acceptable standard of living\" and her \"financial status pales in comparison\" to that of the A.s. Similarly, the court found that the A.s were not in financial need but that Ms. Karen S. was, specifically \"due to the financial burden of defending this\n   case.\" The A.s do not challenge those findings, all of which are amply supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The court then concluded that Ms. Karen S. had substantial justification for litigating this case and that the A.s did not.

As noted, \u00a7 12-103 does not require it. Unlike fee shifting provisions that depend on which party prevails in a case or on a claim, the trial\n   judge's charge under \u00a7 12-103 is to make an award that is \"just and proper.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Md.

It was not an abuse of discretion on this record for the circuit court to conclude that it was just and proper for the A.s to bear Ms. Karen S.'s attorney's fees and costs. Mother, who was not represented by counsel at any point in the litigation, appears to have been the least active party in the litigation. She did not initiate the litigation or drive a substantial amount of the activity in it, especially with respect to Ms. Karen S. Father initiated the litigation and was an active participant in it. However, given that the A.s were mostly aligned with Father's position and the testimony that they provided him with substantial financial support, it would not be unreasonable to consider those parties together. For reasons already discussed, we also find strong support for the court's decision in all three of the factors the statute directs the trial court to consider: the resources, needs, and justification for the positions taken by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This argument misapprehends the role and purpose of an award of attorney's fees and costs under \u00a7 12-103.
