Defendant argues that the trial court erred in allowing (1) evidence of his invocation of the right to counsel, (2) references to his refusal to consent to a search of his computer and car, and (3) testimony by the interrogating officer that he knew defendant was lying. We agree that these three issues combine to undermine the integrity of the verdict and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(a)(1) and (2) ; second-degree aggravated arson, N.J.S.A. 2C:17-1(a)(2) ; second-degree possession of a weapon with unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(a) ; second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(b) ; second-degree desecration of human remains, N.J.S.A. 2C:22-1(a)(2) ; third-degree hindering by way of concealment or destruction of evidence, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-3(b)(1) ; fourth-degree tampering by destroying computer data, N.J.S.A. 2C:28-6(1) ; and fourth-degree stalking, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court sentenced defendant for murder to a life term, subject to more than sixty-three years of parole ineligibility under\n   the No Early Release Act, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. He received a consecutive ten-year term with a five-year parole disqualifier for aggravated arson. The remaining convictions either merged or the court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The March 6, 2011 Murder and Prior Events\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Robert Cantor was shot in the back of the head while in his home in Teaneck, New Jersey. His body was placed on the bed in the basement bedroom, doused with an accelerant, and set on fire. Defendant was the estranged husband of Cantor's girlfriend, S.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was the only suspect considered by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   S. and Cantor had sexual relations for the first time in February 2010, in the basement bedroom of Cantor's home. Defendant acknowledged to the police that he found out about the affair between Cantor and S. through their email exchanges he downloaded from S.'s computer. A computer expert who searched defendant's computer found 299 saved emails between Cantor and S. In early 2010, defendant, who owned a computer store, installed software on his wife's laptop that enabled him to record her exact keystrokes. Defendant also created an email address and sent anonymous emails to Cantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the night of February 16, 2010, S. told defendant she was aware that he knew about her and Cantor. Defendant asked S. where she and Cantor had slept together, and she told him it was in a basement bedroom of Cantor's house. Defendant told her not to see Cantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 18, defendant told S. he was going to take $2000 from their savings to buy a gun \"to protect you and the kids and myself.\" Their bank statement showed a cash withdrawal for $2000. Later that day, defendant showed her a black handgun. Defendant told the police he showed S. a friend's gun, a \"small Beretta,\" during this time period. He said he gave it back to his friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2010, defendant's wife and daughters moved out of the marital apartment. In the spring of 2010, defendant went to Cantor's home in Teaneck three times. Defendant told the police that on the first occasion, they sat in the living room and spoke for about three hours. Defendant told Cantor, \"I want you to stop seeing my wife.\" During this first meeting, defendant said he and Cantor went \"down in the basement ... [b]ecause from the e-mails, I wanted to know where they actually have relationship.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   S. testified Cantor had told her of this three-hour visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant said the second time he went to Cantor's house was about a month later and their conversation was brief. The third time defendant went to speak to Cantor, Cantor was on his way to work and did not let defendant into the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   S. testified that defendant liked to go to shooting ranges. Defendant's friend who lived in Texas testified that in early November 2010, defendant called him and asked him \"to possibly get him a magazine for a Walther PPX\" handgun. The friend did not supply the magazine and defendant said it was \"no big deal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 3, 2011, S. served defendant with divorce papers. Defendant told the police he intended to raise the grounds of adultery and put both Cantor and S. \"on the stand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant spent Sunday, March 6, the day of the murder, with his youngest daughter. At about 8:00 p.m., defendant took her back to S.'s apartment and spent about twenty minutes with all three of his daughters. The middle child told defendant she met \"a guy named Robbie\" who was \"mommy's friend\" when she went to the museum with S. that day. Cantor had never before met any of defendant's children. Defendant told the police he was not angry because \"[i]t was bound to happen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At approximately 11:30 p.m. on March 6, neighbors saw a fire at Cantor's home. His body was found in the basement. He had been\n   shot in the back of the head and died before the fire was started. The police found a 380-caliber shell casing in the basement, under the bed. The 380-caliber gun for which defendant had asked his friend to procure a magazine in November 2010 could be loaded and fired without a magazine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 7, 2011, Bergen County Prosecutor's Office Detective James Brazofsky and Teaneck Detective Mark Fisco interviewed defendant at a New York City police station. Brazofsky used a small digital voice recorder because \"[t]he 23rd Precinct did not have audio and video recording capabilities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant said that on March 6, after he dropped his daughter off with S., he returned to his apartment, had two or three beers, read emails, read books, and washed dishes and \"[t]hat took about an hour and a half, two hours.\" At about 1:00 a.m., he went to a store and bought some beer. A store clerk later confirmed that defendant bought beer between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. on March 7, 2011. He repeatedly denied going anywhere else that night and said he did not leave Manhattan. Defendant acknowledged that he learned of the relationship between S. and Cantor by placing software on her laptop. Fisco continued to question defendant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   There was a situation that happened last night. Okay. And I believe that you left, at some point you left New York City and you traveled into New Jersey last night. Okay. And I -- I want you to be honest with us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [DETECTIVE] FISCO: It's very important that you be honest with us here, Tony. All right? I think some things you have been honest with us about, other things you may have left out and not been so honest about. Tell us about Jersey last night.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A: I was, uh (inaudible). I was --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q: I -- I don't think you were home all night last night.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   DETECTIVE FISCO: What time were you in Jersey last night?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: Why would I be in Jersey? What time was I in Jersey? What are we talking about here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Brazofsky repeated that he believed defendant \"went over there\" the night before and that he was acting under the emotional stress of the divorce and financial troubles, and he suggested\n   that cell phone records, EZ Pass records, or other electronic surveillance would show defendant had traveled to New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Brazofsky asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: Okay. Let me ask you this: Would you allow us, um, to have a computer forensic examiner look at your activity last night on the computer from, say, I don't know, 5:00 p.m. to, I don't know, 7:00 a.m. this morning? Just to look for activity, not to search through your personal\n   stuff or anything like that. Just to look at the activity on the computer to see if --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: I think I would speak to my lawyer about that first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: Okay. That's fine. You could do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Brazofsky also asked for consent to search defendant's car, stating, \"My goal is, if you didn't do anything last night, then there shouldn't be any evidence related to the incident last night in -- in your car, basically.\" Defendant responded repeatedly that he wanted to consult his attorney first before agreeing to either search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Brazofsky suggested that cell phone records could show defendant went to New Jersey and defendant acknowledged that \"certain records don't lie\" and that \"I can't argue against\" that sort of evidence. Brazofsky then asked defendant to admit he was in New Jersey, saying in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Can you be honest with me and tell me where you were last night? Cause I'm telling you, I could see it in your face, and I can see it in the way you're sitting there, I can see that you're not -- you're not at home last night. Something happened and you did something that you're sorry about. I can see it in your eyes. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Brazofsky suggested that defendant was \"pushed ... over the edge\" when he learned that Cantor had contact with his daughter. Brazofsky again told defendant, \"[Y]ou went there last night. Okay. I know you did. I believe you did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Brazofsky again asked to search defendant's computer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Um, why before -- and you have every right to say no, but I just wanna ask you for your reason why you said no. Why would -- if you had nothing to hide, that you weren't in New Jersey last night, why wouldn't you let me look at your computer to say, oh, my gosh, look, he was home? Why would -- why wouldn't you let me go to your computer just for the period of time that this incident took place to see if you were on the computer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Brazofsky stated that \"[i]t's only a matter of time\" before \"things come together,\" and defendant commented, \"You need to prove it.\" Brazofsky then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I'll be honest with you, Tony. You -- you don't -- you don't have any of the reactions of a person who's telling me the truth. All right? I been doing this for [fifteen] years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Brazofsky again stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Do I believe that you were over there? Yeah, I believe you went over there, cause when I asked you a question before, you answered them like a person who's not being truthful. Cause I told you what my answer would have been. Jim, did you leave your house last night after you put your kids to bed? No. I didn't go anywhere. I know for a fact I didn't go anywhere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A: Um.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: Okay. You can look at my computer. You can look at my phone. You can talk to my kids. I -- you can talk to my neighbors. I don't care, cause I know I wasn't there. You didn't say that once. Not -- you still haven't said that. Okay. That's why I don't believe you're being truthful, okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The interview was terminated when defendant asked to call his lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The police collected video evidence contradicting defendant's claim that he was home all night except for purchasing beer. Footage from cameras located near defendant's apartment showed defendant parking his car at about 10:10 p.m., and walking in the direction of his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   About twenty minutes later, the footage showed him leaving the apartment, and going out of view at about 10:40 p.m., not in the direction of his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On March 8, 2011, after obtaining a search warrant for defendant's apartment, the police seized defendant's desktop computer. A computer expert testified that, on March 6, 2011, all activity, whether generated by a user or the operating system, stopped on the computer at 9:48 p.m. Computer activity began again on March 7 at 1:11 a.m. At 2:00 a.m., a user launched a program that permanently deleted a large number of files from defendant's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The police searched defendant's computer store. Among other items, they found handwritten notes that included the name of\n   Cantor's wife, her work address and job title as well as Cantor's name, cell phone number, and two email addresses. The police also seized email correspondence between S. and Cantor, \"a folder with assorted information on\" S. and Cantor, and Google Map directions from Cantor's home in Teaneck to the apartment S. moved into, with a date of April 12, 2010. In addition, the police found S.'s cell phone bill dated March 5, 2010, with calls to Cantor's cell phone highlighted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The State presented no direct evidence that defendant left Manhattan on the night of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Use of Defendant's Statement at Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant unsuccessfully moved pretrial to exclude his March 7, 2011, statement on the grounds that his agreement to speak to Brazofsky and Fisco without counsel present was not a knowing and voluntary waiver of his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p473\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473-74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p473\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p473\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). Defendant did not thereafter seek to exclude any portion of his statement as inadmissible, and the entire statement was transcribed for and played to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In his opening statement, the prosecutor asked the jury to \"pay very, very, very careful attention to the statement of the defendant ....\" He said, \"Please, pay very careful attention to not just what he says but how he says what he says and why he says what he says. How he says it. Please.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At trial, Brazofsky testified at length about the statement and acknowledged that defendant was the prime suspect at the time he was questioned. Brazofsky testified that he had been assigned to \"the polygraph unit\" as a polygraph examiner for the last ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Brazofsky acknowledged that defendant had been interrogated as opposed to interviewed, noting that standard practice was to Mirandize a person \"[a]t any point where you are questioning a suspect with the intention of obtaining a confession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Before the jury heard the audio playback, Brazofsky summarized the entire interrogation, including a number of the answers defendant gave in his statement and Brazofsky's interpretation of those responses. As detailed below, defense counsel largely did not object to Brazofsky's commentary. On a few occasions, the trial court sustained a defense objection to Brazofsky's testimony as \"opinion,\" but some rulings were less clear and no limiting instruction was provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Brazofsky testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   I asked him if [S] had been dating anyone or had a boyfriend. And his first response to me was, you'd have to ask her. Based upon our -- my information base from the beginning of this case, obviously he wasn't being truthful when he answered that question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, your Honor. That's an opinion of the officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   THE COURT: I'll sustain the characterization. You can rephrase it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: No disagreement with counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Brazofsky testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   When I asked him about whether or not he left Manhattan at any point, his response -- he paused, looked at me, didn't answer right away, and said, no. In that fashion. I thought the answer was odd. It wasn't a --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, your Honor. Again, opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: I think he can at least give the jury his reaction. He can be cross-examined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It's still an opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   THE COURT: He answered it. Next question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Brazofsky explained that after a break in the interview, \"we were more, not confrontational, but more direct in our questions.\" Brazofsky said he told defendant he \"did not believe what he was telling us,\" but he believed defendant went to Teaneck to confront Cantor. Brazofsky elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   And I asked him at certain points during this period of the interview if I would see him on any of these checks, whether it be a traffic camera showing his, you know, face walking by, or his cell phone not being in Manhattan, or his, you know, his likeness being on a surveillance camera. His responses were not denials. They were very vague. Things like, I believe he said, \"I hope not,\" \"shouldn't be,\" things like that. Never once did he say, no, absolutely not, I was home all night, you won't see me on any camera or anywhere else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Brazofsky testified that defendant refused consent to search his computer, saying \"words to the effect of, I think I'd talk to my lawyer first.\" He told the jury, \"I just reinforced that, you know, you understand if you are home on the computer when this incident happened, that ... would clear you as a suspect in this case. And he still declined to allow us to look at the computer.\" Brazofsky also testified that he asked for defendant's consent to search his vehicle, but defendant again said he would want to speak to a lawyer first. After another break in the interview, Brazofsky \"again confronted [defendant] with the fact that I did not believe he was being truthful. That I believe he went to New Jersey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Brazofsky repeatedly explained to the jury that he \"continued to confront him with the fact that I didn't believe he was home all night. I felt he went to Mr. Cantor's house. I felt there was an argument .... that somehow got out of control.\" When he told defendant the police would be looking for surveillance camera footage and things like that, defendant \"continued to be evasive with his answers and say things like, 'I hope not,' 'shouldn't be.' Things of that nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Brazofsky said, \"I believe at this point I asked him again if he was going to be truthful and tell us about going to New Jersey.\" Brazofsky again asked to search defendant's computer. \"I informed him that, you know, activity on the computer would eliminate him as a suspect, and his response was, he did not want me to -- he was not giving me permission to look at the computer, 'so that's not another nail in my coffin.' was his response.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Later, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. I think you were at this point in your testimony where you stated that you, again, began to confront Mr. Tung;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   that you told Mr. Tung that you did not feel he was being truthful and that you believed he was in New Jersey that Sunday evening. Correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. All right. At this time does he make any request of you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A. He does. Just so I can explain, as we start to confront him and we start to explain to him that evidence is starting to come in and pile up and that he needs to\n   be truthful with us so that we can understand what his intentions were, whether he went over there to hurt someone or just went over there to have a conversation with Rob Cantor and then a fight happened, where it was an unplanned, you know, spontaneous incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   I speak, and at this point you'll hear it in the audio for a good period of time where he doesn't respond. He doesn't really say anything. He just sits there and listens to me. And I tell him that I don't believe he's a bad guy. I believe he's trying to protect his children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   What I'm trying to do is get him to admit he did go over there, because he went over there just to speak to Robbie, just like he did the other times. That he didn't go over there with intentions to hurt him. It gives a person who's not being truthful a more palatable or less serious explanation of why they went to a house and why this happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   So during this portion, I'm speaking a lot, and Tony Tung is just sitting there staring at me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   All of a sudden, he looks up and says, I need to use the bathroom. And the question just prior to that was, tell us about going to New Jersey or tell us about last night, why you went to New Jersey. And he realizes at that point that he can't answer that question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, your Honor. That's --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   THE COURT: All right, I'll sustain as to --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q. Does he say he can't answer that question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A. I believe he does. Right after that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q. Did you write it in your report?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That's fine, Judge, but not opinion. The statement is fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Agreed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A. He actually says, \"I would like to go to the bathroom.\" And it was either myself or Detective Fisco said, \"Can you just answer that one question, that last question?\" And his words were, \"No, I can't answer that now.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   After defendant used the bathroom, Brazofsky \"continued to confront him. That he's not being truthful with us.\" Brazofsky said that, after a few more minutes, defendant asked to call a lawyer and the interview stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   At that point in the trial, each juror received a copy of the transcript of the statement to follow along. The prosecutor, without objection, instructed Brazofsky:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Now, Detective, I'm going to ask you to begin playing the subject recording, if you would. And during the course of the recitation of this particular recording, if there are points at which you need to stop the recording to explain a particular piece of testimony as it is received, please feel free to do so. And we will stop the recording at that point, have your comments, and then continue with the recording.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   During the playback of the statement, Brazofsky periodically offered comments,\n   some of which addressed defendant's demeanor during questioning, but others addressed the quality of defendant's answers or his refusal to consent to searches. Without prompting or a question from the prosecutor, Brazofsky added that defendant has visited Cantor's home\n   <em>\n    four\n   </em>\n   times, which would include the night of the murder:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A.

Before the statement playback began, Brazofsky told the jury he \"just reinforced\" that a consent search could \"clear [defendant] as a suspect,\" but that defendant \"still declined to allow us to look at the computer.\" As part of his commentary during pauses of the playback, Brazofsky improperly opined that defendant refused a consent search of his computer even though, if he was innocent, it \"could be beneficial\" to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The question, then, is whether references to defendant's refusal to consent to a search was plain error.

In these circumstances, the repeated suggestion that defendant refused consent because he knew he was guilty and had something to hide was prejudicial. The sheer number of references to defendant's refusal, both in the statement and in Brazofsky's live testimony, prevents a finding that the references were fleeting or isolated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Moreover, the court did not give a limiting instruction to the jury that it could not consider defendant's refusal to consent as evidence of guilt.

While the judge sustained an objection to Brazofsky's characterization that \"obviously\n   [defendant] wasn't being truthful,\" he allowed the admission of other testimony regarding Brazofsky's personal belief that defendant was a liar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Most troubling is that Brazofsky frequently made comments on the manner in which defendant gave responses, suggesting that Brazofsky's own experience and specialized training enabled him to determine that defendant was lying. Brazofsky told the jury: \"I'm also assigned to the polygraph unit since 2005. I'm one of three polygraph examiners for the office. We conduct criminal-specific polygraph examinations for local towns, the county prosecutor's office and state and other agencies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The jury heard Brazofsky repeatedly tell defendant that he had truth-telling skills. During his live testimony, Brazofsky stressed to the jury that, when asked if evidence would surface showing that defendant went to New Jersey, defendant's responses were \"vague\" but \"not denials,\" while an honest person would have answered \"no, absolutely not, I was home all night, you won't see me on any camera or anywhere else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The overall message from this evidence was that Brazofsky could tell that defendant was lying about not leaving Manhattan on the night of the murder. The absence of a video recording of the interrogation exacerbated the problem presented by Brazofsky's opinion of defendant's veracity. The jury had no other source to learn how defendant was acting during the interview, causing greater danger that the jury placed reliance on Brazofsky's truth-telling expertise, rather than making its own credibility determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Further, the prosecutor's statements during closing that Brazofsky's testimony established \"what truth sounds like,\" and defendant \"must be guilty\" because he \"lied\" to the police invited the jury to give weight to Brazofsky's veracity opinion. Independent video evidence showed that defendant was not truthful about only leaving his apartment once to buy beer. But the jury's evaluation of whether his denial of guilt was credible was tainted by Brazofsky's clearly and repeatedly stated opinion.
