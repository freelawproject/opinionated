Plaintiff alleges the company wrongfully denied him a promotion to a position in New Jersey and thereafter wrongfully terminated him from his job with its subsidiary in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff claims the company engaged in \"associational\" discrimination against him, in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\"NJLAD\"), based on the fact that his wife was\n   then terminally ill with cancer. The company maintains it treated plaintiff fairly, that he never applied for the promotion, and that it justifiably discharged him for engaging in inappropriate conduct at a trade show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The appeal raises two important and novel questions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, under principles of statutory construction, can the NJLAD protect nonresident workers and job applicants, despite the fact that the statute's preamble refers to \"inhabitants\" of this state?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, even if the NJLAD can extend to certain out-of-state plaintiffs, do choice-of-law principles weigh in favor of applying the law of Illinois instead to plaintiff's respective failure-to-promote and wrongful discharge claims?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court concluded that Illinois law, rather than the NJLAD, must apply to plaintiff's claims of discrimination because he lived in Illinois and worked for defendants' subsidiary in Illinois. Given that Illinois law has yet to recognize a cause of action for associational discrimination, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the NJLAD, notwithstanding the solitary reference to \"inhabitants\" in its preamble, can extend in appropriate circumstances to plaintiffs who reside or work outside of this state. However, whether the NJLAD applies to a particular nonresident's claims turns upon a weighing of the multiple choice-of-law factors set forth in the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws\n   </em>\n   (Am. Law Inst. 1971) (the \"\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   \"), as adopted and construed by the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We hold that New Jersey law, and specifically the NJLAD's ban against associational discrimination, applies to defendants' alleged failure to give plaintiff fair consideration for a promotion to a position in New Jersey. The\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   factors strongly weigh in favor of applying New Jersey law, not Illinois law, to this\n   failure-to-promote claim. We therefore reverse the trial court's dismissal of that discrete claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim, we vacate its dismissal and remand the choice-of-law issue pertaining to that claim to the trial court for further analysis. We do so to enable the further development\n   of critical facts bearing on the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   factors. Among other things, the record needs to be developed more fully and definitively concerning such things as: the location(s) of the person(s) within the company who took part in the decision to terminate plaintiff; the sole or dominant place, if any, that the decision was made; and the location(s) of plaintiff's conduct that precipitated his discharge. After those and other facts pertinent to the choice-of-law analysis are more fully developed, the trial court shall reassess which state has the \"most significant relationship\" overall to plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We glean the following facts and allegations from plaintiff's complaint and related pleadings, mindful that discovery has not yet been conducted and credibility determinations have not been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Work in Illinois for Phibro's Subsidiary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant Phibro Animal Health Corporation (\"Phibro\"), a company headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, develops and sells animal food additives. Prince Agri Products Incorporated (\"Prince Agri\"), a subsidiary of Phibro, handles marketing, product management, research, development, and technical support. Prince Agri's office is located in Quincy, Illinois, where plaintiff resided at all times relevant to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2008, Phibro hired plaintiff to serve as a Vice President of Marketing and Technology Deployment at Prince Agri's office. He\n   worked in that position at Prince Agri in Illinois until his termination in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When plaintiff was hired, he signed three employment-related form agreements: a Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement, an Employee Invention Agreement, and a Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement. All three agreements contained the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY\n   <em>\n    THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY\n   </em>\n   WITHOUT REGARD FOR CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES. I EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO VENUE IN, AND THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW JERSEY FOR ANY LAWSUIT ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [ (Emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Each agreement further stated: \"This Agreement does not alter the status of my employment as an at-will employee of [Phibro].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant Dean J. Warras, the President of Prince Agri, was plaintiff's direct supervisor. Defendant Daniel A. Welch worked as Phibro's Senior Vice President of Human Resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that Warras's and Welch's offices were located at Phibro's headquarters in Teaneck. However, in connection with defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, Warras certified that his own employment was based out of Prince Agri's office in Illinois, the state where Warras maintained a primary residence until approximately August 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While at Prince Agri, plaintiff supervised a team of approximately forty employees who managed existing product portfolios, identified new products, conducted research on product use and development, and provided customer and technical support. According to plaintiff, he consistently received excellent annual performance\n   reviews. Among other accolades, the reviews reportedly stated that plaintiff worked \"extremely hard,\" did an \"excellent job,\" \"significantly strengthened\" his team over the years, and generated \"new credibility and cache in the industry and academic community\" for Phibro's products. According to plaintiff, Phibro never placed him on any type of \"Performance Management Plan\" or \"formally counseled [him] for performance or conduct issues.\"\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Disabling Health Issues of Plaintiff's Wife\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff's wife, Beth Calabotta, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008. Following a period of remission, Beth's breast cancer recurred in 2014 and spread to other parts of her body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff contends he openly discussed Beth's health issues and prognosis with his co-workers and supervisors. According to plaintiff, between 2014 and 2016 Warras periodically asked him questions about Beth's medical condition. Plaintiff believed that Warras shared the information about his wife's condition with Welch. Additionally, in May and June 2016, the\n   <em>\n    Quincy Herald-Whig\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   featured Beth in prominent news stories that discussed her terminal illness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Company Reorganization and the New Jersey Position\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In June 2016, Warras informed plaintiff that Phibro was reorganizing its operations and his responsibilities would be reduced significantly. Under the reorganization, plaintiff would no longer be responsible for marketing and project management, and ten to fifteen people would be cut from his staff. Moreover, plaintiff's title would change to Vice President, Research and Technical Support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Warras told plaintiff that Phibro had created a new position based at Phibro's headquarters in New Jersey for a Senior Vice President of Marketing and Product Management. According to plaintiff, he inquired about who would be considered for the new position, and Warras responded that an independent recruiting firm would begin interviewing candidates \"in the very near future.\" When plaintiff asked whether he would be considered for the new position, Warras allegedly replied, \"I did not think that\n   you would be interested. The job is in New Jersey and with Beth's situation and all ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff claims he informed Warras and Welch on multiple occasions between June and July 2016 that he \"should get serious consideration\" for the new Senior Vice President position, given his marketing and product management experience at Prince Agri. At one point, Welch allegedly responded, \"I don't know if that is going to happen.\" Plaintiff requested from Warras the job description for the new position. According to plaintiff, Warras assured him that he would get a copy of it. Warras also allegedly promised to talk to Phibro's senior managers about plaintiff's interest in the post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Despite these alleged assurances, plaintiff was not interviewed for the new position and was not provided with the job description. In early July 2016, plaintiff learned that the recruiting firm had interviewed other candidates for the position. Plaintiff did not receive the promotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    The July 2016 National Meeting and Plaintiff's Subsequent Discharge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Between July 19 and July 23, 2016, plaintiff and several members of his team\n   attended a national meeting of the American Dairy Science Association (\"ADSA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On July 22, 2016, Welch called plaintiff to discuss a \"serious problem\" that had arisen at the ADSA meeting during a presentation made by a member of plaintiff's staff and how plaintiff had handled the situation. The details of this incident are not fully explained in the complaint. At the end of their phone conversation, Welch suspended plaintiff with pay, \"pending further investigation.\" Plaintiff claims that, despite his request for details, Welch never told him what accusations were being investigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On or about August 19, 2016, plaintiff met with Warras and Welch. They told him that they had \"corroborated the allegations\" against him. The complaint does not state where this meeting took place. Plaintiff again asked what the allegations were, but he claims he was not given an answer. He asserts he told Warras and Welch that, \"he still believed he handled the situation [at the ADSA meeting] appropriately.\" They disagreed. Ultimately, Welch handed plaintiff a draft Separation Agreement and terminated his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff did not sign the Separation Agreement, which proposed that he give up his right to sue for claims \"arising from or in any way connected with\" his employment and termination, in exchange for $117,000 in severance pay. Paragraph 10 of the unsigned Separation Agreement stated that it \"shall be interpreted for all purposes consistent with the laws of the State of New Jersey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that the deliberations among Warras, Welch, and other senior executives culminating in their decision not to consider him for the promotional position, and their subsequent decision to terminate him, all occurred at Phibro's headquarters in New Jersey. Defendants, however, have not acknowledged that these decisions and communications were made in or confined to New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to the representations of counsel at the appellate oral argument, plaintiff applied for and obtained unemployment compensation from Illinois state authorities following his discharge. The present record does not reveal whether plaintiff's unemployment benefits application mentioned his contention that he was fired for discriminatory reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In March 2017, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Law Division against Phibro, Warras, and Welch. Count one alleges that defendants\n   discriminated against him in violation of the NJLAD \"on account of his association with a person with a disability\" on two separate occasions: (1) when they refused to consider him for a promotion in New Jersey, and (2) when they subsequently terminated his employment. Counts two and three allege that defendants Warras and Welch aided and abetted Phibro in violating the NJLAD. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, and statutory attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    The Dismissal of the Complaint and Denial of Reconsideration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:6-2(e). They argued that, even accepting plaintiff's factual allegations as true, plaintiff has no viable cause of action under the NJLAD as an Illinois resident who worked for the company's subsidiary in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On September 1, 2017, the trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, holding that \"[t]he NJLAD does not apply to employees whose employment is based outside of New Jersey.\" The motion judge relied largely on this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Buccilli v. Timby, Brown &amp; Timby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"407064\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/283/6/\">\n    283 N.J. Super. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"407064\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/283/6/\">\n    660 A.2d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 1995), in which we found that Pennsylvania law, rather than the NJLAD, governed a New Jersey resident's claims of discrimination by her Pennsylvania employer for whom she had worked in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff moved for reconsideration. He presented to the court, for the first time, the three employment agreements he signed in\n   2008 and the unsigned Separation Agreement, all of which stated that any lawsuits arising out of those documents would be governed by New Jersey law. Defendants argued these employment agreements pertained only to discrete subjects and were not applicable to plaintiff's present discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On October 27, 2017, the trial court denied plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, concluding that the proffered agreements did not require the application of New Jersey law to his claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff's present appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    The Amici on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   After the appeal was filed, the National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey (\"NELA-NJ\"), a statewide organization of attorneys who solely or primarily represent persons in employment-related matters, sought and was granted leave to appear in this appeal as amicus curiae. We thereafter invited the Attorney General to appear as amicus curiae to address the novel legal issues of statutory construction and choice-of-law presented. The Attorney General accepted the invitation and filed an amicus brief. In addition, we likewise granted the Academy of New Jersey Management Attorneys, Inc. (\"ANJMA\"), an organization of New Jersey lawyers who have long represented employers in labor and employment matters, leave to appear as amicus curiae.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff and amicus NELA-NJ argue the trial court should have applied the NJLAD to both his failure-to-promote and wrongful termination claims. Defendants and amicus ANJMA counter that the court correctly applied Illinois law to both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Attorney General presents a more nuanced position. The Attorney General asserts that the NJLAD clearly should apply to\n   plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim, but that the present record is inadequate to resolve whether the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   factors call for New Jersey or Illinois law to apply to his separate wrongful termination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The pivotal question posed in this appeal is whether New Jersey law (including specifically\n   the NJLAD) or Illinois law applies to each of this Illinois resident's claims against a New Jersey-based parent company and its officials. To answer this question, we must consider both the intended scope of the NJLAD as well as choice-of-law principles adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court, including relevant portions of the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    De Novo Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In evaluating the trial court's decision declining to apply New Jersey law to either of plaintiff's claims, we apply a de novo scope of review. \"Choice-of-law determinations present legal questions, which are subjected to de novo review.\"\n   <em>\n    Fairfax Fin.

If so, then, we must consider whether the Legislature also intended the terms of the NJLAD to override conflicting Illinois law as to those claims.

Although the NJLAD does not expressly set forth a cause of action for discrimination based upon a plaintiff's association with a member of a protected class, case law has recognized the viability of such an associational claim under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This court has held \"where the plaintiff is wrongfully discharged for associating with a member of a protected group [under the NJLAD], that is the functional equivalent of being a member of the protected group.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Lone v.

Accordingly, a plaintiff closely associated with such a disabled person or other member of a protected class can serve as the \"functional equivalent\" of an \"aggrieved person\" under section 5-13 of the NJLAD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Downs v.

First, did our Legislature intend the NJLAD to be broad enough to extend to certain nonresidents such as\n   plaintiff who seek employment in New Jersey?

Equally broadly, N.J.S.A. 10:5-12(a) prohibits the discriminatory refusal \"to hire or employ\" and the discriminatory discharge of \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   individual\" on the basis of that individual's protected characteristics, which include race, gender, religion, and\n   disability, among others.

The factual allegations before us, as pleaded in the complaint, are materially distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Buccilli\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Indeed, in several respects, the present facts are the converse of\n   <em>\n    Buccilli\n   </em>\n   . Here, plaintiff resides\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   of this state, and the defendant company is based\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   New Jersey. Unlike Ms. Buccilli, plaintiff worked for the company in his state of residence, but sought a promotion to a position in New Jersey. He contends the discriminatory conduct by defendants occurred in New Jersey, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Buccilli\n   </em>\n   the alleged discriminatory conduct took place in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Defendants and ANJMA focus upon passages in\n   <em>\n    Buccilli\n   </em>\n   in which we observed that Ms. Buccilli's \"employment began and ended in Pennsylvania,\" that she \"worked exclusively in that state,\" and that \"the conduct she alleges was unlawful occurred there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"407064\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/283/6/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"407064\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/283/6/\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"407064\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/283/6/\">\n    660 A.2d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the defendants' business was located in Pennsylvania, and there was no nexus to New Jersey other than Ms. Buccilli's residency in this State. We continue to agree those circumstances correctly tipped the scales in\n   <em>\n    Buccilli\n   </em>\n   in favor of the application of Pennsylvania law to that particular plaintiff's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Even so, in the wake of the Supreme Court's subsequent precedent in\n   <em>\n    Camp Jaycee\n   </em>\n   and its adoption of the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   factors,\n   <em>\n    Buccilli\n   </em>\n   should not be misread to impose a bright-line choice-of-law principle that all employment discrimination claims must be governed by the law of the state where a plaintiff exclusively or principally worked. Although a plaintiff's place of work is surely an important consideration, it is not always dispositive. Other aspects of the case may at times override it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   A rigorous application of sections 6(2), 145, and 146 factors to plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim shows that New Jersey law, not Illinois law, must govern that particular claim. Most of those factors are heavily influenced by the fact that the new position\n   sought by plaintiff and other potential applicants was going to be located in this state, where the defendant company Phibro is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   For starters, we are persuaded that under section 6(2)(a), the \"needs of the interstate ... systems\" are generally best served by applying the law of the state where a job opening will be filled. Indeed, that coincides with the expressed desire of defendants and the ANJMA to have uniformity in the law applicable to the same group of employees or prospective employees. If a job vacancy is in New Jersey, it would be unwieldy for an employer to have each applicant's quest for the post individually governed by the law of the state or country in which he or she presently happens to live. Instead, it makes sense to have all applicants treated under one set of state laws. The \"needs\" of the system favor such uniformity in a hiring context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Turning to subsections (b) and (c), the policies and interests of this state and other jurisdictions are fairly accommodated by applying local law to an employer's conduct in filling a job opening. There is little reason to think that other jurisdictions would want their laws extended to hiring decisions made elsewhere, particularly if that meant, reciprocally, that employers in their own states would have to grapple with applying the laws of numerous other jurisdictions each time they filled a position that drew job-seekers from other places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Next, subsection (d) concerns the \"protection of justified expectations.\" Here, a person such as plaintiff seeking a job in New Jersey would reasonably expect the laws of New Jersey to govern the hiring and selection process. So too would Phibro, as a New Jersey employer. Indeed, although they do not literally cover plaintiff's claims, the agreements drafted by Phibro reciting that\n   New Jersey law governs various other aspects of plaintiff's work relationship are at least evidence of such company expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   As for subsection (e), the \"basic policies\" underlying antidiscrimination laws favor applying the NJLAD to the hiring of workers who will be employed in this state. The strong and expansive public policies of the NJLAD, which we have already discussed, would be weakened if each job applicant did not get the full benefit of those protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Further, the values of \"certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result\" under subsection (f) are logically advanced by having New Jersey antidiscrimination laws apply to each applicant for a job located in New Jersey. So would the \"ease\" in determining and applying that single set of state laws, consistent with section 6(2)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The enumerated factors of sections 145 and 146 of the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   for tort-based claims also point towards applying New Jersey law to plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Regarding section 146, it is unclear where the \"place of injury\" occurred because discovery has not been conducted. We recognize that the \"injury\" to a disappointed job-seeker arguably is felt by each applicant in the place he or she resides, here being Illinois. Even so, the complaint alleges that the place where the discriminatory denial of the promotion occurred was New Jersey, although that locale is not conceded by defendants. Because the place of injury relating to this claim is not easily identified from the record,\n   <em>\n    In re Accutane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501451\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/503/#p254\">\n    235 N.J. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501451\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/503/#p254\">\n    194 A.3d 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we must turn to section 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Under section 145(1), which cross references the factors in section 6 we have already discussed, New Jersey plainly has the most significant relationship to the failure-to-promote claim. The various \"contacts\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   set forth in section 145(2)(a) through (d) weigh in favor of applying New Jersey law to this failure-to-promote claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Regarding section 145(2)(a), the place of plaintiff's injury is, as we have noted, debatable. In addition, under section 145(2)(b), the place of the defendants' alleged wrongful conduct is also presently unclear. The considerations of domicile, residency, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business under section 145(2)(c) have mixed aspects. But the overall weight of those considerations manifestly tips in favor of New Jersey, the state of Phibro's business and where the new position was to be located. Moreover, under section 145(2)(d), New Jersey would be the place where the parties' future relationship would be \"centered\" upon filling the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   All in all, the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   analysis under sections 6, 145, and 146 produces a logical and overarching nexus to New Jersey with respect to plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim. The trial court erred in ruling otherwise and applying Illinois law to that particular cause of action. We accordingly reverse the court's dismissal of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    The Wrongful Discharge Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   As the Attorney General aptly recognizes, the choice-of-law analysis for plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim is more difficult than the failure-to-promote claim, especially given the present state of the limited record. The state with the most significant relationship to that particular claim is not yet readily apparent. We mention in that regard a few preliminary considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Plaintiff worked for defendants in Illinois, the state where he also lived. He was removed from that Illinois position by his New Jersey-based employer. The parties do not agree on the location(s) where the company officers made the decision to fire plaintiff. The record is also uninformative about the state where plaintiff allegedly acted improperly at the trade show, and exactly where the ensuing communications took place that led to his removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Given this context, the factor-by-factor\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   analysis may differ with respect to plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim, as compared to his failure-to-promote claim. For example, plaintiff's post-discharge conduct in obtaining unemployment benefits under the laws of Illinois arguably may affect section 6(2)(d) (\"the protection of justified expectations\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, because the job from which plaintiff was fired was located at the Illinois office, the company arguably would have reasonable expectations that all of its supervisors and employees at that office, including plaintiff, would be commonly governed by Illinois employment laws. The \"place of injury\" under sections 145(2)(a) and 146 also seems to point to Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   On the other hand, if plaintiff can establish that the company's decision to fire him was made or centered in New Jersey, that would be a counterweight on the New Jersey side of the scale. Many other facts and factors may also bear upon the calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   We do not adopt plaintiff's argument that if the decision to terminate him was made by individuals physically located in\n   New Jersey, that singular nexus must necessarily overcome all other factors that may weigh elsewhere. For example, if hypothetically the firing decision were made by company officials while they all were on a business trip in Florida, that happenstance surely would not require Florida law to apply. The state where the decision was made - even assuming that is a singular place that can be ascertained - is simply one of many factors in the overall mix in identifying the state having the most significant relationship to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Rather than attempt to resolve this discrete choice-of-law assessment on an incomplete and disputed record, we remand that issue for a fuller development of the facts. Those facts should\n   enable a new, more informed ruling by the trial court applying sections 6(2), 145, and 146 factors of the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   to plaintiff's wrongful discharge claim. The trial court shall oversee the discovery needed to develop these issues, and reconsider its choice-of-law ruling upon renewed motion practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   We do not forecast the outcome of this process, except to note that it would be legally permissible for New Jersey law to apply to plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim and for Illinois law to apply to his wrongful discharge claim. Conversely, the application of New Jersey law to both claims remains a conceivable option as well, depending on the development of the record affecting the\n   <em>\n    Second Restatement\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   We conclude with two observations that concern the practical significance of our decision today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   First, we are cognizant that the choice-of-law analysis becomes increasingly more complicated in our world as employees and their supervisors more often perform their work tasks remotely in multiple locations rather than in a traditional common physical location. The \"office\" where an individual works can be an elusive or non-existent concept these days. Work is now conducted often via digital means transcending jurisdictional boundaries. These trends invariably complicate the application of geographic factors in determining which states' laws apply to an employment relationship, absent agreement of the parties. We do not presume in this opinion to begin to resolve those innumerable hypothetical scenarios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Our second parting observation is that we expect employers will attempt to resolve uncertainty about the governing law by including in employment agreements clear and explicit choice-of-law provisions. Of course, such provisions in form employment contracts must be sufficiently clear in order to bind the parties,\n   <em>\n    Martindale v.
