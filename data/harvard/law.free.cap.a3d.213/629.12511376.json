The marital trust, which was created in Michigan, consisted of qualified terminable interest property or \"QTIP\" that was reported on the decedent's federal estate tax return, but was omitted from the Estate's corresponding Maryland estate tax return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In a reported opinion,\n   <em>\n    Comptroller of the Treasury v.

Is the value of a surviving spouse's interest in a QTIP trust created in another state properly included in the surviving spouse's Maryland estate, and therefore subject to the Maryland estate tax?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Did the Tax Court improperly waive a late-filing penalty when waiver must be supported by affirmative evidence and the only basis cited for the waiver was the personal representative's erroneous interpretation of the tax laws?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The personal representative filed a cross-petition with the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Is [the Comptroller's] taxation of the QTIP trust in the [E]state unconstitutional?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Is the fact that an issue was raised before the Tax Court, but not expressly decided by that agency, sufficient to permit review of that issue on appeal from the agency ruling?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals on the first issue. We conclude that, upon the death of decedent's surviving spouse, Margaret Beale Taylor (\"Ms. Taylor\"), the QTIP trust assets were deemed to be transferred upon her death and that transfer was taxable by Maryland. As to issue two, we answer in the negative, concluding that the Tax Court properly waived the late-filing penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With respect to the cross-petition, we consider the second issue first, concluding that this Court's review is limited to the\n   Tax Court's findings and to the reasons for those findings. Because the Tax Court did not expressly address a constitutionality argument in its written opinion, we decline to review the personal representative's first issue in the cross-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The instant tax dispute arose from events that were triggered by the death of Ms. Taylor's husband, John Wilson Taylor (\"Mr. Taylor\"). Mr. Taylor predeceased Ms. Taylor on December 1, 1989. At the time of Mr. Taylor's death, Mr. and Ms. Taylor were residents of Wayne County, Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Taylor died with a valid Will dated September 1, 1982. The Will directed the creation of a \"residuary marital trust,\" consisting of a portfolio of eleven different parcels of stocks and bonds valued on Mr. Taylor's date of death at $2,299,893.20. Mr. Taylor's Will directed that the net income from the residuary marital trust be paid to Ms. Taylor at least annually for and during her lifetime and that upon Ms. Taylor's death, the trust assets would be dispersed to the trust beneficiaries, Mr. Taylor's son and grandchildren.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon the death of Mr. Taylor, the personal representative for his estate filed a timely federal tax return with the Internal Revenue Service in which the estate claimed a deduction for the marital trust, known as a qualified terminable interest property (\"QTIP\") election. Election of the QTIP deduction enables a married couple to defer payment of any estate tax on the transfer of the QTIP until the death of the surviving spouse. The marital deduction is allowed for the entire value of the QTIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202044\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c) ; 2056(b)(7)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following Mr. Taylor's death, Ms. Taylor continued to reside in Michigan until 1993, when she moved to Washington County, Maryland. She died testate on January 15, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The personal representative filed a federal Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return with the Internal\n   Revenue Service, which included the value of the property in the marital trust. On the federal estate tax return, the personal representative reported an Estate value of $5,582,245. The personal representative also filed a Maryland estate tax return, in which he excluded the value of the marital trust, decreasing the reported value of Ms. Taylor's federal gross estate by $4,108,048.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The personal representative explained his deduction of Ms. Taylor's interest in the marital trust in a statement attached to the Maryland return. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In reliance on Section 7-309(b)(6)(i)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   of the Maryland Tax-General Code Annotated, the marital trust created under the Last Will and Testament of decedent's deceased spouse, John Wilson Taylor, in which decedent had an income interest for life and which is reported on Schedule F of decedent's Federal Estate Tax Return, Form 706, has been excluded from the federal gross estate (line 1, federal Form 706) reported on line 1 of Section IV of the MET-1. John Wilson Taylor died on December 1, 1989, and was a resident of the State of Michigan on the date of his death. No Maryland estate tax return was filed for Mr. Taylor, and thus no \"marital deduction qualified terminable interest property election was made for the decedent's predeceased spouse on a timely filed Maryland estate tax return.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After examining the Maryland estate tax return, the Comptroller disallowed the claimed exclusion of Ms. Taylor's interest in the marital trust, adding back the value to the federal gross estate and the corresponding Maryland estate. The Comptroller then sent the personal representative a Deficiency Notice, which added interest, a 10% late penalty, and\n   imposed a 25% penalty \"due on underpayment attributable to substantial estate tax valuation.\"\n   In a letter to the Comptroller dated January 20, 2014, the personal representative protested the Deficiency Notice and objected to the Comptroller's demands. The personal representative asserted that Maryland had no taxable interest in the trust assets, citing to Maryland Code, Tax-General (\"Tax-Gen.\") \u00a7\u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i), 7-302, and 26 U.S.C \u00a7 2044, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 28, 2014, the Comptroller sent a revised Deficiency Notice, waiving the 25% penalty, but retaining the 10% late penalty.

In considering this\n   State's authority to tax the trust's assets, the Tax Court concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [T]he Maryland estate tax is directly linked to the federal estate tax, and completely integrated with it. The linkage and integration is accomplished by adopting, at the outset, the federal definition of \"gross estate.\" Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-301(b).

According to the circuit court, Ms. Taylor never had legal title to the trust assets because legal title was transferred to the trust beneficiaries. That property right vested in the beneficiaries at the time of Mr. Taylor's death in 1989.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The circuit court held that the federal QTIP election simply enabled the trust assets to be taxable as part of the federal estate; the election did not convert the trust assets into Ms. Taylor's personal property which could be subjected to Maryland estate tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The circuit court explained that, because the trust assets were not the property of Ms. Taylor, the only way for the State to impose taxes on the assets would be through statutory authority. After conducting a statutory analysis of Tax-Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 7-301(b) and (d), 7-302, and 7-309(b)(5) and (b)(6), the circuit court concluded that the Tax Court had erred in assessing the estate tax on the trust assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The circuit court also held that imposition of a Maryland estate tax on the trust assets violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights, because the State had taxed property outside its jurisdiction and taxed an item from which this State had received no benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Court of Special Appeals Proceeding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court.

Therefore, the provision is inapplicable for reducing the value of Ms. Taylor's Estate. The unambiguous plain language of the statute renders it irrelevant to any reduction in Ms. Taylor's Estate. In addition, the definition of an \"estate\" provides that Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-309(b)(6) applies to those properties \"not otherwise included in the federal gross estate[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-301(b). In the case at bar, Ms. Taylor's QTIP was included in her federal gross estate under applicable federal law and there was no additional property to augment the Maryland estate.

The definition of an \"estate\" was also amended in Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-301 to reflect the changes in \u00a7 7-309(b)(5) and (6). As\n   discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the text of \u00a7 7-309(b)(5) and (6) enabled Maryland estates to make inconsistent QTIP elections on their federal and Maryland estate tax returns. In sum, the effect of SB 2 on Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-309 was merely to enable inconsistent QTIP elections due to the 2001 federal Act, contrary to the dissent and personal representative's contention that Mr. Taylor's estate\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   to elect a marital deduction on its Maryland return. The historical context of SB 2 provides that Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-309(b)(5) and (6) simply sought to retain the Maryland estate tax by ensuring that Maryland estate taxes were captured even if an estate opted not to make a federal QTIP election: this State opted to maintain the benefit of estate taxes. The concern was not over whether an estate filed a\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   QTIP election because the statute meant to clarify that this State could collect an estate tax absent a federal election. Interpreting the statute otherwise could result in a loophole, whereby this State \"would tax only the QTIP trusts that were elected in Maryland tax returns, and not QTIP trusts that were created in other States, where the beneficiary of the trust resided in Maryland at the time of death.\"\n   <em>\n    Concurring opinion\n   </em>\n   at 109 n. 6, 213 A.3d at 648 n. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We conclude that both the plain language and legislative history of Tax-Gen. \u00a7 7-309 reveal that the value of Ms. Taylor's estate is the same for federal and\n   Maryland estate tax purposes. As provided by the Tax Court, there is no provision that authorizes the personal representative \"to subtract the value of Ms. Taylor's QTIP property from her federal gross estate for Maryland Estate tax purposes.\" Upon her death in Maryland, Ms. Taylor had a property interest in the lifetime income from the residuary trust.

Rather, the Comptroller asserts that the personal representative failed to produce affirmative evidence to demonstrate reasonable cause for the late penalty abatement. Specifically, the Comptroller argues that reasonable cause is generally defined by the exercise of \"ordinary prudence\" and the \"degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\" Because the personal representative failed to provide affirmative evidence that the Estate acted with \"ordinary prudence,\" the Comptroller contends that the Tax Court improperly waived the late penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Contrary to the Comptroller's argument, we conclude that the personal representative did provide sufficient affirmative evidence for waiver of the late penalty. The Personal Representative contends that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The evidence before the Tax Court included the letters to the Comptroller from the Personal Representative, which specifically set forth the [legal] reasons why the Personal\n   Representative thought the tax on the QTIP was not due. The Personal Representative also submitted extensive briefing and argument before the Tax Court on why the tax was not due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Despite this evidence, the Comptroller contends that the evidence is insufficient for two reasons: (i) legal argument is inadequate to constitute sufficient affirmative evidence, and (ii) the personal representative's \"good faith\" argument cannot be conflated with a showing of \"reasonable cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We find it difficult to conceptualize that a coherent legal argument based on the peculiar facts of the case, even if erroneous, does not constitute sufficient affirmative evidence for waiving the late penalty. Furthermore, the Comptroller neglects to consider the history of Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-714 in advancing the \"good faith\" argument. When the General Assembly created the Tax-Gen. Article in 1988, Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-714 was codified as \u00a7 13-701(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1988 Md. Laws at 544. The Revisor's Note to that section specifies that \"[w]illfullness and intent are no longer determinative factors [for waiving a taxing penalty] ...\n   <strong>\n    but may be considered as an element of 'reasonable cause\n   </strong>\n   [.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). According to the Revisor's Note, though good faith alone cannot operate to provide \"reasonable cause,\" good faith\n   <em>\n    may be considered\n   </em>\n   for waiving a late penalty. Certainly, the personal representative advanced a good faith argument, litigated before this Court for its relevance, to argue that Ms. Taylor's QTIP interest was not subject to Maryland estate tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Comptroller also disregards a 1985 opinion from the Attorney General, which provided advice on the \"Comptroller's authority to waive certain penalty and interest charges on late-filed sales and admissions tax returns.\" 70 Md.

As explained in the opinion, Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-714's predecessors, Article 81 \u00a7\u00a7 365(c) and 407(c), enabled waiver of penalties \"for cause shown\" and for \"good cause shown.\" We consider these terms equivalent to the \"reasonable cause\" standard before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The 1985 Opinion of the Attorney General found that 'cause' and 'good cause' are synonymous,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"a general test of 'ordinary prudence' or 'reasonable diligence' has been recognized as satisfying the 'good cause' standard.\" The Attorney General advised that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [T]he Comptroller has comparably broad discretion to determine whether a taxpayer had shown 'ordinary prudence' or 'reasonable diligence' and, hence, has met the statutory standard of good cause.

In other words, that taxpayer will have demonstrated 'ordinary prudence' or 'reasonable diligence' through a pattern of compliance with the applicable law, and the Comptroller may properly treat one instance of untimely filing as not vitiating that diligent track record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As such, the 1985 opinion provides that \"reasonable cause\" may be found under a variety of circumstances to enable the waiver of late penalties.

TG \u00a7 7-301(b) provides that the word \" '[e]state' means the federal gross estate of a decedent, ... as increased by any property not otherwise included in the federal gross estate that is deemed to be included pursuant to [TG] \u00a7 7-309(b)(6) [.]\" Thus, where a Maryland resident's property is subject to federal estate tax, it is also subject to the Maryland estate tax. TG \u00a7 7-301(b) does not make an exception from the Maryland estate tax for any particular kind of property, such as a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Nor does TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) include an exception from the Maryland estate tax for a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State. TG \u00a7 7-301(b)'s plain language belies the existence of such an exception; TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i)'s plain language does the same; and TG \u00a7 7-301(b)'s and TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i)'s legislative history establishes that the General Assembly did not intend to create such an exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   To begin, TG \u00a7 7-301(b) provides that the word \" '[e]state' means the federal gross estate of a decedent, ... as increased by any property not otherwise included in the federal gross estate that is deemed to be included pursuant to [TG] \u00a7 7-309(b)(6) [.]\" TG \u00a7 7-301(b) unambiguously demonstrates that: (1) the Maryland estate tax applies to all property of a Maryland resident that is subject to the federal estate tax; and (2) the Maryland estate tax also applies to any property of a Maryland resident that, under TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6), \"is deemed to be included\" in a Maryland estate. In other words, TG \u00a7 7-301(b) provides that TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6) can only \"increase[ ]\"-not decrease-the amount of property that is subject to the Maryland estate tax. It inescapably follows that TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6) cannot except any particular kind of property from the Maryland estate tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This interpretation of TG \u00a7 7-301(b) is consistent with the Tax Court's decision in this case.

TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   For purposes of calculating Maryland estate tax, a decedent shall be deemed to have had a qualifying income interest for life ... with regard to any property for which a marital deduction [QTIP] election was made for the decedent's predeceased spouse on a timely filed Maryland estate tax return under [ TG \u00a7 7-309(b) ](5)[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In turn, TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(5)(ii) states: \"An election under this paragraph made on a timely filed Maryland estate tax return shall be recognized for purposes of calculating the Maryland estate tax even if an inconsistent election is made for the same decedent for federal estate tax purposes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Read together, TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) simply mean that, where \"a marital deduction [QTIP] election was made for the decedent's predeceased spouse on a timely filed Maryland estate tax return[,]\" TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i), the decedent's interest in the QTIP trust is subject to the Maryland estate tax-regardless of whether the decedent's interest in the QTIP trust is also subject to the federal estate tax,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(5)(ii). TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) make clear that, even if a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust is not subject to the federal estate tax, it is nonetheless subject\n   to the Maryland estate tax if the QTIP election was made in a timely filed Maryland estate tax return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Nothing in TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) indicates that the Maryland estate tax does not apply to a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State. Stated otherwise, although TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) establish that the Maryland estate tax applies to a Maryland resident's interest in a\n   QTIP trust if the QTIP election was made in a timely filed Maryland estate tax return, TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) do not state or imply that that is the only circumstance under which the Maryland estate tax can apply to a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust. In short, TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) do not, in any way, contradict TG \u00a7 7-301(b)'s edict that all of a Maryland resident's property that is subject to the federal estate tax is also subject to the Maryland estate tax. This interpretation of TG \u00a7 7-301(b) and TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) squares with this Court's practice of harmonizing statutes that \"appear to apply to the same situation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Blackstone v.

The dissent does not reach this conclusion by simply interpreting the plain language of TG \u00a7 7-301(b) or TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) in a different way than the majority and concurring opinions do. Instead, the dissent would hold that Maryland lacks \"the statutory and constitutional authority to tax the assets\" at issue in the first place. Dissent Op. at 111, 213 A.3d at 649. The dissent addresses the statutory authority issue by noting that TG \u00a7 7-301(d) states: \" 'Maryland estate' means the part of an estate that this State has the power to subject to the Maryland estate tax.\" Dissent Op. at 110, 213 A.3d at 649. As the Court of Special Appeals did, the dissent extrapolates from TG \u00a7 7-301(d) the notion that \"the legislature explicitly contemplated the possibility that there would be property included in an 'estate' that Maryland does not have the authority to tax,\n   contrary to the assertions of the Tax Court and the Comptroller, that Maryland has the power to tax everything in the estate simply because it was in the federal estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up).

The Department of Legislative Services explained that proposed TG (2006) \u00a7 7-309(b)(5)(ii) was not expected to affect revenues from the Maryland estate tax because the Comptroller's existing practice was to allow an estate to make a QTIP election in a Maryland estate tax return even if the estate made an inconsistent election in a federal estate tax return.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Two matters are conspicuously absent from the Fiscal and Policy Note. First, nowhere did the Department of Legislative Services state or imply that the 2006 amendments to the statutes that govern\n   the Maryland estate tax would create an exception from the Maryland estate tax for a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4. Second, the Department of Legislative Services did not indicate that any QTIP-related amendment would reduce revenues from the Maryland estate tax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. It is reasonable to expect that, if the 2006 amendments to the statutes that govern the Maryland estate tax had created an exception from the Maryland estate tax for a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State, the Fiscal and Policy Note would have stated as much, and would have included an estimate of the resulting reduction in revenues from the Maryland estate tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Indeed, if we adopted Taylor's position that the 2006 amendments created an exception from the Maryland estate tax for a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State, that would mean that the General Assembly essentially created a tax loophole by enacting\n   TG (2006) \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, suppose that two Maryland residents are married to each other. One spouse creates a QTIP trust outside of Maryland, bequeaths an interest in it to the other spouse, and then dies. The surviving spouse inherits the interest in the QTIP trust, and continues to live in Maryland for the rest of his or her life. Under Taylor's interpretation of TG (2006) \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i), once the surviving spouse dies as well, the interest in the QTIP trust would not be subject to the Maryland estate tax, simply because the QTIP trust was created outside of Maryland-even though, to reiterate, the surviving spouse was a Maryland resident when he or she died. I do not believe that the General Assembly intended TG (2006) \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) to allow such a windfall for the surviving spouse's heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In sum, under TG \u00a7 7-301(b), where a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State is subject to the federal estate tax, it is also subject to the Maryland estate tax. And, TG \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) does not create an exception,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a loophole, from the Maryland estate tax for a Maryland resident's interest in a QTIP trust that was created in another State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Dissenting Opinion by Getty, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the Majority's conclusion as to the first issue and would hold that Maryland lacks the power to tax a qualified terminable interest property (\"QTIP\") trust\n   that was never claimed on a Maryland tax return.

Through this process, Maryland joined a minority of jurisdictions that retained their estate taxes, concurrently retaining the possibility of inconsistent estate filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For decedents living in these states, the Majority's interpretation of the QTIP scheme creates a serious risk of double or inconsistent taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   A simple twist on the facts of this case, briefly considered at the hearing of the Circuit Court, illustrates this result. Consider a scenario in which Mr. Taylor died in Maryland, and his Maryland estate made an identical inconsistent filing, claiming the QTIP deductible only on its federal tax return. In these circumstances, Maryland could impose its estate tax on the initial transfer of Mr. Taylor's assets, occurring in Maryland at the time of his death and the creation of the trust through his will. Nevertheless, the trust assets will still be \"deemed\" a part of Mrs. Taylor's federal estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202044\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and 2056(b) for the purpose of recovering the federal estate tax deferred upon Mr. Taylor's death. Should this fictional transfer enable Maryland to impose its estate tax, the State would now be taxing the QTIP assets twice - once upon Mr. Taylor's death, and once upon the death of his surviving spouse - even though Mrs. Taylor never actually owned or controlled those assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Alternatively, suppose Mr. Taylor was a Massachusetts resident at the time of his death and his estate made both a federal and state-level QTIP election. Like Maryland, Massachusetts enacted legislation following the 2001 EGTRRA that decoupled its estate tax from the federal credit to avoid phasing out its tax alongside the federal credit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 65C, \u00a7 2A. In accordance with Massachusetts' QTIP scheme, Mr. Taylor's estate would be \"treated as passing to\n   the surviving spouse.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 65C, \u00a7 3A(a). In theory, these assets would be constitutionally taxable by Massachusetts upon Mrs. Taylor's death to recover the benefit afforded by the initial deferral. However, should Mrs. Taylor relocate to Maryland before her death, the Majority's interpretation would also allow Maryland to impose its tax due to the federal deemed transfer.\n   Maryland, despite having never afforded any benefits or privileges to Mr. Taylor's estate in either of these scenarios, would receive a significant windfall based solely on the relocation of his surviving spouse. \"Taxation is an intensely practical matter, and laws in respect of it should be construed and applied with a view of avoiding, so far as possible, unjust and oppressive consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3910985\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/280/204/#p210\">\n    280 U.S. at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3910985\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/280/204/#p210\">\n    50 S.Ct. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted by the Circuit Court, no information on record suggests that Mr. Taylor's estate deferred the Michigan estate tax by making a QTIP election on a Michigan tax return in 1984. Moreover, Michigan's estate tax remains linked to the federal estate tax credit and is therefore implicitly abrogated by the 2001 EGTRRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.C.L.A. \u00a7 205.232(1) (\"A tax is imposed upon the transfer of the estate of every person who at the time of death was a resident of this state. The tax is equal to the maximum allowable federal\n   credit under the internal revenue code for estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes paid to the states.\"). Therefore, Mr. Taylor's estate is not receiving a tax break: Had Mrs. Taylor remained in Michigan at the time of her death in 2014, she would only be paying a federal tax on the transfer of her estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In summation, Mrs. Taylor neither owned the corpus of the QTIP, nor received derivative privileges from the government of Maryland. The Comptroller is now attempting to tax these assets absent any nexus between the trust and the state of Maryland. Lacking any exchange of benefits, Maryland is not authorized to impose its estate tax under the Fourteenth Amendment. A contrary result creates a significant risk of double or inconsistent taxation, incompatible with the requirements of due process and the essential purpose of the QTIP taxation scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Maryland Code, Tax-General \u00a7 7-309(b)(6)(i) states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    For purposes of calculating Maryland estate tax, a decedent shall be deemed to have had a qualifying income interest for life under \u00a7 2044(a) of the Internal Revenue Code with regard to any property for which a marital deduction qualified terminable interest property election was made for the decedent's predeceased spouse on a timely filed Maryland estate tax return under paragraph (5) of this subsection.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Previous to the amendment, the Tax Court had not adjudicated the issue of the late penalty.
