Defendant and plaintiff agreed that plaintiff would receive a salary plus a percentage of investment gains. In reliance on that promise, but before receiving a confirming writing, plaintiff quit his job with an investment firm. Then, defendant reneged. After several months, plaintiff found another job. For the first year at his new employment, he earned less than the $ 250,000 annual base salary at the promised job, and he continued to earn less than the $ 400,000 average yearly compensation he alleged he earned at his prior job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Proceeding solely on a theory of promissory estoppel, plaintiff sought reliance damages consisting of the difference between what he would have earned had he not quit his job, and what he ultimately earned after securing substitute employment. He appeals from the judgment, after a jury trial, of $ 237,000 minus\n   applicable taxes. Plaintiff contends the\n   trial court (1) improperly barred his damages expert, who opined on what plaintiff would have earned had he not quit his job; and (2) erred in limiting his damages to the difference between the promised $ 250,000 base salary and his actual earnings for seventeen months (after which they exceeded $ 250,000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant cross-appeals, contending that plaintiff's claim was legally and equitably barred by regulations under the New Jersey Securities Law that require a written contract to provide services as an investment adviser; Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules limiting registered persons from providing services outside their current employment with a member firm; and the unclean hands doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before reaching these issues, we address plaintiff's argument that the trial judge should have recused herself upon plaintiff's pre-trial motion. Plaintiff moved for the judge's recusal after learning that a defense attorney, in an ex parte communication, sought the judge's assignment to the case, and the judge responded by specifically requesting the assignment from the presiding judge. We conclude this \"judge-shopping\" created an appearance of impropriety. On that basis, we vacate the trial judge's challenged rulings, but affirm the jury finding of liability. We decide de novo or as a matter of original jurisdiction that plaintiff was entitled to present evidence of his reliance damages; his expert should have been permitted to testify; and his claims were not barred by law or equity. We remand for a new trial on damages before a different judge. We turn first to the recusal motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The judge disclosed the ex parte communication in chambers, and confirmed it on the record. In summary, one of the judge's former law clerks, who was an associate at the defense firm, contacted the judge by text to inquire if she was available to\n   preside over the trial. The judge apparently had no prior connection to the case, which involved significant pre-trial motion practice. The former clerk identified the senior attorney at her firm who would try the case. The judge understood that the attorney liked to appear before her. The judge then spoke to the presiding judge and, relying on her seniority, secured assignment of the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When plaintiff's counsel learned that the judge's assignment of the case resulted from an ex parte contact with defense counsel, he sought the judge's recusal. At the outset of the colloquy, the judge reproached plaintiff's counsel for relying on statements made in chambers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL]: Judge, you stated in chambers that you had received a text message from [defense counsel's] firm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: No ... I did not say that. Let me be very clear about what I said, and let us be very clear about the following; neither one of you will be in my chambers for the rest of this trial. I am appalled that what had been the bedrock of practice, that what a judge tells you in chambers stays in chambers seems no longer to be the rule. So let me be very clear about what I said and I didn't say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judge then summarized what she had disclosed in chambers about the assignment request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Defense counsel's] firm had hired a prior law clerk of mine ... I think that was five years ago ... I told both counsel that [she] had texted me this morning saying that [defense counsel] was waiting around for a judge and I said well I'll be in and I'd love to take the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the course of the on-the-record colloquy, the judge later added that she requested the assignment from the presiding judge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I'll go further. I stopped in this morning and said, \"You got a case around here, because I'm a senior Judge, I don't like doing car accident cases.\" So in some ways I get my pick. ... Because that's what 25 years on the bench will get you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Once informed of the trial attorney's name, the judge said she understood he preferred to try the case before her. \"I got a text from a former law clerk that said [defense counsel] has a case, are you there? Yeah, he likes appearing before me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel argued that the ex parte contact amounted to \"judge shopping, because they like you and they want you to hear the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The judge rejected the argument, stating that it was common practice for attorneys to inquire about a judge's availability to take their case.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Counsel ... do you have any idea how many lawyers stop in my chambers on a weekly basis and say, Judge where you at, are you open? No, not today. Well when will you be open? Probably by Wednesday if you can get [the presiding judge] to wait that long.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The judge added that her former law clerks \"do it all the time ... hey Judge, the partner's coming, are you open? Yeah, I'm open.\" The judge concluded, \"There is nothing untoward about a judge telling a lawyer, I'm going to be open ... bring your case my way.\" The judge stated that she believed attorneys sought her assignment because of her experience and her reputation, and she challenged plaintiff's counsel to cite instances of bias or favoritism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, plaintiff contended that defendant promised him a base salary of $ 250,000 to $ 275,000, plus a fifteen- to twenty-percent share of gains generated on a portfolio of $ 75-100 million. Mid-trial, the judge barred plaintiff's damages expert. The judge also limited plaintiff's form of damages. As a result, plaintiff was prevented from claiming damages equal to the difference between what he would have earned had he not quit his job in reliance on defendant's promise, and his actual earnings after defendant reneged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court utilized the low end of the base salary for its instruction on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury found that defendant made a sufficiently clear and definite promise of employment, such that a reasonable person would rely on it; defendant expected plaintiff to rely on the\n   promise; and plaintiff quit his job in reliance on the promise of employment. It awarded damages based on the difference between his actual earnings and the base $ 250,000 salary defendant promised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff contends the court erred in denying his recusal motion. Plaintiff does not expressly ask us to reverse\n   the judgment on the basis of this error, but he asks us to consider it in reviewing the court's challenged rulings on expert testimony and damages. In his reply brief, plaintiff further contends that the court's actions reflected actual partiality toward defendant. Defendant responds that the judge did not err in denying the recusal motion, and that the former law clerk's ex parte contact was a permissible inquiry about scheduling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addressing the recusal issue, we are guided by several fundamental principles. Generally, recusal motions are \"entrusted to the sound discretion of the judge and are subject to review for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is just as damaging to the integrity of the judicial process when parties secure, without the opposition's knowledge or consent, the assignment of a judge they prefer. When the judge affirmatively facilitates his or her selection by that one party, public confidence and the appearance of impartiality are further undermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Applying these principles, we are persuaded that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying the recusal motion. Contrary\n   to\n   <em>\n    Code of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Conduct\n   </em>\n   Rule 3.8, the judge here considered and responded to an inappropriate ex parte communication from her former law clerk. The contact was not about scheduling, such as when the trial would occur. It was about judicial assignment - that is, who would preside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The prohibition of ex parte communications by attorneys does not bar \"routine and customary\" scheduling communications, but it \"does apply to communications for the purpose of having a matter assigned to a particular court or judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 113 cmt. c (Am. Law Inst. 2000). The reason is apparent. \"The prohibition applies to communications about the merits of the cause and to communications about a procedural matter the resolution of which will provide the party making the communication substantial tactical or strategic advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205642\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/601/#p607\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As set forth above, judge-shopping communications, by securing a desired assignment, can affect the court's decisions and undermine public confidence in its impartiality. Just as lawyers are prohibited from making such ex parte communications, judges may not consider them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this case, the judge's consideration of the ex parte communication, and her active participation in ensuring the case was assigned to her, compounded the usual concerns of judge-shopping and tainted the proceedings with the appearance of partiality. The source and manner of the ex parte communication - a text message from a former law clerk to the judge's cell phone - exacerbated the improper appearance that one party had exploited\n   a prior relationship with the judge. A reasonable person, informed of these facts, would have doubts about the judge's impartiality. Therefore, it is unnecessary to reach plaintiff's argument that the judge in fact favored defendant in the course of her rulings and conduct of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The record does not disclose whether, as the trial judge contends, it is common in her vicinage for attorneys to inquire directly of judges about their availability.

Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    DeNike\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff here does not demand a complete retrial.

To promote economy in the administration of justice, we should endeavor to avoid a retrial that would further burden the party most aggrieved by the trial judge's refusal to step aside.

In contrast to both\n   <em>\n    DeNike\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chandok\n   </em>\n   , the fact-finder in this case was a jury, not a judge who was so tainted by the appearance of impropriety as to require a retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We see no need to retry the jury's factual findings of liability - unchallenged on cross-appeal - that defendant made a\n   sufficiently clear and definite promise of employment such that a reasonable person would rely on it; defendant expected plaintiff to rely; and plaintiff did, quitting his job. Retrial of those findings would disserve the party aggrieved by the trial judge's refusal to recuse herself, undermine public confidence in the judicial process, complicate resolution of the dispute, and burden the administration of justice.
