In the Petition, Bar Counsel charged Mr. Sanderson with multiple violations of the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   throughout his representation of several clients, including: (i) MLRPC 1.1 (Competency); (ii) MLRPC 1.2 (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Attorney); (iii) MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence); (iv) MLRPC 1.4 (Communication); (v) MLRPC 1.5 (Fees); (vi) MLRPC 3.4 (Fairness to Opposing Party and Attorney); (vii) MLRPC 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and (viii) MLRPC 8.4 (Misconduct). The Petition also alleged several violations of the provisions regulating attorney trust accounts including: (i) Maryland Rule 19-407; (ii) Maryland Rule 19-408; (iii) Maryland Rule 19-410; and (iv) Md. Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), Business Occupations and Professions (\"BOP\") \u00a7 10-306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The charges emanated from various complaints filed with Bar Counsel against Mr. Sanderson, stretching across Mr. Sanderson's representation of several clients. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-722, we referred the Petition to Judge John S. Nugent of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a hearing to determine findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 19-727. The hearing spanned two days occurring on November 26 and 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 10, 2019, the hearing judge issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therein, he concluded that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.1; 1.2 (a) and (c); 1.3; 1.4(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b); 1.5(c); 1.15(a), (b), (c), and (d); 3.4;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   8.1; and 8.4(a), (c), and (e). The hearing judge also concluded that Mr. Sanderson violated Maryland Rules 19-410(b), 19-407, 19-408, and BOP \u00a7 10-306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both Mr. Sanderson and Bar Counsel filed exceptions to the hearing judge's findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law. In terms of his factual findings, both parties agree that the hearing judge incorrectly determined that Mr. Sanderson owed one of his clients, Ms. Sharon Ozel, $6,900 instead of $4,900. Mr. Sanderson also took exception to several of the hearing judge's conclusions of law, and each will be discussed at length within our analysis. Bar Counsel's sole exception to the hearing judge's conclusions of law concerned the hearing judge's failure to find that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 8.4(d). In terms of an appropriate sanction, Bar Counsel urged this court to disbar Mr. Sanderson; whereas, Mr. Sanderson recommended a more lenient sanction - a six-month suspension with an ability to reinstate once he satisfies certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court held oral argument in the matter on April 5, 2019. Although Larry Rogers, Esq., entered his appearance as counsel to represent Mr. Sanderson in these proceedings and although Mr. Rogers was present at oral argument, Mr. Sanderson argued on his own behalf. By per curiam order dated April 5, 2019, we disbarred Mr. Sanderson. In this opinion, we explain the reasons for that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We summarize the hearing judge's findings of fact and the record submitted at the attorney grievance hearing as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Sanderson's Legal Practice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Sanderson has been a member of the Bar of Maryland since 2005. He operates as a solo practitioner with offices in Baltimore City and Silver Spring. His practice has primarily focused on child in need of assistance (\"CINA\") cases, personal injury, criminal and immigration cases. Throughout the events described herein, Mr. Sanderson maintained a Maryland attorney trust account with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Bar Counsel Docket No. 2013-297-04-14\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The first complaint against Mr. Sanderson originated from his representation of a client, Olugboyega O. Odubanjo before Judge Patricia Mitchell of the District Court of Maryland sitting in Montgomery County. In short, Mr. Sanderson failed to appear in court on behalf of Mr. Odubanjo. As a result, Judge Mitchell filed a complaint against him with Bar Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 24, 2013, Mr. Odubanjo was charged with three potentially incarcerable traffic offenses. Mr. Odubanjo's initial trial date was set for August 9, 2012. After appearing before the court without counsel, Mr. Odubanjo requested a continuance so that he could retain counsel. The district court granted the continuance and rescheduled the hearing for January 24, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The day before Mr. Odubanjo's trial, i.e., January 23, 2013, Mr. Sanderson filed a motion for continuance and an entry of appearance on behalf of Mr. Odubanjo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the motion, Mr. Sanderson explained that he was unable to participate in the hearing scheduled for the following day because of a scheduling conflict. Further, Mr. Sanderson entered his appearance of Mr. Odubanjo the day prior to trial, knowing full well he would be unable to appear before the court if his motion were denied. On the morning of January 24, 2013, the district court\n   denied the motion because the court determined that Mr. Sanderson's action of \"accepting a case knowing of [ ] existing, conflicting trial dates did not constitute good cause for a [second] continuance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Unaware of the motion or its denial, Mr. Odubanjo appeared before the district court on January 24, 2013. When Mr. Odubanjo's case was called, Judge Mitchell delayed the hearing in attempt to locate Mr. Sanderson. Ultimately, Mr. Sanderson failed to appear on behalf of Mr. Odubanjo despite Judge Mitchell's denial of his motion for continuance. Mr. Sanderson's absence caused further delay in the resolution of Mr. Odubanjo's case and required the court to schedule a third hearing. Consequently, Mr. Odubanjo then terminated Mr. Sanderson's representation, and Judge Mitchell filed a complaint with Bar Counsel regarding Mr. Sanderson's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 14, 2013, after receiving Judge Mitchell's complaint, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Mr. Sanderson requesting he explain in writing why he failed to appear in court on Mr. Odubanjo's behalf. The communication indicated that Bar Counsel required additional information to determine whether the matter should be classified as a formal documented complaint or non-disciplinary in nature. Additionally, Bar Counsel's letter provided Mr. Sanderson with fifteen days to respond to the request. In a letter dated April 29, 2013, Mr. Sanderson provided Bar Counsel with an untimely response. Therein, he represented that he understood his actions were inappropriate but argued they were driven by a desire to assist Mr. Odubanjo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In correspondence dated March 14, 2013, Bar Counsel informed Mr. Sanderson that his case required additional review to determine whether he violated provisions of the MLRPC throughout his representation of Mr. Odubanjo. On May 23, 2013, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Mr. Sanderson that requested\n   he provide Bar Counsel with a copy of his entire client file for Mr. Odubanjo. In the letter, Bar Counsel provided Mr. Sanderson with a fifteen-day period to respond. Again, Mr. Sanderson failed to respond in a timely manner. On July 3, 2013, Mr. Sanderson responded to Bar Counsel's request for Mr. Odubanjo's client file. In this correspondence, with reference to a client file corresponding to his representation of Mr. Odubanjo, Mr. Sanderson replied that \"no such documents or documents [sic] exist[,]\" and denied that Mr. Odubanjo ever retained him as his attorney. Mr. Sanderson continued by stating, \"I attempt [sic] to get a postponement for Mr. Odubanjo, and if that would have been granted we were to make arrangements for representation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Conditional Diversion Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 6, 2014, based on Mr. Sanderson's alleged misconduct in his representation\n   of Mr. Odubanjo, Mr. Sanderson and Bar Counsel entered into a Conditional Diversion Agreement (\"CDA\"), pursuant to Maryland Rule 19-716.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement was for a period of two years and therein Mr. Sanderson agreed that he had violated MLRPC 1.1 by failing to appear on behalf of Mr. Odubanjo. As a condition of his agreement with Bar Counsel, Mr. Sanderson consented to the appointment of a monitor. The monitor's role involved providing oversight of certain aspects of Mr. Sanderson's practice, conducting regular communication and meetings with Mr. Sanderson, and filing reports with Bar Counsel at specified intervals. Under the CDA, Mr. Sanderson was also required to attend two legal education courses sponsored by the Maryland State Bar Association (\"MSBA\"): one course focusing on managing a law office and a second concerning attorney trust account management. The Attorney Grievance Commission approved the CDA on February 14, 2014 and stayed the corresponding disciplinary matter.\n   From the time of the CDA until Bar Counsel filed a petition to revoke the CDA on April 25, 2017, Midgett S. Parker Jr., Esq. of the Law Office of Linowes &amp; Blocher, LLP served as Mr. Sanderson's monitor. Within this period, Mr. Parker filed twelve reports with Bar Counsel. During Parker's tenure as Mr. Sanderson's monitor, he met with and counseled Sanderson multiple times. Following the meetings, Mr. Parker would draft communications regarding Mr. Sanderson's progress and communicate his conclusions to Bar Counsel. In each report, Mr. Parker indicated that Mr. Sanderson was receptive to his suggestions and guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Over the two-year time frame of the CDA, Mr. Sanderson completed several of the requirements. Despite this, the twelfth and final report by Mr. Parker, dated September 12, 2016, noted that Mr. Sanderson failed to attend any courses sponsored by the MSBA involving law office and attorney trust account management. On December 15, 2016, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Mr. Sanderson advising of his failure to comply with the CDA. At the time, Mr. Sanderson did not respond to or contest Bar Counsel's assertion. Consequently, Bar Counsel revoked the CDA and lifted the stay on the underlying disciplinary proceedings. While Mr. Parker monitored Mr. Sanderson, Bar Counsel received four other complaints against Mr. Sanderson. Bar Counsel engaged in further investigation into two of the four complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Bar Counsel Docket No. 2017-0152\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Shortly after Bar Counsel sent notice to Mr. Sanderson regarding his failure to comply with the CDA, Bar Counsel received a communication from Wells Fargo notifying it of an overdraft on Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account in the amount of $114.83. On January 25 and March 7, 2017, Bar Counsel sent letters to Mr. Sanderson which informed him that Bar Counsel was aware of the overdraft on his attorney trust account, requested a complete explanation of the overdraft, and requested access to records concerning Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust accounts. In both correspondences, Bar Counsel requested that Mr. Sanderson respond within ten\n   days. However, Mr. Sanderson failed to respond to either of Bar Counsel's inquiries. On April 10, 2017, Bar Counsel issued a subpoena requesting that Wells Fargo produce any and all records associated with Mr. Sanderson's trust account from January 1, 2016 until the date of the subpoena.\n   A month after Bar Counsel issued the subpoena, Mr. Sanderson left a voicemail for Bar Counsel in which he stated that he could \"submit the documents next week.\" Bar Counsel returned Mr. Sanderson's call, was unable to reach him, and left a voicemail. On May 11, 2017, Bar Counsel wrote again to Mr. Sanderson, mentioned the voicemail, and requested that Mr. Sanderson provide the requested documents by May 19, 2017. On June 15, 2017, Bar Counsel sent a letter to Mr. Sanderson reiterating the contents of the previous letter and providing Mr. Sanderson with a revised deadline to supply the documents - June 25, 2017. In the correspondence, Bar Counsel also requested to be informed if Mr. Rogers was representing Mr. Sanderson in the instant disciplinary matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 19, 2017, Wells Fargo responded to Bar Counsel's subpoena and provided extensive records concerning Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust and operating accounts. On June 22, 2017, Mr. Rogers wrote to Bar Counsel but failed to clarify the reason for the overdraft. Instead, Mr. Rogers only indicated that the overdraft was related to a filing fee in a civil case and the deficiency had since been rectified. Additionally, Mr. Rogers referred to Mr. Sanderson's compliance, or lack thereof, with the CDA and stated his intention to discuss subsequent complaints filed against Mr. Sanderson with Bar Counsel at a later date. On July 13, 2017, Bar Counsel sent another correspondence to Mr. Sanderson, and he again failed to respond. Altogether, Bar Counsel wrote Mr. Sanderson six times requesting an explanation for the overdraft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to each correspondence, Mr. Sanderson failed to timely\n   respond, failed to offer an adequate explanation, and failed to provide any records associated with his attorney trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the interim, Charles E. Miller, IV, an investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission, began to investigate Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account records as a result of the overdraft notice provided by Wells Fargo. During the review, in addition to the overdraft that acted as a catalyst for the investigation, Mr. Miller determined that Mr. Sanderson engaged in several impermissible practices on multiple occasions, including: (i) making cash disbursements from his attorney trust account; (ii) transferring funds from his operating account into his attorney trust account; (iii) failing to maintain client funds in trust until earned; and (iv) using client funds to pay other clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Miller determined that Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account overdraft originated from his representation of Sharon Ozel. In 2015, Ms. Ozel retained Mr. Sanderson to represent her in a personal injury matter involving a car accident. Initially, Ms. Ozel met with Mr. Sanderson at the Juvenile Justice Center in Baltimore to discuss the representation. During the meeting, Mr. Sanderson failed to adequately explain to Ms. Ozel the amount of his fee, but she testified at the disciplinary hearing that she believed he would receive a $2,000 sum from any settlement or judgment in the matter. Mr. Sanderson later negotiated a settlement in Ms. Ozel's personal injury action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In July 2016, Mr. Sanderson contacted Ms. Ozel and asked her to meet him at a movie theater in Owings Mills to provide\n   her with a check for $2,000. Ms. Ozel testified that Mr. Sanderson had her sign a form to release the $2,000, and never informed her of the $6,900 settlement check from USAA. Nevertheless, the record reflects that Mr. Sanderson had her sign the settlement check and a form to release $2,000.00. However, he failed to provide Ms. Ozel with a copy\n   of the form, never mentioned the $6,900 total, and did not provide her with the $2,000 check they had previously discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The hearing judge determined that \"[i]n late July 2016, [Mr. Sanderson] provided Ms. Ozel with an additional $2,000 and told her that money was still owed from a worker's compensation claim.\" Next, in December of 2016, Mr. Sanderson provided Ms. Ozel with a check for $2,900 which he represented emanated from a worker's compensation claim. Approximately a year later, while under investigation by Bar Counsel, Mr. Sanderson contacted Ms. Ozel. In a telephone conversation, Mr. Sanderson asked Ms. Ozel if she had been contacted by anyone regarding his representation of her. She informed him that, at the time, she had not been contacted by anyone. Approximately four or five days later, Ms. Ozel encountered Mr. Sanderson at the Baltimore City Juvenile Court. She testified that during this encounter, he again asked whether she had been contacted by anyone regarding his representation of her. He then instructed her that, if anyone were to contact her, she should inform them that she retained him in a different matter in addition to the personal injury matter, later changed her mind, and requested that he refund the $2,900. The record reflects that Ms. Ozel never retained Mr. Sanderson in another matter and therefore the statement he urged her to provide to any potential investigators was patently false. He then requested that Ms. Ozel repeat the information back to him in an apparent attempt to ensure that she memorized the narrative of falsehoods. According to Ms. Ozel's testimony, approximately one month later, he called her again. When she answered, he told her \"I'm sorry,\" and then hung up the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Miller's review of the financial records associated with Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account revealed that Mr. Sanderson had mismanaged client funds for several of his clients including Darren Parham and Duane Wilkinson. First, Mr. Miller determined that Mr. Sanderson used funds belonging to one client, Darren Parham, and used them to pay another client, Mattie Hines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   During his representation of Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. Sanderson received a settlement check for $40,000 from the Cincinnati Insurance Company. On November 28, 2016, he deposited the check into his attorney trust account. Of these funds, Mr. Sanderson paid Mr. Wilkinson $22,933.28. After disbursing his fee in the matter, funds remained in the trust account stemming from Mr. Sanderson's representation of Mr. Wilkinson. The record does not reflect the eventual fate of these funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    BC Docket No. 2016-1374\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Toumany Sangare is an immigrant from Guinea and was a resident of Montana at all times relevant to these grievance proceedings. In 2005, Mr. Sangare married a United States citizen, and his wife filed with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"UCIS\") a Petition for Alien Relative (\"I-130\") and an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (\"I-485\") on his behalf in March of 2006. On September 16, 2010, UCIS denied Mr. Sangare's I-130 and I-485 petitions and referred Mr. Sangare for removal proceedings. On December 1, 2010, the U.S. Immigration Court held a hearing on Mr. Sangare's removal proceedings. At the removal hearing, the court granted Mr.\n   Sangare a continuance to allow him opportunity to retain counsel. Mr. Sangare's next hearing was then scheduled for March 16, 2011. On that date, the court granted Mr. Sangare a second continuance and rescheduled the hearing for July 6, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On June 22, 2011, Mr. Sangare remarried.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the date scheduled for Mr. Sangare's hearing, Mr. Sanderson filed a motion for continuance and a notice of entry of appearance on behalf of Mr. Sangare, dated June 28, 2011. In his motion, Mr. Sanderson represented that he had another court appearance on the same date and at the same time in the District Court of Maryland Sitting in Baltimore County. Mr. Sangare appeared before the court without counsel and the court continued the matter until August 24, 2011. On August 11, 2011, Ms. Hamrick,\n   Mr. Sangare's new wife, filed a new I-130 petition on Mr. Sangare's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court held Mr. Sangare's removal hearing on August 24, 2011. When the case was initially called, both Mr. Sangare and Mr. Sanderson failed to appear. Therefore, the court moved the case to the end of its docket and, by the time the case was recalled, Mr. Sanderson appeared. In his interaction with the court, Mr. Sanderson conceded that Mr. Sangare was subject to removal but indicated that he would file another I-130 petition based on Mr. Sangare's second marriage. The record indicates that Mr. Sanderson failed to inform Mr. Sangare that he would not appear at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the interim, UCIS denied Mr. Sangare's second I-130 petition. The court provided Mr. Sanderson with notice of the denial, but he failed to advise Mr. Sangare of it or its significance. On July 17, 2013, Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Sangare appeared again before the U.S. Immigration Court for a status hearing. There, the court requested the basis for UCIS' denial of Mr. Sangare's I-130 petition but Mr. Sanderson indicated that he had not yet had a chance to review it with his client and therefore was unable to respond to the court's inquiry. Thereafter, the court set the matter for a voluntary departure hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 2, 2013, the court scheduled an individual hearing for Mr. Sangare for November 14, 2013 and sent notice of the hearing to Mr. Sanderson. Mr. Sanderson informed Mr. Sangare of the November hearing date. Afterwards, Mr. Sangare attempted to contact Mr. Sanderson to ascertain the time of the hearing. Mr. Sanderson failed to respond to Mr. Sangare's inquiry. On November 12, 2013, however, Mr. Sanderson called Mr. Sangare and inquired as to the time of the hearing. Mr. Sangare was unsure and informed Mr. Sanderson that he believed it would occur at 1:30 p.m. - the time at which the court had scheduled his prior hearings. Mr. Sangare asked Mr. Sanderson to confirm the time of the hearing and to contact him with that information but Mr. Sanderson ultimately failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the November 14, 2013 hearing, the court called Mr. Sangare's case; he and Mr. Sanderson were not present. As a result, the court deemed the case abandoned and entered an order of removal against Mr. Sangare. At 1:30 p.m., Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Sangare appeared before the court and learned of the order of removal. Mr. Sanderson filed a motion to re-open Mr. Sangare's case but ultimately failed to provide the court with any required\n   supporting affidavits. The court denied the motion on December 3, 2014. In the interim, Mr. Sanderson filed an appeal on behalf of Mr. Sangare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On June 20, 2016, the United States Board of Immigration Appeals denied Mr. Sangare's appeal. On July 11, 2016, Mr. Sangare filed a complaint against Mr. Sanderson with Bar Counsel. On July 18, 2016, Bar Counsel forwarded a copy of the complaint to Mr. Sanderson and requested that he provide a written response within fifteen days of receipt. Mr. Sanderson failed to reply in a timely manner in writing. Therefore, Bar Counsel sent another correspondence to Mr. Sanderson via certified mail requesting that Mr. Sanderson respond to the complaint within ten days. On approximately August 22, 2016, Mr. Sanderson's agent received the correspondence. Mr. Sanderson again failed to provide a timely response to Bar Counsel's inquiry. On September 16, 2016, Bar Counsel wrote to Mr. Sanderson yet again, including copies of the prior correspondences, advising him that an investigation was forthcoming, and requesting a response within ten days. Again, Mr. Sanderson failed to provide a timely response to Bar Counsel's correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    BC Docket No. 2015-2413\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On November 26, 2015, Mr. Sanderson was representing the parent of a child in a CINA case at a hearing before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Tuesday Racquel Isom-Cyrus, a social worker for Baltimore County Department of Social Services (\"BCDSS\"), testified at the hearing. After the hearing ended, Mr. Sanderson approached Ms. Isom-Cyrus in the hallway outside of the courtroom and, after a brief but\n   heated exchange of words, he called her a \"baby-snatching bitch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On November 30, 2015, Ms. Isom-Cyrus filed a complaint against Mr. Sanderson with Bar Counsel in reference to the incident that occurred four days earlier. On December 10, 2015, Bar Counsel sent a correspondence to Mr. Sanderson regarding Ms. Isom-Cyrus' complaint and requested that he respond within ten days. Mr. Sanderson failed to respond to Bar Counsel's inquiry in a timely manner. Therefore, Bar Counsel wrote to Mr. Sanderson again requesting that he respond within ten days. Again, Mr. Sanderson failed to provide Bar Counsel with a timely response. After failing to obtain a response from Mr. Sanderson, Bar Counsel wrote to Mr. Parker, Mr. Sanderson's monitor, requesting Mr. Sanderson provide a response to their inquiries. In a letter dated January 19, 2016, Mr. Sanderson responded to Bar Counsel's previous communications and indicated that he did not recall using any profanity toward Ms. Isom-Cyrus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On February 3, 2016, Bar Counsel sent another letter to Mr. Sanderson requesting additional information regarding his interaction with Ms. Isom-Cyrus. Mr. Sanderson failed to respond to the request. Accordingly, on March 15, 2016, Bar Counsel wrote to Mr. Sanderson again and requested that he provide the additional information requested in the prior correspondence. On April 27, 2016, Mr. Sanderson contacted Bar Counsel and requested an extension of time to provide the information. However, Mr. Sanderson ultimately did not comply with this extension and he failed to respond to Bar Counsel's communication. Therefore, on June 15, 2017 Bar Counsel wrote to Mr. Sanderson again requesting that he provide additional information within ten days. Again, Mr. Sanderson failed to respond, and on July 10 Bar Counsel re-issued the prior communication requesting a response.

Specifically, Mr. Sanderson takes exception to the hearing judge's findings regarding the impetus for his entry into the CDA with Bar Counsel and the balance due to Ms. Ozel stemming from Mr. Sanderson's representation of her in the personal injury action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With regard to the first exception, Mr. Sanderson contends that the hearing judge improperly determined that he entered into the CDA with Bar Counsel because of his failure to provide competent representation to Mr. Odubanjo. Instead, Mr. Sanderson represents that he entered into the CDA primarily due to Bar Counsel's concerns over the management and oversight of his law practice. However, there is little merit to Mr. Sanderson's exception. The CDA itself is included in the record and sets forth the circumstances surrounding Mr.\n   Sanderson's entry into the CDA. The document provides the following summary of events which led to Mr. Sanderson's first encounter with Bar Counsel and ultimately his entry into the CDA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   In his representation of Olugboyega O. Odubanjo, the Respondent failed to provide competent representation. Specifically, he failed to appear at trial on a motor vehicle matter on behalf of his client, Mr. Odubanjo, in the District Court of Maryland for Montgomery County before the Honorable Patricia Mitchell. Mr. Odubanjo was charged with three (3) incarcerable traffic violations. At the time Mr. Odubanjo retained [Mr. Sanderson], [Mr. Sanderson] was aware that he would be unable to appear at Mr. Odubanjo's scheduled hearing due to a conflict in which he had a court appearance on a separate client matter. [Mr. Sanderson] assumed that a continuance of the hearing would be granted by the court. [Mr. Sanderson] filed a motion for continuance the day before Mr. Odubanjo's hearing, which was denied by the court. Subsequently, [Mr. Sanderson] did not appear at Mr. Odubanjo's hearing. Mr. Odubanjo terminated [Mr. Sanderson's] representation. No refund was rendered to Mr. Odubanjo since he had not yet paid [Mr. Sanderson's] attorney's fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The CDA additionally indicates that Mr. Sanderson's conduct constituted a violation\n   MLRPC 1.1 and that \"[b]y signing this Agreement, [Mr. Sanderson] acknowledges that he has engaged in conduct that constitutes professional misconduct and warrants that he has not concealed from or misrepresented to Bar Counsel any material facts pertaining to his conduct or to the Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12500455\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/656/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Therefore, the agreement clearly indicates that Mr. Sanderson's entry into the CDA was compelled by his representation of Mr. Odubanjo which ran afoul of MLRPC 1.1. Mr. Sanderson's exception to this particular finding is driven by a piecemeal review of the agreement and, to some extent, a mischaracterization of its contents. In particular, paragraph six of the agreement summarizes Mr. Sanderson's admissions with respect to the complaint originating from his representation of\n   Mr. Odubanjo. It provides that Mr. Sanderson did not maintain a written calendar system and \"did not have any training in law practice [management].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12500455\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/656/#p261\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, although Mr. Sanderson's entry into the CDA was in part caused by Bar Counsel's concerns over Mr. Sanderson's office procedures, these concerns became known to Bar Counsel through investigation of Mr. Sanderson's competency, or lack thereof, during his representation of Mr. Odubanjo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, we determine that the hearing judge did not err in determining the catalyst of Mr. Sanderson's entry into the CDA with Bar Counsel. The agreement itself indicates that, although Mr. Sanderson failed to establish sufficient management and oversight procedures within his legal practice, the primary causal thrust for Bar Counsel's initial investigation of Mr. Sanderson, which led to his eventual entry into the CDA, was Mr. Sanderson's representation of Mr. Odubanjo. Accordingly, Mr. Sanderson's exception as to this finding is without merit and therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, both Mr. Sanderson and Bar Counsel take exception to the hearing judge's finding regarding the total amount due to Ms. Ozel and the number of payments Mr. Sanderson made to her. First, the hearing judge found that the total amount due to Ms. Ozel was $6,900 rather than $4,900. Before this Court, both Bar Counsel and Mr. Sanderson contend that the amount due to Ms. Ozel was actually $4,900, instead of $6,900. In his opinion, Judge Nugent found that \"[i]n late July 2016, [Mr. Sanderson] provided Ms. Ozel with an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   $2,000.00[.]\" (emphasis added). However, Ms. Ozel's testimony reflects that she only received two payments from Mr. Sanderson - one check for $2,000 in late July and another for $2,900 on December 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   During the hearing, Ms. Ozel also testified that, although Mr. Sanderson neglected to discuss his fee with her in great detail, she understood that he would receive $2,000 from the settlement. Similarly, Mr. Sanderson agrees that the total amount owed to Ms. Ozel was $4,900. Although the settlement check from USAA General Indemnity Company (\"USAA\") was\n   made payable to both Ms. Ozel and Mr. Sanderson, was for $6,900 the record indicates that $2,000 of the sum constituted Mr. Sanderson's fee and Ms. Ozel was only entitled to recover $4,900. Therefore, the hearing judge clearly erred with respect to the amount of money due to Ms. Ozel, and we therefore sustain this exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Another related exception involves the balance in Mr. Sanderson's escrow account during the period surrounding his receipt of funds from USAA and their disbursement. Mr. Sanderson argues that the hearing judge erred in finding that, two days after receiving the settlement check from USAA, Mr. Sanderson transferred $500 from the escrow account to his\n   business account which brought the balance below the amount owed to Ms. Ozel. However, this is primarily based on and related to the hearing judge's error regarding the total amount of funds Mr. Sanderson owed to Ms. Ozel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As mentioned above, Mr. Sanderson received the $6,900 settlement check from USAA on July 18, 2016 and deposited it into his attorney trust account. The next day, Mr. Sanderson transferred $2,000 of the settlement funds to his operating account. On July 20, Mr. Sanderson withdrew a second $2,000 from the trust account, with the memo \"Garland Atty[.]\" Based on the record before us, it is unclear as to which payment eventually made its way to Ms. Ozel, but we presume the transfer of funds on July 19 was likely associated with Mr. Sanderson's fee. Therefore, the $2,000 withdrawal the following day was likely Mr. Sanderson disbursing a portion of the settlement to Ms. Ozel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this withdrawal, his attorney trust account held $2,905.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Also, on July 20, Mr. Sanderson transferred $500 from the account to his business operating account. As a result, the balance in his attorney trust account dropped to $2,405.00, $495 less than the amount Mr. Sanderson owed to Ms. Ozel at\n   the time. In fact, the balance remained below $2,900 until July 27, 2016, when Mr. Sanderson deposited $700 under Ms. Ozel's client name without any descriptive phrase or words in the memo line, which brought the attorney trust account's balance up to $2,905.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ultimately, this surplusage of funds was short lived, because on August 4, 2016, Mr. Sanderson transferred $250 from his attorney trust account to his operating account, again under the client name of Ms. Ozel, but neglected to provide any indication as to its purpose. At this point, the balance in his attorney trust account fell to $2,605, leaving the trust account underfunded with respect to the amount that Mr. Sanderson still owed Ms. Ozel. This pattern continued until Mr. Sanderson ultimately paid Ms. Ozel the $2,900 over four months later on December 12, 2016. In the interim, Mr. Sanderson would routinely receive client funds, withdraw or transfer portions of it, and allow the attorney trust account to become underfunded, with the account holding as little as $5 on September 26, 2016 and as much as $44,759.55 on December 1, 2016. Although the hearing Judge erred with respect to the total amount Mr. Sanderson owed to Ms. Ozel, he correctly identified that Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account became underfunded, with respect to the amount that he owed Ms. Ozel, on the same day that Mr. Sanderson disbursed $2,000 to Ms. Ozel. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Next, Mr. Sanderson takes exception to the hearing judge's factual findings concerning potential misappropriation of funds from his former client, Ms. Brown. With reference to a monetary exchange between Mr. Sanderson and Ms. Brown, the hearing judge found Mr. Sanderson deposited a settlement check from the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (\"MAIF\") in the amount of $8,601.88 into his attorney trust account on June 28, 2016 which is adequately supported by the record. However, the same cannot be said for the hearing judge's ultimate determination regarding Mr. Sanderson misappropriating funds from Ms. Brown. The hearing judge found that, two days after the check was deposited, Mr. Sanderson\n   withdrew\n   $8,101.88 on June 30, 2016 and that \"there is no evidence that payment was ever made to Ms. Brown.\" However, the hearing judge's finding is problematic in two respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, in the initial complaint, Bar Counsel failed to raise any averments regarding Mr. Sanderson's potential misappropriation of funds from Ms. Brown. In fact, the only reference to Ms. Brown within the initial Petition is paragraph 53, which indicates that Mr. Sanderson provided a waiver of conflict agreement with regards to his representation of Ms. Brown. Aside from this, any allegations of misconduct regarding his representation of Ms. Brown are completely absent from the Petition. Previously, this Court has recognized that a hearing judge's findings must be appropriately limited to charges filed by Bar Counsel through the Petition.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Seiden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739037\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/409/#p418\">\n    373 Md. 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739037\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/409/#p418\">\n    818 A.2d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) ;\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Therefore, the hearing judge erred with respect to this determination. The purpose of limiting the hearing judge's findings to allegations contained within the complaint stems from procedural due process concerns.\n   <em>\n    In re Ruffalo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174216\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/544/#p551\">\n    390 U.S. at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174216\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/544/#p551\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Particularly, this procedure is intended to ensure that an attorney is given fair notice of all of the charges filed against the attorney.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174216\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/544/#p551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In the instant grievance proceedings, Bar Counsel's Petition lacked any corresponding allegations of disciplinary action with respect to Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Brown, and therefore, Mr. Sanderson was not adequately notified of the charges against him. Moreover, the finding is not sufficiently supported by the record. Although the records associated with Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account do not indicate that the withdrawal made on June 30, 2016 was given to Ms. Brown, during Bar Counsel's deposition of Mr. Sanderson, he stated under oath that Ms. Brown accompanied him to the bank and received the payment upon withdrawal, because she did not hold a checking account. He also indicated that the\n   $500 discrepancy between the amount of the MAIF check and the withdrawal on June 30, 2016 corresponded to his fee in the matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174216\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/544/#p551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, Bar Counsel failed to offer evidence, aside from copies of ledgers associated with Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account, which demonstrates that Mr. Sanderson misappropriated funds from Ms. Brown. Accordingly, we sustain Mr. Sanderson's exception to this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Sanderson takes exception to the hearing judge's finding of fact emanating from his representation of Ms. Ozel. More specifically, he asserts that he did not promptly disburse $2,900 of settlement funds to her because he was in the process of settling a \"boni [sic] fide lien from the Worker's Compensation fund[.]\" In support of his position, Mr. Sanderson attaches to his exceptions a purported email from an individual associated with Chesapeake Employers Insurance Company. In this email, dated March 12, 2018, the individual represents to Mr. Sanderson that the insurance company should have recovered $1,437.10 from \"[his] client[,]\" but the organization allowed the client to retain the funds. However, there are several problems associated with this exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, the email does not indicate that the communication is in reference to Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Ozel. In all actuality, the email does not identify Ms. Ozel by name. The only potentially identifying information contained within the correspondence are usage of female\n   pronouns in reference to the client and reference to one of Mr. Sanderson's clients receiving a third-party settlement in the amount of $6,900.00. The link between this email and Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Ozel without more identifying information is tenuous. Nevertheless, other circumstances surrounding this email and Mr. Sanderson's eventual payment to Ms. Ozel render unnecessary any further inquiry into this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Although Mr. Sanderson submits that his payment to Ms. Ozel was significantly delayed due to the potential worker's compensation lien, the exhibit he provided and the associated timelines clearly demonstration that his contention is without\n   merit. Particularly troubling, the email from Chesapeake Employers Insurance Company is dated March 12, 2018. However, Mr. Sanderson did not disburse the remaining $2,900 to Ms. Ozel until December 12, 2018. In the email, an employee of the insurance company informed Mr. Sanderson that Ms. Ozel will be able to retain the funds which, prior to this point, a question remained as to whether they would be subject to Injured Worker's Insurance Fund (\"IWIF\") withholding. Therefore, based on Mr. Sanderson's own exhibit, he received notice that there would be no withholding associated with Ms. Ozel's claim nine months before eventually releasing the funds to his client. Despite Mr. Sanderson's insistence that he had \"a legitimate reason for not promptly dispersing [sic] the $2,900 in settlement funds to Ms. Ozel[,]\" whatever legitimacy can be attributed to that reason ceased at some point after March 12, 2018. Mr. Sanderson offers no explanation for the nine-month delay in providing the funds to Ms. Ozel. Therefore, on this basis, we cannot conclude that the hearing judge clearly erred with respect to this finding. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Review of the Hearing Judge's Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition to Mr. Sanderson's exception to the hearing judge's findings of fact, he also takes exception to several of the hearing judge's conclusions of law. Specifically, Mr. Sanderson takes exception to the hearing judge's conclusions that he violated: (i) MLRPC 1.1 in BC Docket No. 2012-297-04-14 by failing to provide competent representation to Mr. Odubanjo; (ii) MLRPC 1.1 in BC Docket No. 2017-0152 by failing to provide Ms. Ozel with competent representation; and (iii) MLRPC 1.2 by failing to recognize the scope of representation and the allocation of decision-making authority between attorneys and their clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In terms of exceptions to the hearing judge's conclusions of law, Mr. Sanderson first takes exception to several of the hearing judge's evidentiary rulings. Mr. Sanderson argues that the hearing judge erred when he permitted several pieces of evidence to be admitted, because the exhibits lacked appropriate\n   evidentiary foundations. The records Mr. Sanderson contends were erroneously admitted by the hearing judge include: (i) bank records; (ii) communications from the Attorney Grievance Commission to Mr. Sanderson; and (iii) complaints from the Attorney Grievance Commission. In addition, Mr. Sanderson argues that the hearing judge erred in admitting records and testimony provided by Mr. Miller, because he was not properly qualified as an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mr. Sanderson first takes issue with the hearing judge's admittance of bank records that the Attorney Grievance Commission acquired from Wells Fargo through subpoena. In his exceptions filed with this Court, Mr. Sanderson fails to identify any specific basis upon which he takes exception to this evidentiary ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, at the hearing, Mr. Sanderson objected to the introduction of the Wells Fargo Bank records on grounds that he was not informed of Bar Counsel's intent to introduce the bank records prior to the start of his hearing as required by the associated Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(6) provides the following limitations on the admission of business records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (6) Records of Regularly Conducted Business Activity. A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses if (A) it was made at or near the time of the act, event, or condition, or the rendition of the diagnosis, (B) it was made by a person with knowledge or from information transmitted by a person with knowledge, (C) it was made and kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and (D) the regular practice of that business was to make and keep the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation. A record of this kind may be excluded if the source of information or the method or circumstances of the preparation of the record indicate that the information in the record lacks trustworthiness. In this paragraph, \"business\" includes business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In close connection with this Rule, Maryland Rule 5-902(b)(1) establishes certain procedural steps that a party seeking to introduce business records under Rule 5-803(b)(6) must follow:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (1) Procedure. Testimony of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required as to the original or a duplicate of a record of regularly conducted business activity, within the scope of Rule 5-803 (b)(6) that has been certified pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this Rule, provided that\n   <strong>\n    at least ten days prior to the commencement of the proceeding in which the record will be offered into evidence, (A) the proponent (i) notifies the adverse party of the proponent's intention to authenticate the record under this subsection and (ii) makes a copy of the certificate and record available to the adverse party and (B) the adverse party has not filed within five days after service of the proponent's notice written objection on the ground that the sources of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Md. Rule 5-902(b)(1) (emphasis added). The bank records in this case were accompanied by a form titled \"Business Records Declaration\" in which an employee of Wells Fargo Bank certified the authenticity of the records and indicated under the penalty of perjury that they were, in fact, business records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Sanderson objected to the introduction and admission of bank records, obtained by Bar Counsel from Wells Fargo through subpoena, on the basis that he was not properly afforded notice of Bar Counsel's intent to introduce the documents under Rule 5-902(b)(1). Also at the hearing, Mr. Sanderson conceded that he received a copy of the bank records from Bar Counsel at his deposition which occurred on August 14, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, as noted by Bar Counsel, Mr. Sanderson\n   authenticated the records concerning both his attorney trust account and his operating account. Accordingly, because the records were certified by an employee of\n   Wells Fargo, presented to Mr. Sanderson over a year before his hearing, and authenticated by Mr. Sanderson during his deposition, we overrule Mr. Sanderson's first exception to the hearing judge's evidentiary rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Mr. Sanderson next takes exception to the hearing judge's admission of communications, i.e. letters, sent by Bar Counsel to Mr. Sanderson. Again, in his exceptions he does not specifically identify the grounds upon which he takes exception to the admission of these letters. However, at the hearing, Mr. Sanderson objected to admission of the documents on hearsay grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Hearsay is defined as a statement made by an out of court declarant offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Md. Rule 5-801(c). As evident from the definition, the letters Bar Counsel wrote to Mr. Sanderson are not hearsay. Although the individual that drafted the letters by Bar Counsel to Mr. Sanderson, his attorney, and monitor did not testify in court, the record makes clear that these letters were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Although some of the later letters indicate that Mr. Sanderson had failed to respond to Bar Counsel's earlier communications, Bar Counsel clearly did not intend to introduce these exhibits to prove that Mr. Sanderson had failed to respond to their earlier communications or any violation of the MLRPC. Rather, these exhibits were intended to establish notice - that Mr. Sanderson was aware of the proceedings against him and was offered opportunity to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Sanderson also takes exception to the introduction of testimony and records compiled by Mr. Miller, Bar Counsel's investigator, tasked with reviewing the records obtained from Wells Fargo. Mr. Sanderson argues that Mr. Miller acted as an expert witness in this capacity and the court erred by not requiring his qualification as an expert. However, we have held that individuals testify as expert witnesses where\n   they opine in a particular matter on subjects which laypersons would typically be unable to grasp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v. Nold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493368\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/362/241/#p257\">\n    362 Md. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493368\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/362/241/#p257\">\n    765 A.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (holding that a doctor was an expert witness rather than a fact witness where, in his testimony, he gave an opinion on the medical cause of a death).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The activities which Mr. Miller engaged in do not require any particular expertise in a subject-matter. Mr. Miller, in his role as investigator, reviewed the bank records obtained from Wells Fargo and placed some of this information, concerning Mr. Sanderson's trust account, in tables detailing the transactions. In this regard, Mr. Miller acted as a fact witness and merely noted data from the financial records and recorded this information in tables for greater ease of access. In his review, Mr. Miller offered no expertise, merely reiterated numbers from the records, and the subject-matter did not require a particular level of expertise.

Specifically, he contends that the hearing judge's finding is unsubstantiated because the record does not adequately reflect that his representation of Mr. Odubanjo failed to meet the requisite level of competence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In the instant grievance proceedings, the record clearly reflects that Mr. Sanderson filed a motion for continuance and an entry of appearance on January 23, 2013, the day before Mr. Odubanjo's trial was scheduled to begin. Mr. Sanderson conceded that he would be unable to attend trial the following day. This demonstrates that Mr. Sanderson entered his appearance in the matter, on the day before trial, knowing full well that he would be unable to attend if his motion for continuance was not granted. Apparently, Mr. Sanderson expected the court would grant his motion for a continuance, which would enable him not to attend the hearing. Unfortunately for Mr. Sanderson, the court denied the postponement request and he failed to appear on behalf of Mr. Odubanjo despite filing his entry of appearance. Although Mr. Sanderson argues that his absence should be excused, because he was required to attend court in another part of the State contemporaneously with Mr. Odubanjo's hearing, he was fully aware of this at the time he entered his appearance. Therefore, based on our independent review of the record, we agree with the hearing judge that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.1 in the course of his representation of Mr. Odubanjo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 1.1 Competency (BC Docket No. 2017-0152)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Next, Mr. Sanderson takes exception to the hearing judge's finding that, throughout his representation of Ms.\n   Ozel, he violated MLRPC 1.1. Primarily, Mr. Sanderson contends that the record fails to sufficiently demonstrate that he did not provide competent representation to Ms. Ozel. He points out that Ms. Ozel obtained a reasonable settlement and contends that he has offered a reasonable explanation as to why the $2,900 was not promptly paid to Ms. Ozel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   However, Mr. Sanderson's exhibit does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in providing Ms. Ozel with the funds. Although the exhibit provides an explanation for a portion of delay, as discussed above, the email from the IWIF clearing any worker's compensation lien and eliminating the possibility of any withholding against Ms. Ozel's recovery occurred\n   in March. Mr. Sanderson did not provide her with the funds until December.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Overall, Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.1 in several ways with respect to Ms. Ozel. He violated this rule by unreasonably and without justification failing to promptly deliver the remaining settlement funds to Ms. Ozel. An attorney's failure to provide his or her clients with funds due implicates MLRPC 1.1.

Although Mr. Sanderson may have held a portion of\n   the funds because of a potential workman's compensation offset, it was incumbent upon him to communicate this fact to Ms. Ozel. In addition, the six-month delay that elapsed between the date any potential workman's compensation issue was cleared and the date Mr. Sanderson eventually disbursed the remaining settlement funds to Ms. Ozel demonstrates Mr. Sanderson's incompetence. Accordingly, we agree with the hearing judge's conclusion that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.1 in his representation of Ms. Ozel and overrule Mr. Sanderson's exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 1.1 Competency (BC Docket No. 2016-1374)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The hearing judge concluded that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.1 in his representation of Mr. Sangare.

Particularly, Mr. Sanderson conditioned his representation of Mr. Odubanjo on his ability to obtain a postponement in the matter. Specifically, the hearing judge found that such action violated MLRPC 1.2(c). The rule, in pertinent part, reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (c) An attorney may limit the scope of the representation in accordance with applicable Maryland Rules if (1) the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances, (2) the client gives informed consent, and (3) the scope and limitations of any representation, beyond an initial consultation or brief advice provided without a fee, are clearly set forth in a writing, including any duty on the part of the attorney under Rule 1-324 to forward notices to the client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   MLRPC 1.2(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As evident, an attorney may make reasonable limitations to the scope of representation if they are communicated to the client in writing. The record contains no evidence that Mr. Sanderson provided Mr. Odubanjo with a written agreement indicating that his representation of Mr. Odubanjo would be conditioned on his ability to obtain the initial postponement. Therefore, at the outset, we determine that Mr. Sanderson failed to comply with MLRPC 1.2(c)(2) and (3). In addition to his failure to provide his Mr. Odubanjo with written notice of any limitations, Mr. Sanderson also violated MLRPC 1.2(c)(1). As the hearing judge noted, Mr. Sanderson attempted to condition his representation of Mr. Odubanjo on his ability to obtain a postponement in the matter. Considering that Mr. Sanderson entered his appearance and filed the postponement the day before Mr. Odubanjo's trial was scheduled to begin, we agree with the hearing judge that Mr. Sanderson unreasonably attempted to limit his representation of Mr. Odubanjo, in violation of MLRPC 1.2(c). Although Mr. Sanderson, in his exception, acknowledges that Mr. Odubanjo knew he would not appear court, this fact does not affect the unreasonable nature of Mr. Sanderson's decision to limit his representation\n   of Mr. Odubanjo.

First, this was information Mr. Sanderson should have been aware of. Mr. Sanderson, and not Mr. Sangare, received the notice of the hearing date from the court. Although atypical that an attorney would contact his or her client requesting scheduling information, nevertheless, at the end of the discussion Mr. Sangare asked Mr. Sanderson to confirm the time of the hearing and then relay this information back to him. Ultimately however, Mr. Sanderson failed to respond to Mr. Sangare's request, which eventually led to both Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Sangare appearing late for the hearing and the court entering an order of removal against Mr. Sangare.

Because\n   a hearing judge's findings must be appropriately limited to charges filed by Bar Counsel through the Petition, we determine that the hearing judge erred in finding that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.3 through his representation of Ms. Brown.\n   <em>\n    Seiden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739037\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/409/#p418\">\n    373 Md. at 418-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739037\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/409/#p418\">\n    818 A.2d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Monfried\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455022\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/373/\">\n    368 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378-79 n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455022\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/373/\">\n    794 A.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Ruffalo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174216\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/544/#p551\">\n    390 U.S. at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174216\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/544/#p551\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.3 in his representation of Mr. Wilkinson by failing to promptly deliver settlement proceeds to him.

The record indicates that part of this amount was used by Mr. Sanderson as attorney's fees, while another portion of the funds was to be paid to Mr. Wilkinson. The record does not indicate that the remaining funds were ever disbursed to Mr. Wilkinson.

As the hearing judge correctly noted, after Mr. Sanderson filed an entry of appearance and a motion for continuance in Mr. Odubanjo's traffic matter, Mr. Sanderson failed to adequately explain to Mr. Odubanjo that, upon entering his appearance in the matter, he was obligated to appear on Mr. Odubanjo's behalf. In fact, Mr. Sanderson's failure to communicate this circumstance contributed to Mr. Odubanjo eventually terminating his representation. As mentioned above, Mr. Sanderson also failed to communicate to Mr. Odubanjo other things including the denial of his second I-130 petition, its significance, and the time of Mr. Odubanjo's hearing scheduled for November 14, 2013. Consequently, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge's conclusion on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 1.4 (BC Docket No. 2017-0152)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In his representation of Ms. Ozel, Mr. Sanderson committed numerous violations of MLRPC 1.4. An attorney's failure to inform a client that he or she received a settlement check or failure to communicate the terms of a settlement\n   constitutes a violation of MLRPC 1.4.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Ms. Ozel testified that, as to the $6,900 settlement check Mr. Sanderson received from MAIF, that he never informed her of the full settlement amount, never provided her with a settlement disbursement sheet, and failed to explain to her the amount she would receive after his fee had been accounted for. As a result, Mr. Sanderson's conduct in his representation of Ms. Ozel violated MLRPC 1.4. and the record is replete with evidence in support of hearing judge's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 1.5 (BC Docket No. 2017-0152)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   MLRPC 1.5(c) places certain limitations on an attorney's ability to set and collect fees. The rule, in pertinent part, provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (c) A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by section (d) of this Rule or other law. A contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing signed by the client and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the attorney in the event of settlement, trial or appeal; litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery; and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. The agreement must clearly notify the client of any expenses for which the client will be responsible whether or not the client is the prevailing party. Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the attorney shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter, and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The hearing judge determined that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.5 in his representation of Ms. Ozel by failing to memorialize a contingency fee agreement. Further, the hearing judge determined that Mr. Sanderson violated the provision through his failure to provide Ms. Ozel with adequate\n   information regarding the expenses associated with the representation, whether such expenses would be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated, and by failing to provide her with a written settlement statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The record contains a form entitled \"attorney-client agreement\" which summarizes certain aspects of Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Ozel. However, the agreement is unsigned, does not contain an area for signatures, and does not contain Ms. Ozel's signature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   MLRPC 1.5 requires\n   that any agreement regarding contingency fees must be reduced to writing and signed by the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   There are several other shortcomings associated with Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Ozel. As mentioned above, Mr. Sanderson did not provide Ms. Ozel with a settlement disbursement sheet - as contemplated by the final sentence of MLRPC 1.5. In fact, Ms. Ozel openly testified that she was unaware of the total amount of her settlement and never received such a document. Furthermore, no such document exists within the record, which adds additional weight to Ms. Ozel's testimony. For these reasons, we agree with the hearing judge's conclusion that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.5 and determine that the conclusion is supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 1.15 (BC Docket No. 2017-0152)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   MLRPC 1.15 requires that attorneys safekeep the property of clients or third persons in some instances and provides the following limitations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   (a) An attorney shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in an attorney's possession in connection with a representation separate from the attorney's own property.

Within the two days, Mr. Sanderson transferred $2,000 of this amount to his operating account and withdrew $2,000 in cash at a Wells Fargo branch. According to the evidence and testimony adduced at the disciplinary hearing, after the initial payment to Ms. Ozel, Mr. Sanderson still owed her $2,900. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   the legitimacy of Mr. Sanderson's representation concerning the potential worker's compensation lien on the funds, the exhibit he provided indicates that the funds were cleared on March 12, 2018. However, Mr. Sanderson failed to disburse the remaining $2,900 to Ms. Ozel until December 12, 2018 - nine months later. During this period, the available balance within the trust account fell below $2,900 on several occasions. To interrupt the deficient trust balance, Mr. Sanderson transferred funds from his firm's operating account into the attorney trust account numerous times. In addition, the financial records associated with Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account indicate that he deposited cash into the account on several instances in amounts as large as $2,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Mr. Sanderson's failure to adequately maintain records concerning his attorney trust account add a certain degree of opaqueness to our review of the associated financial records. Within the proceedings below, Mr. Sanderson offered no documentary evidence which could have explained some of the\n   deficiencies associated with his attorney trust account and specifically those concerning his representation of Ms. Ozel. Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(a) and (b) by failing to maintain adequate records of his attorney trust account and by depositing funds from his firm's operating account into his attorney trust account.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Maryland Rule 19-408 sets forth the limited situations in which an attorney may deposit funds into an attorney trust account which includes paying fees, service charges, minimum balance requirements, and funds that potentially belong to the attorney. The transfers here, however, fit none of these limited exceptions. Accordingly, we hold that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(c) in his representation of Ms. Ozel by failing to maintain her funds in trust until they were earned. As detailed above, throughout his representation of Ms. Ozel, the level of funds within Mr. Sanderson's attorney trust account fell below the amount he owed to her, i.e. $2,900, her on several occasions. The Rule provides that an attorney \"may withdraw those funds for the attorney's own benefit only as fees are earned or expenses incurred.\" MLRPC 1.15(c). The deficient balance compared to the amount Mr. Sanderson still owed Ms. Ozel, demonstrates that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In addition to these violations, Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(d) by failing to promptly deliver Ms. Ozel her settlement funds. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   the legitimacy of Mr. Sanderson's allegations concerning the potential worker's compensation lien on the funds, the exhibit he provided indicates that the funds were cleared on March 12, 2018. However, Mr. Sanderson failed to disburse the remaining $2,900 to Ms. Ozel until December 12,\n   2018 - nine months later. Mr. Sanderson\n   offers no explanation aside from the worker's compensation issue to rectify this delay. Furthermore, Mr. Sanderson failed to inform Ms. Ozel of the settlement and its amount, as evidenced by her testimony. Therefore, Mr. Sanderson violated the provisions of MLRPC 1.15(d) in his representation of Ms. Ozel by failing to promptly deliver the settlement funds to her and by failing to promptly notify her of the terms of the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The hearing judge also concluded that Mr. Sanderson violated this Rule in his representations of Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Parham. Specifically, the hearing judge determined that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(c) and (d) by failing to maintain their funds in trust until earned and by failing to promptly deliver settlement funds owed to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The record reflects that Mr. Sanderson continued in his habit of transferring funds from his operating account into his attorney trust account throughout his representation of Mr. Parham. Between March 27, 2017 and April 4, 2017, Mr. Sanderson transferred funds from his operating account to his attorney trust on six different occasions. In total, the transfers amounted to $1,400. More troubling however, is the payment made on March 31, 2017, in which Mr. Sanderson impermissibly paid a portion Mr. Parham's client funds to Ms. Hines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   With respect to Mr. Sanderson's representation of Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. Sanderson received a settlement check in the amount of $40,000 from the Cincinnati Insurance Company and deposited it into his attorney trust account on November 28, 2016. On December 3, 2016, Mr. Sanderson issued a check to Mr. Wilkinson for $22,933.28. Two days later, Mr. Sanderson transferred $9,967, accounting for his fee in the matter, from his attorney trust account to his operating account. Thereafter, $7,099.72 remained in the trust account stemming from Mr. Sanderson's representation of Mr. Wilkinson. The totality of evidence adduced throughout the course of these disciplinary proceedings does not indicate that Mr. Sanderson ever paid these remaining funds to Mr. Wilkinson. Therefore, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge's\n   conclusion that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(c) and (d) throughout his representations of Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Parham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In addition to the violations of the MLRPC that originated from Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Ozel, the hearing judge determined that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 1.15(c) and (d) throughout his representation of Ms. Brown. The hearing judge determined that Mr. Sanderson violated this rule by failing to promptly deliver settlement funds owed to these clients. However, as mentioned above, Bar Counsel failed to allege any violations with respect to Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Brown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted above, the record contains scant evidence concerning Mr. Sanderson's representation of Ms. Brown.

In response to these requests, Mr. Sanderson provided only purported retainer agreements for several clients and two \"waiver of conflict\" agreements. However, he failed to provide any records concerning his attorney trust account, and, therefore,\n   the record is entirely devoid of any indication that Mr. Sanderson\n   complied with Maryland Rule 19-407. Under these circumstances, we determine that the hearing judge's conclusion with respect to this issue is supported by clear and convincing evidence; Mr. Sanderson failed to adequately maintain records associated with his attorney trust account as required under Maryland Rule 19-407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    Md.

In fact, between March 15, 2016 and April 4, 2017, Mr. Sanderson transferred funds from his operating account to his attorney trust account more than nineteen times. These transactions totaled an amount of $15,149.72.

Second, this practice resulted in the trust account becoming underfunded on several occasions with its balance falling into the negative and causing the overdraft in January of 2017. Third, Mr. Sanderson consistently transferred funds from his operating account to his trust account which is discussed at length in our analysis of MLRPC 1.15. Therefore, the record clearly reflects that the hearing judge's conclusion that Mr. Sanderson violated BOP \u00a7 10-306 is supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 3.4 (BC Docket No. 2017-0152)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   MLRPC 3.4 concerns fairness to opposing parties and, in pertinent part, provides that an attorney may not \"falsify evidence, counsel or assist a witness to testify falsely,\n   or offer an inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law[.]\" MLRPC 3.4(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The hearing judge determined that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 3.4(b) when he instructed Ms. Ozel to provide Bar Counsel with false information upon any subsequent inquiry into his representation. According to Ms. Ozel's testimony, Mr. Sanderson called her at some point after the meeting in Owings Mills and inquired as to whether she had been contacted or asked any questions regarding his representation of her. She testified that after the phone call she and Mr. Sanderson encountered one another at the Baltimore City Juvenile Court, where she worked. There, Mr. Sanderson again asked whether Ms. Ozel had been contacted by anyone in reference to his representation. In addition, he informed her that if anyone should contact her and ask questions regarding his representation of her, she should inform them that she \"hired him for something else beside a car accident, and then\n   [she] changed my mind and asked for the $2,900 back.\" She then testified that she did not retain Mr. Sanderson in another matter and the representation he urged her to make was in fact false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Our review of the record clearly indicates that Mr. Sanderson contacted Ms. Ozel regarding the pending disciplinary proceedings. He was aware that she would likely be called as a witness in the disciplinary proceedings and attempted to have her provide misinformation to Bar Counsel to mitigate any disciplinary action taken. Therefore, Mr. Sanderson attempted to persuade Ms. Ozel into providing false testimony to Bar Counsel which directly contravened MLRPC 3.4(b).

Specifically, Bar Counsel contends that the hearing judge erred in neglecting to find Mr. Sanderson in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d), where his conduct in the aggregate brings the profession into disrepute. We next determine the applicable provisions of MLRPC 8.4 that Mr. Sanderson violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   First, Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 8.4(a) by violating several provisions of the MLRPC discussed at length above. Mr. Sanderson also engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) by misrepresenting to Ms. Ozel that she would receive $2,900 from a worker's compensation action and urging her to provide Bar Counsel with misinformation upon request. Mr. Sanderson's continued pattern of making cash withdrawals from his attorney trust account and reimbursing the\n   account with funds transferred from his operating account are troubling and evince dishonesty. Moreover, Mr. Sanderson's conduct in paying Mr. Wilkinson's funds held in trust to Ms. Hines constitutes misappropriation. Such conduct directly violates MLRPC 8.4(c).\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Accordingly, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge's conclusions that Mr. Sanderson violated MLRPC 8.4(a) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In addition, the hearing judge concluded that Mr. Sanderson ran afoul of MLRPC 8.4(e) by making disparaging remarks towards Ms. Isom-Cyrus in his interaction with her at the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Several witnesses testified that Mr. Sanderson called Ms. Isom-Cyrus a \"bitch[,]\" while she testified that Mr. Sanderson referred to her as a \"baby-snatching bitch[.]\" At oral argument, Mr. Sanderson argued that the use of the term alone does constitute conduct sufficient to support a violation of the Rule. He alluded to the casual usage of racial epithets in hip-hop music and argued that, in some usages, derogative terms can imply some level of respect rather than disdain. However, Mr. Sanderson's comparison is inapt as his exchange with Ms. Isom-Cyrus in no way demonstrated any such level of respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   When Mr. Sanderson made the disparaging remarks shortly after a CINA hearing in which Ms. Isom-Cyrus represented the BCDSS, he was acting within his professional capacity at the time. Clearly, based on the verbiage alone, Mr. Sanderson in his exchange with Ms. Isom-Cyrus, knowingly manifested bias or prejudice based upon sex, through his words, while acting in a professional capacity in violation of MLRPC 8.4(e). Accordingly, our independent review of the record leads us to conclude that the hearing judge's conclusion\n   is supported by clear and convincing as to this violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Additionally, Bar Counsel takes exception to the hearing judge's legal conclusions premised upon MLRPC 8.4. Specifically, Bar Counsel alleges that Mr. Sanderson's conduct, viewed in the aggregate, brings the legal profession into\n   disrepute in contravention of MLRPC 8.4(d).

Mr. Sanderson failed to disclose to Ms. Ozel the amount or timing of her settlement and knowingly urged her to make false statements to Bar Counsel in an apparent effort to obfuscate his improper handling of settlement and client funds from Bar Counsel's view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Third, Mr. Sanderson clearly engaged in an overarching pattern of misconduct. Throughout Bar Counsel's investigation, Mr. Sanderson consistently failed to respond to Bar Counsel's inquiries. Moreover, Mr. Sanderson engaged in the questionable practice of making impermissible cash withdrawals from his attorney trust account then supplementing the trust account's by transferring funds to it from his operating account. Additionally, Mr. Sanderson demonstrated a pattern of misconduct by failing to appear at several court proceedings\n   despite entering his appearance on behalf of Mr. Odubanjo and Mr. Sangare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Fourth, as evident from our analysis above, Mr. Sanderson committed multiple violations of the MLRPC. Fifth, Mr. Sanderson demonstrated bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding in several respects. Mr. Sanderson failed to comply with the terms of the CDA, failed to comply with Bar Counsel's requests for information regarding his representation of several clients, and instructed Ms. Ozel to lie to Bar Counsel concerning the investigation. Sixth, Mr. Sanderson made false\n   statements to Bar Counsel regarding his interactions with Ms. Ozel. He also engaged in deceptive practices by instructing Ms. Ozel to make misrepresentations to Bar Counsel. Seventh, Mr. Sanderson refused to acknowledge his behavior and the wrongful nature of his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Mr. Sanderson takes exception to the hearing judge's determination that Mr. Sangare was a vulnerable person, which undergirded his finding that factor (h) - the vulnerability of victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   American Bar Association,\n   <em>\n    Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 9.22, Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards (2012).

We find Mr. Sanderson's arguments regarding mitigation unpersuasive for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   First, he contends that, in his representation of Ms. Ozel, he provided her with additional legal services, i.e., obtaining a release of funds from the worker's compensation carrier, without additional attorney fees. Mr. Sanderson's exception regarding the additional work he performed for Ms. Ozel neither fits easily into any of the above categories of mitigating factors nor within any recognized mitigating factor discussed within our case law. However, when viewed in terms of its substance, Mr. Sanderson's argument on this point is most likely subsumed under the mitigating factor concerning the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive. However, Mr. Sanderson failed to establish this mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. In support of his explanation that he performed additional work for Ms. Ozel, staving off a potential worker's compensation lien, Mr. Sanderson provides an email from a subrogation adjuster with the IWIF that cleared Ms. Ozel's settlement funds from any IWIF withholding. Mr. Sanderson failed to provide any documentation which would show the amount of work he performed in releasing these funds or any expenditures throughout this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Second, Mr. Sanderson argues that, although he failed to comply with the CDA in its entirety, he worked with his CDA monitor for an additional eight months past its expiration. Mr. Sanderson's contentions on this point are largely misguided. Although he may have met with his monitor beyond the time-period required by the CDA, he failed to comply with several other conditions of the CDA. Specifically, Mr. Sanderson failed to attend the required professional development courses concerning office and escrow management. Mr. Sanderson argues that the courses were offered at times inconvenient for him, which explains why he was unable to complete them within the two-year term of the CDA. However, he did indicate that he participated in continuing legal education courses from external jurisdictions that are similar to those required under the CDA. Nonetheless, Mr. Sanderson's actions of working with\n   his monitor beyond the expiration of the CDA are insufficient to constitute mitigating circumstances. A holding in Mr. Sanderson's favor would likely encourage other attorneys, within disciplinary proceedings, to pick and choose which terms of their CDAs to follow and for what duration. Such a result would likely frustrate attorney disciplinary proceedings and the purpose of CDAs overall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Third, Mr. Sanderson argues that he was depressed and abusing alcohol throughout the time period in which these events occurred. Regarding mental disability or substance dependence, we have indicated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   in cases of intentional dishonesty misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept, as \"compelling extenuating circumstances,\" anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \"root cause\" of the misconduct and that also result in an attorney's utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the [MLRPC]. Only if the circumstances are that compelling, will we even consider\n   imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment in cases of stealing, dishonesty, fraudulent conduct, the intentional misappropriation of funds or other serious criminal conduct, whether occurring in the practice of law, or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <em>\n    Ghatt\n   </em>\n   , 461 Md. at 275-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12500455\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/192/656/#p261\">\n    192 A.3d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Mr. Sanderson provides us with no evidence confirming his struggles with alcoholism and depression or demonstrating that his struggles in managing his attorney trust and operating accounts were substantially attributable to them. We determine that he failed to adduce sufficient evidence linking any alcohol abuse or depressive disorders to his deficient performance and grievous professional failings as an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Fourth, after reiterating that he had worked with his monitor under the CDA past its expiration, Mr. Sanderson contends that the public has not been demonstrably harmed by his conduct, the financial allegations raised in the Petition do not stem from a complaint originating from the public, and that none of his clients are owed any reimbursement. However, our precedent reveals no distinction between situations where financial complaints originate from Bar Counsel, judges, or an attorney's clients. In fact, in this case, Mr. Sanderson had three complaints filed against him by Judge Mitchell, Mr. Sangare, and Ms. Isom-Cyrus. Moreover, the allegations of Mr. Sanderson's financial misdoings stem from Bar Counsel's investigation into his attorney trust account following its overdraft. With Mr. Sanderson's misrepresentations to his clients, including Ms. Ozel, he obfuscated any financial concerns and reduced the likelihood that a client would have the necessary knowledge of Mr. Sanderson's violations concerning attorney trust accounts and client funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Sanderson argues that he acted as an attorney without any additional allegations of misconduct between the time of the complained activity and Bar Counsel's filing of the Petition. As mentioned above, Bar Counsel filed the Petition on March 26, 2018. Although a lack of prior disciplinary record is a potential mitigating factor, Mr. Sanderson attempts to establish this mitigatory effect by arguing that he practiced law for a little over a year, after receiving Bar Counsel's\n   complaint, without incident. However, twelve months of good behavior is insufficient to mitigate or overcome the litany of sanctionable conduct Mr. Sanderson committed. Therefore, Mr. Sanderson's brief period of not committing sanctionable conduct is insufficient to operate as a mitigating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Disbarment is often warranted in situations where an attorney neglects or abandons clients, makes misrepresentations to clients and Bar Counsel, and\n   knowingly misappropriates funds.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

In his communications with Ms. Ozel, Mr. Sanderson engaged in such a pattern of intentional misrepresentations, which were made in attempt to cover up his prior transgressions and to interfere in Bar Counsel's investigation.

In addition, we sustain the hearing judge's conclusion that Mr. Sanderson violated Maryland Rules \u00a7\u00a7 19-410, 19-407, 19-408, and BOP \u00a7 10-306. Furthermore, Mr. Sanderson, as an attorney, failed to demonstrate the requisite competence, diligence, and communicative abilities required of the profession. Additionally, he engaged in a widespread pattern of misusing client funds, failing to properly maintain records associated with his attorney trust account, and engaged\n   in conduct which has the potentiality to bring the profession into disrepute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Based on our assessment of Mr. Sanderson's misconduct, the existence of aggravating factors, and the absence of any mitigating factors, we agree with Bar Counsel and hold that disbarment is the only appropriate sanction.

Second, the agreement with Mr. Wilkinson contains an area for the party's signatures with instructions. The instructions indicate that \"I/We have read this agreement and have been given a copy\" followed by lines for the client's signature and the accompanying date.
