Ponger (Ponger), who no longer resided at the property. Because the court correctly held that the notice requirement under the mortgage was satisfied because notice to one joint tenant or joint obligor constitutes notice to the others, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties stipulated to the following relevant facts. On September 7, 2005, Ponger executed a note in favor of Long Beach Mortgage Company in the principal amount of $420,000. The note was endorsed in blank and supplied to the plaintiff prior to the commencement of this action. Also on September 7, 2005, Ponger and the defendant executed a mortgage deed in favor of Long Beach Mortgage Company on property located at 23 Macintosh Road, Norwalk. The mortgage was recorded in the Norwalk land records on September 13, 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff is the present holder of the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about December 6, 2013, by letter addressed to Ponger at 23 Macintosh Road, Norwalk, Connecticut\n   06857, the plaintiff advised him that the note and mortgage were in default due to his failure to make the required monthly payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notice of the aforementioned default was not addressed to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the absence of a cure of the default, the plaintiff elected to accelerate the amount due under the note. On April 15, 2014, the plaintiff provided Ponger and the defendant notice of their rights under the General\n   Statutes as they relate to the Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-265cc et seq. The record further indicates that Ponger failed to make payments pursuant to the note from July 1, 2013, to the date of the joint stipulation, May 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The present action was commenced on October 13, 2015, approximately eighteen months after the Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program notice was mailed to the subject property. On May 5, 2016, after the expiration of the court approved foreclosure mediation period, the defendant filed a timely answer asserting, as a special defense, that the plaintiff had failed to provide her with proper notice of default and acceleration. Thereafter, on June 2, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment as to both Ponger and the defendant. The court granted the motion with respect to Ponger but denied the motion with respect to the defendant. On May 16, 2017, the parties filed a joint stipulation of facts with the court as to the remaining\n   issues in dispute. On September 6, 2017, the court issued its memorandum of decision finding in favor of the plaintiff. The court determined that \"[r]esolution of this issue is controlled squarely by\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124851\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/41/598/#p600\">\n    41 Conn.

This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant's principal claim on appeal is that the court erred when it concluded that the notice requirement provision of the subject mortgage had been satisfied as to the defendant when the plaintiff provided notice addressed exclusively to Ponger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant claims that, because she is a \"[b]orrower\" under the terms of the mortgage, and because the notice provision of the mortgage requires notice of default and acceleration to be given to the \"[b]orrower,\" the\n   plaintiff was required to provide her individually with notice. The defendant further claims that the court improperly applied the legal principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porto\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124851\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/41/598/#p600\">\n    41 Conn.

In\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , this court addressed whether notice to one joint tenant constituted notice to the others under similar, but not identical, circumstances. There, the defendant and his spouse were living apart, and neither the defendant nor the spouse resided at the subject property at the time notice was delivered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Similar to the notice provision in the present case, the relevant notice provision provided: \"Unless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this note will be given by delivering it or by mailing it first class to me at the property address above or at a different address if I give the note holder notice of my different address.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Porto\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124851\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/41/598/#p600\">\n    41 Conn.

Unlike like the present case, in which the defendant is a signatory only on the subject mortgage, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , was both a signatory on the note and a signatory on the corresponding mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court concluded that, although \"proper notice of acceleration is a necessary condition precedent to an action for foreclosure ... the plaintiff provided the defendant with proper notice by mailing the notice of acceleration to [a joint tenant of the defendant].\" Id., at 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%2010\">\n    677 A.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court further concluded that, \"[w]hile it appears that service of a notice upon one tenant in common is not usually regarded as binding upon the others, unless they are engaged in a common enterprise, the rule is different where the relation is that of a joint tenancy. In such a case, it is said that notice to one of them is binding upon all. 20 Am.

Despite the foregoing, the defendant claims that the trial court misapplied the aforementioned standards because, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , who was both a signatory on the note and corresponding mortgage, she was not a signatory on the subject note. We find the defendant's claim unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a recent decision, this court addressed a similar claim.

This court held that, because the defendant signed the mortgage instrument, thereby pledging the property as security for the debt obligation created by the note, which was signed by the former spouse, the defendant was a joint obligor as to the mortgage and that the notice provided to his former spouse, despite their contrasting endorsements, satisfied the notice requirements under the mortgage.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12504941\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/199/57/\">\n    Id., at 249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 n.21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12504941\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/199/57/\">\n    199 A.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Critically, at oral argument before this court, the defendant conceded that, at all relevant times, she and Ponger were joint tenants with respect to the subject property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682751\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/594/#p600\">\n    191 Conn. at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=469%20A.2d%20410\">\n    469 A.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, it is not in dispute that the defendant\n   and Ponger continued as joint obligors under the subject mortgage.

Further still, the defendant has not challenged the stipulation or otherwise disputed that her signature is on the mortgage. Accordingly, we conclude that the present case falls squarely within the ambit of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Citicorp Mortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , and, therefore, the notice to Ponger constituted notice to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded for the purpose of setting new law days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Joseph R.
