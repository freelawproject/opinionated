On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the jury's verdict was legally inconsistent because each of these crimes requires a mutually exclusive mental state, and (2) the court erred in failing to exclude testimonial hearsay. We agree that the verdict is legally inconsistent, and, therefore, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as reasonably could have been found by the jury, are relevant to this appeal. The victim, Evelyn Agyei, left her Bridgeport home at approximately 6 a.m. on December 4, 2014. Her eleven year old son accompanied her. Agyei and her son got into her Subaru Outback (Subaru), Agyei driving and her son in the back seat on the passenger's side. After traversing some back roads, they took Bond Street and arrived at the intersection of Bond Street and Boston Avenue. Agyei stopped at the red light and then proceeded to make a right turn onto Boston\n   Avenue, staying in the right lane. As she was making the right turn, her son looked to the left and saw a white BMW sport utility vehicle (BMW) approximately two streets down, traveling at a high rate of speed in the left lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Agyei got onto Boston Avenue, the driver of the BMW pulled alongside Agyei's vehicle. Agyei's son saw the BMW logo on the hood; however, he could not see the driver or the license plate. The driver of the BMW then moved into the right lane, hitting Agyei's Subaru once on the driver's side and causing her to begin to lose control of the vehicle. The driver of the BMW then moved behind the Subaru and ran into it from behind, causing the vehicle to cross the median, proceed under a fence, and hit a tree. Tragically, Agyei died from her injuries, and her son, who also was\n   injured, continues to have vision problems as a result of the injuries he sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After an investigation, which included obtaining a video of the incident from a nearby high school that had surveillance cameras in the area, the police, having concluded that the defendant was the driver of the BMW that hit the Subaru, causing Agyei's death and the injuries to Agyei's son, arrested the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, she was charged, in a long form information, with, inter alia, intentional manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, and criminally negligent operation of a motor vehicle; the jury found her guilty of these charges, among others. See footnote 1 of this opinion. The court accepted the jury's verdicts and rendered judgment accordingly. On the date of sentencing, upon the request of the state,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court vacated the\n   defendant's conviction of intentional manslaughter, and it, thereafter, sentenced the defendant to twenty years incarceration,\n   execution suspended after sixteen years, with five years of probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant raises two claims on appeal-(1) the jury's verdicts of guilty on the crimes of intentional and reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent operation were legally inconsistent because each of these crimes requires a mutually exclusive mental state, and (2) the court erred in failing to exclude testimonial hearsay-and requests that we reverse the judgment of the trial court and order a new trial on all charges and, alternatively, on the charges of intentional manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, and criminally negligent operation. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   INCONSISTENT VERDICTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant first claims that the jury's verdicts on the counts of intentional manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, and criminally negligent operation were legally inconsistent because they each require a mutually exclusive mental state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argues that it was logically impossible for the defendant to have possessed\n   three forms of intent, simultaneously, for a single act, involving a single victim. The defendant explains that, at trial, the state's theory of the case was that her action in twice hitting Agyei's vehicle was one single act, which caused Agyei's death. She argues that the state tried the case under the theory that each of the three relevant counts of the information were charged in the alternative, one being intentional, one reckless, and one negligent. She contends that the fact that the jury found her guilty of all three charges, each requiring a different mental state, and that the state, thereafter, requested that the court vacate the intentional manslaughter conviction, demonstrates that the verdicts were legally inconsistent. After setting forth our standard of review and the general legal principles involved, we will consider the relevant mental element of each of these crimes in order to ascertain whether convictions of all three crimes would be legally inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"It is well established that\n   <em>\n    factually\n   </em>\n   inconsistent verdicts are permissible. [When] the verdict could have been the result of compromise or mistake, we will not probe into the logic or reasoning of the jury's deliberations or open the door to interminable speculation.... Thus, claims of legal inconsistency between a conviction and an acquittal are not reviewable [on appeal].... We employ a less limited approach, however, when we are confronted with an argument that [two or more convictions] are inconsistent as a matter of law or when the [convictions] are based on a legal impossibility.... A claim of legally inconsistent convictions, also referred to as mutually exclusive convictions, arises when a conviction of one offense requires a finding that negates an essential element of\n   another\n   offense of which the defendant also has been convicted.... In response to such a claim, we look carefully to determine whether the existence of the essential elements for one offense negates the existence of [one or more] essential elements for another offense of which the defendant also stands convicted. If that is the case, the [convictions] are legally inconsistent and cannot withstand challenge.... Whether two convictions are mutually exclusive presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20651\">\n    316 Conn. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%20128\">\n    114 A.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[C]ourts reviewing a claim of legal inconsistency must closely examine the record to determine whether there is any plausible theory under which the jury reasonably could have found the defendant guilty of [more than one offense].\" Id., at 663,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%20128\">\n    114 A.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As set forth previously in this opinion, the state charged the defendant with, inter alia, intentional manslaughter and reckless manslaughter. As to intentional manslaughter, the state charged in relevant part that, \"on or about the 4th day of December, 2014, at approximately 6:30 a.m., at or near Boston Avenue within [Bridgeport] ... PATRICIA DANIELS, with the intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, caused the death of EVELYN AGYEI, in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-55 (a) (1) ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to reckless manslaughter, the state charged in relevant part that, \"on or about the 4th day of December, 2014, at approximately 6:30 a.m., at or near Boston Avenue within [Bridgeport] ... PATRICIA DANIELS, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to one EVELYN AGYEI, and thereby caused the death of ... EVELYN AGYEI, in violation of [\u00a7] 53a-55 (a) (3) ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During closing and rebuttal argument, the state specifically argued to the jury: \"[The defendant] knowingly and recklessly\n   got behind the wheel of her BMW; she intentionally rammed that car off the road. And, by the way, if you don't believe it was intentional, she recklessly ran that vehicle off the road.\" It also argued: \"We've proven beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the video of that white BMW ramming, the intentional ramming into Evelyn Agyei's car. That's intentional conduct. But intent is a question of fact for you to decide. The state recognizes that because, if you disagree that it was intentional, we also submit and argue in the\n   alternative ... that that conduct was, at the very least, reckless. She had a reckless disregard for Evelyn Agyei's life ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the state clearly contended that these crimes were charged in the alternative, neither it nor the defendant requested that the court specifically instruct the jury to consider each charge in the alternative. To be clear, the defendant has not claimed on appeal that the state's argument that the jury should consider the charges in the alternative, itself, precluded the jury from finding her guilty of both charges; rather, her argument is that because each of the charges required a mutually exclusive mental state, the jury was precluded from finding guilt on both charges because one intent negates the other. The defendant argues that the guilty verdicts on the counts of intentional manslaughter and reckless manslaughter were legally inconsistent because she could not have engaged in both intentional and reckless conduct simultaneously, involving only one act and one alleged victim. She contends that it was legally impossible for the jury to have found every element of both crimes because, under the state's theory of the case, each of the charges required a mutually exclusive finding with respect to her mental state. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person; or ... (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) : \"A person acts 'intentionally' with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct ....\" Additionally, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13) : \"A person acts 'recklessly' with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In support of her claim that intentional manslaughter and reckless manslaughter require mutually exclusive mental states, the defendant relies, in part, on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520712\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/585/\">\n    216 Conn. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20A.2d%20896\">\n    583 A.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). In\n   <em>\n    Nash\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court discussed\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   at length and explained: In\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , the defendant had \"claimed that his convictions of attempt to commit murder and reckless assault of the same victim based on the same conduct were legally inconsistent because they required mutually exclusive findings with respect to his mental\n   state.... We agreed with this claim, explaining that King's conviction for attempt to commit murder required the jury to find that he acted with the\n   <em>\n    intent to cause the death of the victim\n   </em>\n   , whereas his conviction for reckless assault required the jury to find that he\n   <em>\n    acted recklessly and thereby created a risk that the victim would die\n   </em>\n   .... We further explained that the statutory definitions of intentionally and recklessly are mutually exclusive and inconsistent.... Reckless conduct is not intentional conduct because [a person] who acts recklessly does not have a conscious objective to cause a particular result.... Thus, we observed that [t]he\n   <em>\n    intent to cause death required for a conviction of attempted\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    murder\n   </em>\n   [under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a (a) ] ... necessitated a finding that the defendant\n   <em>\n    acted with the conscious objective to cause death\n   </em>\n   ... [whereas] [t]he\n   <em>\n    reckless conduct necessary to be found for a conviction of assault\n   </em>\n   under [ General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) ] ... required a finding that\n   <em>\n    the defendant acted without such a conscious objective\n   </em>\n   .... We concluded, therefore, that the jury verdicts [with respect to attempt to commit murder and reckless assault in the first degree] each of which requires a mutually exclusive and inconsistent state of mind as an essential element for conviction cannot stand.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nash\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20651\">\n    316 Conn. at 660-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%20128\">\n    114 A.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant also relies on\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chyung\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489400\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/628/#p255\">\n    325 Conn. 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489400\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/628/#p255\">\n    157 A.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

The state argues on appeal that the jury could have viewed each strike of Agyei's vehicle as a separate act, with a separate mental state. It conceded during oral argument before this court, however, that if we view both strikes of the collision as one act, the mental elements of these two counts are mutually exclusive. We are not persuaded by the state's argument that the jury could have viewed each strike as a separate act because the state never made such an argument to the jury; rather, it consistently argued that this was one continuous act. As our Supreme Court repeatedly has stated, the state is bound by the theory it presented to the jury; on appeal, it may not rely on a theory of the case that differs from the theory that was presented to the jury.

As part of their investigation of the collision involving Agyei's vehicle, the police obtained a video of the incident from Harding High School, which had surveillance cameras in the area. The footage from the video showed a white sport utility vehicle (SUV) hitting a darker colored vehicle. Detective Arthur Calvao of the Bridgeport Police Department printed out several still photographs from certain relevant frames of the video, which depict a white SUV striking a dark colored vehicle from the side and then from the rear. Although the investigators were unable to identify the make and model of the white SUV from the video or the photographs, Ortiz, the lead detective on this matter, interviewed Agyei's son, who insisted that the vehicle that hit his mother's vehicle was a white BMW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   One of the Bridgeport police detectives then went to a BMW dealership and showed the still photographs to personnel there, who identified the white SUV as a newer model BMW X3. The police, thereafter, obtained a list of the owners of all 2000-2014 BMW X3s and X5s registered in Connecticut from the Department of Motor Vehicles, and they began visiting the homes of the people on the list, asking to inspect their BMWs. If the vehicle had no damage, the police crossed it off their list. If the vehicle had front end damage, the police spoke further with the owner, and towed the vehicle to the police department for further inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   One of the vehicles examined by the police belonged to the defendant. Ortiz observed that the defendant's vehicle had damage to its front end that was consistent with the collision being investigated. The defendant admitted to Ortiz that she had driven west on Boston Avenue between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. on December 4, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ortiz then called for a tow truck, which took the defendant's BMW to the police department. The front bumper of the vehicle was sent to the state forensic laboratory for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Alison Gingell, a forensic examiner at the state laboratory, performed testing on the bumper, and she compared a paint sample from Agyei's Subaru with a paint particle she found stuck on the bumper of the defendant's BMW. After analysis, Gingell concluded that the samples were similar in color, texture, structure, chemical type, and elemental composition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The defendant argues that \"Ortiz testified that a Bridgeport police detective visited a [BMW] dealership\n   ... and showed members of the staff there [photographs] of the BMW. Those individuals '\n   <em>\n    determined that it was an X3 BMW, a new model\n   </em>\n   .' ... This statement by an employee of [the dealership] is testimonial hearsay.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) She also argues: \"The admission of this testimony violated the defendant's right of confrontation because she never had the chance to cross-examine the person from the dealership to test the basis of this information.\" The state responds that the statement of the dealership employee was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. It argues: \"Because the purpose of the statement was\n   not to show that the vehicle in the [photograph] was, in fact, a BMW X3 but, instead, [was] merely to show how the police investigation proceeded, it was not hearsay and raised no legitimate confrontation clause issue.\" We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"It is fundamental that the defendant's rights to confront the witnesses against him and to present a defense are guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.... A defendant's right to present a defense is rooted in the compulsory process and confrontation clauses of the sixth amendment ....

They then used that information to obtain a list of similar vehicles from the Department of Motor Vehicles.

Rather, it was used to demonstrate the route that the police took in deciding to obtain a list of 2000-2014 X3 and X5 BMWs and in conducting their investigation, which included investigating fifteen model years of X3s and X5s, and not just newer model X3s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that the defendant's evidentiary claim fails under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's second prong because the admission of an out-of-court statement for purposes other than its truth raises no confrontation clause issue.

Because of the inconsistency in the verdicts, we have no way of knowing whether the jury, if it properly had considered the mental elements of each crime, would have found the defendant guilty of reckless manslaughter or criminally negligent operation. Setting aside one of the convictions, therefore, will not cure the problem. Moreover, it is not for this court, on appeal, to make a factual determination as to the defendant's mental state or states at the time the collision occurred. The inconsistent verdicts, therefore, require that we vacate the defendant's convictions on the charges of reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent operation, and order a new trial thereon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520712\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/585/\">\n    216 Conn. at 594-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20A.2d%20896\">\n    583 A.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On retrial, if properly supported by the evidence and pursued by the state pursuant to the same theory, the trial court may submit both counts to the jury, but it should instruct the jury that criminally negligent operation and reckless manslaughter can be found only in the alternative. The court also should make clear to the jury that it may find the defendant guilty of either criminally negligent operation or reckless manslaughter, but it may not convict her of both.

To the\n   extent that the state is asking for the conviction of intentional manslaughter to be reinstated, and not simply that the state be permitted to retry the defendant on that charge, we decline to do so. The state moved at sentencing to vacate the conviction on that charge partly because doing so went \"along with the spirit of the state's intent during the beginning of this case.\" See footnote 3 of this opinion. Under these circumstances, the most the state can ask for is what the defendant has requested-a retrial on all three of the charges related to Agyei's death. In the concluding paragraph of her appellate brief, the defendant requests \"that she be granted a new trial on all the charges.
