Plaintiff's complaint alleges that defendant South Jersey Pubs Inc., doing business as TGIF, violated the CFA and the TCCWNA by failing to list beverage prices on its menu. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself as well as injunctive and declaratory relief for all individuals who received a menu and ordered a beverage from a menu without a price in one of defendant's two establishments during a specific time period. He specifically seeks permanent injunctive relief directing defendant to include beverage prices on its menus and a declaration that the failure to do so is an unlawful commercial practice under the CFA and a violation of the TCCWNA. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion for class certification because he satisfied the requirements for (b)(2) class certification. We agree and reverse the denial of (b)(2) class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We glean the following facts from the motion record. Defendant is a franchisee of TGIF and owns and operates two TGIF restaurants,\n   one in Toms River and the other in Manahawkin. On August 1, 2012, plaintiff went to defendant's restaurant in Toms River.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was given a menu, initially ordered a water, then his meal, and a beer, and then added a soda. He believed that all of this, plus tip, would cost about $20. After finishing his meal, plaintiff was presented with the bill and was shocked to see that he had been billed over \"$5[ ] for a mass produced beer, and ... close to ... $3[ ] ... for a soda.\" On his way out, plaintiff looked at a menu and noticed that the drink prices were not listed. Plaintiff stated that he never would have ordered the drinks if the prices were listed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, plaintiff filed his complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 24, 2015, plaintiff filed an initial motion for class certification, but withdrew it on March 21, 2016. On September 13, 2017, he renewed his motion for class certification under\n   <em>\n    Rules\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2) or (b)(3). Plaintiff sought a class of \"[a]ll customers of ... [defendant's] restaurants who purchased items from [a] menu that did not have a disclosed price\" during the period from August 1, 2006 through the present date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, on October 5, 2017, a day after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff withdrew his motion for class certification under (b)(3) for damages and relied solely on class certification under (b)(2) for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While his renewed motion was pending, plaintiff filed an amended complaint in November 2017. In the amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant violated the CFA and the TCCWNA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   based on its failure to list certain beverage prices on its menu. According to plaintiff, defendant's actions were contrary to N.J.S.A. 56:8-2.2 and N.J.S.A. 56:8-2.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. The complaint demanded monetary damages for plaintiff and a \"proposed class ... of all customers of ... [defendant's] restaurants who purchased items from the menu that did not have a disclosed price[,]\" and declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of himself and the class. Plaintiff specifically sought a declaration that \"[d]efendant's practice ... [was] unlawful\" and an injunction to prevent \"[d]efendant from continuing to offer beverages for sale without written price\n   disclosures.\" Defendant filed an answer denying the allegations in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to plaintiff, despite the age of the case, no discovery had been completed prior to the class certification motion being considered by the court. However, plaintiff relied upon discovery obtained in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   to support his complaint's factual contentions. Citing to that discovery, plaintiff alleged that TGIF intentionally developed a plan to not disclose beverage prices on its restaurants' menus as a form of \"menu engineering,\" after it conducted various market studies that concluded by not disclosing prices, it could charge higher prices to its patrons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying upon a deposition\n   taken in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   from one of defendant's officers in this case, plaintiff alleged that defendant followed TGIF's procedure from 2008 through 2016 and he argued that defendant stopped doing so only to avoid being held liable in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 27, 2018, the motion judge heard argument and afterward denied plaintiff's (b)(2) class certification motion, placing his reasons on the record that day. Initially, the judge opined that the CFA \"violations here [were] not clearly established[,] which would warrant ... injunctive relief,\" but that was \"not dispositive.\" He also observed that the CFA was not \"all about\" a litigant being able to pursue \"comprehensive injunctive proceedings brought on behalf of thousands ... of individuals who are now being told they don't have to worry about whether they've been damaged ....\" He also found that the purported class was \"a large group of people.... [that was] hard to determine ....\" According to the judge, injunctive relief was not necessary because it was \"future oriented\" and there was no \"showing that any individual or members of the class would ... suffer future ... grievances.... [as] the whole purpose of an injunction is to avoid damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Addressing the purported class, the judge found that it consisted of \"thousands of ... [people] who were just simply identified if\n   [they] showed up [at defendant's establishment,]\" so the class was \"generalized.\" He then turned back to the CFA and stated that in determining class certification under (b)(2), \"you don't have to worry about predominance,\" as required by (b)(3), but found that \"cohesiveness require[d] th[e] [c]ourt to search through the record ... [and] the potential claims to determine whether ... the interests of the individuals are so disparate and so lack[ing] of cohesion that it would make it inappropriate for a class action.\"\n   Applying that standard, the judge concluded that there was no evidence of cohesiveness, especially here \"where one consumer can go off and get ... injunct[ive relief] without having some kind of proof of ascertainable loss as it applies to the remainder of the group.\" The judge distinguished this case from\n   <em>\n    Laufer v. U.S. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2895061\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/172/#p188\">\n    385 N.J. Super. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2895061\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/172/#p188\">\n    896 A.2d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 2006), in which we held, in part, that only a putative class plaintiff needs to demonstrate ascertainable loss under the CFA to maintain a (b)(2) class action for purported violations of the CFA. The judge stated that although the putative class plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Laufer\n   </em>\n   was only required to demonstrate ascertainable loss, \"ascertainable loss [was] evident in the remainder of the group.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relying on the Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   , the judge concluded that \"if damage claims can't be subject to class action, then ... injunctive [relief] can't be subject to class action because injunctive [relief] is secondary to the damage claims in the consumer protection world unless you're the Attorney General. Then you don't have to prove damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judge entered an order denying class certification on April 30, 2018. We granted plaintiff leave to appeal and later issued a stay pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff contends that the motion judge erred and abused his discretion in not certifying the class based upon the judge's consideration of whether plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded in his complaint, \"the ultimate merits of the case,\" and\n   the judge's perception that injunctive relief was not necessary because defendant alleged it voluntarily agreed to disclose beverage prices on its menus going forward. Moreover, plaintiff asserts that the judge incorrectly believed that in order to certify the class, plaintiff was bound to come forward with evidence that all putative class members sustained an ascertainable loss under the CFA. Finally, plaintiff argues that the motion judge \"conflate[ed] cohesion and predominance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant contends that the motion judge correctly denied class certification. The thrust of defendant's response is that proposed class members may have decided to purchase beverages from defendant on any given date for reasons totally unrelated to \"the lack of menu pricing.\" According to defendant, \"even if one assumes that patrons viewed the same menus, there is simply no way of knowing which individuals ordered beverages without knowing the prices in advance, and what information about prices they had even in the absence of menu pricing.\" Although not argued before the motion judge, it further argues to us that the individual nature of \"[e]ach proposed class member's dining experience lacked the typicality and commonality necessary for class certification under [\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   ] 4:32-1(a) due to the unlimited variations in customers' interactions with servers regrading beverage purchases.\" Citing to\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   , defendant contends that the Court found that \"there were too many individual variants among how individual patrons ordered beverages to find that 'common questions of law or fact' were 'predominant.' \" In addition, defendant avers that in any event, plaintiff was not entitled to injunctive relief once he abandoned his claim for monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review a trial court's order granting or denying class certification for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    231 N.J. at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    171 A.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In our view, the facts of this case give rise to exactly the type of claims that (b)(2) class certification was intended to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We begin our review by observing that certifying a \"class action is 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.' \"\n   <em>\n    Iliadis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758689,5758262\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/191/88/\">\n    191 N.J. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5758689\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/191/88/5758689/\">\n    922 A.2d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Califano v.

It explained that for the (b)(3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   predominance requirement to be met, a more limited class was required. It stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Although Bozzi asserts general claims that the defendant's restaurants failed to disclose prices, his allegations focus primarily on a specific pricing practice. He alleges that the defendant's restaurants violated the CFA by increasing the price charged to a customer for the same brand, type, and volume of beverage in the\n   course of the customer's visit to the restaurant, without notifying the customer of the change. Bozzi's counsel represents that this price-shifting claim is supported by claimant-specific receipts showing that each customer making this claim was charged different prices for the same brand, type, and volume of beverage in the course of a single visit to one of the defendant's restaurants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   We hold that if the\n   <em>\n    Bozzi\n   </em>\n   class is redefined to include only customers who make that specific CFA claim, and the claim is limited accordingly, plaintiff Bozzi has met the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1 and may attempt to prove that claim on behalf of the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court directed that \"[o]n remand, the trial court should certify the class solely for the purpose of pursuing CFA claims based upon the defendant restaurants' alleged practice of charging a customer different prices for beverages of the same brand, type, and volume during the same restaurant visit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    171 A.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Court also vacated the injunctive relief that the trial court granted in\n   <em>\n    Bozzi\n   </em>\n   compelling the defendant to list beverage prices, it did so only because the injunction applied to too broad of a class and because \"Bozzi offered no argument in support of the trial court's injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   n.14. However, it specifically preserved Bozzi's claim for injunctive relief under the CFA, directing the trial court to consider the application anew after the \"certification of the more limited class.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The fact that Bozzi did not satisfy the (b)(3) predominance requirement did not therefore persuade the Court that injunctive relief could not be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We also disagree with the motion judge's view of \"cohesiveness\" under (b)(2). We conclude that the appropriate consideration is whether a single injunction would provide relief to all members of the purported class. Here, regardless of what happened at defendant's restaurants that led to patrons who received menus ordering beverages, if plaintiff is correct, the law required that they all be advised on the menu of the pricing for all items being offered for sale. A (b)(2) class seeking injunctive relief directing the inclusion of menu pricing does not require a class member to be able to opt in or out of the class and the relief, if granted, would apply to all patrons who visited the establishments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   It is the remedy's ability to satisfy all similar claims that is a proper consideration in determining (b)(2) cohesiveness, not the commonality of the patron's dining experiences at the two restaurants. The mere fact that some members of the class who had a different dining experience after receiving menus are swept up into the class does not cause them or defendant any harm or additional burden. All members will benefit if plaintiff proves the CFA has been violated, and defendant will have no obligation to all class members other than posting prices, if required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Significantly, the cost of complying with injunctive relief if granted is far less in plaintiff's case than in\n   <em>\n    Laufer\n   </em>\n   where the defendant was directed to print and mail notices to each class member. Here, the\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   Court's concern about the cost of dealing with millions of claims does not exist. Defendant's menus need only be updated\n   to reflect prices and there is no need to pay the costs of identifying and notifying individual class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We conclude that plaintiff's CFA claim was appropriate for class certification and raised the precise type of claim that, if proven, was amenable to a single injunction that would afford relief to the entire class, as contemplated by (b)(2). For that reason, we reverse the motion judge's determination as to plaintiff's CFA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We reach a similar conclusion regarding plaintiff's other (b)(2) claim that defendant violated the TCCWNA, which \"is intended 'to prevent deceptive practices in consumer contracts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Spade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/#p518\">\n    232 N.J. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494745\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/969/#p518\">\n    181 A.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    231 N.J. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    171 A.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"Its purpose 'is to prevent deceptive practices in consumer contracts by prohibiting the use of illegal terms or warranties in consumer contracts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pisack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497880\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/188/1088/#p250\">\n    455 N.J.

First, as noted, the Court did not address the TCCWNA claim for (b)(2) certification, which does not require a focus on each purported class member's individual dining experience. By definition, as plaintiff identified the class, plaintiff and each member of the class received a menu and ordered a beverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Second, the granting of (b)(2) class certification here does not raise concerns about the Legislature's intention to not impose extreme financial hardship for TCCWNA violations. The focus is rather on whether a single injunction and declaratory relief, if either is warranted, can provide a remedy to the entire class or none of them in order to compel the inclusion of beverage prices on menus, if their omission gives rise to a violation of law. Moreover, if required, the cost of altering menus for the two restaurants is minimal compared to the costs of\n   the penalties addressed by the\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Third, although we agree that the\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   Court correctly observed that there is no case law or Attorney General opinions declaring the failure to include beverage prices on a menu to be a violation of the TCCWNA or any other law, we note that there is no legal authority that holds to the contrary-that the omission is in fact lawful. Finally, plaintiff's class is narrowly drawn to include only those who ordered off menus without beverage prices. Whether one or all members of the class did so is of no moment if defendant was required to include the price in order to not violate the law. If a court were to find that the failure to disclose prices on a menu given to plaintiff and the class members was a violation of the TCCWNA because a required provision to a consumer\n   contract was not included, we cannot envision any circumstances where declaratory and injunctive relief would not be valid remedies to consider, if necessary, to secure future compliance with the law. To hold otherwise, would allow a merchant to intentionally violate the law without being subjected to any action brought under (b)(2) or (b)(3) seeking to enforce the CFA and the TCCWNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Reversed and remanded for entry of an order vacating the denial of class certification and ordering (b)(2) class certification.

Plaintiff alleges that on August 1, 2012, he went to one of defendant's restaurants. He claims a server provided him with a menu and he thereafter ordered a beer and soda. Plaintiff thought his bill and the tip would cost about $20, and claims he was \"shocked\" when charged \"$5[ ] for a mass produced beer\" and almost $3 for a soda. Plaintiff alleges that when he left the restaurant, he looked at a menu and noticed it did not list the prices for drinks. He claims he would not have ordered the beverages, or would have ordered less expensive beverages, if the prices had been listed on the menu.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In this case plaintiff asserts essentially the same claims that the plaintiffs asserted in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   . He alleges that defendant violated the CFA by engaging in an unconscionable business practice in violation of N.J.S.A. 56:8-2, based on defendant's failure to disclose the prices of beverages on the menu prior to sale. He alleges defendant\n   also violated the CFA by engaging in a form of \"bait and switch\" in violation of N.J.S.A. 56:8-2.2 because the price of the beverages purchased were not disclosed until the \"merchandise\" had been consumed. Plaintiff also claims defendant violated the TCCWNA because consumers allegedly \"have a clearly established legal right to have the total selling price plainly marked or located at the point\" of sale. In addition, plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiff sought monetary damages for himself; designation of a class of persons, which includes all of defendant's patrons who purchased items from menus that did not disclose prices; and declaratory and injunctive relief for himself and the members of the class. Plaintiff later filed a motion to certify a class pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2). In the amended complaint, plaintiff defined the class as \"all customers of New Jersey South Jersey Pubs restaurants who purchased items from the menu that did not have a disclosed price.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   It appears that plaintiff's application for class certification was based on the CFA and TCCWNA claims. It also appears that plaintiff has abandoned his claims for monetary relief on behalf of the class, and he only sought class certification under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2) for the purpose of seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on the CFA and TCCWNA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   As the majority notes, the trial court denied plaintiff's motion.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 169-70, 213 A.3d at 975. The trial court determined that plaintiff had not satisfied the requirement of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2) that the claims of the class be cohesive. The court noted that under the CFA, the plaintiff could not seek injunctive relief on behalf of a class of persons without showing that the members of the class\n   each sustained some ascertainable loss.

The majority states that the trial court erred by concluding that plaintiff could not seek class-based injunctive relief for the alleged CFA violations.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The majority also states that the trial court \"misconstrued the requirement for cohesiveness to include a requirement that plaintiff had to prove that the class members could all establish damages or an ascertainable loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   It should be noted that in this case, plaintiff sought certification of a class that includes all persons who purchased a beverage at defendant's restaurants from menus that did not include beverage prices. The majority finds class certification is appropriate under (b)(2) because defendant allegedly acted or failed to act \"on grounds generally applicable to the\n   class\" by failing to provide patrons with menus that include beverage prices.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 190-91, 213 A.3d at 987-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In my view, the claims and the relief sought are not appropriate for certification under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2) because although defendant allegedly provided the putative class members with menus that did not have beverage pricing, the class members may have chosen to purchase beverages for reasons that had nothing to do with the lack of beverage prices on the menu. Indeed, plaintiff alleges he purchased beverages, notwithstanding the absence of that information, apparently with the expectation that he would be charged a price less than he was actually charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Other patrons may have been return customers, who knew the prices that defendant would charge for beverages. In addition, other patrons may have had no concern as to the amounts defendant would charge for drinks. Thus, there is a lack cohesiveness among the putative class members as to whether they were, in fact, harmed by the lack of beverage pricing on the menus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   I believe the majority also errs by determining that private litigants can obtain class-based injunctive relief under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2) for the alleged violations of the CFA.

By its terms, the TCCWNA addresses \"contract[s],\" \"warrant[ies],\" \"notice[s],\" and \"sign[s]\" and does not apply when a defendant fails to provide a consumer with a required writing. Here, the writing on which plaintiffs rely is the restaurant menu. Plaintiffs concede that, at a minimum, a claimant must prove that he or she was presented with a menu during his or her visit to the defendant's restaurant in order to establish the defendants' liability under the TCCWNA. That critical inquiry cannot be resolved by customer receipts or other documents. Even if we accept plaintiff's theory of liability under the TCCWNA, the testimony of the individual claimant or another witness would be necessary to prove that the plaintiff satisfied the statute's requirements and is thus an \"aggrieved consumer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    at 71-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12460508,12491276\" index=\"460\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/231/24/\">\n    171 A.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (citations omitted).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The TCCWNA claims asserted in this case are essentially the same as those asserted in\n   <em>\n    Dugan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bozzi\n   </em>\n   .

It also may depend on whether the patron previously had been at the restaurant, purchased a beverage, and knew what the price would be.

In my view, they are not. Therefore, I would conclude that the trial court correctly decided to deny certification of the class under\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:32-1(b)(2) for the TCCWNA claims.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
