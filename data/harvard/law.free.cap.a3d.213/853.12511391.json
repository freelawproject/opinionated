The Circuit Court (\n   <em>\n    Moran\n   </em>\n   , J.) ruled that RSA 170-B:4 (2014) does not authorize such an adoption and dismissed the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 170-B:4 (governing who may adopt). On appeal, the petitioners argue that the trial court erred because they are eligible to jointly adopt J.W. pursuant to RSA 170-B:4, II and III. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The relevant facts follow. M.F. is the biological father of J.W., who was born in 2007. M.F. has been in a relationship with C.N. since approximately 2008. They live together and share two biological children but have never married. J.W. has lived with them since approximately 2011, when M.F. was awarded primary residential responsibility of J.W. The parental rights of J.W.'s birth mother were terminated in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   M.F. and C.N. thereafter filed a joint petition to adopt J.W. They argued that their joint petition is authorized under RSA 170-B:4 because M.F. is \"[t]he unmarried parent of the adoptee,\" RSA 170-B:4, III, and C.N. is \"[a]n unmarried adult,\" RSA 170-B:4, II.

The petitioners focus on paragraph III, asserting that this paragraph is \"intended to permit the unmarried parent of a child to adopt the child\n   <em>\n    jointly\n   </em>\n   with another individual.\" (Emphasis added.) They reason that paragraph III must be so construed because, otherwise, it \"would amount to mere surplusage, as an unmarried parent of the child, in possession of full parental rights, would have no need or reason to pursue adoption.\" In other words, the petitioners assume that an unmarried parent would have no reason to seek adoption of his or her child as a sole petitioner, and thus the legislature's intent in including paragraph III was to facilitate a joint adoption by the unmarried parent and another individual. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We first note that paragraph III of the statute, like paragraph II, is phrased in the singular.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 170-B:4, III (\"The unmarried\n   <em>\n    parent\n   </em>\n   of the adoptee.\" (emphasis added)).

Although that case did not involve the application of RSA 170-B:4, III, both\n   <em>\n    Jason C.\n   </em>\n   and the plain language of paragraph III support the conclusion that the\n   legislature intended to allow the unmarried parent of the adoptee to pursue the adoption as a sole petitioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20A.2d%2032\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20A.2d%2032\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; RSA 170-B:4, III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We find further support for this conclusion in the 1971 version of the Uniform Adoption Act (UAA), from which the language of RSA 170-B:4 originates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Unif.

Nor are we presented with the issue raised in many of the out-of-state cases relied upon by the petitioners, in which the court considered whether to construe the jurisdiction's adoption statutes so as to permit the same-sex partner of the child's biological parent to adopt the child, without severing the biological parent's parental\n   rights, at a time when the jurisdiction did not recognize same-sex marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Petition of K.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"291586\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/274/189/\">\n    274 Ill.App.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20Ill.%20Dec.%20693\">\n    210 Ill.Dec. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20888\">\n    653 N.E.2d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890, 898-99 (1995) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of K.S.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9279552\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/804/1253/#p1254\">\n    804 N.E.2d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1254, 1256-57, 1260 (Ind.

Like the State, we believe \"that a liberal construction of the adoption statute\" allows petitioner C.N. to adopt J.W., the minor son of her domestic partner, petitioner M.F., \"without requiring [M.F.] to surrender his parental rights over J.W., so long as both [M.F.] and C.N. consent to the adoption arrangement and the trial court finds that the adoption is in J.W.'s best interests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The petitioners are unmarried, domestic partners and, together, are the biological parents of two children. M.F. and C.N. have been together since approximately 2008. M.F. is also the biological father of J.W., a minor, who was born in December 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 170-B:2, XI (2014) (defining a \"minor\" for the purposes of adoption law as an individual \"under the age of 18\"). In addition, M.F. is J.W.'s legal father, having been named on J.W.'s birth certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 170-B:2, X(a) (2014). The parental rights of J.W.'s biological mother were terminated in 2017. J.W. has resided with M.F. and C.N. since approximately 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In 2018, the petitioners jointly filed a petition to adopt J.W. Their petition was jointly filed, even though M.F. has, in his\n   attorney's words, \"full parental rights\" with respect to J.W. C.N. petitioned under RSA 170-B:4, II, which allows \"[a]n unmarried adult\" to adopt. RSA 170-B:4, II (2014). M.F. purported to do so pursuant to RSA 170-B:4, III, which allows \"[t]he unmarried parent of the adoptee\" to adopt. RSA 170-B:4, III (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At the hearing on their motion, the petitioners' attorney explained the petition was brought jointly so as to allow M.F. to retain his parental rights:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If I brought a petition solely in [C.N.'s] name, it would seem that [M.F.] would have to terminate his parental rights for that to get finalized. So I brought a joint petition with [M.F. and C.N.], who are not married but have been in a family unit for over a decade at this point and have two children in common.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   So I'm trying to get clarification from the Court.... [I]f the Court says they need to be married, I will have a conversation with my clients about that. If the Court says we could bring it in [C.N.'s] name and we can waive the termination of [M.F.'s] rights, then we can do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ultimately, the trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that RSA chapter 170-B \"does not authorize an adoption application from an unmarried adult when a biological parent is not surrendering his parental rights.\" In effect, the trial court ruled that the outcome that the petitioners sought - that C.N. would adopt J.W., and M.F. would retain his parental rights - was not possible under the current statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The petitioners and our colleagues focus upon the fact that M.F. and C.N. brought the adoption petition jointly. We believe that focus is mistaken. New Hampshire is a notice pleading jurisdiction and, as such, we take a liberal approach to the technical requirements of pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Although the petition in this case was filed jointly, M.F. cannot \"adopt\" J.W. because he already has full, parental rights over him. Thus, we believe that the petition, properly viewed, is a petition by C.N. alone.
