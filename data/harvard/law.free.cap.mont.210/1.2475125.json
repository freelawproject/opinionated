The amendment in sentence makes the sentence more consistent with similar transactions in that area during the time this particular crime was committed. This Board finds that the Parole Officer also recommended a deferred imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">We wish to thank Ann German, Attorney from Libby, for her assistance to the Defendant and to this court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-13\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</judges>\n<judges id=\"b557-14\">Joseph B.
