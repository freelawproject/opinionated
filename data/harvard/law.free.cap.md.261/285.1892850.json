Bowers and Wahneta Bowers, his wife, two of the defendants below and two of the appellees in this Court, as \u201cSeller\u201d whereby Commonwealth for a consideration of $100.00 was given the \u201cprivilege of purchasing\u201d from the Bowers for $18,000.00 a parcel of land located along the Sharpsburg Pike in Washington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Chief Judge McLaughlin in a specific performance suit filed by Commonwealth in the Circuit Court for Washington County on October 29', 1968 (Commonwealth Realty Corporation, the parent Company of Commonwealth being joined as a party plaintiff as the real party in interest in accordance with Maryland Rule 203 a, and the other appellant in this Court), against Mr. and Mrs. Bowers and the Sun Oil Company (Sun) (the remaining defendant below and appellee in this Court) to enforce specifically the contract of October 13, 1965, or, in the alternative, for damages, and for other relief, dismissed the bill of complaint on July 29, 1970, upon a number of grounds including laches, abandonment of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>by Commonwealth and vagueness in the contractual language. We are of the opinion that the provision of the option contract relied upon by Commonwealth is void and unenforceable as violating the rule against perpetuities, and, in any event, even upon the construction urged upon us by Commonwealth, would be an -unreasonable restraint on alienation. We will affirm the decree for these reasons, finding it unnecessary to rule upon the additional reasons assigned by the Chancellor for dismissing the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The option contract (which was a printed form amended as indicated below), which bound and inured to the heirs, personal representatives and assigns of the respective parties, after reciting in paragraph 1 the $100.-00 consideration and the ultimate purchase price of $18,-000.00, provided in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>This Agreement shall extend for 180 days; or, if the requisite zoning and permits, described in Article 4 hereof have not been finally issued or denied beyond appeal, until 15 days after such final action thereon.

In order to obtain a health department permit for a sewerage system for the Smith property (there being no public sewer available), Commonwealth sometime in March, 1966, made application to the Washington County Health Department for a percolation test and permit. First, small test holes were dug, some fifteen by thirty inches, but the Health Department did not find that the use of these holes passed the percolation tests. The Supervisor of the Sanitarians of the Health Department, Frank H. War-field, then indicated that the Smith property would have to be retested by use of deeper and larger holes dug by a back hoe. Commonwealth then employed a local contractor, James Short, to dig the larger and deeper holes. Mr. Bowers, who could easily see from his property \u2014 where he and his wife resided \u2014 the digging of the holes by the back hoe on adjacent Smith property, testified, without contradiction, that these holes were approximately four or five feet wide by four or five feet long and about four or five feet deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Mr. Warfield, after inspecting the Smith property after the large holes were dug by the back hoe, wrote Commonwealth on March 23,1966, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cIn response to your request I visited the premises of the Lee L. Smith property on Maryland Rt. 65 near Interstate Route 70 to evaluate the suitability of the ground for the installation of a private sewage disposal system for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>planned Drive-In service station. Mr. James Short had dug holes in an effort for this department to determine the availability of ground suitable for a private sewage disposal system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">\u201cOn March 22, 1966, the visit indicated that due to the degree of rockiness and the limited space for a private sewage disposal system, we cannot issue a permit at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">\u201cWe would recommend that you engage a professional engineer to design a sewage system for your Drive-In service station based on the regulations of the Maryland State Department of Health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cOur evaluation of the land indicates that more ground which is suitable for a private sewage disposal system is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Commonwealth then requested Lee Downey, of the Settles Real Estate Agency, the real estate broker who had assisted in the obtention of the option contract of October 13, 1965, to obtain permission from the Bowers to allow the same testing on their property as had been done on the Smith Property. Downey went to the Bowers property on March 31, 1966, and talked with Mr. Bowers, this being the first contact the Bowers had had with any one from Commonwealth since October 13, 1965, when the option contract was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Mr. Downey talked with Mr. Bowers and Bowers refused permission to bring a back hoe on the property because, as he testified, the Health Department had told him over the telephone that this was not necessary and Bowers was apprehensive that harm would result to his children and his ponies from the digging of large holes on the property. Bowers did say that he would allow the usual tests which had been described'to him by the Health Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">On April 9, 1966, Carl G. Wittig, another representative of Commonwealth, called on Mr. and Mrs. Bowers to talk to them about their refusal to allow a back hoe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>on the property. Mr. Bowers again refused but stated that he would sign the necessary applications for the necessary tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Mr. Wittig, on April 11, sent a letter to the Bowers as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cYour recent refusal to allow us to perform percolation tests on your Sharpsburg Pike property renders it impossible for us to procure permits as contemplated in the Agreement of October 13, 1966 [5]. Of course it also extends the period of that Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cSince you refuse us permission to accomplish such tests, at our expense we will expect you to undertake them at your expense and advise us the results and we will treat such period as elapses between 11 April and full completion of such tests as an extension of the basic 180 day period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201cHerewith you will find our check for $60.00 for the first 30 days of the 180 day extension period. As above, the 30 day portion and the 180 day period will not start upon completion of percolation tests and issuanc\u00e9 of Health Department report instead of 11 April 1966.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Counsel for the Bowers on April 12 replied to the Wittig letter of April 11, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201cPlease be advised the option signed by the Bowers made no provision for any entry by optionee upon the land of the Bowers for any purposes. Paragraph #4 of said option required of the Bowers, only to sign any application forms, etc., that optionee requested. No applications were ever presented to the Bowers for signatures. No request to perform percolation tests were made or refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201cOn March 31, when a representative of your company requested permission to enter upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>property of the Bowers with a backhoe digger to dig holes which were described to them to be of the size of 4 by 5 feet, permission was refused as holes this size are not necessary for percolation tests. When a representative from your company visited them on April 9, he was informed that if he would bring the necessary application from the Health Department for percolation tests, they would sign. No application was presented to them before expiration of this option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">\u201cAm returning your check in the amount of $60 and we consider the option, dated October 13, 1965, as having expired; and, have advised the Bowers that they are now free to deal with the property as they see fit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Commonwealth, as we have indicated, recorded the option contract of October 13, 1965, on April 19, 1966, and Commonwealth wrote the Bowers on April 27 that it had received the letter from their counsel of April 12, regretted the position taken by them and observed that the advice given them by their counsel \u201cmay be correct\u201d but that Commonwealth thought that it was not. The letter of April 27 then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cThe Washington County Health Department indicated that deep test holes are a prerequisite to percolation test for commercial usage. As described to you by both Messrs. Downey and Wittig, these test holes would be refilled the same day they were dug. While open, they would have been guarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cAccordingly, we reiterate the advice of our letter of April 11, 1966 and advise you that we consider the Agreement of October 13, 1965 to be in continuing force and effect and that we intend to reserve our rights thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The Health Department, on May 3, advised Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>wealth that a permit for the Smith property would be issued subject to certain conditions. Commonwealth took title to the Smith property on May 6, 1966, and thereafter conveyed it to Humble Oil Company. Commonwealth, however, did nothing in regard to the Bowers property until the present case arose in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In October 1967, Sun became interested in the Bowers property. After negotiations, study of the matter and the conclusion of a survey and title examination, took title to the property by deed on May 8, 1968, paying $50,-000.00 for the property to the Bowers. A representative of Sun \u2014 after the Bowers had signed the contract of sale with Sun, but prior to Sun\u2019s signing \u2014 learned that there had been a prior option on the property but was advised by counsel for t]ie Bowers that it was no longer in effect. Sun had acquired the property to the north of the Bowers property and began construction on that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In June 1968 as a result of a casual conversation at luncheon, Commonwealth learned that Sun had purchased the Bowers property. A letter, on behalf of Commonwealth, was written Sun on June 26, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cMy clients [Commonwealth] have presented me with sufficient papers to indicate to me that this option is still operable through breach by Bowers after due and proper notification. I have no objection to a full discussion of this cause and would prefer to resolve it without litigation and before involving local Washington County, Maryland co-counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201cI await your advice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Later Commonwealth tried unsuccessfully to get Sun to transfer the Bowers\u2019 property to Commonwealth for $18,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">After the Bowers moved on July 25, 1968, Sun began work on the Bowers property, and has completed its service station on the Bowers and adjoining property to the north.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Commonwealth, on October 29, 1968, filed the bill of complaint, already mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As we have stated, the Chancellor filed a written opinion and a decree dismissing the bill of complaint for a variety of reasons. In his opinion he found as a fact that the Bowers \u201chad no objection to tests being made and that their real objection was to the use of a backhoe digging large holes.\u201d He also found as a fact that Commonwealth had not made any application for a permit from the Health Department \u201cin spite of the fact that the sole bone of contention was the digging of large holes\u201d and that Commonwealth had recorded the option contract and \u201crested its case on the theory\u201d that the $100.00 payment \u201ctied up the property until someone called to make a deal\u201d \u2014paraphrasing a portion of the testimony of Benjamin Vinton, Jr., President of Commonwealth. The Chancellor concluded that there had been no breach by the Bowers of the option contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In construing the option contract, it will be observed that, by paragraph 2 it had a term of 180 days <em>or </em>if the permits mentioned in paragraph 4 \u201chave not been finally issued or denied beyond appeal, until 15 days after such final action thereon.\u201d Then follows a provision that Commonwealth could renew the option contract for an additional period of 180 days \u201cfrom the later of the above dates\u201d by paying an additional consideration of $2.00 for each day of renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Paragraph 4 recites the intended use of the premises for \u201ca drive-in business\u201d or for commercial purposes generally and provides the Bowers \u201cshall sign all applications necessary to special or usual permits for such use to Buyer\u2019s [Commonwealth\u2019s] plans.\u201d Commonwealth \u201cshall thereafter process such applications through the cognizant governmental departments.\u201d If the permits are refused or if title is not in order, the option agreement shall terminate at Commonwealth\u2019s option and all monies paid under the agreement returned. If terminated for any other reason by Commonwealth, no monies would be returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>It will be observed that zoning approval and permits were not included in paragraph 4 but provisions in regard to them were stricken out by typewriting a line through those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The obligation of the Bowers was to sign necessary applications, but, as the Chancellor found, no Health Department application was ever presented to them for signature, so that there was no breach of this provision of the option contract by the Bowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Commonwealth maintains that there is no provision of the contract requiring it to present any application to the Bowers for their signatures and that it properly used an alternative method of obtaining Health Department approval by employing a recognized and qualified engineering firm to go forward with the percolation tests without previously obtaining a signed application by the Bowers, who breached the' option contract by refusing permission for entry and use by the engineering company of the back hoe. But as we have seen, the Chancellor found against Commonwealth on this issue and we do not think that he was in error in his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Commonwealth contends, however, that, in any event, it properly recorded the option agreement and there could be no effective transfer of the Bowers\u2019 property until the permits had been issued, 15 days had elapsed or, if the 180 day additional period was renewed by Commonwealth, until the expiration of that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The Bowers, on the other hand, contend that the alternative period is subject to an implied condition precedent that Commonwealth must within the original 180 day term make application to the Health Department for a permit, but this was never done. They contend further that Commonwealth abandoned the option contract, was guilty of laches but, in any event, the alternative provision for duration of the contract \u2014 as construed by Commonwealth \u2014 is an unreasonable restraint on alienation and violates the rule against perpetuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">As we have already indicated, we are of the opinion that assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that there is no implied condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tion precedent, nevertheless, the alternative provision for duration of the option contract as construed by Commonwealth does violate the rule against perpetuities, and that even upon the contention of Commonwealth that the rule against perpetuities does not apply, the option contract is an unreasonable restraint on alienation and hence is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The Bowers and Sun, as we have stated, contend that the provisions of the option contract upon which Commonwealth relies and as construed by it, violates the rule against perpetuities and, in any event, is an unreasonable restraint on alienation. We have concluded that this contention is correct and we shall affirm the decree of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Judge (later Chief Judge) Prescott, for the Court, in <em>Fitzpatrick v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>220 Md. 534, 540-41, 155 A. 2d 702 (1959) set forth a definition of the rule against perpetuities as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">\u201cIt has frequently been said that no full, complete and comprehensive definition has ever been given of the Rule. Many courts and text-writers, however, have adopted the statement of Professor Gray that \u2018[n]o interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\u2019 It sets out practically the same requirements that were enumerated in the previous appeal in this case, with the exception that the Court there stated that the period of time for an interest to vest was \u2018twenty-one years and ten months.\u2019 It is a rule of law, not one of construction, and it applies to legal and equitable estates of both realty and personalty. It is not a rule that invalidates interests which last too long, but interests which vest too remotely; in other words, the Rule is not concerned with the duration of estates, but the time of their vesting.\u201d (footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The rule against perpetuities and the rule that unreasonable restraints on alienation are void have the same common public policy, i.e., that property shall not be <em>extra commercium </em>for too long a period of time. Indeed, in some instances, the permissible duration of a restraint on alienation is the same as that of the rule against perpetuities. See 6, <em>American Law of Property, </em>\u00a7 26.66 (A. J. Casner ed.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The Courts, however, are properly cautioned against confusing the two rules, one dealing with the <em>vesting of estates, </em>the other with the <em>duration </em>of a restraint on alienation. Our predecessors had much difficulty iri this regard, having confused the application of the rule against perpetuities with the <em>duration </em>of a limitation on alienation rather than the <em>time of vesting </em>of the interest involved in <em>Barnum v. Barnum, </em>26 Md. 119 (1866), and having persisted in the error, in an intermittent way, until <em>Graham v. Whitridge, </em>99 Md. 248 57 A. 609 (1904) when the Court returned to the correct doctrine. For an interesting and informative review of the Maryland cases on this subject, see Gray, <em>The Rule Against Perpetuities </em>(4th ed. 1942), \u00a7 245.2 (III), pages 250-255. Since <em>Graham v. Whitridge, </em>we have continued to embrace the orthodox interpretation of the rule against perpetuities as the above quotation from <em>Fitzpatrick </em>indicates. Even in <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>however, Judge Henderson, in his dissenting opinion, indicated that he thought that the majority of the Court had misapplied the correct rule in that particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We must first determine whether the provision in the option contract comes within the ambit of the rule against perpetuities at all. Commonwealth contends that its right to exercise the option is a present vested absolute right so that there is no postponement of \u201cvesting\u201d within the scope of the Rule. We do not agree with this contention. Inasmuch as no health department permit has been issued \u2014 and will not be issued until Commonwealth presents an application for such a permit to the Bowers, their heirs and assigns \u2014 Commonwealth can postpone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the <em>vesting </em>of the fee simple estate in the Bowers\u2019 land indefinitely, i.e., for a period long beyond the period permitted by the Rule. The option contract creates in Commonwealth an equitable interest to exercise the option <em>in futuro, </em>contingent, however, upon Commonwealth (1) giving the notice required by paragraph 3 and (2) paying the $18,000.00 required to be paid by paragraph 1 of the option contract. There is no <em>present vested estate </em>in Commonwealth; the vesting of the fee simple estate in the land occurs when and if the option is exercised in the future by Commonwealth, notice given and the $18,-000.00 paid. The provision of the option contract relied on by Commonwealth comes within the purview of the Rule, and violates the Rule in that it may be exercised with a resulting vesting of the fee simple estate long after lives in being (and the period of gestation) as and when the option contract is exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In the <em>Restatement of the Law of Property, </em>\u00a7 393 at 2315 (1944), it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cSubject to exceptions stated in \u00a7\u00a7 373 (destructible interest), 395 (option in a lessee), 397 (charity) and 400 (unissued shares of a corporation), the limitation of an option in favor of a person other than the conveyor is invalid because of the rule against perpetuities when, under the language and circumstances of the limitation, such option</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201c(a) may continue for a period longer than the maximum period described in \u00a7 374; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">\u201c(b) would create an interest in land, or in some unique thing other than land, but for the rule against perpetuities\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The illustration given for \u00a7 393 is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u201c1. A, owning Blackacre in fee simple absolute, transfers to B and his heirs (or to B, a corporation) an otherwise effective and specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>enforceable option to purchase Blackacre at a price of $50 per acre exercisable, in terms, at any time within fifty years. If this option were valid, the alienability of Blackacre would continue to be fettered for fifty years. The option is invalid and B has no interest in Blackacre.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">See also Simes and Smith, <em>The Law of Future Interests, </em>\u00a7 1244 at 156-63 (2nd ed. 1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The cases in this country and apparently in England are in accord with this statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">A recent case involving a similar type of option is <em>Middleton v. Western Coal and Mining Co., </em>241 F. Supp. 407 (W.D. Ark. 1965), <em>aff\u2019d; Western Coal and Mining Co. v. Middleton, </em>362 F. 2d 48 (8 Cir. 1966). In <em>Middleton </em>on April 2, 1904, the then owners in fee simple of a tract of land in Sebastian County, Arkansas sold the \u201ccoal, fire clay and other minerals contained within and underlying\u201d the tract to Western Coal and Mining Company (Western). In the 1904 deed the following provision appeared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201c \u2018Provided, that so much of the surface of said grounds as to Western Coal and Mining Company, its successors or assigns, may at any time elect to take under the provisions of this deed it shall pay to the said Franklin Bache, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, an amount of money to be agreed on between the parties hereto.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">(241 F. Supp. at 417.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Then followed a provision to insure a determination of the purchase price in the event of disagreement in regard to it. The \u201cuse\u201d of the surface by Western was conditioned upon Western\u2019s electing to take the desired surface in fee and paying the purchase price. The tract was ultimately sold to the plaintiffs, Middleton, et al., who wished to subdivide the tract for the sale of residential building lots but found the option of Western to be a cloud on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>title. The plaintiffs filed a bill of complaint in the state court in Arkansas to quiet their title and to have the option declared void. This suit was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas because of diversity of citizenship. Chief Judge John E. Miller of the District Court declared the option null and void as violating the rule against perpetuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">After reciting the facts and the provisions of the rule \u25a0against perpetuities as applied in the state courts of Arkansas (they are the same as in Maryland), Chief Judge Miller stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201cThe rule against perpetuities, of course, is no more than a prohibition against the attempted creation of estates in fee which depend for their vesting upon a contingency to take place sometime in the future without limitation. A contingency which is capable of vesting the interest in fee simple in lives in being plus 21 years does not violate the rule against perpetuities. An interest in the surface in fee in the nature of an option or an election which grants a contingent interest, the exercise of which depends upon the discretion of the grantee and its successors or assigns and without any limitation as to time, unduly encumbers the alienation of the estate and constitutes a cloud upon the title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cThe rule against perpetuities, as applied to options to purchase real property, is well but briefly stated in 162 A.L.R., Annotation, beginning at page 581, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201c \u2018According to the weight of authority in jurisdictions applying the common-law rule against perpetuities, an option to purchase real property, unlimited as to the time for its exercise or extending beyond the period limited by the rule against perpetuities, violates such rule and is invalid.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">\u201cThe plaintiffs in their brief cite and rely up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>on <em>Barton v. Thaw, </em>246 Pa. 348, 92 A. 312, (1914), in which the court, in analyzing the interest created in an option to purchase the surface in fee, made the following statement with respect to the rule against perpetuities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">\u201c \u2018The case turns very largely upon the character of the interest in the surface which the optionees took under the covenant. If it was a present, fixed, and vested interest in the land, the rule against perpetuities would have no application. But is a mere option to purchase land, unlimited as to time and indefinite in duration, which may be exercised in 10 years, or in 100 years, or in 1,000 years, or which may never be exercised at all, depending upon the wish and pleasure of the optionee, a present vested interest? To ask this question would seem to answer it. In no proper legal sense can a mere privilege of exercising a future right to purchase be deemed a present vested interest in land. The optionees may never exercise their option, and, failing to do so, they would never acquire a vested interest in the land.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201cThe above quoted portion seems particularly applicable in the instant controversy as Western, by virtue of the election provision of the Bache deed, was granted an option to purchase the surface in fee which was unlimited in time and of indefinite duration. The defendants contend that this election to take the surface does not constitute a cloud upon the plaintiffs\u2019 title as it granted Western no more right in the surface than it impliedly received by virtue of its grant of the mineral estate in fee. The plaintiffs, however, contend that the election to take the surface for a price to be agreed upon in the future is in effect a grant of an interest in the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>face in fee, contingent upon the defendants in their discretion exercising it at some time subsequent to April 2, 1904. The provision with respect to taking the surface does on its face reflect an attempt to create in Western and its assigns or successors the power to succeed to the surface in fee. This provision creates a future estate in the sense that Western and its assigns or successors may become the absolute owner in ' fee of the surface by the exercise of the election granted. The vesting of the estate in fee simple depends, of course, upon the exercising of the election. The vesting is therefore contingent upon the grantees\u2019 making an election in the future. This interest in the surface is thus capable of becoming an ownership in fee simple, and is therefore an attempt to create a future interest, the vesting of which is contingent with no time limitation upon the contingency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><em>\u201cTo </em>sustain this option would give the grantee, Western, its assigns and successors, an election to acquire the surface in fee simple without any limitation as to time, and would thus violate the rule against perpetuities. The underlying purpose of the rule against perpetuities is to prevent such restrictions upon the alienability of property which has the effect of indefinitely encumbering it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">(241 F.

In the author\u2019s opinion, options should be divided into two principal classifications: (1) options appendant to leases and (2) options in gross. Options appendant should not violate the rule against perpetuities, but options in gross (such as the one we have in the present case) should be held void if the interest may vest beyond the period of the Rule. The author\u2019s view is, however, that <em>all </em>options in gross for a longer period than five years should be held void as an unreasonable restraint on alienation. He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201cThe real objection to options in gross is that by the use of such options an individual, or a small group, at small cost could obtain control of, and dictate the use of, huge bodies of land. The same policy which lies back of the mortmain acts and the acts limiting the power of corporations to hold land, should prohibit this use of the device of long term options. It is believed that, following the lead of the Bauer case, an option in gross for a longer term than five years should be held bad as contrary to public policy. The same arm of government that created the rule against perpetuities can recognize the other rule of public policy evidenced everywhere in the law \u2014 a policy against the too close control of the use of land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">(17 Va.L.Rev. p. 471.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">See also 2 Tiffany, <em>Real Property, </em>\u00a7 405 at 168-70 (3rd ed. 1939) ; 70 C.J.S., <em>Perpetuities, </em>\u00a7 13 c and 41 Am.

Indeed, Professor Merrill I. Schnebly of the University of Illinois College of Law, the author of Part 26 \u201cRestraints Upon the Alienation of Property\u201d in 6 <em>American Law of Property, </em>is of the opinion that it would have been wiser to have applied the rule against restraints on alienation, with suitable adaptations, to all cases involving options rather than to have applied the rule against perpetuities to some options and not to others with resulting nice and subtle distinctions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 26.66, p. 509. See <em>Missouri State Highway Commission v. Stone, </em>311 S.W.2d 588 (Mo.App.Ct. 1958) holding an option to purchase, somewhat similar to the one in the present case, void as an unreasonable restraint on alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The option held void in the instant case is to be distinguished from options appendant to leases (see <em>Restatement of Property, Perpetuities and Other Restrictions, </em>\u00a7 395) and from limitations by corporation in regard to its unissued shares <em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 400). The decision of our predecessors in <em>Hollander v. Central Metal &amp; Supply Co., </em>109 Md. 131, 71 A. 442 (1908) is not impaired in any way by our decision in the present case. The decision in <em>Hollander </em>involved a covenant for perpetual renewal of a 99 year lease and a covenant to convey the fee upon the payment of $600.00 and accrued rent. These covenants involving the ground rent system in Maryland do not place any property <em>extra commercium, </em>are not within the policy underlying the rule against perpetuities and are a recognized exception in this State to the application of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, the appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">.

No challenge is made in regard to the recordation by the appellees, either below or in this Court, and we will assume, without deciding, that the option contract was effectively recorded and gave constructive notice of its contents on and after its recordation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
