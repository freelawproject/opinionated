Sanders (Francis) and the appellee, Neil Gordon Sanders (Neil) are the sons of William Franklin Sanders (Mr. Sanders) who died in Garrett County, Maryland in December, 1968, in his eighty-first year. Mr. Sanders had four other children, another son and three daughters, who are not parties in this case. This action was brought by Francis against Neil, to impose a constructive trust on the assets received by Neil from Mr. Sanders at and prior to the latter\u2019s death. From, an order of the Circuit Court for Garrett County dismissing the bill of complaint, Francis has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Most of the facts underlying the controversy are not in dispute. Mr. Sanders, a Garrett County farmer, sold his farm in 1962, but continued to live in a house on the farm until after the death of his wife in 1963. A month after his wife\u2019s death, Mr. Sanders executed a will, dividing his estate equally among his six children, and naming Neil his executor. In December, 1963, Mr. Sanders moved from the farm to Neil\u2019s house in Oakland, where he stayed until his death, except for a period of about five weeks, commencing in mid-September, 1968, when he lived with Francis.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Although Mr. Sanders had suffered two strokes before he moved to Neil\u2019s house, he was by no means an invalid. He could still drive his car, and did so for about two years, and could go to his bank, The Garrett National, where Neil was employed. He could not bathe himself, however, and had some difficulty in climbing stairs. At the time of the move, Mr. Sanders\u2019 assets (with which none of the children except Neil was familiar) consisted of a savings account with a balance of $12,012.82 (later increased to $23,341.30 when the balance of proceeds from the sale of the farm was received) ; a $2,266.17 paid-up life insurance policy; and $3,100 face amount of savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>bonds. Mr. Sanders\u2019 wife had been named as joint owner of the savings account and of the bonds and as beneficiary of the life insurance policy. Mr. Sanders\u2019 income at this time consisted of interest earned on his savings account and social security payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On the day that Mr. Sanders moved into Neil\u2019s house, he executed a power of attorney in Neil\u2019s favor and opened a checking account, over which Neil had a power of withdrawal. Into this account went some of the interest from the savings account and some social security checks. From this account Mr. Sanders paid small bills, and the board which he paid Neil, which reached $80 a month in the last two years of Mr. Sanders\u2019 life.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In November of 1964, after Mr. Sanders had been at Neil\u2019s house for nearly a year, Neil was substituted for his mother, who had died in 1963, as joint owner of the savings account and of the bonds, and as beneficiary of the life insurance policy. This was accomplished at The Garrett National Bank, with the help of a bank officer. Neil was present, but did not participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">In September of 1968, Neil\u2019s son died, and Mr. Sanders moved to Francis\u2019 house. Francis and his wife were employed, and Mr. Sanders was cared for by his daughter Audrey, who was visiting Francis. When Audrey decided to return to Florida, Francis proposed that Mr. Sanders be placed in a nursing home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Sanders became very upset and moved back to Neil\u2019s house on 22 October 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">What happened next sowed the seeds of the controversy. On 18 November, Neil drew $3,000 from the joint savings account to pay for an electric heating plant which had been installed in his house. On 30 November, a vice president of the bank came to Neil\u2019s house, where Mr. Sanders withdrew the balance of some $21,000 in the account, whieh was then transferred to an account in-Neil\u2019s name alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">A few days after Mr. Sanders\u2019 death, Neil filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>will with the Orphans\u2019 Court for Garrett County, but stated that there were no assets. A day later the will was admitted to probate. A month later, as surviving joint tenant, Neil paid the inheritance tax on one-half of the balance in the savings account and on one-half of the value of the jointly owned savings bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Almost immediately, Francis instituted the proceeding to impose a, constructive trust on the assets in Neil\u2019s hands. When the case came on for trial, five witnesses testified in support of the complaint: Francis; June Sanders, Francis\u2019 wife; Helen Fike, one of Mr. Sanders\u2019 daughers; Pauline Eggers, Mr. Sanders\u2019 sister; and Neil, who was called as an adverse witness. There was no suggestion that Mr. Sanders was incompetent. There was testimony that he drove his own car, paid his own bills, served on the election board until 1966, and was confined to his bed only during the last week of his life. It seemed to be conceded that he was well cared for at Neil\u2019s house, where he had his own room and bath on the first floor. No one so much as intimated that Mr. Sanders was the victim of any fraud or that he had been subjected to influence or duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">At the conclusion of Francis\u2019 case, Neil moved to dismiss, contending that no confidential relationship had been established. The chancellor denied the motion, and we think quite properly, on the ground that the designation of Neil as Mr. Sanders\u2019 attorney in fact under the power of attorney established just such a relationship. The effect of this was to shift to Neil the burden \u2014 which is a heavy one under the cases later to be cited \u2014 of proving that there had been no abuse of the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Neil took the stand and testified that Mr. Sanders had the power of attorney drawn and Neil\u2019s name placed on the savings account, on the savings bonds, and on the life insurance policy at The Garrett National Bank, where iNqil worked. When questioned about it, Neil said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201cQ. Now, when this power of attorney was executed, was it a result of your idea ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cQ. What about the change of the checking account into joint names, was that your idea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201cA. No, sir, he done it all himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">\u201cQ. Did you ask him to ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">\u201cQ. Did you induce him to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">\u201cA. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">\u201cQ. Or urge him to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">\u201cQ. It was his own idea ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-15\">\u00cd ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-16\">\u201cQ. Now, about the same time, you already testified to this, that the life insurance policy was changed and you were made beneficiary, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-17\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-18\">\u201cQ. Who took care of this for him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-19\">\u201cA. Mr. Stover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-20\">\u201cQ. Did you ask your Dad to have the beneficiary changed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-21\">\u201cA. No, sir, he had it done himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-22\">\u201cQ. And you did not urge him to ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-23\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-24\">\u201cQ. It was his idea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-25\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-26\">* \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-27\">\u201cQ. Now, on these bonds that you already testified to that there were seven \u2014 six $500.00 ones and one $100.00 one, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-28\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-29\">\u201cQ. And in November, 1964, they were also changed naming you as one of the joint owners, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-30\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-31\">\u201cQ. Where was this done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-32\">\u201cA. Down at the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-33\">\u201cQ. And were you present at the time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cQ. Did you urge your father to change these bonds and put them in joint names?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cQ. Did you ask him to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">\u201cA. I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">As regards the closing of the savings account, Neil said that it was at his father\u2019s insistence that he called Nor-deck Shaffer, a vice president of The Garrett National Bank, who went to Neil\u2019s house to see Mr. Sanders. Mr. Shaffer described the visit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">\u201cQ. You did go to the home, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\">\u201cQ. And for what purpose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\">\u201cA. Mr. Sanders wanted to change his savings account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-14\">\u201cQ. Change it how?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-15\">\u201cA. It was a joint account, he wanted it changed and put into Neil\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-16\">\u201cQ. It was a joint account between William F. Sanders and Neil Sanders, is that correct, or it had been ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-17\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-18\">\u201cQ. And what did you tell Mr. William Sanders when you got to the home of Neil?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-19\">\u201cA. I explained to him that it was a joint account payable to either he or Neil, those two people were the only ones that would be able to withdraw funds from it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-20\">\u201cQ. All right, and you explained this to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-21\">\u201cA. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-22\">\u201cQ. And what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-23\">\u201cA. That he wanted to put it in Neil\u2019s name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-24\">\u201cQ. Mr. Shaffer, you testified that you explained that the savings account was already joint and there was no reason to change it, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cA. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t explain that there was no reason to change it, I explained to him that it was a joint account payable to either one of parties named on the account, with nothing \u2014 the withdrawal of those two and no one else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cQ. After explaining that, you still changed the account, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cA. That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cQ. How did you change it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">\u201cA. Mr Sanders signed a check for the balance in the joint account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">\u201cQ. Who signed this check for the balance in the account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">\u201cA. Mr. Sanders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">BY THE COURT: Is this Mr. William Sanders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">\u201cA. Yes, Mr. William F. Sanders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">\u201cQ. Was \u2014 who else was present when this transaction occurred over at Neil\u2019s home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">\u201cA. I believe Neil and his wife and his sister, Freda.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">\u201cQ. Now what, if anything, did Neil say at the time you were at the home, concerning the change of the account ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-17\">\u201cA. I believe he indicated to his father that it was a joint account payable to either one of the two of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-18\">\u201cQ. Did he want him to make the change which was made that day ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-19\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t believe he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-20\">Freda Fulk, Neil\u2019s sister, called as a witness for Neil, described what happened in respect of the closing of the savings account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-21\">\u201cQ. Now, you were also visiting Neil and your father when Mr. Shaffer came to the home, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cQ. And do you know whether or not it was Neil\u2019s idea to call Mr. Shaffer at the bank?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201cA. No, it was not, it was my idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201cQ. And why was it your idea ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cA. Can I use my Daddy\u2019s name ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">\u201cQ. Yes, not what he said, but \u2014 you asked Neil to call Nordeck Shaffer, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">\u201cQ. And why did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">\u201cA. To ease my Daddy\u2019s mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">\u201cQ. What were you afraid of if you didn\u2019t call that particular morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">\u201cA. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I only wanted my Daddy to have peace of mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-17\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-18\">\u201cQ. All right, then I\u2019ll ask you this, did Neil try to discourage him or did he urge \u2014 or did he want to call Mr. Nordeck Shaffer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-19\">\u201cA. Neil and Mr. Shaffer both tried to discourage him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-20\">BY THE COURT: They did what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Both tried to discourage him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-22\">BY THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-23\">\u201cQ. In your opinion, was your father the type of person that could be easily swayed to do things against his will up to the time of his death ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-24\">\u201cA. Never.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-25\">At the conclusion of the testimony, Neil renewed his motion to dismiss. While the court\u2019s reasoning in its oral opinion might have been more precisely articulated, what the court was saying was that Neil had rebutted the presumption which arises once a confidential relationship has been established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-26\">\u201c* * * the only other means of setting aside a gift inter vivos as we have here is by showing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>confidential relationship where fraud, duress or undue influence was used upon the parent by a child, as in this case, to induce him to make this gift to the exclusion of other children or other people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201c* * * Now, it seems to me, [Mr. Sanders] never having been incompetent, that that was approximately four years before he died, and it seems to me that he certainly, over the period of years, has ratified that gift by not revoking it, rescinding it or complaining about it. Apparently this is what he intended to do and did it, and there has been no sufficient evidence here to show that he was incompetent or that there was any fraud, duress or undue influence exercised upon him by Mr. Neil Sanders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We have held that once a plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to establish a confidential relationship, the burden shifts to the defendant to show the fairness and reasonableness of the transaction, <em>Wenger v. Rosinsky, </em>232 Md. 43, 50, 192 A. 2d 82 (1963) ; <em>Tribull v. Tribull, </em>208 Md. 490, 507, 119 A. 2d 399 (1956). In the absence of the legal presumption which arises from certain relationships (e.g., attorney-client, trustee-cestui but not ordinarily child-parent, compare <em>Henry v. Leech, </em>123 Md. 436, 91 A. 694 (1914) with <em>Williams v. Robinson, </em>183 Md. 117, 36 A. 2d 547 (1944)), the existence of a confidential relationship is a question of fact, not of law, <em>Zimmerman v. Hull, </em>155 Md. 230, 239-40, 141 A. 531 (1928). In other words, once the relationship is proved, the plaintiff is relieved from the necessity of proving \u201cthe actual exercise of overweening influence, misrepresentation, importunity or fraud,\u201d <em>Vocci v. Ambrosetti, </em>201 Md. 475, 485, 94 A. 2d 437 (1953) and the defendant has the burden of showing that a fair and reasonable use has been made of the confidence, \u201cthat the transfer of the property was the deliberate and voluntary act of the grantor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and that the transaction was fair, proper and reasonable under the circumstances,\u201d <em>Rice v. Himmelrich, </em>222 Md. 234, 159 A. 2d 647 (1960) ; <em>Masius v. Wilson, </em>213 Md. 259, 131 A. 2d 484 (1957). See also <em>Vogt v. Vogt, </em>241 Md. 82, 215 A. 2d 741 (1966) ; <em>Owings v. Owings, </em>233 Md. 357, 196 A. 2d 908 (1964) ; <em>Mosebach v. Jenness, </em>224 Md. 395, 168 A. 2d 182 (1961) ; <em>Blair v. Haas, </em>215 Md. 105, 137 A. 2d 145 (1957). And <em>cf. Wenger v. Rosinsky, supra, </em>232 Md. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Whether the defendant meets this burden, which is a heavy one, depends on the facts in each case. Compare <em>Rice v. Himmelrich, supra, </em>and <em>Masius v. Wilson, supra, </em>involving inter vivos transfers within the family, where the burden was held to have been met, with <em>Wenger v. Rosinsky, supra, </em>232 Md. 43, \u201cThe Case of the Shorn Sergeant\u201d, where it was held not to have been met by the shearing landlady of a sergeant retired from the Marine Corps because of ill health. See also <em>Stacy v. Burke, </em>259 Md. 390, 269 A. 2d 837 (1970) and <em>Lusby v. Nethken, </em>256 Md. 469, 260 A. 2d 640 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We think, as did the chancellor, that Neil has met the burden. He was impressed, as are we, by the fact that the really significant event took place in November, 1964, four years before Mr. Sanders\u2019 death. It was at that time that Mr. Sanders made Neil the joint owner of the savings account and the bonds and designated him as beneficiary of the life insurance policy. There is not even a suggestion that this was not completely voluntary on Mr. Sanders\u2019 part. While Francis makes much of the fact that Mr. Sanders stripped himself of his assets, other than his social security payments, he did so, in a sense, in 1964, although he retained a considerable measure of control, including the right to revoke the arrangement, should he have a change of heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Four years passed, during which Mr. Sanders made no change in the provision he had made, which he could have done at any time. During the same period, Neil drew no checks on the checking account, acted under the power of attorney only at his father\u2019s direction, and made but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>withdrawal from the savings account: $3,000 to pay for the electric heating system. It was Neil\u2019s uncontroverted testimony that this withdrawal was not his idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The closing of the savings account was at Mr. Sanders\u2019 insistence, and was done over Neil\u2019s protest. As a practical matter, since Neil already had the power to make withdrawals from the account, this did no more than to effect an immediate transfer of funds which would have passed in any event to Neil as surviving joint tenant at his father\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It is clear to us that the chancellor was not in error when he found that Neil had met the burden of showing that he had fairly and reasonably discharged the confidence imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\">. Francis had made some inquiries, and suggested that if Mr. Sanders\u2019 assets could be reduced to $2,500, he would be eligible for public assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
