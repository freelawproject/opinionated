Shortly before 5:00 p.m. on 23 April 1968 she paid her first visit to the Gino\u2019s Drive-In on Pulaski Highway. Sunset that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>day was at 6:51 p.m. She parked her car in the fourth space from the entrance; at the time the interjacent spaces were occupied by other vehicles. She went in, bought some hamburgers and french fried potatoes. Carrying the bag of food and her purse she came out through the same door. The other vehicles had gone so she could have walked directly to her car but just as she set out to do so she fell and ruptured her spleen. Her suit against Gino\u2019s came on for trial in the Superior Court of Baltimore City on 4 May 1970 before Harris, J., and a jury. A few months later Judge Harris granted Gino\u2019s motion for a judgment n.o.v. thereby setting at naught the $13,-500 majority (7 to 5) verdict in favor of Mrs. Mershon. He concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of primary negligence and that she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Since we agree that he was right in respect of the latter it will not be necessary for us to consider whether the evidence could support a finding of primary negligence. We have been mindful, of course, of the familiar rule that the evidence and all logical and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom must be considered in a light most favorable to Mrs. Mershon. <em>Greenway v. Craft, </em>258 Md. 1 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Gino\u2019s is a glass-walled building surrounded by parking spaces set off one from the other by yellow lines painted on the black asphaltic paving. A sidewalk encircles the building. Concrete \u201cbumpers,\u201d also painted yellow, placed about four or five feet from and parallel with the sidewalk, kept vehicles from encroaching upon it. Along one side of the building the bumpers are square in section; along the side which is our present concern they were nearly triangular; we say \u201cwere\u201d because there is evidence they were removed after Mrs. Mershon fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Larry Sigmon (except for a physician and Mrs. Mershon the only witness to testify) was 13 years old when he saw Mrs. Mershon fall. He said he had been shining shoes in the area for about two or three months; it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>his custom to be there between 3:00 p.m. and \u201c5:00 and 6:00\u201d p.m. He saw her fall \u201cover the bumper stop by the door.\u201d He had seen \u201cnine or ten * * * people fall over the same bumper stop * * * [but] they got right up and left.\u201d Asked if there was \u201canyone on the pavement or around her * * * [or] between her and the curb * * * [or] between her and the bumper\u201d he said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWas there anyone milling around on the pavement there?\u201d he was asked, to which he replied, \u201cNot on the side that she fell on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We think Judge Harris accurately summarized Mrs. Mershon\u2019s testimony. What follows is an excerpt from his opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201cOn direct testimony, Mrs. Mershon testified that, when she entered Gino\u2019s, she \u2018went around the front of the spaces to the door\u2019 of the store; that she \u2018noticed a series of yellow lines\u2019 on the parking lot, indicating the parking spaces; that, as she was leaving the door to Gino\u2019s, she was carrying her purchase of \u2018a couple hamburgers and French fries\u2019 and her pocketbook; that, as she \u2018was walking out there were people coming in * * * I was coming out the door and stepped off the curb and fell.\u2019 In answer to a question as to what caused her to fall, she testified as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u2018This obstruction in the walk-way there. It was a raised triangular shape, but it was long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">It was an obstacle \u2014 buffer, I don\u2019t know what they call them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201cShe further testified on direct examination, in answer to a question as to when she first observed the obstacle that she fell upon: \u2018after I looked to see what I fell over was the first time I noticed there was anything sticking up.\u2019 She further testified that the buffer was yellow in color.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">\u201cOn cross-examination, Mrs. Mershon testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>fied that, at the time of her accident, she \u2018wouldn\u2019t say it was sufficiently dark that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see, but it was getting dark * * * I saw the yellow lines * * * yes, I would say they were yellow\u2019; and that both the car bumpers and the parking lines were the same color, yellow. She further testified that if she \u2018had seen anything besides the line, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have deliberately tripped * * * I usually look where I walk.\u2019 In answer to a question as to whether' she was \u2018looking down at where\u2019 she was walking at the time of the accident, Mrs. Mershon answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u2018Well, I looked down as much as anybody looks down when they walk. You don\u2019t look down every minute, but you do look down. You also avoid things that are coming at you or towards you.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cShe further testified that she was not \u2018distracted at the time of this accident\u2019; and in answer to a question as to whether she saw the car bumper as she came into the store, she stated: T didn\u2019t notice it, no.\u2019 In answer to a question as to why she did not leave Gino\u2019s store and take the same route that she had taken when she entered the premises, she answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u2018Well, when I left, evidently there was no car parked there and I just made a shortcut there. The obstruction was right at the walk when I stepped off the walk.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cShe further testified that she did not see the car bumpers when she entered Gino\u2019s that day; that she \u2018did not see it until I fell over it and noticed it.\u2019 In answer to a question as to whether there was anyone in front of her, between her and the bumper over which she fell, the plaintiff answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t say there was anyone in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>front of me between me and the bumper, but there were people coming in towards the door on the sidewalk before I stepped off.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cThen follows this testimony by Mrs. Mershon on cross-examination which is particularly significant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u2018Q. There was nothing obstructing your vision down and to the front of you? A. Well, once I stepped off the curb it is just, I would say, about a foot between the sidewalk and the bumper so there wasn\u2019t room for anyone to be standing there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u2018Q. So there was nothing obstructing your vision there, was there? A. Not of the actual bumper, if that is what you mean.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Judge Harris considered the factual situation in <em>Tyler v. Martin\u2019s Dairy, Inc., </em>227 Md. 189 (1961), to be closer to the case at bar than any other Maryland case and he thought it ought to be controlling. Mrs. Mershon, on the other hand, insists there are facts in the instant case which distinguish it from <em>Tyler </em>and that there is enough substance in the distinction to attenuate the impact of <em>Tyler. </em>There Mrs. Tyler tripped over a curb on the outside of the dairy\u2019s retail store. It was about 9:00 p.m. and all but one of the outside lights had been turned off as the store was about to close. Judge Hammond (now Chief Judge) said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">\u201cShe [Mrs. Tyler] was in an unfamiliar place. She had been shown a safe way to walk to the entrance to the dairy to which she wanted to go. Instead of following this route, she chose to walk a different way, either blinded by a glare of light from inside the building, according to her version, or in such darkness that she could have seen the curbing only with difficulty, if the version of the son and daughter-in-law is correct. She did not look aside and wait until she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>could recover from the glare and she never looked down to ascertain if there were obstructions in her path. To walk blindly or unlooking in a strange environment, when there is no need to do so, is to be negligent as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 192.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Mrs. Mershon points out that whereas Mrs. Tyler\u2019s ipjury occurred at night, either in darkness or in the glare of a blinding light, she (Mrs. Mershon) \u201cwas proceeding in a place of apparent safety and was <em>deceived </em>by a negligently created condition of the premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Had she in fact been deceived the distinction might have some validity but even if we assume that it results in the demotion of <em>Tyler </em>to something less than controlling we think <em>Tyler </em>is nonetheless highly persuasive. Equally persuasive is the language of Chief Judge Prescott who spoke for the majority in <em>Southern Md. Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Blanchard, </em>239 Md. 481 (1965). Since Judge Singley has included Judge Prescott\u2019s comment in the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hynes v. Hutzler Brothers Co., </em>261 Md. 345 (1971), we shall not repeat it here. In <em>Hynes </em>the appellant, an elderly woman, fell and injured herself in the shoe department, claiming an employee had bumped into her. Judge Singley said, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201cAs we see the case, Mrs. Hynes\u2019 failure to observe the man with whom she collided permits of but one interpretation. It was the distinct, prominent and decisive act in regard to which there is no room for ordinary and reasonable minds to differ. It was the cause of her injury and amounted to contributory negligence as a matter of law, <em>Boyd v. Simpler, </em>222 Md. 126, 131, 158 A. 2d 666 (1960).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cIf Mrs. Hynes had looked, she would have seen Jones and could have avoided the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 350.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>In support of the notion that she was \u201cdeceived\u201d Mrs. Mershon leans heavily on <em>Nary v. Parking Authority of the Town of Dover, </em>58 N.J.Super. 222, 156 A. 2d 42 (1959), where the plaintiff fell over a timber bumper block in the late afternoon. We see in that case, however, a distinguishing feature which we think is significant. \u201c* * * [T]he bumper blocks were freshly painted the same color as the white lines of the parking lot, and <em>were located on top of a white line </em>that had previously been observed by the plaintiff; * * * there were <em>no openings or walkways through the bumper.\u201d </em>156 A. 2d at 45. (Emphasis added.) Here, as Judge Harris observed, the bumper \u201cwas painted a different color from the asphalt surface of the ground\u201d; it had not been placed on top of a painted line and there were openings or walkways between the bumpers. The photographs in evidence make it quite clear that each of the five bumpers was about six feet long; that the spaces or walkways between them were from 12 to 18 inches in length; that the spaces had not been painted; that the bumpers did not delineate a parking space or a walkway; that their only apparent purpose was to keep vehicles from encroaching upon the sidewalk. It is also clear from the photographs that when Mrs. Mershon fell she could not have been more than a few feet from the walkway between bumper #1 and bumper #2 nor more than three or four feet from the other end of bumper #1. Mrs. Mershon is obviously a woman of at least ordinary intelligence and there is nothing to show that her sight was impaired. The bumpers were unmistakably three-dimensional; they were laid in a line about midway between the sidewalk and the nearest parking space; there was nothing on either side of them but the black pavement. Had she looked she must have seen them and had she looked she would have seen also an unobstructed path on either side of bumper #1. For a discussion of the \u201cblending effect\u201d of certain materials <em>see Lloyd v. Bowles, </em>260 Md. 568 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">There is to be sure an abundance of bumper cases. Both parties have cited a number of them. However, none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the cases cited, nor any that we have been able to find, have in combination all of the factors present here. And of the cases submitted to a jury we have found none which did not present at least one of the following situations : bad lighting, bumpers the same color as the paving, bumpers placed directly on a flat line of the same color, or a defect in the bumper. <em>See, e.g., Aaron v. Logro Corp., </em>226 So. 2d 8 (Fla. App. 1969) <em>cert. dismissed, </em>238 So. 2d 422 (Fla. 1970) ; <em>Hollis v. First National Bank of Atlanta, </em>117 Ga. App. 145, 159 S.E.2d 497 (1968) ; <em>Hopkins v. Sefton Fibre Can Co., </em>390 S.W.2d 907 (Mo. App. 1965) ; <em>Nary v. Parking Authority of the Town of Dover, supra; </em>and the cases therein cited. We do not think any useful purpose will be served by \u00e1 discussion of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
