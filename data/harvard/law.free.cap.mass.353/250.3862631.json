The suit was referred to a master.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>After the master filed his report the trial judge ordered the case recommitted to the master for findings of fact on certain aspects of damage. The defendant filed objections to the master\u2019s report on the order of recommittal. The judge entered an interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report \u201cso far as injunctive relief is concerned.\u201d No appeal was taken from the interlocutory decree. A final decree was entered enjoining the defendant from \u201csuffering or permitting water to be piped or conducted from its . . . premises so that it flows in or through a pipe . . . in or under the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] premises.\u201d From this decree the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We summarize the material findings of the master. In 1931, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title granted an easement to the Commonwealth, giving it the right to construct and maintain \u201cupon our land, situated on the southerly side of the proposed State highway [Route 9] in the Town of Shrewsbury . . ., a drain extending from a drainage system to be constructed within the Unfits of said highway . . ., to discharge water from said drainage system into said drain and through our said land, to carry water away from said highway and over and through our land above described, for public convenience and for the proper construction and care of said highway.\u201d The deed referred to a plan which showed a proposed thirty-inch drain running under the highway and diagonally across the land in question. The Commonwealth did subsequently construct such a drainpipe. In 1953, the plaintiff acquired the land, subject to the easement. At that time there was one store building on the property. The plaintiff then built a second, cellarless building \u201cover the area containing the 30 inch pipe,\u201d which was about eight feet underground. The two buildings \u201chave been and are occupied by commercial tenants.\u201d \u201c[T]he said pipe at the time of construction of said building was mainly used for drainage of water from a wet swampy area located on the northerly side of . . . [Route 9] . . . and . . . the water ran through the pipe in the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] property after reaching same through a 30 inch pipe which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>crossed . . . [Route 9] from north to south.\u201d In 1961, the defendant, shortly after its formation, purchased land on the south side of Route 9 adjacent to that of the plaintiff. Construction of the bank building was begun in the same year. It was discovered that there was a \u201ccontinuing and persistent\u201d problem of excessive ground water at this site. The defendant negotiated with the plaintiff to drain this water across the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s land, but this idea was abandoned as impractical. The defendant then applied to the Department of Public Works for a permit \u201cto enter the State highway drainage system.\u201d This permit was granted, over the objections of the plaintiff. On July 17, 1961, an eight-inch pipe, draining the defendant\u2019s land, was connected to the thirty-inch pipe \u201cin the gutter line of the southerly side of . . . [Route 9] approximately opposite the halfway point of the frontage of . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] land on . . . [Route 9].\u201d Since then, percolating ground water from the defendant\u2019s property on the south side of Route 9 has been added to the flow of water from the north side of Route 9 through the thirty-inch pipe on the plaintiff\u2019s property. The pipe is large enough to accommodate this increased flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The master concluded \u201cthat the connection made by the Shrewsbury Bank &amp; Trust Co. under the permits of the Department of Public Works . . . was not within the meaning and intent of the language used in the easement granted in 1931 .... [T]he purpose of the granted easement was for the construction of a drain from the drainage system to be constructed within the highway . . . and it was also for the purpose of carrying water from the highway and for public convenience and for the proper construction and care of said highway. . . . [T]he connection made by the Shrewsbury Bank &amp; Trust Co. serves a private purpose of said bank, i.e. to take care of the problem of percolating water on its property, and constitutes a burden on the Anntco Corporation property which was not authorized by Anntco or its predecessors in title.\u201d The master also found that while no physical damage to Anntco\u2019s property had occurred, \u201cthe connection of the pipe . . . does have some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>adverse effect upon the value and salability of the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] property\u201d and \u201chas reduced the fair market value of the . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] property by $1000.00,\u201d and that \u201cthe fair rental value . . . was lessened to the extent of $600.00 a year, ... by reason of . . . [the] conduct of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The defendant contends that the permit allowing it to connect its pipe to the drainage system running across the plaintiff\u2019s land was within the Commonwealth\u2019s powers under the original easement in that it serves the public convenience. The defendant argues that its land was within the proposed area to be served by the Route 9 drainage system, and that the purpose of draining its land is a public purpose. We do not agree. The ultimate findings of the master must stand unless an examination of the subsidiary findings shows such inconsistencies between them that both cannot stand. <em>Chopelas </em>v. <em>Chopelas, </em>303 Mass. 33, 37. We are unable to discover any such inconsistencies. \u201c[I]f an easement is stated to be for a particular purpose it is limited to the purpose stated.\u201d <em>Makepeace Bros. Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnstable, </em>292 Mass. 518, 525. See <em>Delconte </em>v. <em>Salloum, </em>336 Mass. 184, 190; <em>Socony Mobil Oil Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Cottle, </em>336 Mass. 192, 197; <em>Comeau </em>v. <em>Manzelli, </em>344 Mass. 375, 381. Here, the master found that the original conveyance limited the easement to carrying water from the highway and serving the public convenience in its construction and maintenance. It was hardly inconsistent for him to find that draining land not within the highway to serve the needs of the defendant, and not those of the Commonwealth, was not a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The defendant further argues that there was no \u201cundue burden upon the easement\u201d because there was no physical damage to the property from the increased flow and because in any event the Commonwealth could enter the premises to correct any \u201coveruse of the easement.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s possible rights are not relevant here, since the master found that the use in question did not serve the Commonwealth\u2019s purposes or come within the language of the original conveyance. The master did find that the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tinuance of the defendant\u2019s unauthorized drainage measurably decreased the rental and market value of the property. An intentional and continuing trespass to real estate may be enjoined, <em>Ottavia </em>v. <em>Savarese, </em>338 Mass. 330, 336, because to do otherwise enables the trespasser to deprive the owner of property rights at a valuation. <em>Chesarone </em>v. <em>Pinewood Builders, Inc. </em>345 Mass. 236, 240-241. The defendant\u2019s actions were not authorized by the grant of the easement, and have adversely affected the plaintiff\u2019s property rights. That is \u201cburden\u201d enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions do not require any extended discussion. Whether the conduit in question is a \u201cnatural watercourse\u201d-was a factual question for the master to determine. We have noted that the defendant did not appeal from the interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report. Nor are we inclined to speculate on a possible future dispute with the Commonwealth in regard to the right of the Commonwealth to make repairs to the conduit running under the cement floor of the plaintiff\u2019s new building.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
