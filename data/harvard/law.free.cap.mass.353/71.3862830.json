L. c. 79, filed on May 20, 1964. At the trial before a jury the Commonwealth moved to dismiss the proceeding \u201cfor the reason that it was not commenced within the time allowed by law\u201d and also moved for a directed verdict. Both motions were denied. The jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the petitioners was entered under leave reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The judge subsequently made \u201cfindings and rulings re . . . [the Commonwealth\u2019s] motions for directed verdict and motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The Commonwealth moved for entry of a verdict under leave reserved and the.petitioners moved for a new trial \u201cfor the reason that the amount of the verdict is inadequate and against the law and the evidence.\u201d These motions were denied. The case is here on the petitioners\u2019 and Commonwealth\u2019s bills of exceptions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The only exceptions argued relate to the judge\u2019s rulings regarding the timeliness of the filing of the petition. The following facts relating to that issue appear from the record before us. On October 3, 1961, the Commonwealth recorded an order of taking which established <em>\u201ca </em>new State highway location, with limited access provisions, for a portion of the proposed Route 495. . . . The layout also reestablishes with limited access provisions the location lines of a portion of . . . Route 111. . . . Access to and egress from said location is allowed abutters for residential purposes only at Route 111.\u201d Route 111 was relocated \u201capproximately 60 feet from . . . [the petitioners\u2019] property and . . . [elevated 13 to 19 feet]. None of . . . [the petitioners\u2019] physical property was taken, but the plan indicated that due to an off-ramp construction opposite the reconstructed property entrance, access was restricted for reasons of safety.\u201d The petitioners were conducting a business on their property as well as using it for a residence. Other relevant facts will be mentioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">1. General Laws c. 79, \u00a7 16, provides in material part, \u201cA petition for the assessment of damages under section fourteen may be filed within two years after the right to such damages has vested; but any person, including every mortgagee of record, whose property has been taken or injured, and who has not received notice under section eight or otherwise of the proceedings whereby he is entitled to damages at least sixty days before the expiration of such two years, may file such petition within six months after the taking possession of his property or the receipt by him of actual notice of the taking, whichever first occurs, or, if his property has not been taken, within six months after he first suffers actual injury in his property. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">It is agreed that the petitioners never received \u201cnotice under section eight or otherwise of the proceedings whereby . . . [they were] entitled to damages.\u201d This section distinguishes two situations for the purpose of setting the time within which a petition must be brought where, as here, no such notice is received. If a person\u2019s \u201cproperty has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>been taken\u201d then the petition must be brought \u201cwithin six months after he first suffers actual injury in his property.\u201d All other persons \u201cwhose property has been taken or injured . . . may file such petition within six months after the taking possession of his property or the receipt by him of actual notice of the taking, whichever first occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The Commonwealth argues that the judge erred in ruling that \u201cnone of the petitioners\u2019 property . . . [had been] taken.\u201d It is this ruling which led the judge to hold that the petitioners had six months after they first suffered actual injury to their property to file a petition for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">A distinction between a \u201ctaking\u201d of property and other \u201cinjury\u201d to property has been developed in recognition of the fact that the Constitution compels compensation only if \u201cthe property of any individual should be appropriated to public uses.\u201d Art. 10, Declaration of Rights. <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Water Supply Commn. </em>314 Mass. 33, 36-37. The Legislature, in enacting such statutes as G. L. c. 79 and c. 81,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided compensation for injuries to property which would not amount to a taking under the Constitution as well as providing compensation for takings. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 581. The language of those statutes reflects the distinction between takings, for which compensation is compelled, and other injuries which are compensated only as a matter of legislative grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In <em>Grove Hall Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>284 Mass. 92, 93, we-held that the setting of a building line \u201cconstitutes an encumbrance upon land in .the nature of an equitable easement for the benefit of the public; it is a taking of private property by eminent domain for public use and the procedure prescribed for such taking must be followed. <em>Watertown v. Dana, </em>255 Mass. 67, 70.\u201d In the instant case the Commonwealth \u201cunder a layout and an order of taking . . . changed the access [to a public way] from unlimited access to that restricted to residential purpose only.\u201d We are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>opinion that there is no significant difference between the setting of a building line and the restriction of access to a public way for the purpose of determining whether such action amounts to a \u201ctaking.\u201d Here, as in the <em>Grove Hall </em>case, an equitable easement in favor of the public has been taken, even though land was not taken in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We are strengthened in our conclusion that there was a taking rather than some other compensable \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 16, by the manifest purpose served by that section in distinguishing a \u201ctaking\u201d from an \u201cinjury.\u201d If no formal taking had occurred the earliest time at which the petitioners would have become aware of the Commonwealth\u2019s action would have been when some actual injury was done to their land. It would be difficult to give them actual notice of an injury if no formal proceedings had been instituted. Likewise no \u201cpossession\u201d by the Commonwealth would be likely if the Commonwealth\u2019s action did not amount to a taking. But here, where formal taking proceedings were instituted, the petitioners were treated fairly if they received actual notice of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">2. The petitioners wrote letters to persons in authority in the State and Federal government, inquiring about the status of their access rights. They received a letter from their congressman dated July 18, 1963, which enclosed a letter from the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works addressed to the congressman. The judge ruled this letter \u201cwas actual notice to the petitioners within the purview of G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 16,\u201d and the petitioners took an exception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The petitioners argue that the statutory phrase \u201cactual notice\u201d should be strictly construed, where, as here, a statutory form of notice, is provided. See Gr. L. c. 79, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cThe petitioners assert . . . that no method of notice was used by the Commonwealth, directly or indirectly, to advise the petitioners of (1) the amount of damages, if any, awarded for such taking or, if no damages had been awarded, (2) the time within which they may petition for the same, (3) the time within which they may request an offer under section 8A, and (4) the time within which they may petition the Superior Court to determine their damages under section 14, all as prescribed by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Our reading of \u00a7 16 does not lead us to the conclusion urged by the petitioners. The first part of \u00a7 16 states that if a person received \u201cnotice under section eight or otherwise of the proceedings whereby he is entitled to damages\u201d within the specified time he is required to bring his petition within the two year period. The second part of \u00a7 16 permits a person to bring a petition within sis months of \u201cthe receipt by him of actual <em>notice of the taking\u201d </em>(emphasis added). If the Legislature had intended to require that the petitioners receive actual notice of the proceedings whereby they were entitled to damages rather than notice of the taking it would have been simple to repeat that phrase in the second part of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">We are of opinion that the judge was correct in ruling that the \u201cletter was actual notice to the petitioners within the purview of . . . [G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 16].\u201d The attached letter from the Commissioner of Public Works to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>gressman stated: \u201cThere was an access taking from Mr. Gann\u2019s property. . . . [Ajccess . . . was limited to residential purposes as a traffic safety precaution.\u201d As the petitioners concede in their brief, \u201c [ojral notice by a person in authority . . . might under certain circumstances satisfy the requirement. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Mundy, </em>3 Met. 405, 408. \u201d It is of no consequence that the letter from the commissioner was directed to the congressman and not to the petitioners. Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 assertion this communication was more than \u20181 inquiry notice. \u2019 \u2019 Compare <em>Tramontozzi </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amicis, </em>344 Mass. 514, 517, relied on by the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Since no \u201cpossession\u201d of the petitioners\u2019 property was possible under this taking, <em>Grove Hall Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Ded-ham, </em>284 Mass. 92, 95, the petitioners could not come within the provision of \u00a7 16 permitting a petition to be brought within \u201csix months after the taking possession of his property\u201d where his property has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Petitioners\u2019 exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\n<em>Respondent\u2019s exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> General Laws c. 81, \u00a7 70, provides for the recovery of damages under G. L. c. 79 \u201cfor the taking of or injury to . . . easements of access to . . . [a] public way\u201d where \u201ca limited access way is laid out in whole or in part in the location of an existing public way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> The judge excluded certain \u201cevidence of the Commissioner\u2019s usual procedure in notifying the property owner of a taking of land\u201d on the ground that this letter was actual notice and the petitioners excepted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-12\"> Section 8. \u201cImmediately after the right to damages becomes vested, the board of officers who have made a taking under this chapter shall give notice thereof to every person, including every mortgagee of record, whose property has been taken - or who is otherwise entitled to damages on account of such taking, and to the collector of taxes of the city or town in which the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>taken is located. Such notice shall be in writing and shall describe in general terms the purpose and extent of the taking, and shall state the amount of damages, if any, awarded for such taking, or, if no damages have been awarded, the time within which he may petition for an award of the same, and in either ease the time within which he may request an offer under section eight A and the time within which he may petition the superior court to determine his damages under section fourteen. If, within two years after the date of an order of taking for a highway or town way or for a ditch or drain for draining the same, entry is made or possession taken thereunder for the purpose of constructing the same, such notice of taking shall also state the date of such entry or taking possession. Such notice may be served by personal service, or by leaving an attested copy thereof at the last and usual place of abode of the person to be notified if he is a resident of the commonwealth, by any person authorized to serve civil process, or notice may be given to persons within or without the commonwealth, by registered mail or other suitable means. Failure to give notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings, or the time within which a petition for damages may be filed, except as provided by section sixteen.\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
