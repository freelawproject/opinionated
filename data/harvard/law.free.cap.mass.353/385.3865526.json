The case is before us on report without decree. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Clairol makes fourteen shades of permanent hair dye and also two blue shades which are to be used only in conjunction with one or more of the basic shades. All these products are sold in two \u201cdifferent channels of trade at different prices: one through so-called \u2018retail jobbers\u2019 for ultimate resale through . . . retail establishments to the general public for home use; and the other, through so-called \u2018beauty supply jobbers\u2019, for resale to professional hairdressers . . . and beauty schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">\u201cThe contents of a bottle of . . . dye bearing a particular color number are exactly the same in . . . chemical composition for the . . . \u2018retail users\u2019 as a bottle bearing the same color number sold\u201d for professional use. \u201cThe only differ-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>enees between the [same size] bottles of the two classes are . . . the labels.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The retail bottles, however, \u201care individually packaged in cartons and each carton has a pamphlet of instructions. . . . [Professional use [bottles] are distributed in . . . cartons containing six bottles [six-packs]. Only one instruction sheet, different . . . from the . . . pamphlet inserted in retail . . . cartons in that it describes only the hypersensitivity tests and warnings ... is placed in each 'six-pack\u2019 carton.\u201d - Tl</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Cody\u2019s, \u201coperating a discount store in Lawrence, has been buying from wholesale outlets . . . six-packs designed for . . . professional users only and selling the . . . bottles singly at retail to home users.\u201d Clairol seeks to enjoin this as unfair competition under G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Clairol has not taken advantage of the Fair Trade Law (G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 14A-14D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge correctly concluded that the Unfair Sales Act (G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7jl4E-14K) is not applicable upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Clairol has a substantial good will for its products and controls thirty per cent of a highly competitive hair dye market with gross sales of its \u201chair color bath\u201d of over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>$15,000,000 a year. It spends for advertising more than $5,000,000. Each bottle for home use is distributed in a distinctive yellow carton with which the product has become associated in consumers\u2019 minds. Easily understood instructions in the retail pamphlet were prepared to insure consumers of \u201csafe and satisfactory results.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Directions are given concerning (a) skin tests for hypersensitivity, (b) strand tests to obtain the desired color, (c) use of gloves during application, (d) the assembly and application of the product, and (e) proper utensils. Seriously undesirable and undesired results may follow failure to comply with the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Because its product may deteriorate upon exposure to heat or light, Clairol has adopted a standard \u201cshelf life.\u201d Each home use carton and professional use bottle bears a stamp, \u201cUse before [a specific date].\u201d Outdated merchandise may be returned to Clairol for full credit. Use of product which has deteriorated may result in an undesired color.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Retail channel sales are made at about seventy-three cents a bottle to Clairol\u2019s retail wholesalers (who make about a twenty per cent markup), drug store and certain retail chains, \u201cvery large independents,\u201d and certain others. Professional use bottles are sold (a) at thirty-nine cents a bottle in six-packs to beauty jobbers who resell to beauty salons at a forty per cent markup, and (b) directly to beauty fairs and beauty schools at thirty-six cents a bottle. Retail sales are more profitable to Clairol than professional sales which are \u201conly marginally profitable.\u201d Retail sales, however, are much helped by the professional use of Clairol products. The practice of selling at lower prices for professional use thus \u201chas become a valuable [advertising] factor ... in inducing\u201d retail purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>In 1963, Clairol abandoned placing each professional use bottle in an individual carton with an instruction pamphlet. The purpose was to save about $200,000 a year and increase profits from the professional sales.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Cody\u2019s has sold Clairol hair color bath in unwrapped bottles, bearing the \u201cProfessional Use Only\u201d labels but without individual cartons, from bins exposed to a bright store lighting system. With many bottles it distributed a mimeographed instruction sheet. The trial judge found that this mimeographed sheet mentioned essentially the hypersensitivity tests prescribed for hair colorings by the Federal act, but he concluded that it did not \u201cstrictly . . . comply with\u201d G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 186,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as amended by St. 1961, c. 600 \u00a7 2. The mimeographed sheet gave no substantial instructions concerning the other matters dealt with in Clairol\u2019s retail use instruction booklet. The judge concluded, however, that, because the mimeographed sheet \u201csubstantially warned ... of the danger of the products and ... to make sensitivity tests,\u201d Cody\u2019s (in the absence of contract relations with Clairol) was not required to instruct users on other matters. Some Clairol bottles sold by Cody\u2019s to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>private detectives bore use expiration dates earlier than the sale date.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Cody\u2019s bought Clairol professional use products at forty-five to fifty cents a bottle from jobbers. It sells about 1,000 bottles a month at seventy-three cents a bottle. Some beauty salons also sell professional use bottles to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">There was no evidence of complaints or injuries arising out of Cody\u2019s sales. The trial judge took the view, nevertheless, that Cody\u2019s sales of professional products \u201care extremely likely to injure . . . ^Clairol\u2019s] business reputation ... or dilute the distinct qualities of its trade name or trade marks.\u201d He concluded that Clairol was at fault in failing to exercise sufficient control over its professional product jobbers to prevent sales to discount houses like Cody\u2019s and that this fault contributed to Clairol\u2019s troubles as much as Cody\u2019s retail sales of the easily procurable products.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">I. The record, as the trial judge indicated, reveals no unfair competition in the usual sense of passing off the product of another as that of Clairol, or of trade mark infringement, or of taking advantage of name or trade mark similarity to \u201cdo some \u2018free riding\u2019 ... on the plaintiff\u2019s business reputation, to the damage of\u201d Clairol\u2019s trade mark, as in <em>Skil Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>337 Mass. 485, 494-495. See <em>Angell Elevator Lock Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>348 Mass. 623, 625-626. There is no confusion of corporate names or trade marks or possibility of such confusion. Cf. <em>Great Scott Food Mkt. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sunderland Wonder Inc. </em>348 Mass. 320, 323, 324-325; <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Life Ins. Co. </em>351 Mass. 283, 290-292. The product sold by Cody\u2019s was made by Clairol. Although marked \u201cProfessional Use Only,\u201d it was identical with Clairol\u2019s retail product except for the different label placed upon it by Clairol, the uncovered bottle, and the absence of Clairol\u2019s instruction pamphlet'.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">There also is here no breaking open of Clairol\u2019s bottle container and changing the chemical content of the liquid. See e.g. <em>Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>238 Fed. 513, 516-518 (8th Cir.); <em>Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>J. G. Butler &amp; Sons, </em>229 Fed. 224, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>231-233 (E. D. Ark.) Callmann, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (2d ed. and supp.) \u00a7 84.2 (c). If there is technical adulteration within the meaning of G. L. c. 94, .\u00a7 186, as amended (fn. 6), it is because neither the bottle nor Cody\u2019s mimeographed sheet (despite its aggregate effect) contains the precise statutory warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">2. Clairol places principal reliance upon G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7A (fn. 2), in seeking protection against unfair competition by sales of its own products in a manner not intended by it, which it alleges will damage its reputation. Section 7A, by supplementing general equity principles, has encouraged a wider range of relief against allegedly unfair competitive practices than would probably have been granted prior to its enactment. See Michelson, Massachusetts Law of Unfair Competition and Restatement 2d: Torts, 49 Mass. L. Q. 131, 137-139. In each Massachusetts case cited,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> however, there was some element of possible confusion of (1) a product or trade name of another, or the activity of another, with (2) the product, trade name, or activity of the plaintiff. See note, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 814, 851-852.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">We do not suggest that such possible confusion is essential either to general equitable relief or to relief under \u00a7 7A, but thus far no authority indicates what other equitable considerations will justify granting injunctive relief under \u00a7 7A. Although the precise scope of the section, and of related general principles, can be determined only on a case by case basis, we regard \u00a7 7A as authorizing protection of business reputation and trade marks from unfair injury and dilution on a somewhat broader basis than was clearly recognized prior to its enactment. See Callmann, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks (2d ed. and supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 84.2-84.2 (a); note, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 520, 526-532.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>This case calls upon us to consider whether certain dealings by another in a producer\u2019s own first quality merchandise, as labeled by him, constitute unfair competition. We assume that protection against false marketing, by misrepresentation or deceptive sales practices, will justify relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nothing in our cases, however, suggests that first quality merchandise may not be sold under a producer\u2019s trade mark in sealed units prepared and labeled by him, at least if disclosure is made of departures (see fn. 8) from the producer\u2019s marketing methods or of disadvantages to the consumer possibly resulting from the selling method used.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Clairol must rely largely on cases from other jurisdictions (principally New York and Pennsylvania), which somewhat broadly prevent selling a trade marked product in a manner different from that adopted by the producer. In <em>Bayer Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Sumner Printing Co. </em>7 F. Supp. 740, 742 (N. D. Ohio), aspirin tablets distributed by the producer in larger packages were sold by the defendant in packages of two. The selling method was enjoined as deceptive to the extent that it gave the public the impression that the Bayer Company sponsored that method. The Pennsylvania courts have enjoined hair dye distributions like that now before us. In <em>Clairol, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martin Wholesale Distribs. Inc. </em>35 D. &amp; C. 2d (Pa.) 78, 91-92, the risk to Clairol\u2019s business reputation was deemed sufficient to require that the professional use bottles be packaged as put out by Clairol and include adequate instructions. The court held, however, that Clairol\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201cadvertising program is not protectable under the doctrine of unfair competition.\u201d In <em>Clairol, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sarann Co. Inc. </em>37 D. &amp; C. 2d (Pa.) 433, 452-456, similar relief was granted not only on the basis of unfair competition but also on the ground that the \u201cProfessional Use Only\u201d label imposed an implied equitable servitude upon the chattel which bound the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The New York courts, partly on the basis of a New York penal statute and partly on the basis of a New York statute like our \u00a7 7A, have also given injunctive relief in like circumstances. <em>Clairol Inc. </em>v. <em>L. H. Martin Value Center, Inc. </em>40 Misc. 2d (N. Y.) 875, 876 (Supr. Ct. Spec. Term). See <em>Clairol Inc. </em>v. <em>Peekskill Thrift Drug Corp. </em>141 U. S. P. Q. 147 (Supr. Ct.), affd. 25 App. Div. 2d (N. Y.) 496; <em>Clairol Inc. </em>v. <em>Carlton Drug, Inc. </em>(27 App. Div. 2d [N. Y.] 652). See also <em>Lanvin Parfums, Inc. </em>v. <em>Le Dans, Ltd. </em>9 N. Y. 2d 516, 520-523.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">3. Clairol presses upon us the potential risks to its business reputation from uninstructed home use of its \u201cProfessional Use Only\u201d product. The principal actual injury, however, appears to be the effect upon Clairol\u2019s retail sales of Cody\u2019s enterprising exploitation of Clairol\u2019s dual pricing arrangements by which Cody\u2019s makes retail sales at a price essentially that at which Clairol sells the same liquid to its retail wholesalers.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Clairol, it seems to us, largely seeks to protect what has been an effective marketing and advertising device. So far as the risks to the public are concerned, by individual packaging of its professional product,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Clairol could protect it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>self from most, if not all, the risks (including product liability, fn. 5) to which it contends Cody\u2019s conduct exposes it. As the trial judge points out, Clairol could also protect itself by rigid supervision of its professional jobbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Clairol\u2019s efforts to obtain relief, so far as they involve price protection, deal with a matter as to which Clairol has not seen fit to use the Fair Trade Law. G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 14A-14D, as amended. Where there has been no compliance with \u25a0 a statute directly dealing with price protection, we perceive no reason for applying c. 110, \u00a7 7A, or general equitable principles, to afford such protection. On this record also, we see no basis for treating either (a) Clairol\u2019s labels on its \u201cProfessional Use\u201d bottles (see fn. 9, <em>supra), </em>or (b) any arrangement by Clairol with its jobbers to restrict to professional hairdressers the jobbers\u2019 resale of such bottles, as binding in equity upon nonprofessional purchasers from such jobbers who have no direct contractual relationship with Clairol.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">4. A more compelling consideration in deciding whether to grant any relief is protection of the public. Doubtless, many purchasers from Cody\u2019s were women who had previously used a particular Clairol shade to their satisfaction and were familiar with the instructions and procedures for applying Clairol or competitive hair dyes. Such consumers do not appear to be exposed to substantial risk. They have a legitimate interest in buying the Clairol product as cheaply as possible. Cody\u2019s customers, however, may include others who, if unwarned, may be harmed. We also recognize that Clairol\u2019s reputation may be injured in the event of any substantial number of poor results arising from use of \u201cProfessional Use\u201d Clairol by inexperienced, retail purchasers. Although no necessity appears in this case for broad relief such as was granted in the Pennsylvania and New York cases, some limited protection to inexperienced consumers and to Clairol is justified under general equitable principles and under \u00a7 7A. This can be afforded without enjoining Cody\u2019s from selling the professional bottles, without making such sales more cumbersome, and without restraint of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>trade or injury to the important public interest in buying trade marked commodities at low prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Reasonable protection will be given if Cody\u2019s is enjoined from selling Clairol professional bottles except when it furnishes with each bottle a legible, printed statement (a) containing the precise statutory warning required by G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 186, as amended (fn. 6), and any applicable Federal statutes; (b) indicating that the professional bottle was originally sold by Clairol in six-packs for use by professional hairdressers, that the bottles are being sold by Cody\u2019s separately, and (unless Cody\u2019s provides such a book) that there is furnished no copy of Clairol\u2019s instruction book prepared for nonprofessional, \u201chome use,\u201d retail purchasers; (c) warning that, unless consumers consult and follow such instructions, they may incur substantial health risks and, also, results may not be satisfactory, (d) warning that the two blue shades are not safely to be used alone; and (e) suggesting a strand test because the contents of unpackaged professional bottles may produce undesired results if they have been exposed unduly to light or are used after the indicated expiration date. The record shows no justification for more stringent regulation of Cody\u2019s sales of professional bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">4.
