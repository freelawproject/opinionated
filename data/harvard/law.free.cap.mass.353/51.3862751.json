G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">The defendant (Cavanaugh) conducted a trucking business. For several years he kept his trucks at a garage operated by the plaintiff (Hobart) in Beading. Cavanaugh employed one Blickenstaff as a truck driver. Blicken-staff\u2019s normal duties required him to truck tannery products from Peabody or Lynn to Woburn. He worked on a part time basis, from three to eight hours a day. Blicken-staff customarily reported for work at Hobart\u2019s garage five days a week. The hour varied. The people in Peabody and Lynn would notify Blickenstaff when the loads would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>be ready the next day, and he, on the next day, would get a truck at Hobart\u2019s and pick up the loads whenever they were ready.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The assault took place on August 29, 1962. Hobart was at work at his usual hour, 7 a.m. At seven twenty, while Hobart was putting gasoline into Cavanaugh\u2019s trucks, Blickenstaff drove his car into the yard of the garage, parked it, and walked toward Hobart until he was twenty feet from him. Blickenstaff asked Hobart \u201cwhy the hell he didn\u2019t have the truck filled up, hadn\u2019t Cavanaugh told him to keep those trucks filled.\u201d Hobart told Blickenstaff that \u201che had an awful lot of mouth for a fellow that wasn\u2019t paying the bills. \u2019 \u2019 He did not say this in a nice gentle manner; he looked at Blickenstaff when he made this remark. At that moment, the gasoline started to bubble out of the tank; Hobart looked down at it, and, before he knew what happened, he was struck on the jaw and toppled over. Up to that moment only Hobart had handled the truck. He had driven it to the gasoline pump. Later in the morning, Hobart found that he could not bite; his jaw had been broken by the blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The question presented is whether this evidence, viewed in its aspect most favorable to Hobart and drawing from it such inferences as are reasonably permissible, was sufficient to support the finding implicit in the jury\u2019s verdict that Blickenstaff at the time of the assault was acting within the scope of his employment. We think it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Cavanaugh\u2019s answers to interrogatories which were in evidence show that although the hour Blickenstaff reported was of his own choosing, the only place where he was to report to do Cavanaugh\u2019s work was Hobart\u2019s garage. This evidence precludes our adoption of Cavanaugh\u2019s contention that the evidence did not permit a finding that Blicken-staff \u2019s work for him \u201cdid not begin until he actually started on his first trip to the tanneries scheduled for that day.\u201d It could be found on other evidence that Blickenstaff knew that Hobart did not open the garage until 7 a.m. ; that on bis own arrival at 7:20 a.m. he was impatient that gasoline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>had not already been put into his employer\u2019s truck; and that he struck the blow because of the delay and the incidental waste when the gasoline bubbled over. Thus viewed the evidence meets the test stated in <em>Levi </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>121 Mass. 501, 505, and most recently applied in <em>Rego </em>v. <em>Thomas Bros. Corp. </em>340 Mass. 334, 335. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>190 Mass. 206. <em>Zerngis </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>255 Mass. 603, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The exceptions are sustained and judgment is to be entered on the verdict returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
