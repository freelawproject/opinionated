The respondent conducts a real estate office in the Dorchester District of Boston for the sale and rental of residential properties. The sales manager in charge of that office is one Coleman. On or about October 20, 1965, one Matthews, a Negro, went to the office and inquired as to the availability of a four to five room apartment for himself, his wife, and two children at a rental of $100 to $110 a month. Matthews said he would pay more than $110 if the apartment was worth it. He specifically asked about such apartments in certain sections of Dorchester, and was told by Coleman that none was available. Within a day or two Matthews returned to the office, and Coleman again told him that no apartments of the type he desired were available. In fact there were available one or more apartments of the type, character, location, and price range specified by Matthews. Coleman did not disclose this information because of Matthews\u2019 race.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The judge found that \u201cColeman, in acting as a broker or rental agent, discriminated against Matthews because of his race and color,\u201d but was \u201cunable to find that the respondent Wattendorf had actual knowledge of Coleman\u2019s conduct or that he authorized or participated in the discriminatory conduct of Coleman.\u201d The findings continued: \u201cThe only direct evidence on the point is that Wattendorf had instructed his employees not to discriminate against Negroes. Therefore, I do not find that Wattendorf intentionally or personally violated the decree by discriminating among applicants for housing on the basis of color or race. The evidence falls short of proof of The clear and undoubted disobedience which is required for the foundation of a pe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>titian for contempt\u2019. See <em>United States Time Corp. </em>v. <em>G. E. M. of Boston, Inc. </em>345 Mass. 279,\u201d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">No error appears. Coleman was not a party respondent, and the trial judge made no decision as to whether he was in contempt. The petitioner strives to base an argument on the mistaken view that the trial judge \u201cheld\u201d that he was \u201cbound\u201d by the <em>G. E. M. </em>case to dismiss the petition. The trial judge, however, made no such statement nor said anything in the least justifying it. What he did was to quote from that case the applicable portion of a well established principle, full statement of which is, \u201cTo constitute a wilful violation of the injunction there must be a clear and unequivocal command and an equally clear and undoubted disobedience. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>342 Mass. 462, 464.\u201d <em>United States Time Corp. </em>v. <em>G. E. M. of Boston, Inc., supra, </em>282. See <em>Terminal R. R. Assn. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 U. S. 17, 29, cited in the <em>Nickerson </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The ruling that there was a clear and unequivocal command is conclusive. Equally conclusive is the finding that there was no violation. There was no abuse of discretion, and without that essential element the decree dismissing the petition must be affirmed. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>301 Mich. 482, 484. <em>East &amp; West Coast Serv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Papahagis, Appellant (No. 2), </em>344 Pa. 188, 190. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>241 S. C. 1, 15.
