See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N (inserted by St. 1965, c. 763, \u00a7 <em>2; </em>see amendment of \u00a7 178G by St. 1966, c. 156),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> regulating collective bargaining by municipal em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ployees. The commission on June 9, 1966, filed a decision. After meager findings of subsidiary facts, it stated (1) that a question of representation had arisen; (2) that the appropriate unit consisted \u201cof all fire fighters employed by the . . . [city] including lieutenants, captains, district chiefs, [and] deputy chiefs, but excluding the [c]hief . . . and . . . all other [city] employees,\u201d and (3) that an election should be held on July 7, 1966, to determine whether a majority of the employees had selected the union as collective bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The city manager, on June 28, 1966, filed this petition for judicial review. He contends that the commission\u2019s decision improperly \u201clumps together all uniformed employees of the Medford [f]ire [department as an appropriate [bargaining] unit with the . . . exception of the [c]hief . . . and orders an unnecessary election.\u201d A Superior Court judge overruled a plea to the jurisdiction filed by the inter-veners. This plea was based primarily on the ground that the commission\u2019s decision was not a final order. By firm! decree, the commission\u2019s decision was affirmed. The city manager appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">1. We first consider whether this petition is premature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commission ordered an election by secret ballot \u201cas part of the investigation authorized by\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The statutes permitting collective bargaining by municipal employees (see fn. 2) contain no express provision for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>judicial review. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (as amended through St. 1957, c. 193, \u00a7 1), however, provides for judicial review of \u201ca final decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d The commission and the interveners contend that there has been no \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Precedents under G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6 (f), as amended through St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a711, are not directly controlling. Nevertheless, there are numerous similarities between c. 150A, the State Labor Relations Law (see c. 150A, \u00a7 12) which is applicable to private industry, and the 1965 statute (see fn. 2) concerning municipal employment. Accordingly, precedents under c. 150A are likely to furnish helpful guidance if differences between the two statutes and between public and private employment are appropriately taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>312 Mass. 597, 602, this court held that \u201cin ordinary cases\u201d judicial review of certification issues within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction could take place only after there had been a commission decision based upon an unfair labor practice. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that stage, \u201cthe whole proceeding, including any errors in the certifying of the representatives . . . [becomes} open to court review.\u201d The court in the <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>case (p. 602) left open the possibility that cases might exist \u201cwhere the effect of a mere certification might be so imme-. diately and completely disastrous to the legally protected interests of the employer that the Legislature must be presumed to have intended\u201d to permit other avenues of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In cases reviewing action of the National Labor Relations Board, similar principles have been applied. See <em>American Fedn. of Labor </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>308 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>401, 412. An order for an election has not been regarded as a final order. <em>Inland Empire Dist. Council </em>v. <em>Millis, </em>325 U. S. 697, 707, reh. den. 326 U. S. 803. See <em>Boire </em>v. <em>Greyhound Corp. </em>376 U. S. 473, 476-481. The Supreme Court of Connecticut has recently reached a similar conclusion under its statute (Conn. Gen. Sts. Ann. [1965] \u00a7\u00a7 7 \u2014 467 to 7 \u2014 477; see Pub. Act No. 159, 1965) regulating collective bargaining by municipal employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Windsor </em>v. <em>Windsor Police Dept. Employees </em>Assn. <em>Inc. </em>154 Conn. 530, 536-539.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We conclude that the principles stated in the <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>case, 312 Mass. 597, 602 (at least in the absence of extraordinary circumstances making certification questions of vital significance, or of questions relating to the commission\u2019s jurisdiction), should be applied to postpone judicial review of certification questions until, upon complaint, the commission has issued or denied an order (see c. 149, \u00a7 178L) to the municipal employer or to employees to desist from a practice prohibited by the statute. When such an order is issued, the propriety of the commission\u2019s decision on certification issues will be open for appropriate judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The city manager contends that the commission had no authority to order an election and that, in any event, an election is unnecessary (see White, Rights and Responsibilities in Municipal Collective Bargaining, 22 Arbit. J. 31, 32), because the city in fact recognizes the union as the firefighters\u2019 exclusive bargaining agent. Certainly, there appears to be no real objection by the city to recognizing the union as representing all the firefighters except the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>deputy chiefs and officers (for convenience here called the officer group). The only real dispute appears to be whether the officer group should be included in the bargaining unit. Nevertheless, we cannot say that under c. 149, \u00a7 178H (3), the commission was not justified in ordering an election as part of its investigation, to obtain assurance, through an uncoerced, free, secret ballot, that the firefighters really wished to be represented by the union. See, however, the provisions for waiving an election by stipulation in St. 1967, c. 746, amending \u00a7 178H.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The petition does not set forth any facts showing (a) that the commission has exceeded its jurisdiction, (b) that there is any extraordinary occasion for varying the usual procedure for review, or (c) that special injury to the public interest or inconvenience to the city or its firefighters will occur if the commission\u2019s investigation takes the usual course. Accordingly, it was premature for the Superior Court to exercise jurisdiction to review the commission\u2019s action. The petition should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">2. Although the case could be disposed of on what has been said, the parties urge us to express views (see <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>313 Mass. 722, 731) upon the principal issue in dispute. Some general discussion is appropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The 1965 statute says little concerning what is an \u201cappropriate unit\u201d for collective bargaining. Section 178H (4), quoted, <em>supra, </em>fn. 2, leaves it to the commission to \u201cdecide in each case,\u201d whether it \u201cshall be the municipal employer unit or any other unit,\u201d subject to the explicit exclusion of \u201cexecutive officers of any municipal employer\u201d from the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 178G and subject also to provisions in \u00a7 178H (4), viz. (1) that \u201cuniformed employees of the fire department shall be in a separate unit,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>(2) that \u201cprofessional employees\u201d(see \u00a7 178G) shall not be placed in a unit containing nonprofessional employees without the consent of a majority of the professional employees. The structure and purpose of the statute, however, indicate matters which the commission should take into account. Cf. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>339 Mass. 535, 546-547; <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>347 Mass. 586, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Because the statute deals with public employees, public interest considerations are of greater importance in determining appropriate units than in cases dealing with private employment. The statute (\u00a7 178M) makes unlawful strikes, slowdowns, and other action which may interrupt essential public services, and places much reliance on \u201cfact finding\u201d (\u00a7 178J) as a method of \u201cpeaceful resolution of disputes without disruption of public services.\u201d See Krinsky, Public Employment Fact-Finding in Fourteen States, 17 Labor L. J. 532; note, 8 B. C. Ind. &amp; Com. L. Rev. 273, 283-288. The major public interest objectives of the statute are to be given weight by the commission which, of course, may also take into account considerations such as those mentioned in the second <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>case, 316 Mass. 748, 750-751.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We think that the commission correctly construed the provision in \u00a7 178H (4), that \u201cuniformed employees of the fire department shall be in a separate unit\u201d as requiring it to exclude one nonuniformed employee from the unit. This provision, however, does not indicate to us that all uniformed firefighters must be in the same unit. We think that the section requires no more than that uniformed employees be kept in one or more units separate from the department\u2019s nonuniformed employees, thus enabling the commission to deal flexibly in the public interest with the great variety of situations which may confront it. These may require determining whether in any particular community or department it is wise to include supervisory employees in a unit with the employees whom they supervise. See 1 N. L. R. B. Legis. Hist. of the Labor Manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>ment Relations Act, 1947, pp. 302, 304-308, 409-411; cf. pp. 362-363.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The commission, we think, was plainly correct in excluding the chief as an \u201cexecutive officer.\u201d The other members of the officer group present a more doubtful question. As to them the commission\u2019s decision contains little more than ultimate conclusions and does not make the full findings of subsidiary facts and statements of its reasons appropriate in view of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8). See e.g. <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>347 Mass. 586, 592-594. See also <em>Framingham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>351 Mass. 127, 129-131. Cf. <em>Sudbury </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>351 Mass. 214, 230. We are left largely to infer what subsidiary findings were in fact made from the transcript of the commission hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The commission had before it the job descriptions of the various grades of firefighters. There was also evidence, .among other things, that the fire chief had disciplinary and assignment authority; that deputy chiefs acted for the chief in his absence (see <em>Plante </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>352 Mass. 190, 191); that officers came up through the ranks; that they do much the same work as the ordinary firefighters and work with them; that they five and eat together, or in the same building, to a considerable extent; that the officers exercise some supervisory and instruction authority; that there is an orderly chain of command; and that some -collective bargaining on firefighters\u2019 working conditions had been done in the past by a committee representing all grades in the Medford department, including the officer group. There was no evidence that members of the officer group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>objected to being included in the bargaining unit or that harmful results to departmental discipline or the city\u2019s general interests would be caused by their inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Although, as already indicated, the commission\u2019s findings should have been more complete, we assume that appropriate, permissible findings are implied in the commission\u2019s conclusions. For present purposes, it is sufficient for us to indicate that substantial evidence justified subsidiary findings which in turn would have permitted the commission\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">3. Because the petition was brought prematurely, the case is remanded to the Superior Court, where a new final decree is to be entered dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> Pertinent provisions (emphasis supplied) include the following: (a) <em>Section 178G </em>defines (1) \u201cMunicipal employer\u201d as including \u201cany_ . . . city . . . and any person designated by the municipal employer to act in its interest in dealing with municipal employees\u201d; (2) \u201cEmployee\u201d as \u201cany employee of a municipal employer, whether or not in the classified service of the municipal employer, <em>except </em>elected officials, board and commission members, and _ <em>the executive officers </em>of any municipal employer\u201d; and (3) \u201cEmployee organization\u201d as \u201cany lawful . . . organization . . . having as a primary purpose the improvement of wages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d (b) <em>Section 178H (1) </em>grants to municipal employees \u201cthe right to self-organizatian\u201d and \u201cto bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\u201d (c) <em>Section 178H </em>further reads, in part, \u201c(2) Whenever . . . a petition is filed . . . by an . . . employee organization alleging that a substantial number of employees wish to be represented for collective bargaining by an employee organization . . . [the] commission shall investigate . . . and, if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, shall provide for an appropriate hearing .... (3) If . . . the commission finds that there is a controversy concerning the representation of employees, it shall direct an election by secret ballot or shall use any other suitable method to determine whether and by which employee organization the employees desire to be represented and shall certify the results thereof. . . . An employee organization which receives a majority of votes cast in an election shall be designated by the commission as exclusive representative of the employees in the unit. In any election where none of the choices on the ballot receives a majority, a run off [of the top two organizations] shall be conducted . . . . (4) The commission shall decide in each case whether the appropriate unit . . . shall be the municipal employer unit or any other unit thereof; provided, <em>uniformed employees of the fire department shall be in a separate unit.\u201d </em>This subsection is subject also to a provision concerning \u201cprofessional employees\u201d not here pertinent. See a new subsection (5) inserted by St. 1967, c. 746. (d) <em>Section 178L </em>defines certain unfair practices including \u201c(4) refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with an employee organization which has been . . . designated as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit; and (5) refusing to discuss grievances with the representatives of an employee organization . . . designated as the exclusive representative in an appropriate unit.\u201d Section 178L also provides for the hearing and decision by the commission of complaints \u201cthat a practice prohibited by . . . [the] section has been committed\u201d and for an order by the commission to the party found by it to be \u201c committing the prohibited practice ... to cease and desist\u201d therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> The briefs do not adequately discuss, and we do not decide, whether the city manager has standing (see Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action, \u0440. 537, et seq.; Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 22.15), as a person within the definition of \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d in c. 149, \u00a7 178G (see fn. 1), to bring this petition in his own name. We assume that, as chief administrative officer of the city (see G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 103, as amended through St. 1950, \u0441. 353, and \u00a7\u00a7 104-105), he may be permitted to amend his petition so that it will be brought in the name of the city (G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 2; see <em>Natick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dept. of Pub. Welfare, </em>341 Mass. 618, 619; <em>Building Inspector of Wayland </em>v. <em>Ellen M. Gifford Sheltering Home Corp. </em>344 Mass. 281, 286-287). He has an obvious interest in administrative matters (see <em>City Manager of Medford </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>329 Mass. 323, 330) affecting city employees subject to his general supervision. _ The city, by counsel, participated in the proceedings before the commission. See <em>Wilmington </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>340 Mass. 432, 437-439. See also <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>342 Mass. 58, 59-60; <em>Sudbury </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>351 Mass. 214, 217-219.

Util. </em>339 Mass. 535, 542-544.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> Such postponement of court review, however, is not necessary in cases where the commission acts outside its jurisdiction. In such instances judicial proceedings have been permitted in advance of any final order on an unfair labor practice. See e.g. <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>320 Mass. 467, 469-474; <em>Wheaton College </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>352 Mass. 731, 735-738.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> The Connecticut statute was adopted a few months earlier than the Massachusetts statute, which in many respects appears to follow the Connecticut language. The Connecticut court, however,_ rested its decision (p. 535) in part upon \u00a7 7-471 (4) (D), a provision not included in the comparable Massachusetts section. _ See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178L. On general principles, however, we reach essentially the same result. Precedents under other somewhat different State statutes afford little guidance. See Mich. Comp. L.
