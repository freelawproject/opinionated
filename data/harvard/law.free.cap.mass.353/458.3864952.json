L. c. 267, \u00a7 13, for the purpose of making counterfeits of \u201cnotes and bills . . . issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States\u201d and (2) unlawfully possessing \u201cwith intent to utter and pass\u201d ten or more \u201ccounterfeit bank bills . . . purportedly issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States . . ..\u201d See G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 9. The trial was conducted under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, as amended. He was found guilty on both charges. Saville appealed. He assigns as error the denial of his motions (1) to suppress certain evidence and (2) for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">1. Saville, prior to trial, sought to suppress evidence seized at his printing shop under a search warrant issued on July 4, 1966, pursuant to an appHcation on that day by Officer Desrosiers of the West Springfield pofice. The application reads, in part, \u201cI have information based upon . . . statements made to me by Detective Richard Hurley of the Connecticut State Pofice that John J. Parisi had stated that Anthony Saville of 38 Burford Avenue, West Springfield gave said Parisi 150 counterfeit] ten dollar bills, this occurring at the print shop of said Saville located at 212 Bosworth Street in West Springfield yesterday afternoon.\u201d The officer concluded that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe\u201d that Saville unlawfully possessed at his print shop counterfeit S10 bills as well as certain items of printing equipment capable of producing such bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">At the pre-trial hearing before the judge who later presided at the trial, Saville's attorney introduced in evidence only (1) a warrant to search 212 Bosworth Street, (2) the affidavit (quoted above) of Officer Desrosiers, and (3) a form of notice, dated July 14, 1966, of proposed forfeiture of the articles seized under the warrant as \u201cproperty used in the commission of a crime.\u201d The motions to suppress, however, alleged that when Officer Desrosiers made application for the warrant to search 212 Bosworth Street, he also made \u201capplications . . . for two other search warrants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>which . . . contained affidavits [by Officer Desrosiers] . . . inconsistent with . . . information set forth in the affidavit\u201d upon which the warrant to search 212 Bosworth Street was based. Copies of these affidavits were attached to each motion to suppress (as examination of the original motions reveals).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These affidavits and the warrants based upon them were also dated July 4, 1966, and were issued by the same clerk who issued the warrant to search the Bosworth Street premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">This is another instance, like some recent cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the police, although perhaps aware of facts amounting to probable cause, seem to have set their information out in the required affidavit for the particular warrant (see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2B, as amended through St. 1965, c. 384) less completely than would have been appropriate. In this case, however, the information in all the affidavits presented to the clerk on July 4, 1966, adequately revealed the facts relied upon to show probable cause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Serao, </em>367 F. 2d 347, 348-349 (2d Cir.). We thus need not dis'cuss whether the affidavit in support of the application relating to 212 Bosworth Street was sufficient by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">This last mentioned affidavit and the affidavits (see fn. 1) in support of the applications concerning Parisi\u2019s premises were obviously presented by the same police officer to the same clerk at the same time as a part of a single effort to obtain search warrants relating to one counterfeiting transaction. We think that the affidavits may be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>as a group and that, so viewed, they establish (1) that Parisi had told a Connecticut State police officer that Saville had given Parisi 150 counterfeit $10 bills at Saville\u2019s printing shop on the afternoon of July 3, 1966, and (2) that Parisi had been arrested on July 3, 1966, on charges concerning counterfeit $10 bills with forty such bills in his possession at the time of his arrest. These facts, taken together, had substantial tendency to show that counterfeit money had been obtained at the printing shop and that one who had such money in his possession in incriminating circumstances had obtained the money there from Saville. Although the information about Parisi in the application for the Bosworth Street warrant was somewhat meager, even that application by itself showed that Parisi admitted receipt of counterfeit bills from Saville at his shop. \u201cIncriminating admissions by one who asserts participation [in criminal activity] tend to show the reliability of his statements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>350 Mass. 633, 635-636. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>349 Mass. 121, 123. If it be assumed that Parisi did not in terms assert participation in the counterfeiting venture, involvement in it was inferable from what he was reported as admitting to the Connecticut officer. It was sufficient to warrant treating that admission as rehable. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bozza, </em>365 F. 2d 206, 225 (2d Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>270 F. Supp. 963, 966-967 (S. D. N. Y.). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitlow, </em>339 F. 2d 975, 976-980; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>251 F. Supp. 99, 104 (N. D. Ohio).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We apply the principle stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 108-109, that warrants and affidavits in support of them must be tested \u201cin a commonsense and realistic fashion.\u201d The motions to suppress were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">2. Saville contends that verdicts should have been directed for him because \u201c[t]he possession of ten or more counterfeit . . . Federal Reserve notes and the possession of equipment to counterfeit such notes are not crimes under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 9, or ... \u00a7 13.\u201d These and other relevant sections are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues in effect that \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13 do not apply to counterfeit Federal Reserve notes, because such notes are not issued by \u201can incorporated banking company\u201d within the meaning of that term used in \u00a7 8, and within the meaning of the term \u201cissued by any bank or banking company\u201d used in \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Section 9 makes it a crime to possess (in specified circumstances) with intent to pass ten or more \u201ccounterfeit notes .... such as are mentioned in any of the preceding sections.\u201d Section 8 refers to \u201ca bank bill . . . issued by any incorporated'banking company.\u201d Section 13 makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>a crime to possess with intent to use certain items of equipment designed for making \u201ccounterfeits off] notes . . . issued by any bank or banking company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Federal Reserve. notes are \u201cobligations of the United States,\u201d see 12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 411-414 (1964; see 1966 amendment of \u00a7 413 by 80 Stat. 161), which may be issued to each of the twelve Federal Reserve banks (see 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 222, App. A (1964), and 26 Fed. Reg. 12638) against statutory collateral deposited by such banks (\u00a7\u00a7 412-414), \u201cat the discretion of the Board, of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u201d (\u00a7411; see also \u00a7 248 [d] as amended by 80 Stat. 161). The notes then may be put in public' circulation by the several Federal Reserve banks. Notes \u201cso paid out . . . bear ... a distinctive letter and serial-number . . . assigned . . . to each Federal Reserve bank\u201d (\u00a7 413).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such notes are receivable by member banks of the Federal Reserve System and for all taxes (\u00a7 411), so they have most characteristics of money. See for. a general discussion of these notes, Nussbaum, Money in the Law-(rev. ed.) pp. 91-92/</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We assume that the delivery of a Federal Reserve note to one of the twelve Federal Reserve banks is \u201cthe first delivery . . . to a holder or remitter,\u201d the sense in which \u201cissue\u201d is used in the Uniform Commercial Code. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-102 (1) (a). Article 3 of the Code, however, does not apply to \u201cmoney,\u201d see \u00a7 3-103 (1), which is defined as \u201ca medium of exchange authorized . . . by a domestic . . . government as a part of its currency.\u201d See \u00a7 1-201 (24). Federal Reserve notes are \u201cmoney\u201d within this definition, as the official comment (see Am. Law Inst. Uniform Commercial Code, 1962 Official Text, p. 28) on clause (24) reveals. In any event, having in mind the obvious statutory purpose behind \u00a7 8 (to punish the proscribed possession of counterfeits of notes used as currency put out to the public by banks), it is consistent with that purpose and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ordinary usage to view \u201cissued\u201d as including the action of the several Federal Reserve banks in putting into public circulation Federal Reserve notes obtained by them for that purpose under the Federal statutes cited above. Similarly, such an interpretation of \u201cissued,\u201d as found in \u00a7 13, is appropriate. Federal Reserve banks are incorporated under 12 U. S. C. \u00a7 341 (1964). We thus hold that Federal Reserve notes are \u201cissued by an incorporated banking company\u201d within G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 8 (fn. 3), as well as by a \u201cbank,\u201d within \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Our conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider at length Saville\u2019s argument that the statutory and decisional history of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8-13, indicates that counterfeiting a bank note, upon which an incorporated banking company was not directly hable (or a note within c. 267, \u00a7 7), could be prosecuted only under \u00a7 1. Section 1 has been regarded as having a wide scope. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>2 Pick. 47, 49; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>10 Gray, 477, 480-482. We assume, without deciding, (1) that \u00a7 1, which carries a lesser penalty than \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13, would apply to counterfeiting any type of bank note or currency not more specifically made an offence in one of the later sections of c. 267, and (2) that \u00a7 1 (under the holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>2 Allen, 165, 167-168; but see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulus, </em>11 Gray, 305) would not apply where a counterfeit of any note more explicitly described in one of the later sections was involved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>3. There was no fatal variance between the indictments (which referred to \u201cnotes and bills\u201d or \u201cbank bills,\u201d issued or purportedly issued \u201cby the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States\u201d) and the proof which showed that the case dealt with counterfeit Federal Reserve notes. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7\u00a7 34-35.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>97 Mass. 570, 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> These affidavits, part of applications for warrants to search Parisi\u2019s apartment and place of employment, read, in part, as follows: \u201cI have information based upon . . . statements made to me by Detective Richard Hurley of the Connecticut State Police, Westbrook Barracks that on July 3, 1966 one John P.

See St. 1804, c. 120, discussed in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Mass. 59, 69-71. See also Rev. Sts. c. 127, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 5, 9 (see discussion of \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6 in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simonds, </em>14 Gray, 59, 60-61); Gen. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 5, 9; Pub.

Perhaps, because most prosecutions concerning counterfeits of United States notes take place in the Federal courts under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 8, 471-474 (1964), the Massachusetts statutes have not been brought up to date to refer expressly to modern types of United States notes. Cf. Am. Law Inst., Model Penal Code, \u00a7 224.1 (Proposed Official Draft, 1962). The specific reference to notes issued \u201cby or on behalf of the United States,\u201d in G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 29 (fn. 5), is not here relevant. Section 29 deals with advertising resembling paper money or government securities. It has no necessary relation to statutes mating criminal deliberate counterfeiting. The original predecessor of \u00a7 29 (St. 1849, c. 5) was passed separately from St. 1804, c. 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b511-13\"> At the arguments, Saville\u2019s attorney disclaimed any contention that the field of counterfeiting had been preempted by Congress.
