[to pay] his or her share of the income in equal shares to his or her children and to the issue of any deceased child by right of representation,\u201d and in case B, C, or D \u201cdie leaving no issue, or in case of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>death of all of his or her issue before the [trust\u2019s] termination . . . then his or her share of the income shall be paid to his or her brothers or sister or to their issue in the same manner.\u201d Upon the death of the last survivor of B, C, and D, the provision (for convenience called the termination gift) was that the trustees \u201cshall pay over and divide\u201d the trust estate (after certain charitable gifts) \u201cin equal shares, to the children then surviving of\u201d B, C, and D, \u201cthe issue then surviving of any deceased child to take their parent\u2019s share by right of representation.\u201d There was a gift over to others in the event that there were no then living issue of B, C, or D.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">C, the last survivor of B, C, and D, died leaving no issue in 1966. Two children of B and four children of D were then living. There was also a grandchild of D, the son of a deceased child of D. Prior to the death of C, the two children of B had been sharing one-third of the trust income and the four children and one grandchild of D had been sharing one-third of such income, each taking one-fifth of such one third.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A Probate Court decree instructed the trustees to make distribution in seven equal shares per capita among the two children of B and the four children and grandchild of D. The children of B appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The language of the termination gift, read literally, directs a per capita distribution among the children of B, C, and D (with the son of D\u2019s deceased child taking the share which his parent would have taken). During C\u2019s life (and after the death of B and D), income was distributed to C and to the issue of B and D essentially on a per stirpes basis. This, however, does not sufficiently show an intent contrary to the literal meaning of the termination gift. <em>Cammann </em>v. <em>Abbe, </em>258 Mass. 427, 429-430. <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>278 Mass. 409, 412-414. <em>B. M. C. Durfee Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>329 Mass. 461, 462-463. See <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>337 Mass. 594, 598; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 355; Page, Wills (Bowe-Parker ed.) \u00a7 36.10.

There is no adequate indication of an intention that distribution be made per stirpes among the issue of B, C, and D, living at the death of the last survivor (with the stirpes or stocks to be found in B, C, and D) such as existed in <em>Bradlee </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>318 Mass. 117, 119-120. See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>326 Mass. 397, 400-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The decree is affirmed.
