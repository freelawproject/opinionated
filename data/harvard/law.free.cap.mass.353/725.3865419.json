The automobile \u201cran off the highway into a telephone pole and overturned.\u201d It was then being operated by Audet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>This action of tort<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was commenced in the Superior Court by writ dated September 22, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Service of process was made on the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notice of such service was mailed by registered mail to Audet at 28 Prospect Avenue, Hartford, Connecticut. The letter was returned to Crete\u2019s counsel marked \u201cno such #.\u201d An attorney, purporting to appear specially for Audet, filed (a) a motion to dismiss \u201cfor the reasons that there has been no . . . sufficient service of process upon . . . \u00a1[Audet], a nonresident,\u201d and that there has been no compliance with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 3C; and (b) an answer in abatement asserting that Audet was a nonresident, who had no property in Massachusetts which was attached in this action, that he had not been personally served in Massachusetts, and that there had been no compliance with \u00a7 3C.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">It was stipulated that, when the action was commenced, there were on file at the Chelmsford Police Department the following addresses for Audet: (a) R.F.D. # 1, Box 35, Tolland, Connecticut, which appeared on the report, dated September 26, 1964, of the investigating police officer who had obtained the address from Audet\u2019s Connecticut operator\u2019s license; (b) 12 Chabot Street, Lowell, which appeared on Mrs. Crete\u2019s accident report (September 28, 1964) as owner of the vehicle; and (c) 28 Prospect Avenue, Hartford, Connecticut, which appeared on Audet\u2019s accident report, dated September 29, 1964. See as to these reports, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 26, as amended (fn. 6, <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">It was represented orally at the arguments before us that there was no such address as 12 Chabot Street, Lowell; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>that Audet was a \u201cdrifter\u201d who could not be found; and that the appearance for him was by an insurance company, presumably the insurer on Mrs. Crete\u2019s liability policy, which had learned of the accident from Crete or his wife. Presumably also, the insurance company was protecting itself with respect to possible liability upon the policy. No other facts have been represented to us or stipulated which tend to explain the unusual situation more fully, or which give further indication whether Audet or the insurance company would in any event be subject to liability arising from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">No evidence, other than the stipulation, was presented to the trial judge. He denied the motion to dismiss and overruled the answer in abatement. He then stayed further proceedings and reported the case for the determination of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 3B,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides in effect that a person operating a motor vehicle in this Commonwealth in any place to which the public has a right of access shall be deemed to have appointed the Registrar of Motor Vehicles as his attorney for the service of process. Chapter 90, \u00a7 3C (as amended through St. 1937, c. 387),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides for the method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of service and of giving notice to defendants in connection with \u00a7 3B. The purpose of this provision, as was said in <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>342 Mass. 194, 199, is \u201cto secure, as nearly as may be, to a non-resident defendant . . . the same opportunity to defend before trial that he would have if personal service had been made upon him in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In the <em>Nickerson </em>case, service had been made on a writ, returnable August 13, 1955, upon the registrar in an action against Rhode Island residents growing out of an accident in Massachusetts. No effort, however, was made by the plaintiff to give any notice to the defendants or to file an affidavit of compliance. On May 14, 1957, the defendants appeared specially and filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that service was invalid (p. 196). Thereafter the plaintiffs obtained orders of notice for service upon the defendants, which were served upon the registrar and copies were dispatched by registered mail to the defendants in Rhode Island. The trial judge denied the motion to dismiss. This court, however, ordered judgment for the defendants. We held that, for jurisdiction over the defendants to attach, | 3C required (see p. 197) compliance with one of the alternative forms of service provided in the section; that there was clearly no compliance (see p. 198) with the requirement of \u00a7 3C, par. (1), i.e. that notice be given \u201cforthwith\u201d to the defendants by registered mail; and that (pp. 198-200) the failure to give notice \u201cforthwith,\u201d as required by \u00a7 3C, could not be cured by an order of notice issued under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 84, because (p. 199) \u00a7 30 sets \u201cforth an exclusive procedure for giving notice\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018forth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>with\u2019 requirement in that section may not be avoided by resort to \u00a7 84.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In the <em>Nickerson </em>case no attempt whatsoever to give notice to the defendants was made for two years. In the present case, immediate effort was made to comply with \u00a7 3C by giving registered mail notice to the address which Audet himself had given in his accident report to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles (with a copy to the Chelmsford Police Department) as required by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 26 (as amended by St. 1964, c. 405; see most recent later amendment by St. 1965, c. 664).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>347 Mass. 608. Crete\u2019s registered mail notice, however, was not in compliance with c. 90, \u00a7 3C (1). It was sent to the \u201clast address of [Audet] the defendant known to\u201d Crete (see fn. 4, at point [C]) rather than to Audet\u2019s \u201caddress of record in the office from which . . . [[Audet\u2019s operator\u2019s] license was issued\u201d (see fn. 4, at point [[A]). Service of the notice at Audet\u2019s last known address was permitted by \u00a7 3C if \u201cthe defendant ha[[d] no . . . license known to the plaintiff\u201d (see fn. 4, at point [[B]). In the event of such service, however, \u00a7 3C required that \u201cproof of actual notice ... be filed in the case\u201d (see fn. 4, at point [D]).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Crete contends that Audet is estopped to assert that his address was not that given by him in his report required by \u00a7 26. The record does not show that Audet told Crete that he had a license or by what State it was issued. The stipulation does not require the inference that Crete knew what address was shown on Audet\u2019s license, if any. Even, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>however, if Crete or his attorney had known the address shown on the operator\u2019s license, it might reasonably have been believed that Audet\u2019s address shown in his report was a later address. This naturally might have given rise to the assumption that a change of address had been reported to the appropriate Connecticut official. In any event, the address shown on the report was a representation by Audet on which others might be expected to rely and by which they would be likely to be misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">It, of course, would have been appropriate and possible for Crete to have sent notice of the action to the Tolland address as well as to the address given by Audet in the report under \u00a7 26. Also, counsel might well have verified with the Connecticut Motor Vehicle Department, Conn. G. S. (incl. 1966 supp.) c. 246, \u00a7\u00a7 14-10, 14-36, 14-41, 14-42, 14-45, that the Tolland address was that shown for Audet on the Connecticut records. There would then have been no doubt that there had been compliance with \u00a7 3C and that the Superior Court had acquired jurisdiction. We think, however, that there was sufficient representation by Audet that his real address was the Hartford address to which notice was sent, and sufficient tendency for that representation to mislead Crete, so that Audet should not now be heard to argue that Crete did not send notice \u201cforthwith\u201d to the Tolland address, or whatever address appeared on the Connecticut records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">It could be found (a) that failure to get notice \u201cforthwith\u201d to Audet was induced by his own conduct, and (b) that there had been a substantial effort to comply with \u00a7 3C, and not (as in the <em>Nickerson </em>case, 342 Mass. 194) a complete failure for two years to attempt to give any notice required by \u00a7 3C, par. (1). Accordingly, in the circumstances, now that the failure to give actual notice to Audet at Hartford has become apparent, we think that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>open to the Superior Court to apply \u00a7 84 for one purpose for which it was intended, the correction of service actually attempted but deficient, and to order new notice (of the writ and of the fact of its service upon the registrar) now to be given to Audet at the Tolland address or at whatever address appears on the Connecticut motor vehicle records. Until such a notice has been duly served, action upon the motion to dismiss and the plea in abatement<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appropriately should be postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> Count 1 of the declaration alleged that Crete \u201cwas . . . riding as a passenger, conferring a benefit for the performance of something in which . . .
