L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, to establish its right to payment for labor and materials furnished by it in the construction of a school in the town of Andover. The trial judge made \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order for Decree\u201d which he adopted as his \u201cReport of Material Facts.\u201d He found \u201cthat the defendant, Champy Construction Company, Inc. [Champy], is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $5,730.00, which sum represents the balance due the plaintiff for materials furnished and labor performed.\u201d A final decree was entered ordering Champy to pay this amount (plus interest) to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Champy appealed from this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Champy contends that \u201c[t]he judge\u2019s findings and the final decree are not supported by the reported evidence.\u201d In view of this contention, we summarize relevant portions of the evidence. Sometime in September of 1961, William Baldwin (Baldwin), the president and general manager of the plaintiff corporation, visited the site of the school construction at the request of Champy. The work was already in progress. There he met with Bernard Champy (Bernard), the general manager of the defendant. Bernard asked Baldwin if he were \u201cinterested in the job\u201d of erecting steel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>at the school site and in \u201cgiving a price.\u201d Baldwin said that he was interested and asked Bernard the tonnage involved. Bernard told Baldwin there were 60 tons of structural steel and 39 tons of reinforcing steel. Bernard also showed Baldwin plans of the proposed construction, and Baldwin took these away from the site with him, and examined them \u201cfor the purpose of determining the labor involved so that he . . . [could] give the contractor a unit price, but he could not and did not determine from the plans the volume of steel involved.\u201d The next day Baldwin returned to the job site to discuss the price of the work with Bernard. Baldwin first submitted a price of $70 a ton for the reinforcing steel and about $68 a ton for the structural steel. They \u201chaggled a bit\u201d and finally \u201ccame to an agreement that . . . [the plaintiff] would do the job for $6400. That was $60 a ton of structural and $39 a ton of reinforcing.\u201d Baldwin wrote out a proposal to tins effect and gave it to Bernard. The latter told Baldwin that he \u201cdidn\u2019t sign any contract,\u201d but that his \u201csister would sign the contract and return them\u201d to the plaintiff. (A copy of the first proposal was admitted in evidence bearing the signatures of Bernard and Baldwin.) This proposal was not signed in Baldwin\u2019s presence, nor was it returned to him. Shortly thereafter, and before the plaintiff commenced work, Baldwin learned that the construction would involve 165 tons of structural steel instead of the 60 tons he had been told by Bernard. Within a few days Baldwin returned to the job site and told Bernard, \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake on your tonnage on your structural steel. It\u2019s 165 ton of structural steel instead of 60 ton. . . . I\u2019ve got the tonnage.\u201d Bernard said that he would get the right tonnage from Lyons Iron Works, Inc. (Lyons), the steel supplier. Baldwin said that he could not do the work at the previously agreed price, and gave Bernard a second written proposal calling for \u201c$56 per ton.\u201d Bernard told Baldwin that he would \u201ctear up the . . . first proposal and . . . take the second one ... to his sister and his sister would sign the contract,\u201d which would be returned to the plaintiff. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>plaintiff never received this contract. The plaintiff commenced work on the project in October of 1961. Baldwin visited the site several times and asked Bernard about the written contract. The latter said that he would send it, \u201c][a]s soon as he found out the tonnage from Lyons.\u201d Later, Bernard entered the hospital, and Baldwin went to see Bernard\u2019s attorney, Mr. Salvatore Basile. Mr. Basile assured Baldwin that Champy was rehable and that the plaintiff would get its money. Baldwin told Mr. Basile that he \u201cwanted the contract, but . . . [Mr, Basile] said . . . [Bernard] couldn\u2019t sign, he was sick, and there was nothing . . . [[the plaintiff] could do but go ahead and finish the job.\u201d During the course of the work, two bills were submitted to Champy by the plaintiff \u201cfor 25 tons of reinforced steel at $60 per ton,\u201d and \u201cfor 40 tons of structural steel at $58 per ton,\u201d or a total of $3,820. Champy paid both bills. The work was completed on June 12, 1962. At that time the plaintiff billed Champy for the balance of \u201cthe complete amount of the whole job.\u201d In August, Baldwin met with Bernard and Mr. Basile in the latter\u2019s office. Bernard took no active part in the discussion, allegedly because he \u201cwas under the doctor\u2019s care and he couldn\u2019t do any talking.\u201d Baldwin was shown a copy of the first proposal, and for the first time saw that it bore Bernard\u2019s signature. Baldwin saw a copy of the second proposal in Bernard\u2019s hand, took it from him, and showed it to Mr. Basile. Mr. Basile then told Baldwin that \u201che wasn\u2019t going to pay\u201d more than $6,400, and \u201cthat he accepted the first proposal ... as a contract.\u201d Subsequently, Mr. Basile sent the plaintiff a check for $2,580, which was the difference between the previous payments and $6,400. (It was stipulated by the parties that this check was accepted without prejudice.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The defendant argues that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to recognize . . . [[the first proposal] as the contract between the parties and to enter a decree based on it\u201d; that this first proposal was agreed to by an agent of the defendant whose authority the plaintiff is estopped from disputing; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>and that whatever the miscalculation that led the plaintiff to enter into the contract, it was not the product of fraud or mutual mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">\u201cThe authority of an agent is a question of fact, 'the answer to which depends upon the inferences to be drawn from a variety of circumstances . . .\u201d <em>Costonis </em>v. <em>Medford Housing Authy. </em>343 Mass. 108, 113. <em>Rintamaki </em>v. <em>Cunard S.S. Co. Ltd. </em>205 Mass. 115, 117. <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Lowell Inst. for Sav. </em>304 Mass. 212, 214. In the case at bar, the judge could have concluded that the signature sought from Bernard\u2019s sister was a mere formality. We are of opinion that there was ample evidence to justify a finding that Bernard had authority to enter into a binding contract on behalf of Champy. Bernard\u2019s authority was no less when he entered into an agreement with Baldwin based on the second proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The effective substitution of an executory contract requires no consideration beyond mutual releases from the prior obligations. <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>128 Mass. 116, 120. <em>Zlotnick </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>301 Mass. 224, 226. It is not material here whether the mistake as to tonnage under the first agreement was mutual or unilateral, since that agreement was superseded by an effective new contract. There was evidence that a second agreement was entered into by the parties under which a per-ton rate was substituted for the lump-sum price of the first proposal. There was also evidence that the parties agreed that the first proposal would be destroyed. We are of opinion that the evidence clearly supported a decree based on the terms of the second agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The defendant also claims error in the judge\u2019s failure to strike Baldwin\u2019s testimony that the plaintiff erected 165 tons of structural steel and 39 tons of reinforcing steel. Baldwin testified that these figures had been given him by the supplier, Lyons. There was also testimony from Bernard that he would talk to Lyons from whom he would get the figure of the total amount of tonnage. It is argued that because Baldwin did not have personal knowledge of the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>amount installed, this testimony was hearsay and therefore inadmissible. This argument ignores the fact that the judge could have found that under the terms of the final agreement the \u201cvolume of steel involved\u201d was to be the figure furnished by the steel supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-12\"> The bill was \u201cdismissed as to the defendant . . .
