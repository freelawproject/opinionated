The case was referred to a master and \u201csubmitted [to him] on agreements as to certain facts, . . . documents, and a view.\u201d The trial judge, after sustaining certain exceptions and allowing certain motions to strike, of both parties, ordered the entry of an interlocutory decree confirming the master\u2019s report. A final decree was entered which ordered the plaintiff to \u201creconvey\u201d to the defendants the \u201cproperty\u201d in dispute. The plaintiff appealed from the interlocutory and final decrees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The defendants were the owners of 31.91 acres of land in the town of Holden. On July 16, 1951, the plaintiff purported to take by eminent domain 122 acres of land in the town for school purposes. This taking included the aforementioned land of the defendants. They had not been notified of the taking. It was in August, 1957, that they \u201chad actual knowledge of the taking of their property by the . . . [plaintiff].\u201d Until that time the plaintiff was \u201cunaware\u201d of the defendants\u2019 ownership of the 31.91 acres included in the taking. Thereafter the plaintiff \u201cexpressed its willingness to reconvey to the . . . [defendants] this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>. . . 31.91 acres, on condition that the . . . [defendants] pay to the . . . [plaintiff] the cost of . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] survey in the amount of . . . $1560.37, and the conveyance by the . . . [defendants] to the . . . [plaintiff] of a right of way. \u2019 \u2019 The defendants did not file a petition for assessment of damages under G-. L. e. 79, \u00a7 16, contending that the purported taking was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">For the purposes of this case, and without so deciding, we assume that the taking was a valid one. Based on that assumption, and the finding that the defendants had actual notice of the taking but did not file a petition for damages within the prescribed statutory period, we concern ourselves solely with the constitutionality of St. 1964, c. 711. That act contained a description of the 31.91 acres of land and 14 authorized and directed [the plaintiff] to convey by a deed, without covenants\u201d to the defendants 44whatever right, title and interest\u201d to that land the plaintiff acquired from the defendants under the order of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">1. The defendants argue that the plaintiff 4 4 has no standing to raise the issue of the constitutionality of\u201d the statute because 4 4 [i]n order to raise the constitutional issue, one must be able to show that the operation of the statute does or will impair his rights . . . [and] [n]o evidence has been produced that the operation of . . . [the statute] does or will impair the rights of the . . . [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Although some support for the defendants\u2019 contention may be found in such cases as <em>Assessors of Haverhill </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>332 Mass. 357, 362, and <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>School Comm. of </em>Plymouth, 332 Mass. 410, 413, we believe that subsequent decisions provide adequate authority to sustain the standing of the plaintiff to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. Where, as here, declaratory relief is sought by a school committee 4 4in interpreting the statutes applicable to their duties as to which a controversy has arisen,\u201d <em>School Comm. of New Bedford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ. </em>349 Mass. 410, 412, we may, in our discretion, consider the constitutional issues presented by that contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>versy. <em>School Comm, of Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. </em>352 Mass. 693, 696-697.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">2. The plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of St. 1964, c. 711, on the ground that, in \u201cconferring special and private privilege, [it] is not a \u2018wholesome and reasonable\u2019 law within the meaning of Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, Art. 4 of the Constitution, and such a law, cannot be \u2018for the good and welfare of this commonwealth\u2019 within the meaning of those words as used in the same article. \u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It is clear from numerous decisions that a statute which confers a benefit on a named individual is not unconstitutional, provided that a \u201clegitimate public good is to be derived from\u201d such a statute. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>271 Mass. 495, 498. See e.g. <em>Olivier </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>306 Mass. 376, 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The case of <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Groton Water Co. </em>178 Mass. 472, 477-478, even though the statute construed in that case was of general operation, illustrates the manner in which the public good is served. Such legislation is a device which prevents \u2018 \u2018 a written constitution from interfering with the power to make small repairs which a legislature naturally would possess. . . . [The effect of such a statute] in saving the petitioners from being barred by the statute of limitations ... is only secondary and accidental. . . . The respondent had incurred a legal obligation to them which although not contractual, was voluntary and legal, and which was entitled to the highest protection of the law, as it sprang from the exercise of eminent domain. . . . There is no especially striking equity in favor of defeating them because of a mistake of procedure, and as the Legislature now has said that they shall not be defeated, we have not much hesitation in yielding to the current of decisions and in accepting its mandate as authoritative in this case.\u201d This principle was affirmed in <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R. </em>181 Mass. 383, 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Cases such as <em>Holden </em>v. <em>James, </em>11 Mass. 396, and <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>347 Mass. 230, relied on by the plaintiff, are distinguishable. Those cases involved special statutes which, by their terms, purported \u201cto exempt a named indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>vidual from the obligations of a general law while allowing the general law to remain in full force and effect as to all other persons.\u201d <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Brookline, supra, </em>p. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Statute 1964, c. 711, does not suspend the operation of a provision of the General Laws. We are of opinion that the General Court did not transcend its powers in enacting this legislation to rectify a manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Interlocutory and final decrees affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\"> We do not comment on various requests for rulings acted on by the trial judge and argued by the parties in their briefs. Requests for rulings have no standing on an appeal in equity. <em>Klefbeck </em>v. <em>Dous, </em>302 Mass. 383., 390. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Branconmier, </em>337 Mass. 366, 368-369.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
