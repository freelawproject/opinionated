The plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions are to the direction of verdicts for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The defendant was the owner and operator of YD Lunch in Bridgewater. Wainwright testified that he visited the YD Lunch in the company of the plaintiffs\u2019 intestates about 9 p.m. on February 15, 1961, for the purpose of drinking beer. They arrived in an automobile driven by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate McLean. Wainwright remained until 11 p.m., was served four or five beers, and \u201cfelt the alcohol\u201d when he left. Both the defendant, who acted as bartender, and the waitress, who served them, were convicted of selling intoxicating liquor to minors on this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The defendant could have been found to have violated G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34, which provides in material part, \u201c[Whomever makes a sale or delivery of . . . [alcoholic] beverages ... to any person under twenty-one years of age . . . shall be punished by a fine ... or by imprisonment . . . or both.\u201d He also could have been found to have violated G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 69. See <em>Adamian </em>v. <em>Three Sons, Inc. </em>decided this day, <em>ante, </em>498. But unlike that case, the evidence here did not warrant a finding that the defendant knew or should have known that the group had arrived by automobile or that Wainwright himself would drive away in one. This conclusion could not have been inferred from the fact that there was a parking lot owned by the town which patrons of YD Lunch could use. That the defendant could have been found to have sold beer to minors who became in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>toxicated would not, without more, satisfy the burden upon the plaintiffs to prove proximate cause. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>318 Mass. 359, 361-362. <em>Deignan </em>v. <em>Lubarsky, </em>318 Mass. 661, 664.
