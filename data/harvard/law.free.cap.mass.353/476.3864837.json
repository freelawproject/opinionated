Among other witnesses four adult women, victims of the defendant\u2019s conduct, testified. His defence was insanity. Two experts testified for the defence; three for the Commonwealth. The defendant did not testify. The history taken by all the experts showed the defendant to be subject to abnormal, very intense, and frequently recurring sexual urges. The experts agreed that he was mentally ill and dangerous but differed as to whether he acted under impulses which he could not control. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A to 33E, were made applicable to the trial and the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The charge so stated the test of criminal responsibility formulated in the Model Penal Code (Am. Law Inst. Proposed Official Draft \u00a319623 p. 66, \u00a7 4.01) along with the words of the classic <em>Rogers </em>test <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>7 Met. 500, 501-502), as to make manifest to the jury, what we later held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 551-553, 555, that the Code test is \u201can evolutionary restatement of our rule rather than a substantively new rule.\u201d The judge instructed that the defendant, to be held responsible \u25a0under the stated cognitive test (knowing right from wrong) \u201cmust have substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act,\u201d and to be held responsible under the stated test of irresistible impulse he \u201cmust have substantial capacity to control his conduct so as to be able to abstain from doing the unlawful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The defendant contends that even though, as we have indicated, the adoption of the Code test does not mean that it was error to conduct a prior trial under the <em>Rogers </em>case language, nevertheless it was prejudicially confusing to refer to both tests. There is nothing in this. It was plainly helpful to the defendant\u2019s case to qualify the <em>Rogers </em>case test in what the defendant describes as \u201cthe more workable and desirable language\u201d of the Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The defendant\u2019s first witness, although testifying before the judge had ruled that the language of the Code test might be used in the examination of experts, in effect testified that the defendant did not meet the <em>Rogers </em>test because he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate and to control his conduct. There was therefore no harmful error in excluding a question to him in the express terms of the Code, even though the question was allowed as to later witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The defendant excepted to the exclusion of certain testimony offered for the purpose of showing that he had committed sexual attacks on and had murdered a number of women in the period from June, 1962, to January, 1964. The judge had permitted each expert to testify to the history of the defendant as it was derived from his interviews with the defendant and certain records. Thus the jury heard from the defendant\u2019s two experts their account of his statements about those crimes but under appropriate instructions that this was not proof that the defendant had committed them. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belenski, </em>276 Mass. 35, 47. There was also reference to the crimes in the testimony of Dr. Samuel Tartakoff, one of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts. He testified that he had heard from the defendant his account of the \u201cmacabre\u201d events of \u201cmost serious consequence\u201d in the period from June, 1962, to January, 1964. He accepted the account as historical information. His opinion was that the defendant \u201cwas in fact telling me the truth as he understood it. And he was not deluding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The defendant excepted to the refusal of the trial judge to allow a former assistant attorney general to testify to his interviews with the defendant. The offer of proof was that the interviews were in the presence of the defendant\u2019s guardian and were for the purpose of advising certain psychiatrists assigned by the Commonwealth whether the defendant was subject to delusions or was feigning or was telling the truth as to the murders. The other part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>defendant\u2019s proposed demonstration was shown in the offer to have a Boston poEce officer testify to instructions from the assistant attorney general and his resulting verification of the truth of certain physical facts stated by the defendant in the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">This was plainly inadmissible evidence. It had no standing as \u201chistory\u201d appraised by an expert and underlying his opinion. A party cannot put in incompetent evidence to fortify his experts\u2019 opinions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>195 Mass. 100, 108. <em>Peirson </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>191 Mass. 223, 233-234. Conduct of the defendant tending to show his inability to control himself was a fact to be proved in usual ways. Although it is beside the evidential point, the judge may have differed with the view that the testimony would have helped the defendant. The risk of prejudice to the defendant in the references to the murders <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70-71, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>351 Mass. 37, 44-45) justified careful rulings in accordance with well established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The defendant excepted to the exclusion of a Ene of inquiry to Dr. Samuel Allen, another of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts, and Medical Director at Bridgewater State Hospital. Dr. Allen had testified that he had heard mentioned in several places by several people the events in the period from June, 1962, to January, 1964, but did not receive a history of them \u201cin the form of a history.\u201d The question, the exclusion of which cut off other questions, was whether an official went to Bridgewater to determine if the defendant\u2019s story was factual. The offer of proof was that the defendant through his attorneys and guardian had assented to a prolonged interrogation by an assistant attorney general taken by agreement between the Commonwealth and the defendant as to the reEability of the defendant\u2019s account, and that Dr. Allen was one of the psychiatrists for whose benefit this history was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">There was no error. The issue is not presented whether in the course of his study to form an expert opinion a physician must in all circumstances get the entire history by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>own inquiries and confine himself to talks with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Allen could not properly be cross-examined about conduct of the defendant not in evidence and not appraised by him as a part of his study and evaluation of the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>342 Mass. 279, 287-288, and cases cited. His testimony that what he heard did not come to him as \u201ca history\u201d was, in effect, testimony that this information had not been included in his underlying data.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Further, the defendant shows no prejudice. The transcript persuasively suggests that he had all possible advantage from the circumstance that Dr. Allen had some information in respect of the defendant\u2019s assertions as to the other crimes. The physician\u2019s further testimony was that he \u201ccertainly would\u201d consider that a history of homicidal conduct would be significant diagnostically in arriving at an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s ability to resist impulsive acts; that if it appeared that the conduct was sexually \u201cmotivated or accelerated\u201d he would consider that significant; and his opinion that the defendant had not acted under irresistible impulse in the crimes being tried had been arrived at \u201cpractically without\u201d such a history. In his opinion the defendant is insane, and is suffering from mental illness, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>fined as mild schizophrenia, but sufficiently severe so that he is committable because he is sick and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The defendant excepted to the exclusion of a question to his own expert, Dr. Robert R. Mezer, seeking his testimony that he had information that the victims in almost all the homicides had been left in singular, bizarre and obscene positions, that the bodies of some of them had been subjected to shocking indignities and that this was schizophrenic conduct. The physician had already testified that bizarre conduct was significant in diagnosing schizophrenia. The offer of proof was not confined to information which had come to the physician as history evaluated by him in forming an expert opinion as to the defendant. The implication was that the doctor was being asked to give an expert opinion on the significance of what he had heard that the police had found.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such testimony of the witness was not admissible on any ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The defendant finally contends that the evidence so plainly shows that he was without substantial control that we should rule that the verdict cannot stand. We may not do this. Experts having differed, as was to be expected in a borderline case <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544; <em>Jarvinen </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante, </em>339, 340), there was a jury issue. Although significant testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts was helpful to the defendant it does not conclusively establish lack of capacity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>327 Mass. 609, 614-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">It is not a basis for a legal ruling that the defendant is without substantial capacity to control his conduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>those experts who testify that he has such capacity also testify that he is mentally sick or that a cure is doubtful or that he should be committed because he is dangerous. The Code test does not apply the <em>Durham </em>rule. <em>Durham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>214 F. 2d 862 (Ct. App. D. C.). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>337 Mass. 702, 712-713. Notwithstanding such evidence the Code test in the use of the word \u201csubstantial\u201d leaves the issue squarely in the hands of the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issues tried in such a case as this do not include whether the defendant should have treatment, or whether, apart from guilt, he should be segregated. See G. L. c. 123A.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Criminal acts having been committed, and the evidence not being conclusive, a determination was required whether the perpetrator was responsible or irresponsible under the law. No better way appears to determine that than by leaving to the twelve citizens of the jury the application of a reasonable and understandable rule after a fair trial and under fair and full instructions. That is what happened in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> The\u2019 examination and cross-examination reflected concepts that arose under the <em>Rogers </em>case formulation but this did not prejudice the defendant.'

There was expert testimony that the line between psychosis and sociopathic behavior was uncertain. One expert who gave great weight to the \u201cpoliceman at the elbow\u201d test recognized that the defendant had \u201csome abnormal compulsion that drives him to the abnormal sexual gratification\u201d and although in a controlled situation he is quiescent, when not in a controlled situation he sometimes becomes extremely violent, so \u201cthere is a compulsion of some sort.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\"> In many if not most cases the expert description of a disease and its effect on the defendant\u2019s conduct will be more significant than the concluding views of the expert as to criminal responsibility under the carefully formulated legal test. The testimony in this case showed that overall impressions and feelings have a part in expert conclusions. Although experts must weigh all factors much as the jury must do, their testimony must not in effect usurp the jury\u2019s functions.
