The crimes were allegedly committed on July 29, 1965. The three indictments other than that for murder were ordered placed on file and the defendant recognizes that the appeal in respect of these indictments brings nothing before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>338 Mass. 682, 684. The jury did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>not recommend that the sentence of death be not imposed. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">A principal issue was the criminal responsibility of the defendant for the shocking and revolting acts shown in the evidence. The defendant contends that on the evidence a verdict should have been directed for him on the ground of insanity. He contends also that his motion for a new trial should have been allowed as the weight of the evidence shows that he was insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">An expert called by the defendant testified that the defendant was afflicted with schizophrenia and \u201chad an irresistible impulse to sexually molest and to kill a young girl.\u201d An expert called by the Commonwealth testified that in his opinion the defendant did not act under irresistible impulse. On cross-examination he testified that the crime, allegedly committed by the defendant, was, he felt, \u201cvery definitely ... a product of this mental disease\u201d (which he had described). In his opinion the defendant \u201cis not of substantial capacity to control his behavior.\u201d Asked as to the effect of the mental disease on the defendant\u2019s ability on July 29, 1965, to control his impulse to sexually violate or to kill, the witness answered, \u201cI certainly feel that his mental illness played a substantial part in reducing his capacity to control his behavior. I do not believe it completely obliterated or stopped his ability to control his behavior.\u201d The history indicated that \u201cwhile his impulses to kill have existed for many years ... he had always been able previously to resist these, and again always on the basis of the presence of some other individual.\u201d He \u201cwould avoid . . . [giving way to his impulses] if he felt there was any such chance of being apprehended. For this reason I felt very clearly that the defendant had ample control of bis impulses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">It is inescapable on this record that the testimony of the witness for the Commonwealth was dependent on his making a distinction between irresistible impulse and lack of substantial capacity to control, a distinction which we have rejected in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>553-555. In that case we held that the test of the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code, Proposed Official Draft (1962) \u00a7 4.01, restates our rule <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, 7 </em>Met. 500, 501-502) in \u201cclearer and more understandable words.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the <em>McHoul </em>case we said, \u201cWe think our test <em>as applied </em>has been in all likelihood, in most cases, a \u2018substantial capacity\u2019 test. . . . The Code intends that \u2018a defendant will not be convicted ... if mental illness has deprived him of effective power to make the right choices\u2019 .... Such is the precise intent of our test, expressed in terms of capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">There was no legal error in this case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>327 Mass. 609, 613-615. <em>McHoul </em>case, <em>supra. </em>The jury could disregard all the expert opinion. But on this record there is shown the possibility, if not the probability, that had our construction of the <em>Rogers </em>rule been already declared, as it later was in the <em>McHoul </em>opinion, there would have been, as in the <em>Cox </em>case, \u201cunanimous medical opinion\u201d (327 Mass. at 615) that the defendant was not criminally responsible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This we deem in justice to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">As it appears that a retrial will not take place for two years or more after the trial of March, 1966, we do not consider whether the defendant\u2019s motion for change of venue should have been granted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 333. We note, however, that the considerable pre-trial publicity in Plymouth County including the newspaper publication of serious admissions of the defendant with an account of his reenactment of the crime and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>photograph of the defendant with the subcaption, \u201cAccused murderer . . . shown in the Lakeville area where he reenacted for police the slaying of 5-year-old Ellen Gamache of Middleboro,\u201d risked a finding that the guilt of the defendant had been \u201csubstantially prejudged by the residents of the county.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The responsibility to guard against prejudicial pre-trial publicity is particularly serious in a first degree murder case because of the double function of the jury both to determine guilt or innocence and to recommend as to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> The Code states (\u00a7 4.01 [1]): \u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacles substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\"> How the testimony would have stood if there had been full direct and cross-examination in the light of the <em>McHoul </em>case construction is of course not certain. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert testified, inter alla, that the defendant\u2019s affliction was a combination of a \u201csociopathie personality disorder with sexual deviation\u201d and \u201ca concurrent schizophrenic reaction of the chronic undifferentiated type.\u201d_ He deemed the sexual drive itself as sociopathie or criminal but \u201cthe choice of object, the excitement by the blood . . . certainly part of his mental illness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
