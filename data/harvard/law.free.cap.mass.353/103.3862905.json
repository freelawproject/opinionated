The defendant, knowing of their ownership, or claim of ownership, petitioned the Land Court for a decree of registration, and fraudulently repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sented that he did not know of any other persons having an estate or interest in the locus. Consequently, the plaintiffs did not receive the notice by registered mail afforded a party in interest in a registration proceeding. The only notice given was one by newspaper publication of which the plaintiffs had no knowledge. The title examiner appointed by the court reported that the defendant did not have a record title proper for registration. The defendant thereupon filed two false affidavits in support of a claim that he and predecessors in interest had acquired title by adverse possession. One affidavit, by the chief assessor of Rockland, asserted that the defendant\u2019s predecessors in interest had been assessed for the locus (twenty-five acres) for many years, although the assessors\u2019 records show that'for most of that time the defendant\u2019s predecessors had been assessed for five acres. The affiant, who was familiar with the actual facts, made the affidavit either with intent to defraud the Land Court or with such wilful disregard of the facts as to be tantamount to fraud. The other affidavit recited certain information concerning the ownership, and use of the locus, of which the affiant, in fact, either had no knowledge or knew to be false. The defendant knew of the falsity of this affidavit and filed it with the intention of deceiving the court. In reliance on these affidavits, the Land Court, on October 31,1960, entered a decree registering the locus in the defendant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The present bill was brought on March 20, 1962. The defendant demurred. The basis of the demurrer was that the bill was not brought within one year of the decree of registration in accordance with the provisions of Gr. L. c. 185, \u00a7 45.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The provisions of \u00a7 45 relied on are those which provide that a decree of confirmation and registration <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shall be conclusive upon and against all persons . . . [and] shall not be opened by reason of the absence, infancy or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor by any proceeding at law or in equity for reversing judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>or <em>decrees; </em>subject, however, to the right of any person deprived of land, or of any estate or interest therein, by a decree of registration obtained by fraud to file a petition for review within one year after the entry of the decree, provided no innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The judge rendered a decision in which he ruled that the plaintiffs\u2019 bill was \u201cin the nature of a petition for review under c. 185, \u00a7 45, and that the plaintiffs have not complied with the statutory provision that a petition for review be filed within one year after the entry of the decree of registration.\u201d The judge further ruled \u201cthat the Land Court has no jurisdiction [in equity] to award damages for fraud in procuring the decree. \u2019 \u2019 An interlocutory decree sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer and a final decree dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill were entered. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">It is well settled that a traditional remedy for a person who has been deprived of land through fraud is specific restitution. \u201cA person who has tortiously acquired or retained a title to land ... is under a duty of restitution to the person entitled thereto.\u201d Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 130. The duty to make such restitution is often enforced by imposing a constructive trust. In <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Covich, </em>332 Mass. 338, at p. 342, we said, \u201cA constructive trust may be said to be a device employed in equity, in the absence of any intention of the parties to create a trust, in order to avoid the unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of the other where the legal title to the property was obtained by fraud . . ..\u201d See Restatement: Restitution, \u00a7 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The bill prays that the defendant \u201cbe ordered to convey . . . [the locus] to [the] Plaintiffs ... by a good and sufficient deed such as to entitle the Grantees to a certificate of title . . . [and for] such other . . . relief as shall . . . seem meet and proper.\u201d The bill does not directly challenge the registration decree; the plaintiffs do not ask that the decree be declared void and the locus removed from the registration system. Rather they acknowledge that the legal title is now vested in the defendant and claim title by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>means of a constructive trust. The question, then, is whether a bill to impose a constructive trust on registered land may properly be treated as a \u201cpetition for review\u201d of the registration decree, and thus, pursuant to G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 45, must be brought within one year of that decree. We are of opinion that it may not be so treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Several other provisions of G. L. c. 185 (the land registration statute) are relevant. Section 45, upon part of which the defendant\u2019s demurrer was based, also provides in part that \u201cany person aggrieved by such decree [of registration] in any case may pursue his remedy in tort against the petitioner or against any other person for fraud in procuring the decree. \u201d Section 62, which deals with the presentation of the owner\u2019s duplicate certificate upon the transfer of registered land, provides in part: \u201cIn all cases of registration procured by fraud, the owner may pursue all his legal and equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud . . ..\u201d And \u00a7 75 explicitly recognizes that registered land may be held subject to a constructive trust.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus in three sections of the land registration statute, including the very section upon which the defendant relies, it appears that the remedies of a person deprived of land by fraud are preserved. Nor is there any indication that the remedy of restitution is excluded. As noted, \u00a7 75 specifically refers to constructive trusts. Section 62 refers to \u201clegal and equitable remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">If \u201cpetition for review,\u201d as used in \u00a7 45, were so broadly construed as to include a bill for the imposition of a constructive trust, the above enumerated provisions which appear to preserve that remedy would be severely weakened. Unless the defrauded person discovered the fraud and filed his bill within a year, a valuable \u2014 and often the most valuable \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 remedy would be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>We do not think that the purpose of G. L. c. 185 was to reduce the availability of the traditional remedy of restitution. The purpose of land registration is to provide a means by which title to land may be readily and reliably ascertained. See <em>Malaguti </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>262 Mass. 555, 567-568; <em>Deacy </em>v. <em>Berberian, </em>344 Mass. 321, 328. But these benefits of the registration system are intended primarily for those who act in good faith. It is not a purpose of the system to afford those who deal with registered land in bad faith any greater protection than they would have in similar dealings with unregistered land. See <em>Killam </em>v. <em>March, </em>316 Mass. 646, 650-651.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We hold that a \u201cpetition for review,\u201d as used in \u00a7 45, does not include a proceeding which seeks to impose a constructive trust, as distinct from one brought to alter or set aside a registration decree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The distinction between an attack upon a decree and a suit in equity to avoid the consequences thereof has been recognized. <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Esty, </em>110 Mass. 536, 544. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Small, </em>160 Fed. 142 (D. Mass.); Restatement: Judgments, \u00a7 112f and \u00a7 114a. Since the remedy of restitution operates only against the person who has committed the fraud, our holding does not run counter to the land registration act\u2019s purpose of furnishing good faith purchasers with a ready and reliable means of ascertaining title to land.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\n<em>Final decree reversed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> This was the sole ground of the denrarrer and we shall confine our discussion. to this issue,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\"> Section 75 provides: \u201cWhoever claims an interest in registered land by reason of any implied or constructive trust shall file for registration with the assistant recorder a statement thereof containing a description of the land, and a reference to the number of the certificate of title and the volume and page of the registration book in which it is entered.
