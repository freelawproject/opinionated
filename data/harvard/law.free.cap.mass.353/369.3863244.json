The companion case was reported for our decision, apparently pursuant to G.

L. c. 7, \u00a7 30K (as amended through St. 1963, c. 439, \u00a7 l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of revised all-inclusive per diem (AIPD) hospital charges to be paid by certain State and municipal agencies. These revised rates were to become effective on October 1, 1965. The two cases present similar issues, which can be dealt with adequately as presented in the first case, without setting forth the details of the second case (see fn. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In the first case, the hospital asked declaratory relief against the Commissioner of Administration (the commissioner). A Superior Court judge made findings and rulings adverse to the hospital\u2019s contentions. From a final decree making declarations in accordance with the findings and rulings, the hospital appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The case arises from the following four actions of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>missioner: (1) the commissioner promulgated emergency hospital rates on February 4, 1965, and notified the State Secretary (see G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 1951, c. 556, \u00a7 1, and c. 30A, \u00a7 5) that notice and hearing were impracticable because \u201cno rates . . . [had] been promulgated pursuant to . . . [\u00a7] 30K, within the last year, the result of which . . . [was] causing the hospitals . . . great economic and financial hardship and harm.\u201d (2) After notice and a public hearing on February 25, 1965, the commissioner on April 30, 1965, certified rates effective January 1, 1965, to be charged by the hospitals without any indication that the rates were temporary in effect or emergency rates. These rates he filed in the State Secretary\u2019s office, with a covering letter stating that under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 2, \u201cpursuant to notice, a hearing was held on February 25, 1965, to determine such rates.\u201d (3) To become effective on October 1, 1965, the commissioner certified new and higher hospital rates (the October 1 rates).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The covering letter, dated October 1 and received October 7, filing these rates with the State Secretary, recited that \u201cpursuant to notice, a hearing was held on February 25, 1965, to determine such rates.\u201d (4) On November 12, 1965, the commissioner sent to the State Secretary a letter stating that he had been advised by the Attorney General that he \u201chad no authority to promulgate the rates which . . . [he] filed ... on September 28, 1965 [apparently referring to the rates in fact filed with the letter of October 1, received October 7] . . . under . . . G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 30K.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>also stated that he had \u201cheld no hearing on the withdrawal of these rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The trial judge ruled (1) that the commissioner \u201chaving duly established . . . hospital care rates on April 30, 1965, to be effective from January 1, 1965 (for the calendar year of 1965), lacked authority on October 1, 1965, to establish a new and different schedule of rates for the year 1965\u201d; (2) that the \u201cpurported certification of . . . [the October 1] rates was without legal effect\u201d; and (3) that the commissioner \u201cwas not required to afford the . . . [hospital] an adjudicatory proceeding . . . [or to] hold a public hearing prior to the . . . withdrawal of rates which . . . [he] had no . . . authority to promulgate in the first instance.\u201d These rulings were incorporated in the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The record does not indicate what evidence was before the commissioner at the February 25 public hearing. Allegations of the present bill not explicitly denied by the commissioner, see Rule 29 of the Superior Court (1954), refer to exhibits annexed to the bill and summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These exhibits indicate that the commissioner, at the time of the February 25 public hearing, recognized that the cost data then placed before him were seriously out of date and \u201caveraged twenty-seven months in age\u201d in a period of changing (and apparently rising) hospital costs, and that the rates based upon such cost data were not reasonable and were \u201cin many cases, 20% to 30% below what the evidence indicated . . . [to be] the current costs of the hospitals.\u201d He thus apparently regarded the April 30 rates as established \u201ctentatively\u201d and proceeded later to attempt \u201cto rectify the situation by updating the hospital costs.\u201d The commissioner in his letter of August 9, 1965, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to the Attorney General (fn. 4) states that the \u201cBureau of Hospital Costs and Finances completed the updating . . . and on July 8, 1965, certified . . . new rates to the [Commissioner\u201d who then desired to certify these new rates under c. 7, \u00a7 30K, to be effective October 1, 1965, as reflecting \u201cthe lower of reasonable hospital costs or charges.\u201d The higher rates issued on October 1 indicate that the commissioner, on the basis of the new reports, in effect determined that the rates of April 30, 1965, were very much too low, that hospital costs were rising, and that rates based on out of date costs were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">1. Section 30K (see fn. 2) provides that rates to be paid to the hospitals by public bodies for the care of public patients are to be determined by the commissioner so as (fn. 2, at point [D]) to \u201creflect reasonable hospital costs or charges made to the general public, whichever is the lower.\u201d In collecting cost data (see fn. 2, at point [B]) a \u201cuniform system of hospital accounting and cost analysis\u201d is to be employed. Items such as depreciation are to be taken into account. The section has been viewed as directing the commissioner to establish compensatory rates of reimbursing hospitals from public funds for their costs in giving care to public patients, so that the hospitals will not be out of pocket for caring for welfare and other public patients, and so that the many nonprofit, charitable hospitals in the Commonwealth (of which the Massachusetts General Hospital is one) will not be obliged to deplete funds held for general charitable purposes for the care of such public patients. See <em>Springfield Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>350 Mass. 704, 709-710. The section must be interpreted with this purpose in mind. Obviously the AIPD rate, in a period of rising prices and wages, will not be compensatory if it reflects the lower hospital expenses, including wages and costs of goods, of a period long past instead of the higher costs of the current period in which the hospital is called upon to render services to public patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The principal contention now advanced by the Attorney General is that \u00a7 30K does not permit the commissioner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>certify more than one set of AIPD rates in each year. He relies upon the provision of \u00a7 30K (fn. 2, at point [C]) that the \u201ccommissioner shall certify annually\u201d the AIPD rates. Standing by itself this language would indicate only one certification each year, but the word \u201cannually\u201d does not stand by itself. The director of hospital costs (fn. 2, at point [A]) is to \u201cdetermine from time to time and certify to the commissioner ... at least as often as annually\u201d the per diem charges. The commissioner is to certify (fn. 2, at point [Ej) AIPD rates \u201cat least annually\u201d to the Department of Industrial Accidents. These two provisions suggest strongly that costs may be reexamined by the commissioner more frequently than once a year. Such an interpretation is consistent with the general purpose of \u00a7 30K to provide fair and just rates for hospital care, a purpose more accurately accomplished if the commissioner is free to change rates as often as costs change significantly. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 4, permitting petitions by interested persons for amendments of regulations. There is little apparent reason for the inconsistency of the language used in \u00a7 30K. In the absence of any clear statutory indication to the contrary, we read \u201cannually\u201d (fn. 2, at point [C]) as meaning \u201cat least annually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">2. The rates certified on April 30, 1965, were not, and did not purport to be, merely tentative, emergency, or temporary rates, like the emergency rates put out on February 4, 1965, which under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 2 (3), could \u201cnot remain in effect for longer than three months unless during that time\u201d notice was given and a public hearing held in accordance with \u00a7 2. The April 30 rates were promulgated by the commissioner after a public hearing on February 25, the date of the only public hearing mentioned in the record as held on AIPD rates in 1965. Even if issuing this general regulation was not an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1), a matter which we need not now decide, the hospitals and perhaps various public bodies and boards, in a matter so substantially affecting their interests, were properly given such a public hearing under general principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>administrative due process. See <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 499-500. These April 30 rates (as general regulations) could be changed as substantially as was done in the October 1 rates (except perhaps to correct clerical or computation errors) only after new notice to all entitled to notice and a new hearing. There is in the record no suggestion of any such new notice and new hearing. The updated cost schedules of the Bureau of Hospital Costs and Finances (see fn. 4 and related text of this opinion) could not have been before the commissioner at the public hearing on February 25. He could not have taken such data into account in considering new rates without disclosing the new schedules as evidence which he planned to consider, and without giving to persons in interest an opportunity at least for comment on the new schedules. See <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>298 Mass. 161, 168-169; <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>335 Mass. 748, 752-753. We hold that the October 1 rates were not validly issued because of failure to comply with the applicable provisions of G. L. c. 30A. See <em>Kneeland Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, 233-235; <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>346 Mass. 739, 740-741. The presumption of the regularity of actions by public officers has no application (see <em>Robie </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Authy. </em>347 Mass. 715, 725; see also <em>Century Cab Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>327 Mass. 652, 668) for the letter filing the October 1 rates with the State Secretary shows that the commissioner was relying on the same public hearing of February 25 which was the basis of the April 30 rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Because the October 1 rates were not validly promulgated, they never became effective. Consequently, there was no obligation to give any notice or to grant a public hearing with respect to the commissioner\u2019s recognition of the invalidity of the October 1 rates, which had no legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">3. What has been said disposes also of the companion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>case (fn. 1) with respect to the hospital\u2019s claim for reimbursement for two days\u2019 care in 1965 afforded to a public patient from Somerville. The hospital was entitled to reimbursement only at the April 30 rate and not at the higher October 1 rate, which never became effective. The validity of the April 30 regulation cannot be attacked collaterally. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>347 Mass. 519, 522. No petition for judicial review (under c. 30A) of the rates of April 30, 1965, is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">4. In the hospital\u2019s case against the Commissioner of Administration, the final decree is to be modified by striking out paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, and inserting in place thereof a declaration that the commissioner\u2019s rates, intended to become effective October 1, 1965, were not based on adequate new notice and hearing and never took effect as valid regulations. As so modified, the decree in that case is affirmed. In the hospital\u2019s case against the Commissioner of Public Welfare, a final decree is to be entered consistent with the view that the hospital is entitled to reimbursement from the city of Somerville for care rendered in 1965 to Mrs. Cioffi only at the rate established by the Commissioner of Administration on April 30, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Section 30K, as amended in 1963, reads in part, \u201cThe director of hospital costs and finances shall [A] determine <em>from time to time and certify to the commissioner of administration, at least as often as annually, </em>the average all-inclusive per diem charge to the general public for public ward accommodations or their equivalent, the all-inclusive per diem cost of care in such accommodations and the all-inclusive per diem cost of care for all patients of each hospital . . . licensed by the department of public health under . . .
