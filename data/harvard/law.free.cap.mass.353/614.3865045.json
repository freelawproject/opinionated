(C.F. Inc.). There was a substantial verdict for the plaintiff (My Bread) against C.F. Inc. and also a verdict for each codefendant (fn. 1). The case is before us on C.F. Inc.\u2019s exception to the judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict for it. The facts are stated in their aspect most favorable to Mjr Bread.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">In August, 1960, Byron Haseotes discussed with Joseph Duchaine, \u201cthe sole proprietor\u201d of My Bread, the sale of the latter\u2019s bakery products in \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d retail dairy stores. Haseotes was the secretary and treasurer and a stockholder of C.F. Inc., of each codefendant, and of fifteen other corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">After August, 1960, My Bread began selling its bakery products in the retail dairy stores, and provided bakery racks for use in this operation. The racks were delivered by My Bread directly to the local store in which they were used.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September, 1963, when the business arrangement with My Bread was terminated, My Bread sought the return of the racks. It was prevented by the local store managers, acting on the instructions of Haseotes, from recovering them from all but a few of the \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d stores. Title to the racks remained in My Bread at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In August, 1960, the capital stock of C.F. Inc. and of each codefendant was owned by Haseotes, his parents, his brothers, and his sisters. There was no joint financing of these corporations. The officers and directors of each corporation were the same. The sole business of the co-defendants \u201cwas the operation of chains of [small] retail dairy stores ... in Massachusetts . . ..\u201d C.F. Inc. did not operate retail stores.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It conducted \u201ca bottling . . . plant which processed and packaged milk and other dairy products and . . . [sold] its dairy products at . . . wholesale ... to the . . . five\u201d codefendants. Haseotes testified that in August, 1960, C.F. Inc. did not sell dairy products to all of the \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d stores in which My Bread was to sell its bakery products. In 1962 or 1963, however, it began to do so. All of the defendants used the trade name \u201cCumberland Farms.\u201d Persons dealing with all of these corporations treated them as \u201cCumberland Farms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">C.F. Inc. never owned any stock interest in the five co-defendants, nor did those corporations own any stock in it. The advertising of all six corporations was purchased in separate transactions and always used the trade name \u201cCumberland Farms.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In August, 1960, the Haseotes family dairy businesses were operated out of headquarters in Woonsocket. Processing and bottling were then done in two plants, one in Woonsocket and the other in Boston. Prior to the alleged conversion, the Woonsocket and Boston plants were consolidated in a new plant in Canton, and each defendant corporation moved its principal office to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>plant. Thereafter the \u201csame business manager operated all the businesses from the Canton address.\u201d Haseotes \u201cparticipated in the operation of all the corporations and it was his decision where money was to go in the various corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In August, 1963, Haseotes as sales manager of C.F. Inc., signed and sent out circular memoranda concerning the sale of bread (including My Bread products) in \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d stores. These were on C.F. Inc. letterhead and were addressed to a large number of retail stores or store managers in mandatory language, using such terms as \u201cmust\u201d and stating policies \u201cto be strictly adhered to.\u201d There was in evidence a loaf which had on its wrapper the name \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d and a notation that it was distributed by \u201cCumberland Farms, Inc. of Boston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Haseotes testified that, in his dealings with My Bread, he never acted on behalf of C.F. Inc. because that corporation did not operate retail stores, nor did it have any control over the store operating corporations. One of My Bread\u2019s officers, however, testified that he \u201calways dealt with . . . Haseotes as \u2018Cumberland Farms\u2019,\u201d although he did on occasion on Haseotes\u2019s request make out checks <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to other corporations. He also obtained certificates of insurance which included the names of several of the Haseotes corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">1. C.F. Inc. contends that the conversions of the bakery racks were \u201ccommitted by the local store managers, employed by the [(codefendant] store-operating corporations,\u201d that there was no evidence that these managers were agents for C.F. Inc. so as to make that corporation hable for their acts, and that the codefendant corporations must each be treated as distinct and separate from C.F. Inc. and each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>other. The issue, of course, is whether there was evidence which, on any theory of law, would warrant the jury in finding C.F. Inc. liable for the conversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">C.F. Inc. thus seeks to have us apply the principle that corporations are generally to be regarded as separate from each other and from their respective stockholders (see <em>Marsch </em>v. <em>Southern New England R.R. </em>230 Mass. 483, 498) where there is no occasion \u201cto look beyond the corporate form for the purpose of defeating fraud or wrong, or for the remedying of injuries.\u201d See e.g. <em>M. McDonough </em>Corp. v. <em>Connolly, </em>313 Mass. 62, 65-66.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The general principle is not of unlimited application. A corporation or other person controlling a corporation and directing, or participating actively in (see <em>Refrigeration Discount Corp. </em>v. <em>Catino, </em>330 Mass. 230, 234-236), its operations may become subject to civil or criminal liability on principles of agency or of causation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Abbott Engr. Inc. </em>351 Mass. 568, 579-580. See also <em>Rock-Ola Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Music &amp; Television Corp. </em>339 Mass. 416, 422-423. This may sometimes occur where corporations are formed, or availed of, to carry out the objectives and purposes of the corporations or persons controlling them. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Price, </em>340 Mass. 502, 511-512; <em>Centmont Corp. </em>v. <em>Marsch, </em>68 F. 2d 460, 464-465 (1st Cir.), cert. den. 291 U. S. 680. See also <em>Finnish Temperance Soc. Sovittaja </em>v. <em>Finnish Socialistic Publishing Co. </em>238 Mass. 345, 354-356; <em>Henry F. Michell Co. </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, ante, </em>318, 321-322. The circumstances in which one corporation, or a person controlling it, may become hable for the acts or torts of an affiliate or a subsidiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>under common control have been frequently discussed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although common ownership of the stock of two or more corporations together with common management, standing alone, will not give rise to liability on the part of one corporation for the acts of another corporation or its employees, additional facts may be such as to permit the conclusion that an agency or similar relationship exists between the entities. Particularly is this true (a) when there is active and direct participation by the representatives of one corporation, apparently exercising some form of pervasive control, in the activities of another and there is some fraudulent or injurious consequence of the intercor-porate relationship, or (b) when there is a confused intermingling of activity of two or more corporations engaged in a common enterprise with substantial disregard of the separate nature of the corporate entities, or serious ambiguity about the manner and capacity in which the various corporations and their respective representatives are acting. In such circumstances, in imposing liability upon one or more of a group of \u201cclosely identified\u201d corporations, a court \u201cneed not consider with nicety which of them\u201d ought to be held liable for the act of one corporation \u201cfor which the plaintiff deserves payment.\u201d See <em>W. W. Britton Inc. </em>v. <em>S. M. Hill Co. </em>327 Mass. 335, 338-339.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">It may be, as one commentator suggests (see Peairs, Business Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 8-10, esp. at p. 33), that Massachusetts has been somewhat more \u201cstrict\u201d than other jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>in respecting the separate entities of different corporations. Nevertheless, our law concerning disregarding the corporate fiction has been stated, in cases already cited, essentially in the same general terms employed in decisions elsewhere (fn. 7). Where there is common control of a group of separate corporations engaged in a single enterprise, failure (a) to make clear which corporation is taking action in a particular situation and the nature and extent of that action, or (b) to observe with care the formal barriers between the corporations with a proper segregation of their separate businesses (see <em>Acton Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. </em>v. <em>Jared Builders, Inc. </em>368 Mich. 626, 628-630), records, and finances, may warrant some disregard of the separate entities in rare particular situations in order to prevent gross inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">2. On the evidence the jury could reasonably have reached the following conclusions. (a) Haseotes was responsible by an order to the local stores for a high-handed, inexcusable refusal by employees of the various retail stores to return My Bread\u2019s racks to it at the termination of the bread sale arrangement, (b) Although no one of the codefendant operating store corporations was a subsidiary of C.F. Inc. (in the sense that C.F. Inc. owned the whole or a part of its stock), all the defendant corporations (including C.F. Inc.) were under the full stock control of the Haseotes family and were operated as a closely coordinated single enterprise. Haseotes himself could be found to have been a dominant figure in the whole \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d enterprise, (c) The basic common enterprise was the processing, distribution, and sale of milk and dairy products. C.F. Inc., on the evidence, could reasonably be regarded as the principal corporation of the enterprise and the codefendants as its affiliates or satellites so that, when one thought of \u201cCumberland Farms,\u201d one would naturally think of C.F. Inc. (d) Because all the corporations were operated ambiguously from the same headquarters as part of a single enterprise, the jury could reasonably infer that Haseotes, in furtherance of the interests of C.F. Inc. in the distribution of its prod-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>nets, was intervening actively in the conduct of the satellite corporations, (e) Haseotes without (so far as this record shows) clear indication of the capacity in which (and the corporation for which) he was acting, dealt in 1960 with Duchaine of My Bread for \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d in a very confused manner. Although My Bread\u2019s representatives probably knew of the existence of the separate corporations, they might reasonably think (absent a clear indication by Haseotes that he was acting for the retail store corporations and not for C.F. Inc.) that My Bread, with respect to the general wholesale distribution of bread, was dealing with C.F. Inc. That was the corporation which was engaged, for the whole \u201c Cumberland Farms \u201d enterprise, in the general wholesale distribution of milk and other dairy products. It would have been the logical corporation to arrange to purchase bread at wholesale for distribution through the \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d stores, (f) The bill of exceptions reveals no basis for an inference that any of the codefendants was inadequately capitalized, a ground frequently relied upon, when taken with other factors, as permitting disregard of a corporate entity. See e.g. <em>Mull </em>v. <em>Colt Co. Inc. </em>31 F. R. D. 154, 158-166 (S. D. N. Y.). Cf. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>298 Mass. 371, 380-381; <em>Eskimo Pie Corp. </em>v. <em>Whitelawn Dairies, Inc. </em>266 F. Supp. 79, 82 (S. D. N. Y.); <em>Walkovszky </em>v. <em>Carlton, </em>18 N. Y. 2d 414, 420-421.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The jury could properly infer (because of Haseotes\u2019s actions, the general corporate situation, and Haseotes\u2019s failure to dispel ambiguities) that Haseotes in all matters connected with the My Bread arrangement was acting for C.F. Inc. and that the satellite companies in following Haseotes\u2019s orders concerning the bread racks (fn. 2) were caused to act by C.F. Inc. and were acting as its agents. See <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Seaboard Commercial Corp. </em>5 N. J. 28, 33-35. See also <em>Wallach </em>v. <em>Hadley Co. </em>331 Mass. 699, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The jury could reasonably decide that C.F. Inc., through Haseotes, brought about and was liable for the conversions. A directed verdict was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-11\">These racks consisted of a check-out counter on which the store cash register was placed, a gondola, and a bakery rack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\"> Each of the codefendants operated stores in a specified area in Massachusetts or Rhode Island. Each corporation \u201cdesignated its various stores by numbers in a series. Thus, for example, stores operated by Commonwealth Dairy Stores, Inc. each had a store number from 300 to 399 . . These store numbers were used in . . . correspondence between the parties.\u201d From i960 to 1963, C.F. Inc. had a peddler\u2019s license for the sale of milk in the New Bedford area. It owned trucks and delivered milk in 1960 and 1961 in connection with sales of milk to the store operating corporations by the processing plants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> The telephone operator at the consolidated Canton plant usually answered the telephone by saying \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d except when a caller called on a Une for one of the Haseotesjamily\u2019s real estate corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\"> From August, 1960, through September, 1963, My Bread made payments in connection with the sale of its products in \u201cCumberland Farms\u201d dairy stores. From November 29, 1962, to August 10, 1963, some five chechs (totaling $9,477) from My Bread payable to C.F. Inc. were delivered to and cashed by C.F. Inc. These moneys were deposited in C.F. Inc.\u2019s account and then were withdrawn and applied to the appropriate store operating corporation account. On other occasions, My Bread checks were made payable to the various codefendant corporations by name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> See also <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>298 Mass. 371, 379-382; <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Brockton Natl.
