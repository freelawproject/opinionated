L. c. 265, \u00a7 26) and armed robbery (c. 265, \u00a7 17). The cases have been reported for the determination of certain questions of law (see c. 278, \u00a7 30A) by a Superior Court judge upon a statement of facts, assented to by the district attorney and by counsel for each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">William Fergnani was allegedly robbed and kidnapped on October 30, 1964, at his place of business in Tyngsborough. He was taken by his captors to a gravel pit where he was left. The defendants were arrested on November 9, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">A hearing on the issue of probable cause was held in the District Court of Lowell on November 16, 1964. Each defendant there was represented by an experienced attorney. Fergnani was sworn. He was questioned by an assistant district attorney. Counsel for each defendant cross-examined Fergnani at length. His testimony, if believed, would warrant the conclusion that he had been the victim of physical attack, violent robbery, and abduction in exceedingly disagreeable circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">A transcript of Fergnani\u2019s testimony (reproduced in the record) was prepared by a \u201cregular and duly authorized court stenographer\u201d retained by the defendants. The stenographer was not \u201cspecifically\u201d sworn before or during the District Court hearing. There is no contention that the transcript is not full and complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The defendants were bound over to the grand jury. Indictments were returned on December 3, 1964. Each defendant has filed a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">The Commonwealth moved for trial of the indictments after Fergnani\u2019s death on May 20, 1965. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>asked postponement so that certain questions of law, concerning the possible use at the trial of Fergnani\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing, might be reported to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">1. Fergnani\u2019s testimony was taken at a full hearing of the charges against these defendants (later also made in the pending indictments) at which each defendant was given a complete, adequate opportunity to cross-examine. In view of Fergnani\u2019s unavailability, his testimony at the prior proceeding is admissible at the defendants\u2019 trial under general principles of the law of evidence, if the former testimony can be reproduced with substantial completeness and accuracy. No violation of the defendants\u2019 constitutional right of confrontation will be involved. The relevant principles were fully discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>275 Mass. 320, 328-334, in holding admissible at a second trial evidence given at a former trial where the witness had disappeared between the first trial and the later trial. These principles were applied in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caruso, </em>251 Mass. 362, 366-367, to admit at the trial of a murder indictment the testimony, stenographically recorded, of a medical examiner at a probable cause hearing (see original record in that case, p. 79) in the District Court, where the medical examiner had died before the trial in the Superior Court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>18 Pick. 434, 437-440. <em>Ibanez </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>222 Mass. 129, 130; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 F. 2d 133, 134 (6th Cir. \u2014 testimony of witness before United States Commissioner at prehminary hearing admitted where witness died prior to trial), cert. den. 269 U. S. 552; <em>Coppedge </em>v. <em>United States, </em>311 F. 2d 128, 132 (Ct. App. D. C. \u2014 testimony at former trial); Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 1370, 1375, 1395-1403; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 230-238; note, 75 Yale L. J. 1434. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>14 Gray, 402, 404-405; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerrigan, </em>349 Mass. 295, 299-303; <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>349 F. 2d 720, 770-771 (2d Cir.); annotations, 79 A. L. R. 1392, 122 A. L. R. 425, 159 A. L. R. 1240, and 45 A. L. R. 2d 1354. Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, </em>106 F. 2d 726, 728 (4th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Nothing in <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U. S. 400, 407, leads to a different result. In that case, two persons charged with crime, both laymen, had not been represented by counsel at the earlier hearing, the transcript of which was offered in evidence at their trial. Thus, at the earlier hearing, the evidence offered \u201chad not been taken at a time and . . . [in] circumstances affording . . . [the defendants] through counsel an adequate opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d It was pointed out (p. 407), \u201cThe case . . . would be quite a different one had Phillips\u2019 statement been taken at a full-fledged hearing at which . . . [the defendants] had been represented by counsel who had been given a complete and adequate opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d See <em>Motes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>178 U. S. 458, 474; <em>Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Aquino, </em>378 F. 2d 540, 547-551 (3d Cir.), esp. at pp. 547-548. See also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>California, </em>364 F. 2d 522, 523 (9th Cir. \u2014 testimony at preliminary hearing); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>365 F. 2d 308, 310 (9th Cir. \u2014 testimony at preliminary hearing). Cf. <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>364 F. 2d 618, 622-624 (5th Cir.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We perceive nothing in G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 30 (concerning binding \u201cover for trial in the superior court\u201d persons charged with offences not within the final jurisdiction of the District Court), which precludes use at the defendants\u2019 trial of Fergnani\u2019s testimony in the District Court. The testimony at the District Court hearing was on issues not in any substantial sense different from those which will arise at trial. To bind the defendants over, the District Court had to find that they \u201cappear to be guilty of [the] crimes\u201d for which they later will or may be tried in the Superior Court. It is not material that, as a matter of tactics, the defendants (4) may not have wished to cross-examine at the probable cause hearing in a manner which would have revealed their proposed defences or their trial strategy, or (2) preferred to conduct some cross-examina-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tian for the first time at trial. If they failed to cross-examine any witness fully at the probable cause hearing, they necessarily assumed the risk that the witness would die or become unavailable before trial, so that his initial testimony could be admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">2. There is no merit in the contention that the transcript of Fergnani\u2019s testimony, given in open court at the probable cause hearing, constituted privileged \u201cwork product\u201d of the defendants\u2019 attorneys within the principles declared in <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 U. S. 495, 504-514. The transcript merely recorded what a complaining witness testified in open court. His testimony is material and significant. It is in no real sense the result of work by the defendants\u2019 attorneys. No privilege is to be given to this material merely because the attorneys did obtain the stenographer and ask some questions at a hearing at which Fergnani could have been compelled to testify. <em>Stimpert </em>v. <em>Abdnour, </em>24 Ill. 2d 26, 28-32. See <em>McGill </em>v. <em>Illinois Power Co. Inc. </em>18 Ill. 2d 242, 246-247.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">3. It is of no significance that the stenographer was not sworn at the probable cause hearing. The stenographer and any other person then present may testify about what was said at the earlier hearing, if the trial judge determines that, through the witness, \u201cthe former [here Fergnani\u2019s] testimony can be substantially reproduced in all material particulars,\u201d and that the witness is now unavailable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glassman, </em>253 Mass. 65, 74-75. See <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>204 Mass. 181, 189-190; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Peerless Motor Car Co. </em>212 Mass. 352, 385-386. Any competent witness may refresh his memory from his notes or other documents or he may produce a reliable record of his past recollection. See <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Swartz, </em>333 Mass. 265, 267-271; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>351 Mass. 522, 534, cert. den. 389 U. S. 991; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>352 Mass. 636, 642-643.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">4. In the light of what has been said, the questions raised by the report are answered: (1) Fergnani\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing as recorded by the stenographer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>may be received at the trial of the indictments. (2) The stenographer\u2019s transcript is not attorneys\u2019 \u201cwork product.\u201d (3) It is of no significance that the stenographer was not sworn in the District Court hearing. (4) There will be no improper denial of the right of confrontation if Fergnani\u2019s testimony at the probable cause hearing is admitted. (5) and (6) The testimony of police officers concerning the earlier testimony may be received in accordance with principles stated in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\"> We do not view G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 91B, inserted by St. 1965, c. 585, as making such transcripts inadmissible if, under common law principles, they could be admitted apart from G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 80, as an exception to the hearsay rule^or otherwise. See McCormick, Evidence/ \u00a7 230, fn. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
