L. c. 156B, \u00a7 91. The defendant filed a demurrer and a plea in abatement. The plaintiffs appealed from a final decree sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend denied, sustaining the plea in abatement, and dismissing the bill. They also filed exceptions to (1) the sustaining of the demurrer with leave to amend denied; (2) the sustaining of the defendant\u2019s plea in abatement; and (3) an order that the copy of the charter of incorporation \u201cbe marked as an exhibit, but only as it applied to the [p]lea in [abatement and in no way to apply to the [d[|emurrer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We summarize the material allegations of the bill. The defendant is a Massachusetts corporation organized under c. 115 of the Public Statutes, as amended. The plaintiffs are stockholders of record of the defendant. The defendant is the owner of record of 92.658 acres of land with the buildings thereon, all of which are used to maintain a golf course, clubhouse building and several other accessory uses. At a special stockholders\u2019 meeting, 219 of the 296 stockholders of record voted to sell all of the land and buildings and the plaintiffs voted against the \u201cproposed action.\u201d After the votes had been cast the president of the defendant corporation \u201cdeclared that more than the required two-thirds of those entitled to vote having voted in favor of the said sale, the same was thereby authorized and became effective.\u201d Subsequently, the plaintiffs demanded \u201cpayment to each of them of the fair value of their respective stock ... as provided\u201d by G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 89. The \u201cdefendant has not reached an agreement with and has failed to pay to each [plaintiff the fair value of his respective stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendant demurred to the bill on several grounds. In its brief it relies on two of them: (1) \u201cThat it appears from the plaintiffs\u2019 Bill that the suit is brought pursuant to the provisions of Section 91 of Chapter 156B but that the defendant is a Massachusetts corporation incorporated on January 20, 1899 under Chapter 115 of the Public Statutes as amended, and therefore the provisions of Chapter 156B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>are not applicable to this defendant,\u201d and (2) \u201cThat it does not appear from the plaintiffs\u2019 Bill that the sale of the defendant\u2019s assets concerning which a vote was taken and against which the plaintiffs voted has in fact taken place, and, therefore, this suit does not he under Chapter 156B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We deal with the latter ground first, since it is dispositive, for \u201c[i]f any ground is good the demurrer should be sustained.\u201d <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>347 Mass. 21, 22. <em>Silverman\u2019s Liquor Mart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. for Boston, </em>348 Mass. 524, 528. General Laws c. 156B, \u00a7 76, reads in pertinent part: \u201cA stockholder in any corporation which shall have voted to sell ... all or substantially all its property and assets . . . who objects to such action . . . shall be entitled, if such sale . . . shall have been consummated . . ., to demand payment for his stock from the corporation . . ..\u201d The plaintiffs allege in their pleadings that after the authorizing vote of the stockholders \u201cthe President thereupon declared\u201d that the sale \u201cwas thereby authorized and became effective.\u201d This merely alleges the authorization by the corporation of the prospective sale. The statute, however, makes such an authorizing vote but one of two prerequisites to relief. The additional requirement is that there must be a consummated sale and no such allegation was made. On this basis, the demurrer to the bill was rightfully sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the judge was in error in \u201cpermitting the defendant to introduce evidence in support of its demurrer and plea in abatement.\u201d Since the failure to allege a consummated sale made the bill demurrable it is unnecessary for us to discuss this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The plaintiffs were denied leave to amend their bill. The denial of leave to amend rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Shubert Holding Co. </em>316 Mass. 470, 477. We cannot say that the judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In view of our holding we need not decide any other issues raised by the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
