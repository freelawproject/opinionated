In the latter reference, defendant Fletcher and defendant Walker will be called collectively the \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">On February 2, 1967, defendant Fletcher was indicted by the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury for robbery of a financial institution, with a count for the unlawful entry. A plea of former jeopardy and motion to quash the indictment were filed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">Also on February 2, 1967, defendant Fletcher and defendant Walker were jointly indicted for robbery of a financial institution, with a count for the unlawful entry. Pleas of double jeopardy and motions to quash the indictment were filed by both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">The trial court considered the pleas well taken, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>motions to quash each of the indictments were sustained with a supporting opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The State appeals in both instances, as it may, under the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Heaton </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 65, 72, where Sections 2945.-67 to 2945.70, Revised Code, were held \u201cconstitutionally inoperative to permit an \u2018appeal\u2019 in a criminal case on behalf of the prosecutor from any judgment of a trial court <em>not included within the exceptions </em>enumerated in Section 2945.70, Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">These appeals will lie because the enumerated exceptions include \u201ca motion to quash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The appeals were argued together and, because of common issues, are considered together and decided together. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">17.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The State indictments rest on the same claimed criminal acts which supported charges pressed to a conclusion against the present defendants in the federal jurisdiction for the Northern District of Ohio. Each defendant acquired his status as an Ohio defendant solely because his actions took place where two levels of government were operative, <em>i. e., </em>federal and state. Neither defendant has been tried on the merits in the Ohio system. A description of the federal proceedings follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">On January 27, 1967, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Michael Fletcher, </em>defendant Fletcher was charged by information on two counts for violations of Title 18, Section 2113(a) and (c), U. S. Code. In essence, the two counts charged (1) the armed robbery of a savings and loan association whose deposits were insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the receipt and conceal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ment of money stolen from a bank whose deposits were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant Fletcher plead guilty to the federal counts on January 26, 1967, and was sentenced to fifteen years on the first count and ten years on the second \u2014 the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">On February 8, 1967, in <em>United States </em>v <em>Willie Walker, </em>defendant Walker was charged by the indictment of a federal grand jury with the violation of Title 18, Section 2113(a), U. S. Code. In fine, the charge was armed robbery of a bank whose deposits were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant Walker was found not guilty and an order dismissing the indictment against him was entered on May 1, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The stance of the facts raises the question of double jeopardy in three aspects \u2014 where there have been federal prosecutions resulting in acquittals, convictions or pleas of guilty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">1. Does the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which inhibits successive prosecutions in the federal jurisdiction for the same act, apply to the states through the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">2. If 1. is answered \u201cYes,\u201d does the prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>against state action block successive prosecutions in the <em>state </em>jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">3. Apart from impediments in the United States Constitution, does Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution prohibit second state prosecutions in Ohio for the claimed criminal acts which induced the prior prosecutions in the federal jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">There is a deceptive simplicity about the general proposition that no man shall be twice in jeopardy in a criminal case. Therefore, to circumscribe that deception we confine ourselves to the questions formulated earlier in this opinion. This limitation avoids some very difficult problems which, if not central to the successive prosecution issue, are so related to it as to warrant a clear disclaimer. We do disclaim any intimation of opinion with respect to such problems as multiple prosecutions where there are multiple victims of a single criminal act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or multiple crimes flowing from an act affecting a single victim,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or splitting causes or collateral estoppel, or when jeopardy has attached to prevent retrial following discharge of a jury or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>other issues not encompassed in the questions stated in HI. Such problems may generate constitutional questions of due process quite apart from, or interwined with, double jeopardy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> depending on the factual situation. In any event, those questions are not before us now for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Confining our rule to those successive prosecutions whose succession would not be but for the circumstance of federalism in our scheme of government, we avoid deciding what is not before us and at the same time essay decision on a problem much more manageable because restricted in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>V.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The first question posed in III has been answered recently by the Supreme Court of the United States and is no longer in doubt. The double jeopardy stricture of the Fifth Amendment does apply to the states through the providence of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1969), 395 U. S. 784, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Since the <em>Benton case </em>reversed a conviction for larceny on a second trial following an earlier acquittal in the same state, it does not reach the question whether the federal proscription against double jeopardy prevents a state prosecution following a federal acquittal or conviction where the only distinction of consequence between the two prosecutions is the source of the prosecuting initiative. Nonetheless, <em>Benton </em>casts a long shadow that makes it necessary to say that the resolution of the second question is in little doubt. That conclusion is supported in part by an analysis of two <em>cases </em>\u2014 Barthus v. <em>Illinois </em>(1959), 359 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>121, 3 L. Ed. 2d 684, and <em>Abbate </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959), 359 U. S. 187, 3 L. Ed. 2d 729, and in a larger proportion by the inferences to be drawn from <em>Benton, </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Before <em>Benton, </em>a strong, although not necessarily conclusive,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> case could be made for the proposition that <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, id., </em>held definitively that an acquittal on a federal charge did not foreclose an indictment and conviction for the same acts in a state jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In <em>Bartkus, </em>the petitioner was first acquitted on a bank robbery charge in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and then convicted under the Illinois robbery statute on an indictment reciting facts substantially identical to the facts in the prior federal indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States, invoking an elaborate history to support the proposition that the federal bill of rights was not intended to apply to the states through a shorthand labeled \u201cDue Process,\u201d <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>(359 U. S. at 124-136, 3 L. Ed. 2d at 687-694),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> sustained the state conviction but paid its respects to the \u201cdouble sovereignty\u201d issue<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by noting that the same his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tory, reflected and confirmed in judicial precedent, revealed that the widely followed practice was to allow second prosecutions \u2018 \u2018 even though there had been a prior trial by another government.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The majority declined to interpose the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to bar a second prosecution in \u201cdisregard of a long, unbroken, unquestioned course of impressive adjudication\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and assigned an additional \u201cpractical justification\u201d in support of the declination. The justification was that a rule refusing to bar a second prosecution would prevent displacement of the states\u2019 reserve power to act, thus preventing federal action involving a relatively minor penalty from blocking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>state action to prosecute a much more serious offense rising from the same facts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The \u201cno bar\u201d conclusion in <em>Barthus, </em>Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, was supported alike by \u201c [Precedent, experience and reason.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Whatever the uses of history, they provide neither a mechanistic nor universal standard for the application of law. Least of all do they provide an excuse for ignoring the implications of a recent instruction from the highest court in the land. In deciding <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>Mr. Justice Marshall said, for the majority, that the prohibition against double jeopardy in the Fifth Amendment applied to the states through the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It was, he declared, \u201cLike the right to trial by Jury * * * clearly \u2018fundamental to the American scheme of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Double jeopardy could hardly have been characterized otherwise. For if the right to counsel, <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U. S. 335, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799, and self-incrimination, <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 1, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Water Front Commission of New York Harbor </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 52, 12 L. Ed. 2d 678, are examples of fundamentals, <em>a fortiori </em>double jeopardy is. Moreover, the <em>Benton </em>majority noted a recent tendency of the Court, crucial here, \u201c \u2018increasingly * * * [to look] to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law.\u2019 \u201d 395 U. S. at 794, 23 L. Ed 2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">With this teaching in hand, and recognizing the degree of reliance in <em>Bartkus </em>on precedents and concepts now weakened, if not repudiated, we conclude that the rule of <em>Bartkus </em>is so enfeebled<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as to lack all binding force.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The effects are several. <em>Bartkus </em>and cases of the same genns may he eliminated from further consideration. Therefore, whatever support by projection or analogy <em>Bartkus </em>lent <em>Abbate </em>is gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">However, the present cases involve second jeopardies in a state jurisdiction after (1) federal acquittal and (2) a federal plea of guilty. And the <em>Benton </em>rule, limited by the facts of that case (successive prosecutions in the same state jurisdiction), reaches only by implication the issue of prior jeopardy in one jurisdiction as a bar to a later prosecution in a second jurisdiction. Nonetheless, that implication clouds <em>Abbate </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959), 359 U. S. 187, 3 L. Ed. 2d 729, which, before <em>Benton, </em>might have been thought dispositive, by analogy, of the dual sovereignty-successive jeopardy issue because it held that an Illinois conviction did not bar further prosecution and conviction on federal charges growing out of the same acts. But, <em>Abbate, </em>even without <em>Benton, </em>is susceptible to the interpretation that in it the Supreme Court was merely fashioning a rule to protect the jurisdiction of the federal courts, thus exposing a concern<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which reveals the obverse side of that sensitivity to federal-state relationships which found expression in Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s feeling for states\u2019 rights in <em>Bartkus. </em>In this view, the <em>Ab-bate </em>response represents only the Court\u2019s reaction to its supervisory responsibility for the federal court system. See <em>Rea </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1956), 350 U. S. 214, 216-217, 100 L. Ed. 233, 236-237. Certainly, the principle of <em>Abbate </em>mounts no constitutional mandate binding state courts <em>not </em>to treat a prior federal jeopardy as a bar to subsequent criminal proceedings by the states. Indeed, a close reading of both <em>Abbate </em>and <em>Benton </em>shows state courts to be unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>structed on the issue except by projection from <em>Benton. </em>While the idea that the prohibition against double jeopardy is \u201c \u2018fundamental to the American scheme of justice\u2019 \u201d hardly presages a narrow future view of the constitutional scope of the double jeopardy clause, it is less than an explicit directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Were we required to estimate the implications of <em>Benton </em>for the future, our estimate would be that the Supreme Court of the United States will eventually hold it constitutionally requisite that state courts find prior federal jeopardy a bar to state prosecutions for the same act. Without extensive analysis, we note that every justification advanced in <em>Benton </em>to support the ending of \u201cstate on state\u201d jeopardy applies with equal force to successive jeopardies where the singular distinction between the causes stems from the jurisdiction in which the first action is begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Only the \u201cdual sovereignty\u201d idea, an abstraction,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> can be advanced to excuse federal after state or state after federal prosecutions. If it be thought that sovereignty insulates and protects successive prosecutions, it is most significant that an extinction of part of state sovereignty (the incorporation of the federal double jeopardy clause into strictures against state action imposed by Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment) was utilized in <em>Benton </em>to accomplish the result in that case. In addition, it is of the utmost relevance to a forecast of future constitutional development that, although <em>Benton </em>did not overrule <em>Barthus </em>specifically, it did overrule <em>Palho, </em>a major underpinning of <em>Barthus, </em>to the extent inconsistent with the <em>Benton </em>rule. (See footnote 18, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">No doubt there are values in the offsetting of powers and the decentralization of government, which double so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>vereignty effects. But we are considering sovereignty in the <em>United </em>States and not the <em>Balkan </em>states.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And it is more than doubtful that the Supreme Court of this united country will hold, or should hold, that one of the blessings of freedom insured by the balancing of state and federal power is a permissible form of double jeopardy protected by federalism. Cf. Frankfurter, J., in <em>Bartkus, id. </em>at 137, 3 L. Ed. 2d at 695:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201c* * * the men who wrote the Constitution <em>* </em>* * were fearful of the power of centralized government and sought to limit its power.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">A definitive conclusion, however, must await the case which puts the double jeopardy question as defined by the present facts squarely before the Supreme Court of the United States. Meanwhile, we are faced with the necessity for deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">From what has been said it is apparent that <em>Abbate </em>and <em>Bartkus </em>leave this court unrestrained in the application of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth. Amendment. Under the command of that clause, and the compulsion of our duty to uphold the United States Constitution, we conclude that it is incompatible with fundamental justice that a person who has been charged with crime be exposed to jeopardy for the same act first in the federal system and then a second time in the courts of this state. This is so whether \u201cDue Process\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment or not. For the double menace from the single act is \u2018 \u2018 repugnant to the conscience of man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>kind.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra, </em>at 323. Surely, if that fairness, which is the essence of dne process, is to he more than an nnfonnded hope, one of its ingredients must be the assurance that one charged with crime hazards liberty or life but once for the same misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">A justification for a quickened conscience on this question came on review of a second prosecution <em>after an acquittal </em>in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1957), 355 U. S. 184, 187-188, 2 L. Ed. 2d 199, 204. The reasons can hardly be stated better:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\"><em>\u201c* * * </em>the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to mate repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>pelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The rationale of the <em>Green case </em>does not lose power <em>after a </em>conviction.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The imperatives of Due Process placed upon us by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution require that the second question in III be answered \u201cYes\u201d and that the judgment of the trial court be affirmed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">FI.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">There remains the question whether, apart from federal constitutional issues, Section 10, Article I of the Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Constitution prohibits the state prosecutions now before this court because of prior jeopardies incurred in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for the same acts.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For all practical purposes, this is a case of first impression in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It is true that in <em>Koch </em>v. <em>State </em>(1895), 53 Ohio St. 433, the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed a lower court which had sustained a demurrer to a plea in bar entered to an Ohio prosecution instituted under a statute for the \u201csame act\u201d which supported a previous conviction in the Akron May- or\u2019s court. But that decision involved no analysis of the problem. The total opinion was but eleven lines long and the decisional portion but one sentence. In any event, the case did not involve dual sovereignty and preceded <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>by approximately 75 years. While principles do not necessarily degenerate with age, it seems more than probable that <em>Koch </em>would not survive in the judicial climate which produced <em>Benton, </em>nor even that which produced <em>State </em>v. <em>Shimman </em>(1930), 122 Ohio St. 522.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In <em>SMmman, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio indicated approval of the proposition \u201cthat prosecution and punishment under one sovereignty does not place the defendant in double jeopardy when prosecuted in the other\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 525). This idea was carried into the first paragraph of the syllabus. However, the court said in a later ease:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201cThe syllabus of a decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio states the law of Ohio, but such pronouncement must be interpreted with reference to the facts upon which it is predicated and the questions presented to and considered by the Court.\u201d <em>Williamson Heater Co. </em>v. <em>Radich </em>(1934) 128 Ohio St. 124, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In the light of the <em>Shimman </em>syllabus, it is significant that in the text of the unanimous opinion in <em>Badich </em>the court said, at 126:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">\u201c* * * It [the syllabus] cannot be construed as being any broader than [the] * * * facts warrant. When <em>obiter </em>creeps into a syllabus it must be so recognized and so considered. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The facts in <em>Shimman </em>reveal that <em>obiter </em>did creep in. For that case involved successive prosecutions in separate Ohio counties for violations arising out of the transportation of liquor in one continuous, uninterrupted transaction from Huron County into Sandusky County, all within the state of Ohio. On this state of the facts, the majority in <em>Shimman </em>found a plea in bar well taken on the ground that a single transaction was involved in the continuous transport, and that a second prosecution would place the defendant twice in jeopardy.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Thus, it is apparent that the case did not involve two sovereignties and did not reach the issue now before this court and is not, therefore, a binding precedent on that issue. Beyond this, the constitutional development of the past four decades in the United States is of such dimension that it cannot be assumed that the <em>dictum </em>in <em>Shimman </em>provides an accurate guage of the present view of the Supreme Court of Ohio on the law of double jeopardy. It follows that the issue presently before us falls in virtually uncharted Ohio territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">This does not mean that there are no benchmarks. The Ohio Constitution provides them. To hold that Ohio will allow prosecutions here after a federal jeopardy for the identical acts is to embrace a system of constitutional duality which enables the state to pursue, indeed to hound, a man who either has been found innocent or paid in the coin of another sovereignty for his dereliction.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">To harass the innocent, the acquitted, or the guilty who have paid for their miscreance, is not compatible with constitutionally legitimate state action. For on the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>it, it is at just such harassment that the injunction of Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution is aimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">\u201cNo person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">That simple, broad, unqualified statement sets out the constitutional policy of Ohio on the issue. The evils that policy was meant to proscribe are not improved because the state and federal sovereignties combine to generate them. It would be incongruous to allow a basic constitutional policy of a state, determined as an aspect of its sovereignty, to be frustrated by a consequence of the duality which allows that sovereignty to exist.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Furthermore, it would be both inconsistent and ironic to use that federalism, which is justified in the name of protecting freedom, to obliterate a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">No interest of the state remains unvindicated after one fair test of guilt. The development of federal constitutional law may eventually impose upon the states<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the rule we now apply. Whether this development eventually takes place or not, the time has come to plainly say on behalf of Ohio, as the Supreme Court of Ohio said in a civil matter: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of justice as to all parties concerned.\u201d <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Beckwith </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 348, at 352.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cA decided cause is worth as much as it weighs in reason and righteousness, and no more.

This becomes especially clear when it is considered that to hold otherwise is to require these defendants to either prove twice or pay twice to expiate the same offenses for the sole reason that the acts complained of took place where two layers of government fortuitously coincide.

It may be an obvious point, but we note also that whether a defendant plead guilty or was found guilty does not affect the issues in the <em>Fletcher case. </em>Having plead guilty in federal court, defendant Fletcher would have special problems in a second trial in a state court.

On a subsequent indictment for the robbery of a fourth person during the same incident the defendant was convicted. A majority of the court upheld the conviction against a claim of double jeopardy. In <em>Ciucci </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1958), 356 U. S. 571, 2 L.

According to scholarly commentators, the English rule, contrary to the court\u2019s view, seems to be well settled, at least against permitting second prosecutions after acquittals <em>merely </em>because the second effort began under the auspices of a different territorial sovereignty. See Friedland, <em>supra, </em>12, 364. And cf. Grant, <em>Successive Prosecutions by State and </em>Nation: <em>Common Law and British Empire Comparisons, </em>4 U. C. L. A.

For, although <em>Lanza </em>supports dual sovereignty, successive prosecutions, it relies in turn on the <em>dicta </em>in some of eleven Supreme Court precedents, in none of which is the dual sovereignty successive prosecution doctrine essential to decision, see Appendix B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Using <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States (1945), </em>325 U. S. 91, 89 L. Ed. 1495, as an example, the majority pointed out that the federal prosecutions in that case resulted in convictions with one and two year penalties for a crime which was a capital offense under state law. A Georgia sheriff, a special deputy and a policeman beat to death a young negro as he alighted from the car which took him to the courthouse. He was charged with stealing a tire. The beating, administered by using a solid bar blackjack and fists, continued for fifteen to thirty minutes after the decedent was knocked to the ground still handcuffed. The claimed provocation was decedent\u2019s reach for a gun and insulting language. <em>Id. </em>at 92-94, 89 L. Ed. at 1497-1498. The <em>Screws case </em>reversed and (impliedly) remanded for a new trial for the trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury on the question of intent. Construing \u201cwillfully\u201d in Section 20 of the Federal Criminal Code (Title 18 U. S. Code, Sec. 52) as tantamount to \u201cspecific intent,\u201d the court saved the section from a charge of unconstitutionality for vagueness. <em>Id. </em>at 100-107, 89 L. Ed. at 1502-1506. Consistently with his thesis in <em>Barthus, </em>Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting in <em>Screws, </em>maintained, among other things, that the practical consequence of the latter decision was the <em>relaxation </em>of state responsibility for homicide \u201cby allowing prosecutions in the federal courts for a relatively minor offense carrying a short sentence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 139, 89 L. Ed. at 1523. The dissent does not contend that a federal conviction in <em>Screws </em>would prevent a state prosecution, for the very good reason that the law would not support such a conclusion <em>at the time </em>that case was decided. That Georgia was \u201clax\u201d in enforcement may be inferred only from the single reference in the dissent to the actual posture of state enforcement. This reference indicates that the Solicitor General of the Albany Circuit for the State of Georgia testified in the federal trial that no complaint had been filed in connection with the prisoner\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 160, 89 L.

A recent volume notes that the principle was not unknown to the Greeks and Romans and that the Digest of Justinian contained the precept that \u201cthe governor should not permit the same person to be again accused of a crime of which he had been acquitted.\u201d J. Sigler, <em>Double Jeopardy, </em>Cornell Univ. Press, Ithaca, N. Y. (1969), at p. 2. See Black, J., dissenting in <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>359 U. S. at pp. 151-155, 3 L. Ed. at 706-707. Some students of the problem suggest that a stricture against double jeopardy may be exemplified in the Old Testament by I Nahum 9:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cHe will make a full end; He will not take vengeance twice on his foes.\u201d (Revised Standard Version, 1952.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In context the quotation bears the interpretation that after one round of the Lord\u2019s vengeance there is nothing left for a second. This fits more easily than does a conclusion of heavenly sensitivity to the legal problem involved in double jeopardy. The current state of conscience on this subject is reflected in the fact that by 1961 all but five states had double jeopardy prohibitions in their constitutions. See the list in <em>Note, Double Jeopardy and the Problem of Successive Prosecutions: A Suggested Solution, </em>34 So. Cal. Law Rev. 252, 253 (1961) (the remaining five have common-law inhibitions. <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, id. </em>fn. 9), and by the number of states which have taken legislative action to bar \u201cdual sovereigney\u201d double jeopardy. See fn. 13, <em>supra, </em>and Appendix A. In mid-nineteenth century, dissenting in <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1847), 46 U. S. (5 How.) 410, 440, 12 L.

L. Friedland, <em>Double Jeopardy, </em>3-5, Oxford University Press, London (1969). See also, Sigler, <em>ibid, </em>Chap. 5, <em>The Policy Issue: The Power of the Prosecutor\u201d, </em>and cf. Pontikes, <em>Dual Sovereignty and Double Jeopardy: A Critique of Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois and Abbate </em>v. <em>United States, </em>14 Western Res. Law Rev. 700, 713 (1963), to the effect that multiple punishments consequent upon multiple prosecutions may threaten the standardization implicit in the rule of law and, therefore, the rule of law itself. For another aspect, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer </em>(1916), 242 U. S. 85, 87, 61 L. Ed. 161, 164, where the full court affirmed the quashing of a second criminal indictment on a charge previously held to be barred by the statute of limitations. Refusing to confine <em>res judicata </em>in criminal cases to that more narrow area occupied by the Fifth Amendment provision against double jeopardy, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">\u00ab* * * n cannot be that the safeguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn reverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Whether the second jeopardy follows an acquittal, a plea of guilty or a conviction makes little or no legal difference to the rationale against it. The sweeping language in the <em>Green case, supra, </em>is not confined to second prosecutions after an acquittal. It is only a literal reading of the facts which narrows the sweep. Moreover, a second state prosecution under any of the three circumstances may raise serious Eighth Amendment considerations. For the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is now applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. See, <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California </em>(1962), 370 U. S. 660, 8 L.

Some statutes raise the bar when a \u201cconviction or acquittal\u201d is \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of another state, territory, or country,\u201d Bobbs-Merrill, <em>Idaho Code, </em>Title 19, Section 19-315 (1948); Burns, <em>Indiana Stat., </em>Title 9, Section 9-215 (1956); McKinney\u2019s, <em>Consolidated Laws of New York, Code of Criminal Proc., </em>Title 1, Section 139 (1958); <em>Oregon Revised Statutes, </em>Chapter 131, Section 131.240 (1) (1968); the bar arises upon a conviction or acquittal under a statutory provision of the state or \u201cthe laws of another jurisdiction\u201d in Wisconsin, <em>Wisconsin Statutes, </em>Section 939.74 (1967); \u201cUnder the laws of the United States, or of another state or country\u201d in Arizona, West, <em>Arizona Revised Statutes, </em>Title 13, Section 13-146 (1956); \u201cunder the laws of [another] state or country\u201d in Nevada, 6 <em>Nevada Revised Statutes, </em>Chapter 208, Section 208.020 (1967), and in Washington, 2 <em>Revised Code of Washington, </em>Chapter 10.43, Section 10.43.040 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Illinois has a lengthy enactment <em>on </em>the subject of the \u201cEffect of Former Prosecution.\u201d The portion relevant to the <em>Bartkus </em>problem, had it been on the books when Bartkus was tried, would have provided a complete defense. The applicable portion, Smith-Hurd, <em>Illinois Statutes, </em>Chapter 38, Sections 3-4 (1964), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201c(c) A prosecution is barred if the defendant was formerly prosecuted in a District Court of the United States or in a sister State for an offense which is within the concurrent jurisdiction of this State, if such former prosecution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201c(1) Resulted in either a conviction or an acquittal, and the subsequent prosecution is for the same conduct, unless each prosecution requires proof of a fact not required in the other prosecution, or the offense was not consummated when the former trial began; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201c(2) Was terminated by a final order or judgment, even if entered before trial, which required a determination inconsistent with any fact necessary to a conviction in the prosecution in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae\">For an example of a federal statute prohibiting successive prosecutions in federal court following a State conviction or acquittal but disavowing an intent to pre-empt the field, see Title 18, Section 2117, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>U.
