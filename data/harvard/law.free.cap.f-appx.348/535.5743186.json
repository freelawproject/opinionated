Osborne appeals <em>pro se </em>the summary judgment against Osborne\u2019s complaint that his civil rights were violated in the events that led to his arrest and prosecution in a Georgia court for criminal trespass. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest Osborne. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">Phillip Antonio Paul, a security officer for American Multi Cinema and an officer of the Sheriff\u2019s Department of Cobb County, Georgia, noticed Osborne combing the lobby and hallways of the theater. Paul watched Osborne select patrons and employees of the theater, primarily women, to approach, after which he would \u201cblatantly stare at them.\u201d Paul confronted Osborne and questioned him about his conduct. When Osborne stated that he did not have a movie ticket, Paul told Osborne to leave the theater. Paul warned Osborne that if he did \u201ccome back and continue with [his] actions, [he] [would] be charged with criminal trespass.\u201d An employee of the theater later told Paul that Osborne had grabbed her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Osborne returned to American Cinema the next day, purchased a ticket, and asked to speak with a manager about his conversation with Paul. Osborne eventually spoke with security officer Jeremy Gibson. Gibson called Paul to inquire about his conversation with Osborne. Paul told Gibson about Osborne\u2019s odd behavior and that Paul had banned Osborne from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Gibson arrested Osborne and issued a written warning stating that Osborne was \u201cforbidden to return\u201d to the theater. Osborne was charged in a Georgia court for criminal trespass and obstruction of justice. A jury convicted Osborne of criminal trespass and acquitted him of obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">A Georgia appeals court reversed Osborne\u2019s conviction on the ground that he did not receive notice as required by state statute before he was arrested for criminal trespass. <em>Osborne v. State, </em>290 Ga.App. 188, 189-90, 665 S.E.2d 1, 2 (2008). The statute required that, to prosecute for criminal trespass, the trespasser must receive notice from \u201cthe owner, rightful occupant\u201d or an \u201cauthorized representative of the owner or rightful occupant\u201d that he is forbidden to enter the premises, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-21(b)(2), and the evidence established that Paul had not talked to or received permission from the owner or manager of the theater before he banned Osborne from the theater. <em>Osborne, </em>290 Ga.App. at 189-90, 665 S.E.2d at 2. The state court explained that, had Osborne returned to the theater after he received the warning from Gibson, Osborne \u201ccould have been arrested for criminal trespass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 665 S.E.2d at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Osborne filed a complaint in a Georgia court that alleged he had been falsely arrested and maliciously prosecuted in violation of state law by American Cinema, Paul, Gibson, two other employees of American Cinema, and an unnamed insurance company. Osborne alleged that the defendants also had violated his rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and his rights reserved under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. Osborne later moved to amend his complaint to add Cobb County and the State of Georgia as defendants; to withdraw his claims under state law; and to add claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, conspiracy to deprive him of his rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and retaliation for exercising his rights under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">American Cinema, Paul, and Gibson removed the case. Later, American Cinema moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, American Cinema filed a transcript of Osborne\u2019s criminal trial. Osborne objected to the use of the transcript and argued that he had paid a court reporter under a binding contract to record his trial and had exclusive rights to the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The court granted Osborne\u2019s motions to include additional defendants and his complaints about the violation of his civil rights. The district court ruled that no dispute of fact existed about whether Gibson had probable cause to arrest Osborne and that the existence of probable cause precluded relief for Osborne\u2019s complaints of false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution under federal and state law, conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights, and the violation of his rights under the Fust Amendment. The district court ruled, in the alternative, that Osborne failed to state a claim for a violation under the First Amendment because he \u201c[had] identified neither the protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>speech that was suppressed or retaliated against nor the manner in which Defendants supposedly suppressed speech or retaliated against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo. Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.2005). The party that moves for summary judgment must establish that the pleadings and evidence establish there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the district court's admission of evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Deverso, </em>518 F.3d 1250, 1254 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Osborne raises two issues for our review. First, Osborne challenges the summary judgment in favor of the defendants for his complaints of false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, conspiracy, and violation of his rights under the First Amendment. Second, Osborne challenges the use of his state trial transcript by American Multi Cinema. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of American Cinema, Deputy Sheriffs Paul and Gibson, and the State of Georgia. The district court found that Gibson had probable cause to arrest Osborne for criminal trespass and that finding was supported by the record of Osborne\u2019s state criminal proceedings. Gibson reasonably believed that Paul had banned Osborne from the theater and Gibson had probable cause to believe that Osborne, by returning to the theater, had committed criminal trespass. That Osborne\u2019s conviction was later reversed because Paul lacked authority to ban Osborne from the theater does not affect our analysis because \u201c[pjrobable cause does not require the same type of specific evidence of each element of the offense as would be needed to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Holmes v. Kucynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1079 (11th Cir.2003). Osborne argues that the warrant for his arrest was obtained by fraud and his conviction could not provide \u201cconclusive evidence of probable cause,\u201d <em>Condon v. Vickery, </em>270 Ga.App. 322, 324, 606 S.E.2d 336, 339 (2004), but Gibson obtained the warrant after he arrested Osborne and Gibson had probable cause to make the arrest. The existence of probable cause creates an absolute bar to Osborne\u2019s complaints of false arrest and false imprisonment, <em>see Case v. Eslinger, </em>555 F.3d 1317, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Marx v. Gumbinner, </em>905 F.2d 1503, 1506 (11th Cir.1990), and defeats his claims for malicious prosecution, see <em>Kjellsen v. Mills, </em>517 F.3d 1232, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2008), and the violation of his rights under the First Amendment, <em>Dahl v. Holley, </em>312 F.3d 1228, 1236 (11th Cir.2002). As Osborne failed to establish that the defendants violated his constitutional rights, his complaint of conspiracy also fails. <em>Cook v. Randolph County, Ga., </em>573 F.3d 1143, 1153 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Osborne\u2019s trial transcript. Osborne complains that admission of the transcript violated state evi-dentiary rules, but when a district court exercises supplemental jurisdiction over alleged violations of state law, \u201cfederal law governs procedural issues.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). Osborne cites no authority that pi'ecludes admission of the transcript in his federal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The summary judgment against Osborne\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
