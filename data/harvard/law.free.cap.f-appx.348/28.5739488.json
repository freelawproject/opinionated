As a result of that arrest, he was charged with robbery, auto burglary, and kidnapping; he was eventually convicted of robbery. <em>See Burton v. State, </em>914 So.2d 288, 289 (Miss.Ct.App.2005). Burton also complains that his claims were improperly consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to consolidate the matters. <em>See Green v. Polunsky, </em>229 F.3d 486, 488 (5th Cir.2000). With respect to the merits, the district court did not err in dismissing Burton\u2019s claims under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Wells v. Banner, </em>45 F.3d 90, 95 (5th Cir.1995). As Burton\u2019s appeal presents no legal points arguable on their merits, it is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Burton previously accumulated two strikes in the prior \u00a7 1983 action challenging the legality of his arrest. Accordingly, Burton is now barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See\u00a7 </em>1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
