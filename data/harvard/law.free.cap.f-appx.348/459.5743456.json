For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-30\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-31\">Clayton pled guilty in 2007 to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>grams or moi*e of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and (b)(1)(B). In calculating Clayton\u2019s guideline range, the probation officer first determined that Clayton was responsible for at least 20, but less than 35, grams of crack cocaine, thereby giving him a base offense level of 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6). However, the probation officer also determined that Clayton was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Clayton\u2019s status as a career offender gave him a new, superseding offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI. The probation officer awarded Clayton a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, giving him a total offense level of 31, which, when combined with his criminal history category of VI, produced an applicable guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. There were no objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">At sentencing, the government requested the district court to sentence Clayton at the low-end of the guideline range and, in light of Clayton\u2019s substantial assistance, \u201cdepart\u00ed ] downward by 20% from the Guidelines range\u201d to a sentence of 150 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The district court granted both of the government\u2019s requests and accordingly sentenced Clayton to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On March 18, 2008, Clayton, relying on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, submitted a <em>pro se </em>motion for a sentencing reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The government responded that, since Clayton was sentenced as a career offender, Amendment 706 did not affect his applicable guideline and therefore did not entitle him to a sentencing reduction. The district court appointed Clayton an attorney, who countered by emphasizing that, in imposing a sentence below the guideline range, the district court \u201cmade clear that the career offender provisions were not [applicable] to Mr. Clayton\u2019s case.\u201d The district court denied Clayton\u2019s motion, agreeing with the government that, because Clayton was sentenced as a career offender, Amendment 706 \u201cha[d] no bearing on [his] total offense level.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (same). Construing this language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we have held that certain defendants who were sentenced as career offenders were ineligible for a sentencing reduction under Amendment 706 because that amendment would not reduce their applicable guideline ranges. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[Although Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to the defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) (providing for superseding offense levels based on the statutoiy maximum penalty where those levels are \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In this case, Clayton correctly acknowledges that our decision in <em>Moore </em>controls. This is so because Clayton\u2019s offense level was based on his status as a career offender, and, thus, Amendment 706 would not affect his applicable guideline range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Although Clayton contends that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided, we are bound by the panel\u2019s decision in that case unless overruled by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc. United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2825, 174 L.Ed.2d 556 (2009). In this regard, Clayton has abandoned his argument, raised below, that he was not sentenced as a career offender in light of the district court's downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (arguments not raised on appeal are abandoned). Finally, because Clayton is not eligible for a sentencing reduction, the district court had no occasion to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity or the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Clayton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AX2\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
