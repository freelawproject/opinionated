On appeal, Joseph argues that the district court clearly erred in calculating the appropriate amount of loss because it failed to credit the fair market value of collateral property against the calculated amount of loss. Further, he asserts that the district court clearly erred in determining the fair market value of the property by disregarding its appraisal value in favor of the contract sale price. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s loss calculation and <em>de novo </em>whether the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004). A defendant\u2019s failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). Further, a defendant\u2019s affirmative withdrawal of an objection to the PSI at sentencing waives the argument for purposes of appeal. <em>United States v. Horsfall, </em>552 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2034, 173 L.Ed.2d 1120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">For offenses involving fraud, the Guidelines provide for an increase in the defendant\u2019s offense level based on the amount of loss that resulted from the fraud. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). The offense level is increased by eight where the amount of loss is greater than $70,000, but not greater than $120,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E)-(F). \u201cWhen calculating loss for sentencing purposes, the district court looks to the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d <em>United States v. Willis, </em>560 F.3d 1246, 1250 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cIntended loss is the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense and it includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and emphasis omitted). In a case involving collateral, the loss must be reduced by \u201cthe amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral, or if the collateral has not been disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(E)(ii)). A district court\u2019s finding of loss under \u00a7 2B1.1 is entitled to \u201cappropriate deference,\u201d and it may reasonably estimate that amount. <em>Willis, </em>560 F.3d at 1251; <em>United States v. Miller, </em>188 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.1999) (interpreting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, which was incorporated into \u00a7 2B1.1 by amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Joseph waived his argument regarding the district court\u2019s methodology in determining the amount of loss by affirmatively withdrawing the argument before the district court. The district court explained that it calculated the intended loss by subtracting the amount the bank would have loaned based on the contract sale price from the amount of the loan that Joseph attempted to obtain. In response to the district court\u2019s explanation, Joseph indicated that he did not dispute the district court\u2019s methodology in calculating the intended loss, but only the district court\u2019s use of the contract sale price instead of the price from the appraisal as the fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>In determining the fair market value of the property, the contract sale price was a fair estimate of that value based on an aim\u2019s length transaction. Because Joseph failed to show that the bank would have financed a loan based on the value of the property presented in the appraisal rather than the contract sale price, the district court did not clearly err in determining the fair market value of the property. Because the contract sale price was an appropriate estimate of the fair market value of the property and Joseph waived any argument regarding the district court\u2019s methodology in calculating the amount of loss, the district court did not clearly err in determining the amount of loss under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
