Flores-Ordones does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that the notice of the removal hearing was proper because Flores-Ordones was personally served with the notice to appear, which apprised him of the consequences of his failure to appear and the necessity for him to provide a change of address form to the court, that Flores-Ordones failed to provide a new address to the immigration court when he left Texas to move to California, and that the notice of the removal hearing was properly mailed to the Texas address Flores-Or-dones provided to the Government. Accordingly, he has abandoned these issues. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006). Flores-Ordones has also abandoned by failing to adequately brief any argument regarding the service of his notice of hearing. <em>Id. </em>To the extent Flores-Ordones attempts to argue that the failure to receive notice of a removal hearing always entitles him to a rescission of that order, such an argument is foreclosed by <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">Flores-Ordones challenges the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to support his claim that illness prevented him from attending his removal hearing. However, as the BIA concluded, the record does not contain any evidence corroborating Flores-Ordones claim of illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">Flores-Ordones also argues that the Government sent him mixed signals regarding whether the Government would agree not to oppose his motion to reopen. However, he does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that the record does not contain any evidence of an agreement by the Government not to oppose the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen, this court applies a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, regardless of the basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, this court must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision as long as it is not capricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">While questions of law are reviewed de novo, this court accords deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>incorrect. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, meaning that this court may not overturn the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). This court reviews the order of the BIA and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ only if it influenced the determination of the BIA. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Flores-Ordones has not established that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his appeal. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED. Flores-Ordones\u2019s motion to remand is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that litis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
