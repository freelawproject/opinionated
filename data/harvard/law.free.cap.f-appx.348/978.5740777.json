Gomez Lopez argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not give adequate reasons to support its choice of sentence and did not explicitly address his arguments in favor of a lesser sentence. He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Gomez Lopez also argues, for the purpose of preserving the issues for possible Supreme Court review, that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and is penologically flawed and that this court\u2019s ability to review the propriety of his sentence is hampered by the lack of reasons given for the sentence imposed. These arguments are, as he concedes, unavailing under our prior jurisprudence. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 365-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Gomez Lopez\u2019s remaining arguments are likewise unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-19\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-20\">Gomez Lopez\u2019s argument concerning the procedural unreasonableness of his sentence was not presented to the district court and thus is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361. He has not met this standard with respect to his claim that the district court gave inadequate reasons to support its choice of sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 364-65. He likewise has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
