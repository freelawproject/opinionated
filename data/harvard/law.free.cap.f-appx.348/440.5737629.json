McNealy was originally sentenced pursuant to a statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment. McNealy appealed his convictions and sentences and this Court affirmed. <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1164 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">McNealy asserts the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the mandatory minimum, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, was inapplicable. He contends that, because his prior offenses were juvenile offenses, \u00a7 851 should not have applied to give him a mandatory life sentence. Citing <em>Harris v. United. States, </em>149 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir.1998), McNealy asserts the applicability of a \u00a7 851 notice is jurisdictional and can be raised at anytime, including a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and its conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines range that has been lowered subsequently by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Because a sentencing adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Indeed, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not give the district court \u201cjurisdiction to consider extraneous resen-tencing issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 782. In <em>Harris, </em>we held that a defendant could raise a jurisdictional challenge to the application of \u00a7 851 in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate even though he failed to object at trial or on direct appeal. 149 F.3d at 1307-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">Because McNealy\u2019s sentence was based upon the applicable statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment rather than his original Guidelines range, he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based upon Amendment 706 or Amendment 505. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (\u201c[A] defendant whose original sentencing range was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1[, such as the application of a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment,] is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction, since the amendments] would not lower his applicable guidelines range.\u201d). McNealy is attempting to challenge an extraneous sentencing issue, namely, the application of \u00a7 851, which led to his mandatory life sentence. However, the correct avenue for challenging original sentencing determinations is either on direct appeal or in a \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>motion to vacate. McNealy\u2019s reliance on <em>Hams </em>is inapposite because <em>Hams </em>involved a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate which allows for jurisdictional challenges, whereas \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is limited to determining whether a defendant was sentenced based on a Guidelines range that has been amended since his original sentencing. <em>See Harris, </em>149 F.3d at 1307-09. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of McNealy\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
