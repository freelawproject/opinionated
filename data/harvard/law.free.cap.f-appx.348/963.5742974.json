Tatum is serving consecutive sentences of 193 months and 60 months of imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base and for using and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">In his challenge to the district court\u2019s judgment, Tatum contends <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to proceedings involving sentencing reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as it does in original sentencing proceedings. He asserts that, although he was sentenced as a career offender under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov.1992), the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Although we review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision not to reduce Tatum\u2019s sentence, we review <em>de novo </em>its interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we review Tatum\u2019s contentions <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Eligibility for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment that lowers the applicable guidelines range. USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">Tatum maintains his sentence should have been reduced because Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1 (providing sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses) was amended in 2007. Tatum\u2019s guidelines range, however, was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense; instead, it was pursuant to his career-offender status. Accordingly, the district court was correct in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">In addition, our court has rejected Tatum\u2019s contentions based on <em>Booker. See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238-39. \u201c[T]he concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-11\"> Pursuant to 5'ru Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
