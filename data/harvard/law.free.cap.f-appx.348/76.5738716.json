As he did in district court in moving to dismiss the indictment, Puente contends: his conviction violates his due process rights because he did not have notice of SORNA\u2019s requirements; and, his lack of notice shows he could not have knowingly violated SOR-NA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In <em>United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 261-62 (5th Cir.2009), our court rejected a similar challenge to lack of notice; we joined several other circuits in holding: \u201cnotice of a duty to register under state law is sufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause\u201d. We discern no reason to reach a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
