He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that a shorter sentence is warranted in his case because he did not actually possess most of the 100 kilograms of cocaine for which he was held responsible under the Guidelines. He also argues that the district court judge failed to adequately consider his lack of a prior criminal record and the fact that his strong family ties, community involvement, and educational accomplishments provided a strong incentive for rehabilitation. Finally, Colin-Lu-jan argues for the first time on appeal that a shorter sentence is warranted in his case because \u00a7 2D1.1, the Guideline used to calculate his base offense level, is not based upon empirical data and national experience and tends to overstate the sentence necessary even in a mine-run case. For that same reason, Colin-Lujan argues that this court should not apply an appellate presumption of reasonableness to his within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\">At sentencing, the district court judge considered the advisory sentencing guidelines range, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the arguments presented by the parties. After noting the seriousness of the offense, the district court judge determined that a sentence at the low end of Colin-Lujan\u2019s advisory sentencing guidelines range was appropriate. Colin-Lujan\u2019s arguments do not establish that the district court judge abused her discretion or committed plain error by declining to impose a shorter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Colin-Lujan has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
