Applying the recidivist enhancement, the district court determined that Williams was subject to a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence on the drug count. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). The court sentenced Williams to consecutive prison terms of 240 months for the drug violation and 60 months on the firearm count. Williams argues that the court should not have imposed the enhanced sentence for the drug offense because, he contends, the Government failed to file, before the entry of Williams\u2019s guilty plea, an information specifying the prior conviction it relied on to enhance the sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-15\">Under the terms of the plea agreement, Williams waived the right to appeal his sentence unless it was higher than the statutory maximum. Before Williams entered his guilty plea, however, the district court incorrectly advised that he could appeal the sentence if it was \u201cillegal, above the maximum guideline range, or above the maximum statutory range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-16\">The Government seeks to enforce the appeal waiver and argues that Williams\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. In light of the district court\u2019s failure to describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>appeal waiver accurately, we assume without deciding that Williams did not knowingly waive the right to appeal his sentence as Williams\u2019s appeal is more easily resolved on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">A defendant, through his actions, can waive compliance with \u00a7 851\u2019s requirements, <em>see United States v. Dodson, </em>288 F.3d 153, 160-61 (5th Cir.2002), and that is what Williams has done here. Throughout the proceedings in the district court, Williams repeatedly and affirmatively acknowledged that he would receive an enhanced sentence. In the plea agreement, Williams acknowledged that he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years because he had a prior felony drug conviction, and the agreement detailed the prior conviction that justified the enhancement. Furthermore, during the Rule 11 colloquy, the district court explained the 20-year mandatory minimum sentence, and before pleading guilty, Williams told the court that he understood the minimum penalty. Both in the plea agreement and during the Rule 11 colloquy, Williams necessarily agreed that he would receive a sentencing enhancement based on his prior conviction and, thus, waived any argument that the Government failed to comply with the \u00a7 851 requirements. <em>See Dodson, </em>288 F.3d at 160-61. Even if he did not waive compliance, he forfeited his right to raise the argument on appeal by failing to raise it in the district court, and, for the same reasons, we decline to exercise our discretion to address the forfeited error as Williams has not sought to withdraw his guilty plea and received the sentence that he expected. <em>See id. </em>at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
