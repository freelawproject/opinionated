For the following reasons, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">1. Petitioner seeks political asylum in the United States after being arrested and scheduled for removal. The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum was untimely. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination. This Court has no jurisdiction to disturb this determination as it is specifically based on findings of fact. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-95 (5th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">2. Petitioner also seeks withholding of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). However, there is substantial evidence that supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner was not eligible for withholding of removal and that Petitioner failed to establish \u201can objective \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution in the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>See Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 2492, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">3. Finally, Petitioner seeks protection pursuant to the Convention Against Torture. However, there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c)(2); 1208.18(a)(1); <em>Majd, </em>446 F.3d at 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
