The district court departed upward or varied from the guidelines range in imposing a statutory maximum 120-month term of imprisonment. Ortiz has appealed his sentence, arguing that the district court imposed an unreasonably harsh sentence. He contends that the district court failed to explain adequately its reasons for upward departure or variance and that the extent of the departure or variance is not supported by the facts relied upon by the district court. We have reviewed these contentions for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-94 (5th Cir.2007), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">Ortiz was a leader of an extensive conspiracy involving the transportation of many aliens under dangerous circumstances. In determining the sentence, the district court considered and applied the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and it explained in detail why application of those factors to the facts of this case supported imposition of a statutory maximum sentence that involved an upward departure or a variance from the guidelines imprisonment range. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806-07 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). The sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b982-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
