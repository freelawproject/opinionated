Villagomez argues that his due process rights were violated because the Immigration Judge (IJ) excluded witness testimony that would show that his removal would lead to extreme hardship for his family. For the following reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Villagomez, who was born in Mexico, came to the United States without inspection or parole in 1990. He now lives with his wife, three children, and his parents. His parents are lawful permanent residents and two of his children are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">In 2005, Villagomez returned to Mexico with his family for fifteen days because of a family emergency. Villagomez brought a substantial sum of cash in preparation for difficulties crossing the border. On their return trip, Villagomez bought two forged green cards at the border for himself and his wife and also paid to have his son smuggled back into the United States. During the border crossing, immigration officials detained Villagomez and his wife and questioned them about the validity of their green cards. After a four hour detention, during which Villagomez and his wife claimed that they were the people identified on the green cards, the immigration officials released them.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">Villagomez was arrested in 2007 and charged with removal. After this arrest, Villagomez admitted the allegations in the removal charge but claimed he was eligible for a cancellation of removal. The IJ declined to hear from Villagomez\u2019s witnesses regarding hardship because he determined, based on what happened in 2005, that Villagomez did not have the \u201cgood moral character\u201d required for a cancellation of removal. The BIA affirmed the Id\u2019s decision. Villagomez now petitions for a review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">We review due process claims de novo. <em>De Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004). However, to prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must \u201cmake an initial showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We \u201cmust affirm the decision [of the BIA or IJ] if there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the decision\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003); <em>accord Howard v. INS, </em>930 F.2d 432, 434 (5th Cir.1991). Villagomez applied for a cancellation of removal. The INA provides that the Attorney General may cancel the removal of an alien charged with removal if the alien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-15\">(A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-16\">(B) has been a person of good moral character during such period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-17\">(C) has not been convicted of an offense under section 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3) of this title, subject to paragraph (5); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>(D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">At issue here is whether Villago-mez has exhibited good moral character during his presence in the United States. The INA provides that no person shall be found to possess good moral character if the alien is a \u201cmember of one or more of the classes of persons\u201d described in \u00a7 212(6)(E). INA \u00a7 101(f)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3). Section 212(6)(E) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged ..., or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible.\u201d INA \u00a7 212(6)(E), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(6)(E)(I).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">The IJ determined that Villagomez\u2019s testimony surrounding his trip in 2005 demonstrated his lack of good moral character because he knowingly aided others\u2019 illegal entry into the United States. Villagomez argues that because the Government never pursued the underlying smuggling charge that the IJ\u2019s decision regarding moral character was erroneous. This contention is unpersuasive. The INA prohibits a finding of good moral character for any alien who knowingly aided others\u2019 illegal entry into the United States, and it does not require that the Government prosecute the underlying smuggling charge before seeking to remove a petitioner. INA \u00a7 212(6)(E), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(6)(E)(I). <em>See also Chambers v. Office of Chief Counsel, </em>494 F.3d 274 (2d Cir.2007) (upholding lack of good moral character determination based largely on petitioner\u2019s own statements at an IJ removal hearing). As such, the only question is whether the evidence presented at Villagomez\u2019s hearing established that he knowingly aided another person\u2019s illegal entry into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Here, the administrative record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Villa-gomez did knowingly aid others in illegally entering the United States. Villagomez, by his own admission, brought a significant amount of cash to pay for a border crossing, purchased forged green cards for himself and his wife, paid a person to smuggle his son over the border, and claimed that he and his wife were the persons identified on the green cards. Further, Villagomez\u2019s official record from his 2007 arrest indicates that a record check revealed that Villagomez was arrested for aiding and abetting in 2005 and granted a voluntary departure. As such, the administrative record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Villagomez \u201cknowingly\u201d aided another person\u2019s illegal entry into the United States, and, accordingly, Villagomez cannot show the requisite good moral character to cancel his removal under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">While Villagomez now argues that the IJ\u2019s exclusion of his witnesses\u2019 testimony violated his due process rights, he does not demonstrate that the exclusion of such testimony substantially prejudiced the outcome of his hearing. Villagomez does not contend that his witnesses\u2019 testimony would have demonstrated that he did not knowingly aid others\u2019 illegal entry. Instead, Villagomez only contends that his \u2022witnesses would have demonstrated the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d of his removal. However, even if Villagomez\u2019s witnesses were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>able to demonstrate extreme hardship, that would not aid his application for cancellation of removal. Here, without evidence contradicting the determination that he knowingly aided another\u2019s illegal border crossing, Villagomez cannot show he has good moral character, and thus he cannot sustain his application for cancellation of removal. As such, excluding Villagomez\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding extreme hardship did not substantially prejudice the outcome of Villagomez\u2019s hearing because a showing of extreme hardship is irrelevant if the alien lacks good moral character. Accordingly, excluding the witnesses\u2019 testimony did not substantially prejudice the result of Villagomez\u2019s hearing, and he cannot show that his due process rights were violated. <em>See De Zavala, </em>385 F.3d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-9\"> Pursuant to 5tu Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-8\">. In the proceedings below, Villagomez contended that he qualified for the family reunification and other exceptions to the \"smugglers\u201d provision. However, he does not make this argument on appeal, and, as such, we consider the issue waived. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
