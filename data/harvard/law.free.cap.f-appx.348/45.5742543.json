Chisholm filed a motion, styled as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion to reopen his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings. Chisholm\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was denied in 1997, but he sought to reopen the matter to address an alleged jurisdictional defect in the proceeding pursuant to <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-33, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). The district court construed Chisholm\u2019s pleading as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Chisholm argues that, because the indictment against him failed to allege a drug quantity, the indictment was defective and the district court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him to more than the 20-year statutory maximum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). This specific argument constitutes a new theory of relief. Although Chisholm challenged the adequacy of the district court factual findings with respect to drug quantity in his \u00a7 2255 motion, he did not raise the specific argument he asserts here. Accordingly, the district court did not err in construing his motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 531, 532 &amp; nn. 4-5, 125 S.Ct. 2641.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
