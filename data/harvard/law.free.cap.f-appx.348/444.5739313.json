Cameron\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Cameron argues that the district court erred (1) by not sentencing him at the low end of his amended guideline range, and (2) by failing to articulate adequately its reasons for refusing to sentence him at the low end of his revised range, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de uovo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\"><em>A </em>district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the ease of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Because the district court was not obligated to sentence Cameron to the low end of his amended guideline range, we conclude that it did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Cameron to the middle of his amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under the first part of the two-step analysis, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors under the second part of the analysis, regardless of whether it ultimately denies or grants \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWhile the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">Indeed, the only time this Court has vacated a district court\u2019s order granting a defendant\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduced sentence for a failure to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors occurred when the record contained no evidence that the district court had considered, or the defendant had even raised, the applicability of any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 928 (citing <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256-57).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The district court must also comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), which requires \u201c[t]he court, at the time of sentencing, [to] state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence, and, if the sentence ... range exceeds 24 months, the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range\u201d advised by the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). When evaluating the sentencing court\u2019s reasons for imposing a particular sentence, we focus \u201cexclusively on the sufficiency of the court\u2019s conduct at sentencing\u201d and whether the court \u201ctailored] its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>(petition for cert filed) (U.S. </em>June 29, 2009) (No. 09-5135). We have explained that sentencing courts \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). The length and amount of judicial reasoning required depends on the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Because the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stated that it had considered the nature of the underlying offense, Cameron\u2019s criminal history category, and Cameron\u2019s conduct while in prison, the district court adequately articulated its reasons for imposing its mid-range sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review, and did not violate \u00a7 3553(c). Accordingly, we affirm Cameron\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
