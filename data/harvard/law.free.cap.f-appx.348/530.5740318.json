On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by: (1) misapprehending its authority to depart downward from the sentencing guideline range when it denied his motion for a downward departure; and (2) denying his request to adjust his guideline range based on sentencing factor manipulation and sentencing entrapment. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-23\">We generally lack the authority to review a district court\u2019s refusal to issue a downward departure under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Chigbo, </em>38 F.3d 543, 546 (11th Cir.1994). However, we may review a district court\u2019s refusal to make a downward departure if it was based on the court\u2019s misapprehension of its statutory authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Fossett, </em>881 F.2d 976, 979 (11th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by Arce-Negron\u2019s claim that the district court mistakenly believed that it did not have the authority to depart downward from his criminal history category based on \u201cover-representation of criminal history, sentencing manipulation, and unwarranted sentencing disparity.\u201d When deciding whether to depart downward from the defendant\u2019s criminal history category, the district court may consider \u201creliable information [which] indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Here, the district court did not erroneously believe that it lacked the authority to depart downward, and therefore, its refusal to depart may not be reviewed on appeal. As the record shows, the district court specifically stated that it had the authority to depart downward but found no \u201cvalid basis to find that the criminal history category [was] overstated.\u201d In other words, the district court refused to grant the departure because it did not find reliable information that Arce-Negron\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1). In making this finding, the district court did not need to consider irrelevant information such as Arce-Negron\u2019s arguments about the disparity of his sentence with his codefendant and sentence manipulation by the government. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court understood its authority to depart from the guidelines, and we may not review its refusal to make a downward departure. <em>See Chigbo, </em>38 F.3d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">We also reject Arce-Negron\u2019s argument that the district court erred by refusing to adjust his guideline range based on his contention that the government engaged in sentencing manipulation or sentencing entrapment. As an initial matter, we do not recognize sentencing entrapment as a viable defense. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>138 F.3d 1410, 1414 (11th Cir.1998). Therefore, Arce-Negron\u2019s claim based on sentencing entrapment fails as a matter of law, <em>id., </em>and the only issue is whether the district court erred in not adjusting Arce-Negron\u2019s sentence based on sentencing manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\u201c[Sentencing factor manipulation occurs when the government\u2019s manipulation of a sting operation, even if insufficient to support a due process claim, requires that the manipulation be filtered out of the sentencing calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007). As we have explained, \u201can adjustment for sentencing factor manipulation is not a departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party raising the defense bears the \u201cburden of establishing that the government\u2019s conduct is sufficiently reprehensible to constitute sentencing factor manipulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271. \u201cGovernment infiltration of criminal activity is a recognized and permissible means of investigation ... The fact that government agents may supply or sell illegal drugs or provide other essential services does not necessarily constitute misconduct.\u201d Sem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number><em>ehez, </em>138 F.3d at 1413 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Based on Aree-Negron\u2019s own admission at the sentencing heai'ing that the informant did not encourage him to purchase more cocaine and that he was aware of the possibility of purchasing five kilograms, Arce-Negron has not shown how the government\u2019s conduct was \u201csufficiently reprehensible\u201d and thereby had the effect of increasing his sentence. <em>See Ciszkowki, </em>492 F.3d at 1271. Thus, the district court did not err in denying Arce-Negron\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we still cannot review a district court's decision not to apply a downward departure, except to ille extent noted in <em>Fossett. United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
