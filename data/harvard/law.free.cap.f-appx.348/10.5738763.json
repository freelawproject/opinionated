In dismissing Redd\u2019s complaint, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that the complaint be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) as barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-16\">The district court denied Redd leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Redd is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-17\">Redd asserts that the district court failed to give reasons as required by <em>Baugh </em>for certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. However, the district court stated specifically that it was certifying that Redd\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith \u201cfor the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report,\u201d and such an incorporation by reference satisfies <em>Baugh\u2019s </em>requirements. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-18\">Redd also asserts that he never received notice of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and that he was not given the opportunity to respond before the district court rendered its decision. However, because the magistrate judge did not consider any factual disputes in recommending that Redd\u2019s complaint be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>missed as Heck-barred and because the district court could assess the merits of Redd\u2019s complaint on its face, any error by the district court was harmless. <em>See Braxton v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 392, 397 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Redd does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his claim was barred by <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, he has abandoned the only issue before this court. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In light of the foregoing, Redd\u2019s motion fails to show error in the district court\u2019s certification decision and fails to show that Redd will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Redd\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">This court\u2019s dismissal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Redd\u2019s complaint each count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Redd is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b37-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
