Lopez argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh the sentencing factors found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues, for the purpose of preserving the issue for possible Supreme Court review, that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and is penologically flawed. This argument is, as he concedes, unavailing under our prior jurisprudence. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number><em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). His remaining arguments are likewise unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id,, </em>at 751-53. Lopez\u2019s argument concerning the procedural unreasonableness of his sentence was not presented to the district court and thus is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Lopez\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence. He has not shown that his sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable, nor has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 405 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1021-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
