No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Baker was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment in May 2002 upon his conviction of multiple count crack-cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, Baker was found to be accountable for 18.7 kilograms of cocaine base, which resulted in an offense level of 38 when calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Baker\u2019s section 3582(c) motion for reduction of sentence, Baker argued that he was due a section 3582(c) reduction based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which retroactively reduced by two the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied Baker\u2019s motion: Baker was due no reduction because he was found responsible at sentencing for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court is authorized to grant a sentence reduction \u201cif such reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with applicable policy statements and is not authorized under section 3582(c)(2) if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">At his May 2002 sentencing, Baker received a base offense level of 38, the highest base offense level under section 2Dl.l(c) and the offense level applicable to more than 1.5 kilograms of crack. The highest base level under section 2Dl.l(c) after application of Amendment 706 is also 38, and that highest level applies when the defendant is held accountable for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. Because Baker was held accountable for more than 18 kilograms of cocaine base, Baker\u2019s offense level and guideline range were unchanged by Amendment 706. The district court had no authority to reduce Baker\u2019s sentence and committed no error in denying his section 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201ca base offense level of 38 still applies to defendants responsible for 4.5 kilograms or more\u201d of crack cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Baker\u2019s Booker-based argument, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is without merit, <em>see United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>has no application to motions to reduce sentence under section 3582(c)(2)); and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>district court committed no error when it denied Baker\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 794-95 (11th Cir.2009) (no statutory or constitutional right to counsel for a section 3582(c)(2) motion or hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">. Baker was also convicted of possessing firearms in furtherance of his drug trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); he received a 60-year consecutive sentence on the drug-trafficking-firearms count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. The district court's drug weight calculation attributable to Baker was affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-14\">.Amendment 706 revised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by reducing by two levels the offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses.
