Withrow alleged that Miller confiscated mail and refused to allow him to receive mail concerning other prisoners\u2019 litigation which he was assisting. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice Director\u2019s Review Committee initially upheld Miller\u2019s actions, but reversed its position after Withrow filed his \u00a7 1983 action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Miller filed a motion for summary judgment in which she asserted that Withrow would henceforth be allowed to receive mail concerning other prisoners\u2019 litigation, as he requested. Miller also asserted, without a sworn attestation, that documents attached to her motion were the documents she had confiscated and that they were being returned to Withrow with the motion. She thus argued that the case was moot because there was no longer a case or controversy. In his motion to alter judgment, Withrow contended that Miller\u2019s unauthenticated documents were not competent summary judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The magistrate judge, deciding the case by consent of the parties, granted Miller\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Withrow\u2019s complaint, reasoning that the case was moot. In response to Withrow\u2019s timely motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59, the court took \u201cjudicial notice\u201d that the documents filed by Miller were \u201cpublic records.\u201d Although the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment was improper, we agree that the case was moot, and we affirm the dismissal of the cause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">On appeal, Withrow contends that summary judgment was improper because Miller\u2019s documents were not authenticated and because the court improperly decided a contested factual issue. Miller did not authenticate her documents with a sworn statement that they were the same documents confiscated from Withrow. Un-sworn documents generally cannot support a summary judgment motion. <em>See Eguia v. Tompkins, </em>756 F.2d 1130, 1136 (5th Cir.1985) (finding that any error was harmless where a summary judgment motion was \u201csupported by unauthenticated documents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Although the magistrate judge improperly characterized the rejection of With-row\u2019s claim for injunctive relief as a grant of Miller\u2019s summary judgment motion, it is clear that the basis of the magistrate judge\u2019s opinion was actually a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Withrow\u2019s claim was moot. This court is \u201cnot bound by the label a trial court puts on its opinion where underlying facts or the opinion as a whole indicate that a different action was in fact intended.\u201d <em>Zeidman v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., Inc., </em>651 F.2d 1030, 1037 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Tuley v. Heyd, </em>482 F.2d 590, 593 (5th Cir.1973) (\u201cIt is a familiar principle that the label a district court puts on its disposition of a case is not binding on a court of appeals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Because the magistrate judge\u2019s decision was based on the jurisdictional issue of mootness, the magistrate judge was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>limited by the procedural restrictions that govern a motion for summary judgment. At issue in this case \u201cis the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 its very power to hear the case.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 412-13 (5th Cir.1981). Therefore, \u201cthere is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413. Even in the face of a factual dispute, the magistrate judge had authority to dismiss the action based on \u201cthe complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the court has relied \u201con its own determination of disputed factual issues, we must then review those findings as we would any other district court resolution of factual disputes \u2014 we must accept the district court\u2019s findings unless they are \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Withrow challenges only the technical correctness of summary judgment and does not advert to any evidence contradicting the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that Miller returned the confiscated documents. He concedes that he does not know what documents were actually mailed and that Miller does. In addition, a website user identification number present in Miller\u2019s documents was the same one used by Withrow\u2019s friend to gain access to the documents. Withrow offers only speculation that Miller reprinted the documents herself after destroying the confiscated ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Withrow also contends that the magistrate judge erred by taking judicial notice of \u201cthe documents\u201d confiscated, which were filed by Miller on the grounds that they were \u201cpublic records\u201d and determining that they were \u201cthe actual documents that were confiscated.\u201d This action was in error as judicial notice may be taken only of a fact that \u201cis \u2018not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot be questioned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Charter Medical Corp., </em>162 F.3d 827, 829 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting Fed R. Evid. 201). Even if the documents presented by Miller were properly characterized as \u201cpublic records,\u201d that characterization is not probative of whether the documents were the same documents that were mailed to Withrow. Because it was subject to reasonable dispute whether the filed documents were the confiscated documents, the issue was not susceptible to judicial notice. <em>See </em>Fed R. Evid. 201(b). The error was harmless, however, because the court was permitted to make factual findings concerning its jurisdiction, and its finding that the confiscated documents were returned to With-row was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Withrow also argues that the magistrate judge erred by considering Miller\u2019s documents because they were \u201cdisclosed\u201d after the deadline set forth for disclosures in the magistrate judge\u2019s scheduling order. This contention is frivolous because a challenge to the court\u2019s jurisdiction may be made at any time. <em>Carr v. Saucier, </em>582 F.2d 14, 16 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Ultimately, Withrow fails to show that there was any continuing case or controversy which provided the magistrate judge with jurisdiction to hear the case. With-row has not proven that the magistrate judge committed clear error in finding that the confiscated documents were returned, and he acknowledged in his motion for summary judgment that as \u201cthe Defendants are now allowing him to receive [mail concerning other prisoners\u2019 litigation], he has obtained all the relief requested and it appears to him that an order from the Court is no longer necessary.\u201d Because the case was moot, dismissal for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>lack of jurisdiction is proper. <em>See Rocky v. King, </em>900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">We also affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that Withrow is not entitled to costs. To recover costs of litigation in a \u00a7 1983 action, the party seeking recovery must be a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Withrow is not a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) where his lawsuit was the catalyst for a voluntary change in the defendant\u2019s behavior in absence of \u201ca judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties\u201d bearing the necessary \u201cjudicial <em>imprimatur,\u201d </em>such as a court judgment or consent decree. <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dept. of Health and Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001); <em>see Dearmore v. City of Garland, </em>519 F.3d 517, 521 (5th Cir.2008). As no such judgment has been entered, With-row is not entitled to recover his litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The judgment of the magistrate judge dismissing the complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\">.
