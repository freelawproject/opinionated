The district court enhanced Tavira\u2019s sentence for his prior conviction in a Georgia court for possessing cocaine. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-26\">In 2001, Tavira pleaded guilty in a Georgia court to possessing cocaine. Tavira was treated as a first offender and was sentenced to twelve months of probation in lieu of imprisonment. After Tavira completed probation, he was \u201cdischarged without court adjudication of guilt\u201d and \u201cnot [ ] considered to have a criminal conviction.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 42-8-62(a). The discharge \u201ccompletely exonerate[d] [Tavira] of any criminal purpose\u201d under state law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In 2007, Tavira was indicted for his role in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and the government moved to enhance Tavira\u2019s sentence based on his earlier conviction. Tavira entered a blind plea of guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, but he objected to the enhancement of his sentence and argued that he was not \u201cconvicted\u201d under Georgia law. The district court overruled Tavira\u2019s objection and sentenced Tavira to the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, by enhancing Tavira\u2019s sentence. Tavira argues for the first time that the enhancement provision of section 841(b)(1)(A) is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define the word \u201cconviction\u201d and an enhancement predicated on an offense for which he was exonerated is manifestly unjust, but we disagree. Tavi-ra argues that we should follow state law to determine whether he has a prior conviction, but we are bound by federal law to determine what constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d under section 841(b)(1). <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>287 F.3d 1034, 1036-37 (11th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Mejias, </em>47 F.3d 401, 403-04 (11th Cir.1995). Although a Georgia court discharged and exonerated Tavira after he completed a pre-trial diversionary program for first offenders, the district court was entitled to enhance Tavi-ra\u2019s sentence based on his prior conviction. <em>See Acosta, </em>287 F.3d at 1036-37 (affirming enhancement of a sentence under section 841(b)(1)(A) with defendant\u2019s prior adjudication as a youthful offender even though \u201cstate law d[id] not consider [the defendant] \u2018convicted\u2019 and his record [was] sealed\u201d). <em>Cf. Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 112-15, 103 S.Ct. 986, 992-93, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983) (affirming enhancement of a sentence under the Gun Control Act with defendant\u2019s prior conviction even though a state court discharged the defendant and expunged the charge under a pre-trial diversionary program). To rule otherwise \u201cwould disrupt uniformity in federal sentencing and frustrate the purpose of sentence enhancement ... to punish and deter recidivism.\u201d <em>Mejias, </em>47 F.3d at 404; <em>e.g., Acosta, </em>287 F.3d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Tavira\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
