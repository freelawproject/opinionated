No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">McDowell argues that insufficient evidence existed to convict him. Where, as here, a defendant fails to move for a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, \u201cwe will reverse his conviction! ] only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThis standard requires a finding that the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). To support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute under section 841(a)(1), the government had to establish (1) knowledge of possession; (2) possession of a controlled substance; and (3) intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Here, testimony \u2014 which was corroborated by a recorded conversation and video surveillance \u2014 showed that (1) a confidential informant (Cl) called McDowell about purchasing $500 worth of crack cocaine; (2) McDowell met the Cl at the Cl\u2019s residence (which was being surveilled by a police officer) with a cooler; (3) McDowell allowed the Cl to look through the cooler, which had drugs in it; (4) the Cl gave McDowell money with one hand and received two plastic baggies in the other; and (5) after the transaction, the Cl gave the police officer surveilling the transaction the crack cocaine he had just purchased. This evidence plainly was sufficient for a jury to find McDowell guilty of drug trafficking; and we conclude that his conviction was not a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">None of McDowell\u2019s appellate arguments negate that the evidence sufficiently showed that he sold drugs to the Cl. His arguments focus on other possible constructions of the evidence and the credibility of the Cl. But the evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, and jurors are free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence. <em>United States v. Mattos, </em>74 F.3d 1197, 1199-1200 (11th Cir.1996). And all inferences and credibility determinations must be resolved in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 845 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">We now address McDowell\u2019s challenges to his sentence. He argues that his sentence \u2014 which was 39 months below the low end of the applicable guidelines range \u2014 is unreasonable because of several alleged guideline calculation errors. When reviewing a sentence, we must, in pertinent part, ensure that no procedural error occurred, such as the district court improperly calculating the guidelines, basing a sentence on clearly erroneous facts, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or failing to explain a variation from the guidelines. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its finding of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">McDowell argues that his base offense level should have been based on a lower drug quantity. He contends that only the purity of the crack cocaine from the transaction with the Cl \u2014 not its entire weight \u2014 should be attributed to him and that the district court should not have included the additional crack cocaine \u201ccookie\u201d observed by the Cl in McDowell\u2019s cooler because his possession of it was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">The district court committed no clear error in concluding that McDowell was responsible for at least 35 grams of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contrary to McDowell\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ment that only the pure weight of the cocaine should be considered, the guidelines provide that \u201cthe weight of a controlled substance ... refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n.A. And the government was not required to prove McDowell\u2019s possession of the additional crack cocaine cookie beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, 39</em>8 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (when a defendant objects to a fact determination, such as drug quantity, \u201cthe government bears the burden establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">And we conclude that the Cl\u2019s approximation of the weight of the additional cookie was sufficiently accurate. <em>See United States v. Zapata, </em>139 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1998) (sentencing cannot be based on calculations of drug quantities that are merely speculative). The Cl\u2014 who previously had been convicted of selling cocaine \u2014 testified that the cookie weighed approximately 14 grams. McDowell also testified that there were a couple of bags of crack cocaine at the scene of the transaction. And the district court determined that the cookie had to weigh only 4.7 grams to reach the 35-gram cutoff for sentencing purposes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">McDowell argues that he should not have been given an obstruction of justice enhancement based on perjured testimony at trial because he did not willfully provide untruthful information; instead, he submits, his testimony was the product of confusion and faulty memory. We disagree. Obstruction of justice occurs \u2014 and a two-level enhancement applies \u2014 when, among other things, a defendant provides \u201cmaterially false information to a judge.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(f)). Material evidence is \u201cevidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">At trial, McDowell testified that he went to the Cl\u2019s house with an empty cooler to purchase drugs for his own personal use. This testimony was belied by the video of the transaction and the testimony of police officers and the Cl; and the testimony was material on the issue of whether McDowell trafficked in drugs. Nothing evidences that McDowell\u2019s testimony was based on confusion, mistake, or faulty memory; and we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s application of the obstruction of justice enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">McDowell challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a downward departure based on diminished capacity, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. But the district court did not believe that it lacked authority to grant McDowell a downward departure on this basis, and we cannot review the district court\u2019s refusal to grant the departure. <em>See United States v. Ortega, </em>358 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11th Cir.2003) (a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is unreviewable on appeal unless the district court believed erroneously that it lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the authority to grant a downward departure).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The district court committed no error in its guidelines\u2019 calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. This amount came from the transaction with the Cl, the additional crack cocaine cookie observed by the Cl, and 21 grams of crack cocaine from a dismissed count. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>McDowell does not challenge the crack cocaine from the dismissed count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. We reject McDowell's argument \u2014 raised for the first time on appeal \u2014 that he was entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4) (conduct that results in an obstruction of justice enhancement \"ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct\u201d). And McDowell did not admit to his conduct: instead, he proceeded to trial where he testified that he did not sell crack cocaine to the Cl.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-22\">. The district court noted that it had considered McDowell's documented history of mental and emotional problems along with other sentencing factors in section 3553(a) in sentencing McDowell below the guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
