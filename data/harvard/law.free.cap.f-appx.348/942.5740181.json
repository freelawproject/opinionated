Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 207-13, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The notice of appeal in a civil action must be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Alfred did not file his notice of appeal until over five months after the dismissal of his suit as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-21\">Construing Alfred\u2019s notice of appeal as a motion to reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), we hereby remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining whether Alfred\u2019s appeal should be reopened pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6). The district court is directed to return the case to this court for farther proceedings or dismissal, as appropriate, once the ruling has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-22\">LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b968-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
