Huang sought asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment based on a claimed fear of persecution on account of her Christian religion. Although Huang withdrew her application in August 2005 and was ordered removed to China, she moved to reopen removal proceedings in January 2008, asserting that, based on her marriage in the United States and the birth of her two children, as well as changes in China\u2019s family planning policy, she held a well-founded fear of being forcibly sterilized upon return to China. An immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied her untimely motion to reopen and the BIA dismissed her appeal for failure to demonstrate that country conditions in China had changed since her prior removal proceeding. On appeal, Huang argues that the BIA abused its discretion by refusing to grant reopening on account of a material change in personal circumstances, and neglecting to consider evidence purportedly showing that local family planning officials altered their enforcement of China\u2019s one-child policy. After careful review, we grant the petition, vacate the BIA\u2019s order, and remand to the BIA for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, although the BIA noted that it discerned no error in the IJ\u2019s decision for the reasons cited therein, it issued its own opinion and added its own analysis without expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s opinion. As such, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). Judicial review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Motions to reopen are especially disfavored in removal proceedings, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Although the BIA is not required to discuss every piece of evidence presented, it is required to give reasoned consideration to all the evidence submitted by the petitioner. <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1376 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing the denial of an application for withholding of removal). If the BIA fails to give \u201creasoned consideration\u201d or make \u201cadequate findings,\u201d it is appropriate to vacate and remand for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1376-77 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Ordinarily, an alien who is subject to a final order of removal and wishes to reopen the proceedings must file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the date of the final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nevertheless, the time limit is inapplicable if the alien can demonstrate \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). An alien cannot circumvent the requirement of showing changed country conditions by demonstrating only a change in personal circumstances. <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319. In several recent decisions, we held that evidence of enhanced enforcement or a recent campaign of forced sterilization in a petitioner\u2019s home province is sufficient to establish changed country conditions to warrant reopening of removal proceedings. <em>See Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (11th Cir.2007), <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2009), and <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1318-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Because Huang\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely, she needed to establish changed country conditions with previously unavailable evidence, and could not simply rely on evidence of changed personal circumstances. Huang failed to present evidence demonstrating increased enforcement in her home province with respect to Chinese natives, but she offered some evidence that may suggest that enforcement was significantly altered with respect to returnees with foreign-born children. Previously available evidence from 2004 indicated that Fujian officials sanctioned the use of economic penalties on returnees to ensure compliance with the national family planning policy, but not physically coercive methods such as forced sterilization. A November 2007 \u201cNotice Regarding the Birth Control Policy of Fujian Province,\u201d however, stated that Chinese citizens with foreign-born children would become targets for sterilization and were required to return to China to undergo sterilization procedures. It is unclear from the BIA\u2019s opinion whether it considered this 2007 Notice as it relates to returnees like Huang.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Because the BIA determined that Huang presented no evidence of escalated enforcement, its decision does not reflect reasoned and adequate consideration of all the evidence submitted in support of the motion to reopen, particularly the 2007 Notice. As a result, we find it necessary to remand to permit the BIA to consider the totality of the evidence in determining whether it is sufficient to establish changed eounti-y conditions. <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1376-77. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review, vacate the order denying the motion to reopen, and remand to the BIA for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">PETITION GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED TO THE BIA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
