Harrison </em>22 Mich. 410), who will hold against creditors even though a statute expressly declares fraudulent conveyances void as against creditors, and makes no exception in favor of bona fide purchasers: <em>Quirk v.

Her claim is that her husband once owned the land, and that she never parted with her dower. The court below decided in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">On the trial, to make out her case, she showed a deed, given in 1865 by John P. Mason to her husband, under which they went into possession. This deed was never recorded. It was subsequently given up by surrender in writing, with directions in writing to the vendor to convey to Andrew Ely,\u2014 which he did. This conveyance was made subject to a mortgage referred to in .it, given by Wheeler to one Nye, which the vendee was to pay, and which is not now outstanding. A subsequent deed was made, subject to a mortgage to Wheeler? concerning which there is no question, as it came from the record owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">It is claimed by plaintiff that defendant, by reason of these -references, had notice of Wheeler\u2019s title, and therefore of such claim as plaintiff had as dowress. It appears, however, that she and her husband both left the premises at or about the time when he relinquished his deed; and there are some other facts connected with their relations which might perhaps require attention if defendant stood in a different position. He is only informed, therefore, constructively of what appears in his deed and the chain of title. There is nothing in these papei-s which indicates that Wheeler ever owned the legal title, and nothing which would warn a purchaser of anything but Nye\u2019s rights, and of those there is no controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">But plaintiff insists, and so the court below seemed to consider, that a right of dower has some preference over other rights under our land laws. The statute in regard to unrecorded deeds (How. Stat. \u00a7 5683) makes them void as to subsequent bona fide purchasers whose deeds are first recorded. This is defendant\u2019s position. Whatever plaintiff\u2019s rights may have been, they depend solely on the unrecorded deed to her husband. Hnderthe statute defendant\u2019s honest purchase, made under previous bona fide purchasers, left this precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>as if it lia.d never existed. We can see no possible reason for ingrafting on this statute an exception which is at variance with its language, and at variance with the plain purpose of \u00bfhe law, which is to give honest .purchasers a right to rely \u2022on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">This makes it unnecessary to consider the important and interesting questions lying outside of the record title, and we \u2022shall not discuss them. In our opinion the court below should .have directed a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
