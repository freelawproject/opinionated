Jones, owned by the defendant, (a corporation, created by the laws of Texas,) loaded at Houston on the 13th February, 1873. The load was chiefly cotton, in bales, and whilst in Galveston Bay, from some reason, fire was communicated to the cotton, or to the vessel. The fire was first discovered about five o\u2019clock in the morning. When first seen, it seems to have been well under way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">Of a .crew of fifty-six persons, twenty-three were lost; and among the lost was John J. Price, husband of Sarah E. Price, the. plaintiff, who sued for damages resulting from the death of her husband. She alleged various omissions of duty on the part of those in charge of the steamboat at the time of the disaster, as well as various deficiencies in the outfit of the boat, and the want of full complement of skilled officers in charge and in command of the boat at the time of the disaster. She claimed, that by reason of the wilful acts and omissions of defendant\u2019s servants, (which were set out,) her husband, who was, at the time, a clerk on said boat, in the employ of said company, lost his life, whereby an action for damages had accrued to her as surviving widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">The defendant pleaded the general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-8\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.

W. Co. <em>v. </em>Bradley, guardian, is in force and unrepealed by section 30, article 12, of the Constitution of 1869. Appellant\u2019s right to maintain the action must, therefore, be conceded, if an action could have been maintained against appellee by her husband, for the alleged negligent, culpable, or wrongful acts changed to have occasioned his death, if death had not ensued. To determine whether an action could have been maintained by appellant\u2019s husband, John J. Price, if death had not ensued from the alleged unfitness, gross negligence, or carelessness of appellee\u2019s servants and agents, it is necessary for us to determine the general proposition, whether the master is liable for injuries sustained by his servant through the wrongful act, negligence, or default of a fellow servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Although the question has not been heretofore authoritatively ruled upon by this court, still it has been so thoroughly discussed and repeatedly decided by the courts of Great Britain, Belaud, and almost every -State of America, with the same result, that it can hardly now be regarded as presenting an open question. It would be an idle consumption of time for us to enter into an elaborate consideration of the question, or undertake to vindicate the conclusions reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>in the courts in which it has been discussed with such remarkable unanimity of conclusion. If we were to attempt to do so, we would be forced to journey along a plain, familiar, and well-traveled road, and could only hope to entertain those who might accompany us with the reiteration of legal principles, arguments, and illustrations often presented by others with much more force and clearness than we could hope to do. We will, therefore, content ourselves with the citation of the authorities, in which the principle of non-liability of the master for damages, on account of injuries sustained by the negligence of a fellow servant, has been directly decided or clearly recognized. For which, in the main, we are indebted to the research and erudition of counsel in the different cases pending before us, involving this point.

But these decisions, we think, cannot be justly regarded as of any great weight. The leading case on the subj ect, in Kentucky, is that of The Louisville and Nashville R. R. Co. v. Collins, 2 Duval, 114. The subsequent decisions (4 Bush, 507, and 6 Bush, 579) merely follow it. It- cannot be questioned, that in this case Judge Bobertson defends the propositions, upon which he insists with his usual vigor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>thought and acute and discriminating powers of reason. But the learned judge cites, throughout the opinion, not a single authority in its support. It can only be regarded, therefore, as entitled to such weight as its inherent force, and the approval of the learned court from which it emanates, gives it. The earliest of the cases cited from Ohio, (Little Miami R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Stevens, 20 Ohio, O. S., 415,) to which the subsequent cases of C. C. and C. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Keary, 3 Ohio, 201, and P. Ft. W. and C. R. W. Co. <em>v. </em>Devinney, 17 Id., 197, certainly give no additional strength, was decided by a divided court. Only two of the four judges upon the bench concurred in the decision upon the point to which it is here cited. And the opinion of Lord Cockburn seems also to have been overruled, or, at least, not to have met with subsequent approval, in the House of Lords.
