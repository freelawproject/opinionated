(\u201cEquinox\u201d), in her action alleging gender discrimination in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 760.01 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFCRA\u201d), and unpaid overtime in violation of the Fair Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cFLSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Alvino was employed as a personal trainer and group fitness instructor at Equinox South Beach, a health and fitness club in Miami Beach, Florida. With respect to her FCRA claim, Alvino claimed that Equinox created a hostile work environment because she was subjected to inappropriate comments by some male club members and encouraged by her supervisors to dress provocatively to help sell personal training sessions. As to her FLSA claim, Alvino contended that Equinox\u2019s timekeeping procedures did not accurately track all of the time she worked, and that, specifically, she was not compensated for off-the-clock time she spent trying to generate personal training clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In granting summary judgment, the district court concluded: (1) that the alleged sexual harassment was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of Alvino\u2019s employment; (2) that Alvino had not shown that Equinox failed to pay her for her compensable time; and (3) that Alvino was not entitled to be paid for the off-the-clock time she chose to spend at the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to Alvino\u2019s sexual harassment claim, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s November 17, 2014 order, we agree that Alvino\u2019s evidence failed to show that the harassment she allegedly experienced was objectively severe or pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment. <em>See Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Further, on appeal Alvino relies primarily upon her post-deposition declaration and its exhibits to show that Equinox displayed inside the club images from its national advertising campaign that depicted women as sexual objects and used a business model that sold a sexual fantasy, rather than fitness, to older men. The district court, however, did not consider this evidence, finding that some of Alvino\u2019s statements in her declaration conflicted with her prior deposition testimony. Alvino does not challenge this evidentiary ruling on appeal. In any event, even considering this evidence, Alvino did not establish objectively severe or pervasive sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on Alvino\u2019s FLSA claim, which warrants brief discussion. An employee bringing a claim of unpaid overtime work must establish that: (1) she worked unpaid overtime; and (2) her employer knew or should have known about the unpaid overtime. <em>Bailey v. TitleMax of Ga., Inc., </em>776 F.3d 797, 801 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Alvino was \u201con the clock\u201d and paid when she was giving personal training sessions, conducting group classes, or working a scheduled floor shift. However, Alvino testified that most days she arrived at the club when it opened and remained there between 11 and 18 hours each day, even when she was not \u201con the clock\u201d during those hours, because she was trying to generate a base of personal training clients among the club\u2019s members. According to Alvino, she spent her off-the-clock hours at the club \u201cbeing there, face time, walking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>around, meeting people, talking to people, offering free training sessions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Alvino presented sufficient evidence of the first element \u2014 that her off-the-clock activity at the club was \u201cwork\u201d within the meaning of the FLSA for which she was not paid \u2014 she nonetheless failed to present sufficient evidence of the second element \u2014 that Equinox knew or should have known that whenever Alvino was at the club, she was working overtime without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">It is undisputed that personal trainers were expected to use their scheduled floor shifts to market their skills to clients, as well as perform other work such as handing out towels, picking up equipment, mingling with club members and assisting them with their exercises. To that end, new trainers were typically scheduled floor shifts several days per week. Trainers also were assigned to conduct complimentary 60-minute Equifit sessions for new club members. For personal training sessions, however, trainers set their own schedules with their clients, and supervisors were not necessarily aware of when a trainer had scheduled a session. In addition, trainers, including Alvino, were given free gym memberships and encouraged to exercise at Equinox when they were not working, and Equinox\u2019s trainers spent a lot of time working out.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Alvino did not testify that she was instructed to work \u201coff the clock.\u201d Rather, Alvino believed she was expected to be at the club all day because a supervisor once told her that two top trainers at Equinox had \u201clived at the club when they first started.\u201d The supervisor admitted making this comment while trying to encourage Alvino, but explained that he was referring to the trainers\u2019 \u201cpassion for fitness,\u201d and meant that \u201cthey spen[t] a lot of time working out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Alvino also did not testify that her supervisors knew that she was working \u201coff the clock.\u201d Instead, Alvino said that \u201cany manager\u201d who was at the club would have seen her there and that she \u201cwould hope\u201d that her supervisors knew given \u201chow hard [she] was trying, and how much time [she] was pulling in.\u201d In other words, Alvino\u2019s argument is that her managers should have inferred that she was working off the clock because she was present at the club for such long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Alvino\u2019s own testimony, however, suggests it would not have been readily apparent to Equinox\u2019s supervisors that Alvino continued to market herself to clients outside her scheduled floor shifts and Equifit sessions. Alvino taught two group classes each week in addition to her personal training sessions, Equifit sessions, and scheduled floor shifts. Alvino also had friends who worked in Equinox\u2019s front desk, shop and juice bar, and her supervisors often saw her socializing with them, rather than on the floor. Alvino came and went from the club during the day to, for example, work other jobs (including teaching a one-hour boxing class at another gym and waiting tables), run on the beach, or walk her dog. Further, while floor shifts were scheduled, they could be rearranged to accommodate trainers\u2019 other work schedules, and Alvino liked to pick up as many of the other trainers\u2019 floor shifts as she could,- so she could get paid while she was at the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Given, that personal trainers such as Al-vino lacked fixed schedules outside of floor shifts and were frequently present for purposes other than floor shifts, Alvino did not show that her lengthy presence at the club would have been conspicuous or would have suggested to her supervisors that she was trying to generate clients off the clock. Without more, a reasonable jury could not conclude that Equinox knew or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>have known Alvino was working off the clock. Accordingly, the record here demonstrates that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Alvino\u2019s FLSA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">.
