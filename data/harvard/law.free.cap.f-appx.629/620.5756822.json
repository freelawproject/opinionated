(Avon) on Cordero\u2019s claims for breach of contract and fraud. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In 2012, Cordero was hired by Avon for the position of District Sales Manager (DSM) for Avon District No. 1803, located within Avon\u2019s \u201cTexan Division.\u201d A DSM\u2019s responsibilities include training, incentiviz-ing, and developing Independent Sales Representatives (ISRs) \u2014 independent contractors who purchase Avon products for resale to their customer base \u2014 to maximize the district\u2019s performance. Under Avon\u2019s Sales Leadership program, participating ISRs, titled \u201cSales Leaders,\u201d undertook the additional responsibility to recruit new ISRs. As a DSM, Cordero was eligible to earn bonuses based on sales, orders, and recruiting activities achieved by ISRs and Sales Leaders in her district pursuant to Avon\u2019s Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In April 2013, Avon furnished recruitment and sales reports to Cordero detailing her-district\u2019s productivity for the first quarter of 2013. According to Cordero, these reports indicated that Cordero was due a $70,850 bonus. Shortly thereafter, however, Avon learned that certain Sales Leaders in the Texan Division had fabricated recruiting and sales activities. Specifically, the Sales Leaders created fictitious accounts for persons they claimed to have recruited as new ISRs and placed fake orders on credit from those individual\u2019s accounts. This dishonest activity resulted in orders for $450,000 of Avon products for which Avon claims it did not get paid. Though both parties agree that Cordero was not involved in the dishonest activity, Cordero has acknowledged that it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Because the feigned activity falsely inflated the productivity of Cordero\u2019s district, Avon adjusted the performance numbers, and Cordero\u2019s bonus calculated therefrom, to reflect only legitimate sales and recruiting. As a result, Avon paid Cordero a $1,200 bonus based on the sales for which Avon received payment. Corde-ro nevertheless contends that pursuant to the ICP, she was due $70,850, calculated from all activity published in the aforementioned reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">This dispute resulted in Cordero\u2019s filing claims against Avon for breach of contract, fraud, and negligence. While she originally brought suit in state court, Avon properly removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Corde-ro subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on her breach of contract claim, and Avon moved for summary judgment on all of Cordero\u2019s claims. After a pre-trial hearing on the motions, the district court granted Avon\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201cfor the reasons stated on the record\u201d and dismissed the suit. Cordero timely appealed the district court\u2019s judgment regarding her claims for breach of contract, fraud by false promise, and fraud by non-disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Avon de novo, \u201capplying the same standard as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>district court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 motions are considered independently, \u201cviewing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Under Texas law, applicable to this diversity action, the elements in a breach of contract claim include: \u201c(1) the existence of a valid contract; (2) that the plaintiff performed or tendered performance; (3) that the defendant breached the contract; and (4) that the plaintiff was damaged as a result of the breach.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In dispute is the third element, whether Avon breached the employment agreement \u2014 namely, the bonus provisions of the ICP.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The crux of the parties\u2019 dispute is contract interpretation. Cordero alleges breach insofar as Avon adjusted her bonus to exclude fictitious sales and recruiting activity. Because the ICP speaks only of \u201csales,\u201d but not \u201clegitimate sales,\u201d and does not specifically exclude \u201csales manufactured by fraud,\u201d Cordero reads Avon\u2019s bonus provisions to trigger a bonus when products are ordered, shipped, and notated on Avon\u2019s quarterly report, as occurred here. According to Cordero, a jury could conclude that Avon, due to its alleged poor credit policies, should bear the financial consequences of nonpayment. Avon responds that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law because the bonus provisions only applied to legitimate sales \u201cachieved,\u201d i.e. sales resulting in payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">The ICP is a chart that identifies sales, order, and leadership goals necessary to trigger specific bonus awards. The grid lists quarterly awards for \u201cSales Plan Achievement\u201d and \u201cLeadership Plan Achievement.\u201d The Administrative Guidelines, which define the terms, provide in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-13\"><em>6. Leadership Bonus </em>\u2014 Consists of 2 components \u2014 Total Upline Growth target achievement paid quarterly when 100% of Total Upline target is met and includes a New to Title component that is earned ... when 100% of Total Leadership Upline target is met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-14\">10. <em>Quarterly Sales Bonus </em>\u2014 Paid quarterly if commissionable sales achievement is at least 95% and 95% quarterly order count plan is achieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-15\">11. <em>Quarterly Orders Bonus </em>\u2014 Paid quarterly if 100% of orders count plan is achieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">\u201cWhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA contract is not ambiguous if it can be given a definite or certain meaning as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a contract is ambiguous if subject to two or more interpretations, though \u201cboth interpretations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>must be reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ambiguity creates a fact issue for the jury; but, if a contract is unambiguous, \u201cwe give the contract its plain grammatical meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We agree with the district court that \u201ccommissionable sales,\u201d as referenced in the Administrative Guidelines, is unambiguous and refers to legal sales, \u201cas opposed to those that were a product of some fraudulent representation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csale\u201d to include four elements: \u201c(1) parties competent to contract, (2) mutual assent, (3) a thing capable of being transferred, and (4) a price in money paid or promised.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, we have neither parties competent to contract, as the orders were placed on behalf of fictitious individuals, nor mutual assent. When Avon, shipped the orders, they operated under the assumption that the order was a bargained-for exchange between itself and a <em>real </em>buyer, for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Reading the Guidelines as a whole, we similarly hold that the terms \u201cachieved\u201d and \u201cmet\u201d necessarily refer to bona fide sale, order, and recruiting activity. Achieve means \u201cto be successful in doing something,\u201d \u201cto attain a desired end or level of performance,\u201d or \u201cto strive, make an effort.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cMet\u201d as referred to in the leadership bonus provision, operates in a synonymous fashion. It strains credulity, and is thus unreasonable, to read the bonus provisions to apply to the wholly fabricated activity at issue here. The culpable Sales Leaders made no effort to attain the desired end: business for themselves and Avon.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">We further dispense with Cordero\u2019s argument regarding Avon\u2019s failure to present evidence of Cordero\u2019s involvement in the dishonest conduct. We reiterate that Avon concedes Cordero was not a party to the dishonest conduct. Even so, neither Cordero\u2019s lack of culpability, nor her inability to approve sales, credit lines, or shipments, is material to her bonus entitlement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Though Cordero is correct that her bonus was intended to be a reflection of her \u201cindividual performance,\u201d as intimated in her offer letter, Cordero\u2019s \u201cindividual performance\u201d is inextricably tied to the performance of her district \u2014 namely, the ISRs\u2019 sales, orders, and recruiting activities \u2014 given her role as DSM. The interpretive issue is whether the commissiona-ble sales, orders, and recruiting efforts targets were achieved or met. That Cordero disagrees in her interpretation does not render the terms ambiguous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Due to our determination that Cordero was only entitled to a bonus derived from legitimate sales and recruiting efforts as a matter of law, we further hold that Corde-ro has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Avon breached the ICP. The summary judgment record shows that Avon paid Cordero a bonus on legitimate sales, excluding \u201cthe fraudulent sales, orders and recruiting efforts that did not actually exist.\u201d Cordero admits that she was paid $1,200 and has acknowledged the existence of the fraudulent activity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>her district multiple times. To the extent Cordero now, for the first time, seeks to raise a fact issue as to the exact \u201cpercentage or dollar amount of the subject sales, if any, which were procured by fraud,\u201d that argument is waived. It is clear that \u201c[pjlaintiffs may not advance on appeal new theories or raise new issues not properly before the district court to obtain reversal of the summary judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Accordingly, based on our review of the summary judgment record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to Avon on Cordero\u2019s claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Cordero also appeals her claims of fraud by false promise and fraud by non-disclosure. The district court implicitly ruled on Cordero\u2019s fraud claims when it granted Avon\u2019s Motion for Complete Summary Judgment and dismissed the suit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Under Texas law, a fraud claim requires a \u201cmaterial misrepresentation, which was false, and which was either known to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of its truth, which was intended to be acted upon, which was relied upon, and which caused injury.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cordero\u2019s claims of fraud by false promise and fraud by non-disclosure are theories by which the misrepresentation element of fraud can be proven.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Fraud by false promise involves \u201c[a] promise to do an act in the future ... when made with the intention, design and purpose of deceiving, and with no intention of performing the act.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Fraud by non-disclosure is premised on the notion that silence \u201cmay be as misleading as a positive misrepresentation of facts.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To survive summary judgment, Cordero must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to each element of fraud.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">Cordero alleges that Avon committed fraud by false promise when Avon unquali-fiedly promised to pay Cordero pursuant to the ICP, yet did not intend to do so with respect to orders for which Avon did not receive payment. Though Avon contends that Cordero did not appeal the judgment as to fraud by false promise because Cordero did not list it as an issue for appeal, Cordero did brief the claim and we thereby reach it.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">Cordero has offered no evidence, other than her own interpretation of the ICP, to support her allegation that Avon\u2019s promise to pay her according to the ICP was false, much less intentionally false. Nor did Cordero allege in her affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>that she relied upon Avon\u2019s alleged misrepresentation when she accepted the DSM position. As such, Cordero\u2019s evidence is insufficient to preclude summary judgment on her fraud by false promise claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Nor can Cordero survive summary judgment as to her non-disclosure theory of fraud. Cordero asserts that Avon failed to disclose that Avon \u201chad prior experience with the kinds of activities it now calls fraud, that [Avon] had done nothing ... to prevent such fraud from recurring, and that such fraud could adversely affect [Cordero\u2019s] bonuses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Under Texas law, fraud by non-disclosure is only implicated when a party has a duty to speak, yet deliberately remains silent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cWhether such a duty exists is a question of law.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Cordero has offered no authority, and we found\u2019 none, indicating that Avon owed a duty to make the cited disclosures to Cordero as a prospective employee.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This alone merits summary judgment in favor of Avon as a matter of law, as \u201ca complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">But even assuming such duty existed, Cordero failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the non-disclosures were material,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> that Avon intended for Cordero to rely on the non-disclosures, or that Cordero did, in fact, rely upon them in accepting the DSM position. That Avon dealt with fraudulent accounts and orders in the past, of which Cordero provides limited evidence, does not create a material fact issue as to whether Avon intentionally withheld such information.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Though Cordero states in her affidavit that Avon informed her that bonuses were a large part of DSM compensation, she does not contend that she accepted employment on the assumption that her bonuses would reflect illegitimate sales and recruiting activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">In sum, the scant evidence to which Cordero points the court is insufficient to enable a reasonable jury to render a verdict in her favor.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to Cordero, the non-movant, we cannot, \u201cin the absence of any proof, assume that [she] could or would prove the necessary facts.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">\u2022{' #</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Avon. Cordero\u2019s alternative motion for oral argument which was carried with the case is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
