No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">This action arises out of Gibson\u2019s challenge earlier to his 15-year Florida court sentence for robbery. In state court, Gibson filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, pursuant to Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800(a). Relying on intervening state case law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gibson argued that he should not have been sentenced under Florida\u2019s prisoner releasee reoffender (\u201cPRR\u201d) statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.082; he stressed his 1999 robbery offense was committed more than three years after he was last \u201creleased from a state correctional facility,\u201d within the meaning of the PRR statute. Gibson contended the 1997 release date used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>the trial court was from a temporary detention pending a ruling on Gibson\u2019s alleged parole violation and, thus, was no valid release date for purposes of PRR sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The state trial court denied summarily Gibson\u2019s motion, in the light of records provided by the Department of Correction\u2019s Bureau of Central Records (\u201cBureau\u201d). The state appellate court reversed and remanded, concluding that the Bureau\u2019s records \u2014 which showed only that Gibson\u2019s last release date was in 1997\u2014 failed to address Gibson\u2019s contention that his 1997 release was only from a <em>temporary </em>detention. On remand, the state trial court again denied Gibson\u2019s motion based on additional documents provided by the Bureau. The state appellate court reversed and remanded again. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and again denied Gibson\u2019s motion. The state appellate court reversed and remanded a third time, concluding that the state failed to refute Gibson\u2019s claim that his 1997 release was from a temporary detention and, thus, was no valid release date for purposes of PRR sentencing. Then, Gibson was resentenced (as a non-PRR) to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, was credited for time served, and was released immediately-</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Gibson filed this civil action against the Chief of Bureau of Central Records, an action purporting to allege violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court dismissed Gibson\u2019s first amended complaint for failure to state a claim and denied, as futile, Gibson\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). Although we construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>pro se </em>litigants must still conform to procedural rules. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">To survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A complaint containing only \u201cnaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\u201d or \u201c[tjhreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">To avoid dismissal of his section 1983 claim, Gibson must allege facts demonstrating that he was deprived of a constitutional right by a person acting under color of state law. <em>See Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Gibson must also allege facts demonstrating \u201can affirmative causal connection between the official\u2019s acts or omissions and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>See Zatler v. Wainwright, </em>802 F.2d 397, 401 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">In his first amended complaint, Gibson alleged that the unnamed Records Custodian acted with deliberate indifference by refusing to produce exculpatory evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>to the state attorney and by giving \u201cmomentum and impetus to the prosecution\u201d to oppose Gibson\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence. Gibson provides no factual support for his conclusory allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Among other things, never has Gibson identified \u201cexculpatory evidence\u201d that the Records Custodian allegedly concealed intentionally or otherwise failed to produce. Gibson has also alleged no facts demonstrating a causal connection between the Records Custodian\u2019s alleged acts and delay in Gibson\u2019s obtaining relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The record demonstrates that the state appellate court concluded repeatedly that the Bureau\u2019s records were insufficient to establish Gibson\u2019s PRR status. Yet the state attorney continued to argue \u2014 and the state trial court continued to rule \u2014 that Gibson was unentitled to relief. On this record, it appears that the delay in Gibson\u2019s resentencing was proximately caused by the state attorney\u2019s and the state trial court\u2019s continued misapplication of the PRR statute, <em>not </em>by the Records Custodian\u2019s alleged failure to produce some evidence. Because Gibson failed to state a claim for relief that was plausible on its face, Gibson\u2019s first amended complaint was dismissed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">The district court also committed no error in denying Gibson\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion, but review <em>de novo </em>whether a proposed amendment would be futile. <em>Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 869 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">\u201cOrdinarily, if the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, leave to amend should be freely given.\u201d <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations and citations omitted). But leave to amend may be denied properly when the proposed amendment would be futile. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. A proposed amendment is \u201cfutile\u201d \u201cwhen the complaint as amended is still subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">In his proposed second amended complaint, Gibson first sought to replace the unnamed \u201cJohn Doe\u201d with two named former Chiefs of Bureau of Central Records, McKinnley Crockett and John McLaughlin. Gibson alleges no facts supporting his conclusory allegations against Crockett or McLaughlin or establishing a causal connection between the two proposed defendants\u2019 alleged acts and the delay in Gibson\u2019s obtaining relief. As a result, Gibson\u2019s claims against Crockett and McLaughlin are subject to dismissal for the same reasons that Gibson\u2019s claim against \u201cJohn Doe\u201d was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Gibson also sought to add as defendants former Secretaries of the Florida Department of Corrections Walter McNeil and James McDonough, in their official capacities. Gibson\u2019s claims against McNeil and McDonough are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Gamble v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Rehab. Serv., </em>779 F.2d 1509, 1512 (11th Cir.1986) (the Eleventh Amendment bars \u201cdamages awards against state officers sued in their official capacities in suits brought in federal court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Because Gibson\u2019s proposed second amended complaint was subject to dismissal, the district court committed no error in denying Gibson leave to amend. <em>See Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">. Gibson has abandoned expressly his claim against Michael Crews, in his official capacity, as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-11\">. Gibson's complaint also included a state law claim for negligence. On appeal, Gibson raises no challenge to the district court\u2019s refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claim or to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his state law claim. These arguments are abandoned. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., 522 </em>F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-12\">. In <em>Brinson v. State, </em>851 So.2d 815 (Fla.Ct.App.2003), the state court concluded that the term \"release,\u201d as used in Florida\u2019s PRR statute, means \"actual release from a state prison sentence, not release from a temporary confinement that happens to be in state prison,\u201d such as a temporary detention pending resolution of a parole violation charge. <em>See also Wencel v. State, </em>915 So.2d 1270 (Fla.Ct.App.2005) (instructing the trial court \u2014 when determining whether a defendant was sentenced properly under the PRR statute \u2014 to take judicial notice of the parole commission's order showing that defendant\u2019s controlled release had not been revoked).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
