The IJ\u2019s decision denied Palaj\u2019s application for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), withholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Lack of corroboration of Pa-laj\u2019s stories is a main concern. No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, unless the BIA adopts expressly the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). When the BIA \u201cadopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>legal determinations of the BIA. <em>Id. </em>Factual determinations are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence test;' and we \u201cmust affirm the decision of the Board if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2009) (alteration omitted). To reverse a fact determination, we must conclude \u201cthat the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d that is, a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion and membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">Uncorroborated testimony may be sufficient to demonstrate eligibility for asylum only where \u201cthe applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">Palaj sought relief based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. Briefly stated, Palaj says that he has been persecuted and threatened by supporters of the former Communist Party in Albania because of his political involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">In the 1960\u2019s, Palaj\u2019s father and aunt were imprisoned in Albania for engaging in anti-communist activities. In 1990, Pa-laj was also accused of anticommunist activities and fled to Yugoslavia to avoid imprisonment. When living in Belgrade, Serbia, Serbian authorities forced Palaj to return to Albania in 1993. Upon his return, Palaj became an active member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>the Democratic Party and worked on various election campaigns, including that of his cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">At some point after returning to Albania, Palaj says that he was harassed, beaten and shot in the foot<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by two <em>unknown </em>persons, who Palaj says were supporters of the former communist government. Fearing for his safety, Palaj fled to Italy in 1999. While in Italy, Palaj continued to support the Democratic Party in Albania, mainly through financial contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">In 2009, Palaj\u2019s brother \u2014 who was also living in Italy \u2014 was approached by two strangers who Palaj says asked questions about Palaj\u2019s whereabouts. A few days later, Palaj\u2019s brother was ambushed and beaten, causing him to have his arm amputated. During the beating, one of these attackers Palaj says told Palaj\u2019s brother \u201cOne day we will And your brother too.\u201d No statements from Palaj\u2019s brother or parents are in the record. No police records corroborate the attack on Palaj in the 1990\u2019s or that the attack- was linked to communist supporters; the Italian police report on the attack on Palaj\u2019s brother makes no <em>reference </em>to Palaj of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The IJ denied Palaj\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ determined that Palaj\u2019s testimony was \u201ctoo meager and generalized\u201d to satisfy his burden of proof. Given the lack of detail in Palaj\u2019s testimony \u2014 and Palaj\u2019s failure to present evidence corroborating his testimony \u2014 the IJ concluded that Palaj failed to meet his burden of proving eligibility for asylum. The IJ also concluded that the alleged harm Palaj suffered amounted to no persecution \u2014 for asylum \u2014 and that Palaj lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution either in Albania or in Italy. Because Palaj failed to satisfy the burden of proof required for asylum relief, the IJ also denied Palaj\u2019s claim for withholding of removal. About Palaj\u2019s claim for CAT relief, the IJ concluded that Palaj failed to show that he would more-likely-than-not be tortured if removed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The BIA dismissed Palaj\u2019s appeal. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination that Palaj failed to present detailed testimony or to submit corroborating documents sufficient to satisfy his burden .of proof. As a result, the BIA declined to address Palaj\u2019s appellate arguments about past and future persecution. The BIA also concluded that Palaj failed to demonstrate eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">On appeal, Palaj argues that the BIA erred when it concluded that the.IJ found that Palaj\u2019s petition lacked corroborating evidence. This argument is refuted plainly by the record. In an oral decision, the IJ explained that Palaj failed to meet his burden of proof based both on the lack of detail in the record and the lack of \u201cfurther corroboration.\u201d Moreover, the IJ explained that relief can be denied when an applicant fails to submit sufficient corroborating evidence, and then noted \u201c[t]hat is the problem that I see in this particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Palaj\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in determining that the IJ made an adverse credibility finding is also mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>placed: the BIA made no such determination. Instead, the BIA noted \u2014 correctly\u2014 that the IJ concluded that Palaj failed to meet his burden of proof. An asylum applicant cannot satisfy his burden of proof when the applicant\u2019s testimony fails to \u201crefer[ ] to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee\u201d and where the applicant fails to \u201cprovide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). Moreover, because the burden of proof lies with the applicant, the IJ committed no error in failing to pose specific questions to Palaj to elicit more detailed testimony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1168(b)(1)(B)\u00ae; <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Palaj\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum forecloses his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4. In addition, substantial evidence supports the denial of Palaj\u2019s claim for CAT relief because Palaj failed to demonstrate that it was more-likely-than-not that he would be tortured (or that such torture would be by or with the acquiescence of the government) if removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-11\">, Palaj\u2019s wife and daughter are listed as derivative beneficiaries in Palaj\u2019s asylum application; so our decision about Palaj also applies to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">. This incident is the only instance in which Palaj says that <em>he </em>was attacked physically by anyone. We note that Palaj's story about whether he was shot in the foot, shot in the back, or escaped this encounter unharmed has not been consistent in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-12\">. The IJ also concluded that Palaj was ineligible for asylum relief, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi), because he had firmly resettled in Italy. Because we affirm on other independent grounds, we need not address whether Palaj is also ineligible for asylum relief based on his residency in Italy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b895-8\">. We lack jurisdiction to consider Palaj\u2019s arguments that he, in fact, submitted sufficient corroborating documents to support his claims for relief: Palaj failed to raise that argument in his appeal to the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). We also lack jurisdiction to consider Palaj\u2019s claims that he demonstrated past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution, because the BIA declined to address those claims on appeal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
