After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">I. DRUG TRAFFICKING OFFENSE UNDER \u00a7 2L1.2</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">On appeal, Cruz contends the district court erred when it increased his offense level by 16 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), based on Cruz\u2019s 2003 Alabama conviction for trafficking in methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We first review how Cruz\u2019s guidelines range was calculated and then the relevant law about the 16-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">At sentencing, the district court calculated a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Over Cruz\u2019s objection, the district court added 16 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), because Cruz was previously deported in 2005 after being convicted of felony methamphetamine trafficking in Alabama and sentenced to 15 years in state prison. After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), Cruz had a total offense level of 21. Based on his multiple prior criminal convictions, Cruz was assigned a criminal history category of IV, which yielded an advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months. Cruz asked for a downward variance to his time served of approximately 6 months, which the district court denied. The district court imposed a 57-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2, an illegal reentry defendant receives a 16-level increase in his offense level if he was previously deported after he was convicted of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.l(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">The Alabama statute Cruz was convicted of violating provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny person who ... is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, 28 grams or more of methamphetamine ... is guilty of a felony, which felony shall be known as \u2018trafficking in methamphetamine.\u2019 \u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-231(ll)(a). Cruz argues that this offense is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2 because the Alabama statute does not have as an element the intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Alabama\u2019s scheme of drug possession crimes is a three-tiered classification system based on the amount of drugs possessed, with the least serious offense being simple possession, the next serious being possession with intent to distribute, and the most serious being drug trafficking. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-3(b); 13A12-211; 13A-12-212; 13A-12-231. For methamphetamine offenses in Alabama, simple possession is the knowing possession of any amount of a controlled substance, which is a Class C felony with a mandatory minimum prison term of 1 year and 1 day. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-212(a)(l), (b); 13A-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>5-6(a)(3). Possession with intent to distribute is the knowing possession of between 9 grams and 27 grams of methamphetamine, which is a- Class B felony with a mandatory minimum 2-year prison term. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-211(c)(6), (d), 13A-5-6(a)(2). Finally, trafficking in methamphetamine, <em>the crime of which Cruz-was convicted, </em>is the knowing possession of 28 grams or more of methamphetamine, which is a Class A felony with a mandatory minimum three-year sentence if the quantity of methamphetamine was between 28 grams and 499 grams. Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-231(ll)(a), (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">While this Court has not addressed the Alabama drug trafficking statute in regards to \u00da.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, we have addressed Georgia\u2019s statute, which is nearly identical. In <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir.2003), this Court addressed the same argument that Cruz now makes with respect to a Georgia conviction for trafficking in methamphetamine and \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Guidelines. Like the Alabama statute here, Georgia\u2019s statute defined the offense as the \u201cpossession of 28 grams or more of methamphetamine.\u201d <em>See Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1231; <em>see also </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-13-31(e). This Court explained that, although the Georgia statute contained no explicit intent to distribute, under Georgia\u2019s three-tiered drug offense scheme, it was a more serious offense than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute, and thus the statute \u201cnecessarily infers an intent to distribute once a defendant possesses a certain amount of drugs.\u201d <em>Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1231-32.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <em>Madera-Madera </em>court held that the Georgia methamphetamine conviction fell within \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">This Court subsequently concluded that <em>Madera-Madera </em>dictated that a defendant\u2019s Florida offense of trafficking in cocaine by possession of between 200 and 400 grams was a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), because Florida\u2019s three-tiered scheme was \u201cnot materially distinguishable\u201d from Georgia\u2019s scheme. <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1155 (11th Cir.2005). We explained that Florida\u2019s drug trafficking, statute, like Georgia\u2019s, \u201cnecessarily infers an intent to distribute once a defendant possesses 28 grams or more.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Accordingly, based on <em>Madera-Madera, </em>we too conclude here that Alabama\u2019s drug trafficking statute \u201cnecessarily infers an intent to distribute,\u201d if at least 28 grams-of methamphetamine is possessed and, thus, a conviction under that statute qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the \u2022 meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">II. DUE PROCESS CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Cruz argues that, at sentencing, the district court violated his right to due process by considering the government\u2019s unproven proffer that Cruz had an outstanding arrest warrant in Florida for his alleged participation in a 2011 methamphetamine sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">To establish that a defendant\u2019s due process rights have been violated by the sentencing court, the defendant must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>that: (1) the challenged evidence is materially false or unreliable and (2) it actually served as the basis for the sentence. <em>United States v. </em>Ghertler, 605 F.3d 1256, 1269 (11th Cir.2010). The defendant bears the burden of proving that the court explicitly relied on the information. Id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Here, Cruz cannot carry his burden to establish a due process violation because the record does not show that the district court relied upon the government\u2019s proffered, but unproven, information about an outstanding warrant. Specifically, Cruz\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated that: (1) Cruz had a pending charge in Florida for trafficking in amphetamine or methamphetamine based on his delivering a bag of methamphetamine to a confidential informant who was working with a drug task force in August 2011; (2) a \u201ccapias\u201d issued on October 2, 2012 for this pending charge; and (3) the probation officer had confirmed that Cruz had the outstanding warrant with the sheriffs office in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Cruz did not object to the pending charge information in the PSI before or at the beginning of the first sentencing hearing, when the district court asked for objections to the PSI. However, once the government referred to the outstanding warrant in opposing Cruz\u2019s request for a downward variance to time served, Cruz objected to the information. Cruz pointed out that the arrest warrant did not issue for over a - year and was never served. Cruz further maintained that he was not \u201cthe person who they believe committed this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The district court expressed reluctance to vary downward to time served if Cruz had engaged in the very serious conduct alleged in the outstanding warrant. The district court continued the sentencing hearing so that the government could obtain more evidence as to the outstanding warrant. When the sentencing hearing resumed, th\u00e9 government advised the district court that it had contacted the clerk of the state court and the sheriffs office and confirmed that a detainer was now lodged against Cruz, that Cruz\u2019s vehicle had been pulled over for a traffic violation as part of an undercover drug investigation, but the arrest warrant was delayed so that the larger investigation could be developed. The government, however, did not present any evidence to support its contentions. Instead, Cruz submitted a copy of the outstanding arrest warrant, but he continued to insist that he was not the person identified in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">On appeal, Cruz argues that, because he objected, the government had the burden to prove the disputed information \u2014 that he was the person described in the outstanding warrant who participated in the methamphetamine sale to the confidential informant \u2014 but the government failed to do so. The problem for Cruz is that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the disputed information was materially false and unreliable, the district court did not refer to it when it denied Cruz\u2019s request for a downward variance or when it imposed the 57-month sentence. Rather, the district court explicitly stated that its reasons for denying the downward variance included Cruz\u2019s prior 15-year sentence for his 2003 methamphetamine trafficking conviction, his high criminal history category (in which the outstanding warrant had no bearing), and the seriousness of the charged reentry offense. Thus, on the record before us, Cruz has not shown that the outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>warrant or his alleged participation in a 2011 methamphetamine sale to a confidential informant served as the basis for his sentence. <em>See Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1269. Accordingly, Cruz\u2019s has not established that the sentencing court violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">For all these reasons, we affirm Cruz\u2019s conviction and 57-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). <em>United States v.
