While in Honduras, appellant had sent a letter to the Scandinavian Union in New Orleans requesting a seaman\u2019s job. When a reply letter made the job prospect appear promising, appellant came to New Orleans and secured work on the M/S NO-PAL VEGA within a few weeks. His seaman\u2019s contract on the vessel, which is Norwegian registered and manned almost exclusively by Norwegians, was signed in New Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">That same month, while the M/S NOPAL VEGA was docked at Monrovia, Liberia, appellant was struck in the eye by a piece of wire apparently thrown by the sanding machine, used to remove rust from the ship, which he and another seaman were operating. Although the eye was treated by a physician in Monrovia, it became infected and, on December 2, 1975, it was necessary for appellant to leave the ship for medical treatment at Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Appellant remained in a medical clinic there for about ten days, at which point, because his eye did not heal, the Norwegian Consul advised him to return to New Orleans and seek help from the Scandinavian Union. Norwegian authorities sent appellant by plane to New Orleans, where he received treatment which did not prevent the onset of blindness in the eye. Appellant received Norwegian compensation, and his medical and hospital bills were paid pursuant to the seaman\u2019s contract, crew\u2019s articles and Norwegian law. Appellant has remained in the United States since his treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Appellee Rederi, the Norwegian corporation sued for damages by appellant under the Jones Act, moved for summary judgment based on the above facts, which are established by discovery and several affidavits. Appellee argued that summary judgment was appropriate because jurisdiction was lacking. After holding a hearing, the district court ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">Motion for summary judgment will be granted. The Court feels the contact in this case is insufficient for the Court to assume jurisdiction. Motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">An order consequently issued dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-20\">Appellant Nunez-Lozano contends that summary judgment was granted improperly, since contacts with the United States sufficed to establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The leading Jones Act case on the issues presented is <em>Lauritzen v. Larsen, </em>345 U.S. 571, 73 S.Ct. 921, 97 L.Ed. 1254 (1953), which lists criteria or \u201ccontacts\u201d that \u201cserve as an appropriate yardstick for a district court in deciding whether . . . [to] accept ... jurisdiction of a controversy which is essentially foreign.\u201d <em>Anastasiadis v. S. S. Little John, </em>346 F.2d 281, 283 (5th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 920, 86 S.Ct. 1368, 16 L.Ed.2d 440 (1966). Once adequate discovery is completed, which is the case here, <em>Lauritzen </em>criteria can properly be applied on summary judgment. <em>Yohanes v. Ayers Steamship Co., Inc., </em>451 F.2d 349 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 919, 92 S.Ct. 1771, 32 L.Ed.2d 118 (1971); <em>Merren v. A/S Borgestad, </em>519 F.2d 82 (5th Cir. 1975) (grants of summary judgment affirmed). <em>See Tamboris v. Kainis Compania Maritima, S. A., </em>439 F.2d 1131 (5th Cir. 1971) (dismissal of complaint affirmed).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">As applied to this case, the <em>Lauritzen </em>criteria are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">(1) place of the wrong \u2014 Liberia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">(2) law of the flag \u2014 Norwegian:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">(3) domicile of injured seaman \u2014 Honduras (at time of accident);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">(4) allegiance of shipowner \u2014 Norway;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">(5) place of contract \u2014 United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">(6) accessibility of foreign forum \u2014 inapplicable, since benefits have been paid under the Norwegian compensation system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">(7) law of the forum \u2014 inapplicable when defendant was involuntarily made a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">The shipowner\u2019s base of operations, which here is Norway except for some husbanding agents in the United States, is also to be considered. <em>Hellenic Lines v. Rhoditis, </em>398 U.S. 306, 309, 90 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 26 L.Ed.2d 252 (1970). <em>See Merren, supra </em>at 83 (shipping agents in United States insufficient to constitute \u201cbase of operations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">The district court decided correctly that jurisdiction should not be assumed. The place of the contract was in New Orleans; but the Supreme Court, while considering contractual situs as a proper jurisdictional criterion, has likewise deprecated its importance. <em>Lauritzen, supra, </em>345 U.S. at 588, 73 S.Ct. at 931. Appellant urges, nonetheless, that jurisdiction should be taken since the existence of stockholders in \u201ccompanion corporations\u201d prove that appellee\u2019s corporate citizenship is not \u201cexclusively Norwegian.\u201d Yet, although appellant is correct on this point, the record falls far short of establishing that this case is analogous to <em>Rhoditis, </em>where the Supreme Court found Jones Act jurisdiction in part because ninety-five per cent of the stock in a shipping corporation was owned by a United States domiciliary. Nor is it apparent how appellant\u2019s post-injury establishment of residence in the United States justifies taking jurisdiction, especially in light of the benefits and compensation owed and received from Norwegian sources and appellant\u2019s Honduran citizenship. The majority of important contacts in this case are elsewhere and do not justify our assumption of jurisdiction. The district judge did not abuse his discretion in so deciding. <em>Fisher v. Agios Nicolaos v., </em>628 F.2d 308 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"Aph\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
