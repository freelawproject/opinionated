The action was filed by the Taxpayers, Homeowners and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Tenants Protective Association, Inc. against the mayor of Miami Beach, its city commission, and the Miami Beach Redevelopment Agency, alleging that these officials violated the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985, by illegally transferring title to certain property.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Joseph A. Wanick, had been city attorney for some twenty years, until February, 1979. The suit was filed in October of 1979. The defendants moved to disqualify Wanick, arguing that he had been \u201cintimately involved\u201d in the redevelopment project of which the challenged conveyance was an important part. They contended that his representation contravened Canon 9-101(B) of the Florida Bar\u2019s Code of Ethics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">A lawyer shall not accept a private employment in a matter in which he had substantial responsibility while he was a public employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The district court held a full evidentiary hearing, and ordered Wanick\u2019s disqualification, finding that \u201cMr. Wanick was <em>instrumental </em>in advising the City Commission on all legal aspects of the redevelopment plan. .. . and that the matters involved in the pending suit are substantially related to those matters in which Mr. Wanick participated in as City Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">On this appeal, Wanick and the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred (1) where, in their view, the evidence showed no involvement on Wanick\u2019s part in the disputed transaction; (2) in refusing to hold that the new city attorney was estopped to move for disqualification where he had allegedly committed a breach of ethics by representing individual defendants at taxpayers\u2019 expense; (3) in rejecting the argument that defendants had waived any objection to the representation by having previously filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of mootness; and (4) in refusing to find that Canon 9-101(B) is unconstitutionally vague. We reject each of these arguments, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">While appellants contend that the district court erred in finding as a matter of fact that Wanick was connected with the project in such a way as to make his disqualification necessary, we do not perceive the assertion to be relevant. The district court did not hold that counsel was directly involved in the transaction now challenged; rather, it found Wanick to have had \u201csubstantial responsibility\u201d over the area so as to come within Canon 9-101(B). We cannot hold that conclusion to be clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The disqualification on that ground was amply supported by authority. <em>See Armstrong v. McAlpin, </em>606 F.2d 28 (2 Cir. 1979); <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Dean Foods, </em>605 F.2d 380 (8 Cir. 1979); <em>In Re Special February 1977 Grand Jury, </em>581 F.2d 1262, 1264 (7 Cir. 1978); <em>In Re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, </em>530 F.2d 83 (5 Cir. 1976); <em>Whiting Corp. v. White Machinery Corp., </em>567 F.2d 713, 715 (7 Cir. 1977); <em>American Can Company v. Citrus Feed Company, </em>436 F.2d 1125 (5 Cir. 1971); <em>United States v. Trafficante, </em>328 F.2d 117 (5 Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">We find no constitutional defect in the Canon under consideration, and hold the appellant\u2019s other points to be meritless. Disqualification matters are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we find no abuse of that discretion to have been committed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
