We affirmed Debra\u2019s convictions. <em>State v. </em>Bockorny, 124 Or App 585, 863 P2d 1296 (1993). Defendant appeals his convictions for aggravated felony murder (first degree sodomy), aggravated felony murder (first degree sexual abuse), aggravated murder/concealment (first degree sodomy), aggravated murder/concealment (first degree sexual abuse), aggravated murder/concealment (attempted first-degree sexual abuse), intentional murder and felony murder. ORS 163.095; ORS 163.115. The jury rejected the state\u2019s request for the death penalty. The court sentenced defendant to life in prison with concurrent 30-year mandatory minimum terms on the aggravated murder counts and a 20-year mandatory minimum term on the felony murder count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Defendant and his wife met Spicer in a bar after a day of heavy drinking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Debra is bisexual. The three eventually ended up at the Bockorny residence, where Spicer was murdered. Defendant and Debra took Spicer\u2019s body and threw it over a cliff into the Clackamas River.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Defendant testified, admitting that he assisted Debra in disposing of Spicer\u2019s body, but denying that he had anything to do with the murder. His testimony was that, when the three arrived at the residence, Debra initiated an act of oral sex with him in the presence of Spicer. Defendant ejaculated. Debra and Spicer began engaging in sexual activities in the bedroom. Defendant went into another room, lay down on the bed and passed out. He testified that he was suddenly awakened by a noise, went back into the bedroom and saw Debra on top of Spicer. When Debra got off, defendant testified that he saw that Spicer had been stabbed, and Debra told him that Spicer was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Spicer died as a result of stab wounds to the chest and abdomen and asphyxiation by manual strangulation. Her face was badly bruised and both eyes were blackened. She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>naked and her body had bruises consistent with her having been held down. There were no defensive wounds. Two sperm heads were identified in material recovered from Spicer\u2019s mouth. The state\u2019s theory was that defendant and Debra took Spicer to their house where defendant had oral sex with Spicer. Thereafter, defendant and Debra stabbed and choked Spicer to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court erred in denying his demurrer to the indictments and in denying his motion for judgments of acquittal on the ground that the indictments failed to inform him of the nature of the crimes with which he was charged. He argues that, although the indictments allege the elements of homicide, they fail to allege the specific elements of the underlying crimes of sodomy in the first degree and sexual abuse in the first degree that elevate the homicide to aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Defendant was first indicted jointly with Debra in 1989. In 1990, he was individually indicted in a second five-count indictment. He went to trial on two counts in the 1989 indictment, as well as the five counts alleged in the 1990 indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He demurred to the 1989 indictment, but did not demur to the 1990 indictment. His first attempt to challenge the sufficiency of the charges alleged in the 1990 indictment was by the motions for judgment of acquittal after the state\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The proper time for an objection to the indictment is before trial. <em>State v. Montez, </em>309 Or 564, 597, 789 P2d 1352 (1990). The state argues that defendant failed to preserve any objection to the charges in the 1990 indictment, because his demurrer was not made at arraignment. <em>See State v. McKenzie, </em>307 Or 554, 558, 771 P2d 264 (1989). However, even assuming that defendant\u2019s objections to the 1989 indictment preserved a challenge to the charges in the 1990 indictment, the court did not err in denying the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The Supreme Court recently rejected a challenge to an indictment for aggravated murder on the ground that it was indefinite and uncertain because it did not specify the state\u2019s theory or the elements of sexual abuse. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>313 Or 356, 380, 836 P2d 1308 (1992), <em>cert </em>den_ US_, 122 L Ed 2d 789 (1993). An aggravated murder indictment does not necessarily need to allege all of the elements of the underlying crimes nor the manner in which those crimes were committed. <em>State v. Montez, supra, </em>309 Or at 597. An indictment in the language of the statute generally is sufficient. <em>State v. Nussbaum, </em>261 Or 87, 91, 491 P2d 1013 (1972). The counts here were phrased in the statutory language and sufficiently apprised defendant of the charges against him to enable him to make his defense. <em>State v. Cohen, </em>289 Or 525, 529, 614 P2d 1156 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Defendant next argues that the court erred in denying four of his motions for judgments of acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could find him guilty. He contends that the evidence did not show that he was personally involved in causing Spicer\u2019s death, that there was no evidence that any sexual act occurred with forcible compulsion or without Spicer\u2019s consent and that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that any sexual crime \u2014 as opposed to sexual act \u2014 had occurred at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The only evidence supporting defendant\u2019s version of the events was his testimony. The jury was not bound to accept his version of the facts. <em>See State v. Rose, </em>311 Or 274, 284, 810 P2d 839 (1991). The state presented evidence that defendant, a violent, intoxicated man, took Spicer to his house, had sex with her, that she was attacked and that she died as a result of stabbing and strangulation. It presented evidence that defendant disposed of Spicer\u2019s body, concealed evidence of the crime and fled the state. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant subjected Spicer to sexual contact or deviate sexual intercourse through forcible compulsion and that he personally murdered her.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Defendant next argues that the court erred in allowing the state to call one of his expert witnesses to provide testimony on behalf of the state when the testimony exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the scope of the expert\u2019s testimony on defendant\u2019s direct examination. During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, state criminalist Scarpone testified that, using the \u201cChristmas tree stain\u201d method on material taken from Spicer\u2019s mouth, she had identified two sperm heads. During defendant\u2019s case, one of his experts, Dr. Brady, testified that, in his opinion, the objects found in the victim\u2019s mouth were not sperm heads. Another expert, Dr. Grimsbo, also testified during defendant\u2019s case. His testimony was limited to whether material on scissors found in defendant\u2019s van was blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Before Grimsbo testified, the prosecutor had contacted him to discuss the question of the blood on the scissors. During their discussion, the prosecutor also asked Grimsbo some questions regardingthe stain method used to detect the presence of sperm in Spicer\u2019s mouth. Grimsbo later contacted the prosecutor to see if he could examine the slides, and the prosecutor complied. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the court for permission to examine Grimsbo on a matter beyond the scope of his direct examination, that is, his expertise in the use of biological stains. The court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the state putting on rebuttal at that time. Grimsbo was excused, \u201csubject to recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">After Grimsbo\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor stated that, in order to rebut Brady\u2019s testimony, he wanted to call Grimsbo to testify that he had looked at the slides. The court then examined Grimsbo out of the presence of the jury. Grimsbo testified that he had discussed the issue of longevity of sperm with the defense team and later had received a phone call from defense counsel stating that the defense would question him only about the blood on the scissors. He told the court that, pursuant to the trial court\u2019s order, defense counsel also informed him that the defense could not tell him not to talk to the prosecution. Grimsbo also told the court that his discussions with the prosecutors did not relate to the testimony he gave for the defense and that he was not asked about conversations with the defense. In an offer of proof, the state then elicited testimony from Grimsbo that the Christmas tree stain method was accurate and that, in his opinion, sperm heads were correctly identified in the material recovered from Spicer\u2019s mouth. The court asked him whether he had ever discussed the matter of the stain method and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>identification of the sperm heads with the defense. Grimsbo stated that he had not. Defense counsel then moved to exclude Grimsbo from testifying in the state\u2019s rebuttal case on the ground that his testimony was \u201cwork product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">An <em>in camera </em>proceeding followed. There, defense counsel testified that Grimsbo had told the defense team that, \u201cif he were asked, he would express an opinion that those two objects in the slide were in fact sperm heads * * *.\u201d However, defense counsel\u2019s testimony did not contradict Grimsbo\u2019s claim that he had not discussed the accuracy of the Christmas tree stain method with the defense team. The prosecutor then told the court that Grimsbo would not be asked his opinion about the sperm heads, but would be examined only about the accuracy of the Christmas tree stain method.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The court allowed the state to call Grimsbo in rebuttal, and he testified about stain methods and slide preparation, use of the Christmas tree stain in identifying spermatozoa, his experience with that stain method and the identification of sperm heads not connected to their tails. He did not give an opinion as to whether the material found in Spicer\u2019s mouth contained sperm heads. Defense counsel then cross-examined Grimsbo, attacking his credentials and the basis for his opinion that the Christmas tree stain is an effective scientific method. During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s \u201cown expert, Dr. Grimsbo, told you that that test is a valid test for sperm with a sperm tail or without. He testified to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Under ORCP 36B(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a lawyer may avoid discovery of records of interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions and other similar data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>prepared by the lawyer to further the client\u2019s interest in pending litigation. Defendant\u2019s position is that, although the immunity from discovery under that provision is not absolute, there is no rational basis for giving protection to the written opinions and impressions of the expert while disallowing protection for opinions and impressions of the expert that have not been reduced to writing. He argues that allowing the prosecution to elicit impressions of a defendant\u2019s expert witness on subjects that were not elicited or relied on by defendant permits the prosecution to question the expert in such a manner that it appears that the expert is joining the ranks of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The state contends that no law is violated when the prosecution calls an expert, who has been hired by a defendant to testify regarding one subject, to testify regarding an unrelated subject. It argues that Grimsbo\u2019s testimony on rebuttal regarding the Christmas tree stain method did not violate any discovery statute or privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">There was no evidence that biological staining was a subject for which the defense retained Grimsbo or that it had been a subject of discussion between Grimsbo and the defense. Therefore, Grimsbo\u2019s testimony was not privileged under the attorney-client privilege, nor could it be called work product.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant argues, however, that allowing or requiring an expert witness to testify as to matters that are not part of the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief creates a conflict of interest. He argues that it creates a situation in which the prosecution can go to defendant\u2019s expert and ask that expert also to work for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">There is no dispute that, if an expert is willing to give opinions to both sides, a litigant can be placed in a difficult, if not impossible, situation at trial. However, it is not a situation prohibited by law. Here, the prosecution\u2019s questions about the Christmas tree stain method were questions asked of an expert witness about a subject within the expertise of the witness. The prosecution was free to inquire as to whether Grimsbo had an opinion about a subject within his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>expertise. It could have done so even if Grimsbo had not chosen to discuss the subject with the prosecution before he testified. However, in that instance, the prosecution would have run the risk that Grimsbo\u2019s testimony would be damaging to its case. Here, that risk was eliminated when Grimsbo voluntarily gave an opinion to the prosecution, thereby alerting the prosecution to a weakness in defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Defendant next argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of prior bad acts committed by Debra. Defendant sought to admit evidence that Debra carried a knife that she threatened to use on anyone who came between her and defendant, that she slapped another woman and attacked her with a knife, that she shot a former husband and that she hit a former husband on the head with a hammer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The basis of defendant\u2019s offer for the admission of the evidence was that they were \u201csignature-type identity-type of acts.\u201d OEC 404(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The attacks on former husbands were not similar to the method of Spicer\u2019s death; the similarity in the attack on the woman to Spicer\u2019s death was the use of a knife. We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s determination that the excluded evidence did not demonstrate a high degree of similarity and a distinctive nature of the methodology of prior and current misdeeds. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>313 Or 189, 197, 832 P2d 443 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Defendant argues, however, that Debra\u2019s prior violent acts were highly probative of his defense that it was she who committed the murder. He contends that the rationale for excluding evidence of prior bad acts \u2014 that a defendant will be tried on the basis of his or her propensities or that a victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>got what he or she deserved \u2014 does not apply if the evidence is of prior bad acts of a third party to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Character evidence, whether of a party or non-party, carries a risk of diverting the jury\u2019s attention from what a person did on a specific occasion to what that person has done in the past. <em>See </em>Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence </em>139 (2d ed 1989). The legislature has not chosen to apply the exclusion of character evidence to only defendants or victims. Under OEC 404(4), it applies generally to \u201cpersons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Defendant next contends that the court abused its discretion in failing to define the term \u201cpersonally\u201d in the context of aggravated murder. The jury gave the court a written question: \u201cDoes personally mean solely, or could it be cooperative?\u201d After discussion with counsel, during which defense counsel stated that he thought the jury should be instructed that personally means \u201csolely, \u2019 \u2019 the court stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cI instruct you that the word \u2018personally\u2019 is a word of common usage that should be given its natural, plain, and obvious meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">There was no error. The court\u2019s instruction was based on <em>State v. Nefstad, </em>309 Or 523, 539, 789 P2d 1326 (1990), in which the Supreme Court discussed a similar argument regarding the word \u201cpersonally\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cDefendant argues that \u2018personally\u2019 is a word of \u2018common usage\u2019 that should be given its \u2018natural, plain and obvious meaning.\u2019 The state agrees. The logical consequence of this conclusion is that no instruction is required to tell the jurors what \u2018personally\u2019 means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">\u201c \u2018Personally\u2019 also is a word that was understandable to the jurors without elaboration by the trial court in the instructions. This does not mean that the words always will be easy to apply to a given set of facts, but the difficulty lies in the application and not in the definition of the word.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Defendant next assigns error to the court\u2019s requirement that he display to the jury the multiple tattoos on his arms and chest. He argues that the tattoos had no relevance to identity when, from the beginning of the trial, it was conceded that he was with Debra and Spicer until the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the murder. Defendant\u2019s position apparently is that the nature of the tattoos was prejudicial, although he does not specify why that is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The state argues that defendant\u2019s unusual tattoos were a key to his identity for several witnesses, particularly given that his appearance had changed substantially between the time of the murder and the time of trial, and that it was required to prove defendant\u2019s identity. It contends that it was not required to accept defendant\u2019s offered stipulation that he was in the company of the victim, <em>see State v. Leland, </em>190 Or 598, 630, 227 P2d 785 (1951), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom Leland v. Oregon, </em>343 US 790, 72 S Ct 1002, 96 L Ed 1302 (1952), and that the trial court carefully weighed the probative value against any prejudicial effect before concluding that the evidence should be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Witnesses remembered defendant, in part because of his distinctive tattoos. The trial court viewed the tattoos before requiring them to be shown to the jury and found no \u201cvisual prejudicial impact.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s requirement that defendant show them.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Defendant next assigns error to the court\u2019s instructions on \u201caiding and abetting.\u201d He argues that the instructions permitted the jury to convict him if they believed that he aided or abetted Debra in committing a sex crime and that there was no evidence that he did so. He also contends that the court abused its discretion in listing forcible compulsion as an element of the underlying sex crimes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>there was no evidence that the force that was apparent in the case accomplished the sexual act, or was in any way related to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">There was no error in the instructions. There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Debra sodomized and sexually abused the victim, that defendant aided and abetted her in doing so and that forcible compulsion was used. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>313 Or 19, 26, 828 P2d 1006, <em>cert </em>den-US_, 121 L Ed 2d 118 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Defendant\u2019s final assignment of error is that the court erred when it instructed the jury that felony murder was a lesser included offense in the several charges of aggravated murder. He contends that the state did not allege felony murder in the indictments and that it was never a subject of the state\u2019s discovery or in the state\u2019s opening argument. There was no error. The elements of aggravated murder, with which defendant was charged, include the elements of felony murder. ORS 136.465 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cIn all cases, the defendant may be found guilty of any crime the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which the defendant is charged in the accusatory instrument or of an attempt to commit such crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Defendant presents no authority for his position that a lesser included offense must be pleaded separately in the indictment or that the state must provide notice of a lesser included offense by discovery or during opening argument. A party is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction if a juror could conclude that, based on the evidence, the defendant was not guilty of the greater offense but was guilty of the lesser offense. <em>State v. Naylor, </em>291 Or 191, 195 n 2, 629 P2d 1308 (1981). The court did not err in its instructions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> Defendant raises no merger claims in this appeal, and we express no opinion about the correctness of the sentences imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> Debra\u2019s version of the events differs from defendant\u2019s. <em>See State v.
