The plaintiffs, Thomas Santa Barbara, Jr., and Frank Perrotti, Jr., the owners of real property (owners) condemned by the defendant town of Branford (town),* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the town\u2019s objection to the owners\u2019 offer of judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The owners claim that the court improperly concluded, on the basis of its determination that the offer of judgment statute conflicts with General Statutes \u00a7 8-130,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which specifically limits the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>prejudgment interest in condemnation cases, that \u00a7 52-192a cannot be utilized in a condemnation appeal. The owners contend that the eminent domain statutory scheme can be read harmoniously with \u00a7 52-192a, and that failure to apply \u00a7 52-192a to condemnation appeals would run contrary to that statute\u2019s well established puipose of encouraging pretrial settlements. The town maintains that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-133* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 37-3c<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provide the exclusive remedy for awards of prejudgment interest to property owners in condemnation cases and, therefore, the offer of judgment statute is inapplicable. The town also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the owners\u2019 offer of judgment was invalid because it did not offer to settle the case for a \u201c \u2018sum certain\u2019 \u201d as required by \u00a7 52-192a (a). We affirm the judgment of the trial court, albeit on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The facts underlying this appeal are set out more fully in the companion cases of <em>Branford </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara, </em>294 Conn. 785, 988 A.2d 209 (2010), and <em>New England Estates, LLC </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>294 Conn. 817, 988 A.2d 229 (2010), which were released on the same date as this opinion. The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. On December 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>2003, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-129 (a) (3),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the town filed a statement of compensation for the taking of property known as 48-86 Tabor Drive in Branford in the amount of $1,167,800. The town also deposited the sum of $1,167,800 with the clerk in the Superior Court. In May, 2004, the owners, believing the amount of the compensation to be inadequate, filed an appeal and application for review of the statement of compensation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-132 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, in May, 2005, pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (a), the owners filed an offer of judgment in the amount of $3,967,800. In its objection to the offer of judgment, the town argued that an offer of judgment is not appropriate in condemnation cases because an appeal from a statement of compensation does not seek the recovery of money damages and that the application of \u00a7 52-192a would be inconsistent with \u00a7 37-3c because \u00a7 37-3c specifically provides for the recovery of interest in condemnation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Following a hearing on September 19,2005, the court, <em>Blue, J., </em>sustained the objection to the offer of judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ment. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that \u00a7 52-192a, which awards prejudgment interest on the entire amount recovered, cannot be applied to condemnation appeals without violating \u00a7 8-130, which prohibits the assessment of interest on the amount deposited by the town in accordance with \u00a7 8-129 (a) (3). The court reasoned that applying \u00a7 8-130 to the exclusion of \u00a7 52-192a is consistent with the well established principle that statutes specific to a particular subject matter control over a more general statute that may also be applicable. See, e.g., <em>Griswold Airport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>289 Conn. 723, 729 n.10, 961 A.2d 338 (2008) (\u201c[i]t is a well-settled principle of [statutory] construction that specific terms covering [a] given subject matter will prevail over general language of . . . another statute which might otherwise prove controlling\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, the trial court concluded that an offer of judgment cannot be made in condemnation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The question of whether \u00a7 52-192a applies properly to an appeal from a statement of compensation presents a question of statutory construction, over which we employ plenary review. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 525, 978 A.2d 487 (2009). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>PJM &amp; Associates, LC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>292 Conn. 125, 134, 971 A.2d 24 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Our inquiry in any issue of statutoiy interpretation begins with the language of the statute at issue. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z; <em>Director of Health Affairs Policy Planning </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>293 Conn. 164, 170, 977 A.2d 148 (2009). The relevant language of \u00a7 52-192a (a) provides: \u201cAfter commencement of any civil action based upon contract or seeking the recovery of money damages, whether or not other relief is sought, the plaintiff may, not later than thirty days before trial, file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 signed by the plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney, directed to the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney, offering to settle the claim underlying the action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Section 52-192a is silent as to the inclusion or exclusion of condemnation appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>determine whether those appeals come within the purview of \u00a7 52-192a. By its terms, \u00a7 52-192a (a) sets out three elements that must be met in order to benefit from the offer of judgment statute. Specifically, the party must be: (1) a plaintiff; (2) in a civil action; (3) that is based upon contract or seeking the recovery of money damages. We turn our attention, then, to whether a condemnation appeal satisfies these three requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Because the question of whether persons who file an appeal from a statement of compensation are \u201cplaintiffs\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a (a) turns, in part, on whether such an appeal is a civil action, we first consider whether an appeal from a statement of compensation brought pursuant to \u00a7 8-132 is a civil action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 52-192a does not define \u201ccivil action,\u201d a civil action generally is an action that is commenced by service of process. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-45a and 52-91;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Tavares Pediatric Center, </em>276 Conn. 544, 557-58, 888 A.2d 65 (2006) (Rhode Island administrative proceeding not civil action because not commenced by service of process or controlled by rules of pleading). This rule, however, is not a hard and fast one. Administrative appeals, for example, are civil actions in some circumstances. See Practice Book \u00a7 14-6.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The offer of judgment statute, therefore, is not clear and unambiguous. See <em>PJM &amp; Associates, LC </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 292 Conn. 134 (\u201c[t]he test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, we turn to extratextua! sources for further guidance as to legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">A subsequent amendment to \u00a7 52-192a (a) is instructive. See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Electric Boat Corp., </em>283 Conn. 840, 855 n.8, 930 A.2d 653 (2007) (this court has previously considered subsequent enactments to illuminate legislative intent with respect to earlier legislation). In 2007, as part of its changes to eminent domain legislation following our decision in <em>Kelo </em>v. <em>New London, </em>268 Conn. 1, 843 A.2d 500 (2004), aff'd, 545 U.S. 469, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005), the legislature added the following language to \u00a7 52-192a (a): \u201cFor the purposes of this section, such plaintiff includes a counterclaim plaintiff under [\u00a7] 8-132 . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Public Acts 2007, No. 07-141, \u00a7 16 (P.A. 07-141). Public Act 07-141, \u00a7 9, also added the following language to \u00a7 8-132 (a): \u201cFor the purposes of [an application for review of a statement of compensation], review and appeal therefrom, and for the purposes of sections 52-192a to 52-195, inclusive . . . such applicant shall be deemed a counterclaim plaintiff.\u201d Thus, in 2007, the legislature unambiguously evidenced an intent that condemnation appeals should be subject to the offer of judgment statute. Significantly, the legislature made the amendments effective from the date of passage of the act, June 25, 2007, and with respect to \u00a7 8-132 the changes were \u201capplicable to property acquired on or after said date\u201d; P.A. 07-141, \u00a7 9; and with respect to \u00a7 52-192a \u201capplicable to applications filed on or after said date . . . .\u201d P.A. 07-141, \u00a7 16. \u201c[W]e will not impute to the legislature an intent that is not apparent from unambiguous statutory language in the absence of a compelling reason to do so. Rather, [w]e are bound to interpret legislative intent by referring to what the legislative text contains, not by what it might have contained.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Laliberte </em>v. <em>United Security, Inc., </em>261 Conn. 181, 186, 801 A.2d 783 (2002). Accordingly, by the express terms of P.A. 07-141, the 2007 amendments cannot be applied in the present case. See also <em>In re Michael S., </em>258 Conn. 621, 627, 784 A.2d 317 (2001) (\u201c[i]n determining the effect of a subsequent statutory amendment on earlier legislation . . . [w]e recognize the usual presumption that, in enacting a statute, the legislature intended a change in existing law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Additionally, like the trial court, we are mindful that \u201cspecific terms in a statute covering a given subject matter will prevail over the more general language of the same or another statute that otherwise might be controlling. . . . This oft-stated principle reflects the fact that specific statutory language constitutes a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>accurate representation of the legislature\u2019s purpose or intent than more general pronouncements concerning the same subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Thibo-deau </em>v. <em>Design Group One Architects, LLC, </em>260 Conn. 691, 713-14, 802 A.2d 731 (2002). Here, the legislature\u2019s amendment adding language that specifically applies the offer of judgment statute to condemnation appeals, effective after the passage of P.A. 07-141, controls over more general language, which does not directly implicate \u00a7 8-132. In other words, the amendment of \u00a7 52-192a in 2007 evidences the legislature\u2019s understanding that an amendment was necessary to bring condemnation appeals within the ambit of the offer of judgment statute. The corollary to that is the conclusion that, prior to 2007, the legislature did not intend for \u00a7 52-192a to be applicable to condemnation appeals. We conclude, therefore, that the offer of judgment statute did not, in 2005, apply in the context of condemnation appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The punitive nature of the offer of judgment statute supports our conclusion. See <em>Accettullo </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>256 Conn. 667, 672, 775 A.2d 943 (2001) (\u201cThe statute is admittedly punitive in nature. ... It is the punitive aspect of the statute that effectuates the underlying purpose of the statute and provides the impetus to settle cases.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Civiello </em>v. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., </em>208 Conn. 82, 91, 544 A.2d 158 (1988) (\u00a7 52-192a imposes \u201cinterest penalty\u201d). Because \u00a7 52-192a is punitive, we are required to construe it with \u201creasonable strictness in determining whether the act complained of comes within the description in the statute of the acts for which the person in fault is made liable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Alamo Management Co., </em>221 Conn. 674, 684, 607 A.2d 370 (1992) (discussing punitive provisions in context of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-46). Given the ambiguity of \u00a7 52-192a, we must interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>it in favor of the party who would be subject to the punitive consequences of the statute rather than in favor of the party who would benefit from those consequences. Accordingly, in the absence of clear evidence that the legislature intended the offer of judgment statute to apply to condemnation appeals prior to 2007, we cannot impose the consequences of \u00a7 52-192a on the town in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We recognize that in <em>Loomis Institute </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>234 Conn. 169,179-80, 661 A.2d 1001 (1995), we concluded, relying on the rules of practice, that \u00a7 52-192a applied in the context of tax appeals. Specifically, we noted that the rules of practice directly implement \u00a7 52-192a through Practice Book \u00a7 17-14, formerly Practice Book, 1978-97, \u00a7 346,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which \u201cmirror[s] the usage of \u2018civil action\u2019 that is found in the statute.\u201d Id., 180. We then concluded that because Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 14-5<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 14-6, formerly Practice Book, 1978-97, \u00a7\u00a7 255 and 256, respectively, define a tax appeal as a civil action, the trial court properly awarded interest to the taxpayer pursuant to \u00a7 52-192a. Id., 180-81. Although condemnation appeals, like tax appeals, fit within the definition of administrative appeals in the rules of practice, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>rules of statutory construction lead us to conclude that the subsequent amendment to \u00a7 52-192a is the more persuasive extratextual source because it applies specifically to \u00a7 8-132.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We also acknowledge the owners\u2019 argument that the application of \u00a7 52-192a to condemnation appeals would be consistent with the well established purpose of that statute: to encourage the settlement of cases and to provide punitive consequences for litigants who reject reasonable settlement offers. The town contends that \u00a7 8-133, which grants the court discretion to shift costs of court to the condemning agency; see footnote 5 of this opinion; is the sole remedy for owners who recover more than the sum in the statement of compensation. Although the General Assembly apparently agrees with the owners in this regard, P.A. 07-141 provides that \u00a7 52-192a is applicable only to property condemned on or after July 25, 2007, and, as we have recognized, it is the legislature, and not this court, that is responsible for formulating and implementing public policy. See <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Design Group One Architects, LLC, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 715. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly concluded that \u00a7 52-192a could not be used in this condemnation appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-132.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-192a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) After commencement of any civil action based upon contract or seeking the recovery of money damages, whether or not other relief is sought, the plaintiff may, not later than thirty days before trial, file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 signed by the plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney, directed to the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney, offering to settle the claim underlying the action and to stipulate to a judgment for a sum certain. The plaintiff shall give notice of the offer of settlement to the defendant\u2019s attorney .... Within sixty days after being notified of the filing of the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney may file with the clerk of the court a written \u2018acceptance of offer of judgment\u2019 agreeing to a stipulation for judgment as contained in plaintiffs \u2018offer of judgment\u2019. Upon such filing, the clerk shall enter judgment immediately on the stipulation. If the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 is not accepted within sixty days and prior to the rendering of a verdict by the jury or an award by the court, the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 shall be considered rejected and not subject to acceptance unless refiled. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">\u201c(b) After trial the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the sum certain stated in the plaintiffs \u2018offer of judgment\u2019, the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount, computed from the date such offer was filed in actions commenced before October 1, 1981. In those actions commenced on or after October 1, 1981, the interest shall be computed from the date the complaint in the civil action was filed with the court if the \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 was filed not later than eighteen months from the filing of such complaint. . . . The court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not to exceed three hundred fifty dollars, and shall render judgment accordingly. ...\u201d All references to \u00a7 52-192a in this opinion are to the 2005 revision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Section 52-192a was amended in 2005 by, inter alia, the substitution of \u201coffer of compromise\u201d for \u201coffer of judgment.\u201d See Public Acts 2005, No. 05-275, \u00a7 4 (P.A. 05-275). Because P.A. 05-275 is applicable to actions accruing on or after October 1, 2005, it is not applicable to the present matter.

See General Statutes \u00a7 48-6 (a) (any municipal corporation purchasing real property for its municipal purposes shall, if it cannot agree with owner regarding amount to be paid for property taken, proceed in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 48-12); General Statutes \u00a7 48-12 (procedure for condemning land under \u00a7 48-6 shall be in manner specified for redevelopment agencies in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-128 to 8-133, inclusive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-132 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person claiming to be aggrieved by the statement of compensation filed by the redevelopment agency may, at any time within six months after the statement of compensation has been filed, apply to the superior court for the judicial district in which such property is situated for a review of such statement of compensation so far as it affects such applicant. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\"> As we have already explained, in its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 52-192a appears to conflict with \u00a7 8-130. We do not necessarily agree that the two statutes cannot be reconciled; see <em>Rainforest Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Revenue Services, </em>293 Conn. 363, 378, 977 A.2d 650 (2009) (\u201c[i]f a court can by any fair interpretation find a reasonable field of operation for two allegedly inconsistent statutes, without destroying or preventing their evident meaning and intent, it is the duty of the court to do so\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); and note that, in other contexts, this court has harmonized seemingly conflicting statutes by considering the term \u201camount so recovered\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (b); within the context of the particular litigation. See, e.g., <em>Stiffter </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>288 Conn. 38, 49-50, 950 A.2d 1270 (2008) (when applying \u00a7 52-192a in context of uninsured motorist claims pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 [b], offer of judgment interest is based on judgment after remittitur rather than verdict amount); <em>Cardenas </em>v. <em>Mixcus, </em>264 Conn. 314, 318-19, 324, 823 A.2d 321 (2003) (jury verdict rather than award due plaintiff after apportionment to employer, who had previously paid plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation benefits, should be used to determine offer of judgment interest because employer stood in shoes of plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293); <em>Civiello </em>v. <em>Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., </em>208 Conn. 82, 91, 544 A.2d 158 (1988) (plaintiff not entitled to offer of judgment interest when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>jury returned verdict greater than amount in offer of judgment but amount recovered was reduced by remittitur pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a). We need not address this issue, however, for two reasons. First, as we conclude later in this opinion, the owners\u2019 appeal from the statement of compensation did not come within the class of cases to which \u00a7 52-192a was applicable in 2005. Second, the 2007 amendment to \u00a7 52-192a, which explicitly applies that statute to condemnation appeals, resolves any conflict with \u00a7 8-130. General Statutes \u00a7 52-192a (c), following its amendment by Public Acts 2007, No. 07-141, \u00a7 16, provides in relevant part that \u201cin the case of a counterclaim plaintiff under [\u00a7] 8-132, the court shall add to the amount so recovered eight per cent annual interest on the difference between the amount so recovered and the sum certain specified in the counterclaim plaintiffs offer of compromise. . . .\u201d The statute, as amended, does not, therefore, allow for interest on the amount deposited, thereby avoiding conflict with \u00a7 8-130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> This court has recognized that the filing of a statement of compensation does not originate a civil action. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Conn. 492, 494 n.l, 280 A.2d 351 (1971).
