The defendant claims that the trial court improperly accepted the arbitrator\u2019s determination regarding the arbitrability of the plaintiffs claims and, specifically, the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 4-61<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conclusion that the plaintiffs claims had been timely asserted under that statute. The defendant claims that it therefore follows that (1) the trial court and this court lack subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, (2) the plaintiffs claims are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>arbitrable, and (3) the award does not conform to the submission. The plaintiff responds that (1) the defendant is not entitled to judicial review of whether the plaintiffs claims are arbitrable under \u00a7 4-61 because the defendant submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator without objection, and (2) the trial court properly granted the plaintiffs application to confirm the award because the award conformed to the submission. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 13, 1992, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract pursuant to which the plaintiff agreed to perform masonry and plank work in connection with the construction of a correctional facility in Niantic. The plaintiff was to commence work on June 1,1992, and the contract provided for an overall project duration of 300 calendar days. The plaintiffs work on the project required coordination with various other contractors. Coordination was the responsibility of the defendant, which delegated that responsibility to its construction manager, Tishman Construction Corporation (Tishman). Tishman failed to schedule and coordinate the contractors properly, and, as a result, the plaintiff was delayed in performing its work. Ultimately, the plaintiff remained at the work site until November, 1993, well past the 300 day duration provided for in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Early on in the project, the plaintiff complained to the defendant that it would be incurring additional costs due to delays and issued to the defendant various notices of claims for reimbursement of such costs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>defendant initially disputed the plaintiffs claims but eventually, in October, 1994, authorized the issuance of several change orders that approved contract payment for the plaintiffs claims. On November 8, 1994, Tishman advised the plaintiff to submit two requisitions for payment, one for the value of the outstanding contract work, adjusted by the change orders, and the second for the retainage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, on November 10, 1994, the plaintiff submitted requisitions for payment in accordance with Tishman\u2019s directive. In December, 1994, the defendant issued a check to the plaintiff for the first requisition but did not pay the retainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In April, 1995, the defendant advised the plaintiff that it would issue final payment in exchange for a release in its favor. On May 22, 1995, the plaintiff gave the defendant a release, but the defendant subsequently failed to pay the plaintiff the retainage. The plaintiff sent letters to the defendant in June and July, 1995, advising that the release had been issued on the basis of the defendant\u2019s representation that it would issue the final payment. The defendant did not respond to these letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In March, 1996, the plaintiff again sent a letter to the defendant, advising that if it did not pay the balance in full, the plaintiff would take legal action. This letter also went unanswered. In August, 1996, however, the defendant advised the plaintiff that some of the buildings that the plaintiff had worked on were leaking due to the plaintiffs allegedly defective workmanship. In response, the plaintiff submitted a quote to perform the repair work, agreeing to absorb one third of the cost. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The plaintiff performed the work and submitted an invoice for two thirds of its cost. The defendant did not pay that invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Having received no satisfaction from its letters to the defendant seeking payment in the years that followed, the plaintiff submitted a notice of claim to the defendant on October 1, 2004, pursuant to \u00a7 4-61 (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, on or about August 1, 2005, the plaintiff filed a demand for arbitration, seeking damages for the following: (1) lost productivity arising from the delay that required the plaintiff to remain on site after the project completion date; (2) additional expenses incurred as a result of being forced to work during the winter of 1993; (3) reimbursement for the settlement of a delay claim asserted against the plaintiff by one of its subcontractors; (4) lost profits and overhead expenses; (5) payment of the outstanding contract balance; (6) payment for the repair work performed in 1996; and (7) prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In April, 2006, the arbitrator appointed to decide the parties\u2019 dispute conducted a preliminary telephone conference with the parties, during which the defendant asserted that the arbitrator lacked authority to consider the plaintiff\u2019s claims under \u00a7 4-61 because the plaintiff had not filed notice of its claim and had not commenced the arbitration within the statute\u2019s time limitations. The defendant then requested that the arbitrator decide the issue of his authority to hear the plaintiffs claims before proceeding further. Thereafter, the arbitrator ordered that the evidentiary hearings be bifurcated. In the initial phase of the proceedings, the arbitrator was to decide the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses of (1) sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>immunity based on the plaintiffs alleged failure to comply with the time limitations set forth in \u00a7 4-61, (2) release, and (3) settlement by accord and satisfaction. In the second phase, the arbitrator was to decide the merits of the plaintiffs claims. In an answering statement dated October 12, 2006, the defendant stated in relevant part: \u201cThe actual issues in this proceeding are [the plaintiffs] delay and disruption claims, and [the defendant\u2019s] special defenses that: [the plaintiffs] claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; [the plaintiff] released [the defendant] from its claims; and [the plaintiff] settled its claims with [the defendant]. Those issues may be heard and fully and finally determined by this arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\u201cThis approach is precisely what the parties anticipated at the outset of this arbitration. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On November 15 and 16, 2006, the arbitrator conducted the initial phase of the evidentiary hearings. On February 7, 2007, the arbitrator issued a preliminary ruling with respect to his authority to hear the case and the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses. In his ruling, the arbitrator concluded that he had authority under \u00a7 4-61 to arbitrate the plaintiffs claims and ruled against the defendant with respect to its defenses of release and settlement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the arbitrator found that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201c[i]nasmuch as no certificate of acceptance was ever issued [by the defendant] and [the plaintiff] was not terminated, it seems beyond doubt that the period for filing a claim, by the express language of [\u00a7 4-61], ha[d] not yet expired and that, therefore, the notice filed in 2004 and the arbitration demand filed in 2005 [were] . . . timely.\u201d The arbitrator further found that \u201c[a]rticle 33 of the contract provides a context to construe \u2018termination.\u2019 \u2018Termination\u2019 there refers to a process for ending the contract prior to completion, either for reasons of default or for the state\u2019s convenience. Accordingly, in the context of the contract . . . there was no premature termination of the contract by [the defendant], and, therefore, the time for filing the notice of claim and demand for arbitration ha[d] not been triggered by a \u2018termination.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">On January 25, 2008, the arbitrator issued his decision, award and findings of fact on the merits of the plaintiffs claims. The arbitrator awarded the plaintiff $434,974.34, which included damages for each of the claims that the plaintiff had asserted in the arbitration. On February 13, 2008, the plaintiff filed an application to confirm the award in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs application to confirm and a motion to vacate the award. In its motion to dismiss, the defendant claimed that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs application to confirm because the plaintiff had not asserted its claims within the time limitations set forth in \u00a7 4-61 and, therefore, that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Similarly, in its motion to vacate the award, the defendant claimed that the plaintiffs claims were not arbitrable and that the award did not conform to the submission because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the plaintiff had failed to assert its claims within the time limitations contained in \u00a7 4-61.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">On April 22, 2008, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In its memorandum of decision, the court found that the defendant had submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator and, specifically, the issue of whether the plaintiff timely had asserted its claims under \u00a7 4-61. The court concluded that the defendant was bound by the arbitrator\u2019s decision on this issue because the defendant had empowered the arbitrator to decide it. In addition, the court determined that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the defendant from asserting a claim for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs application to confirm the award.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>On May 8, 2008, the court granted the plaintiffs application to confirm the award and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the submission of the dispute to the arbitrator had been unrestricted and, therefore, that the award was not subject to de novo review as to errors of fact or law. Accordingly, the court held that the decision of the arbitrator must stand on the issue of arbitrability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied its motion to dismiss. The defendant claims that the plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and, therefore, that the trial court and this court lack subject matter jurisdiction. This claim is premised on the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly accepted the arbitrator\u2019s determination regarding the arbitrability of the dispute and, specifically, the arbitrator\u2019s inteipretation of the time limitations period specified in \u00a7 4-61 and conclusion that the plaintiffs claims had been timely asserted under that statute. The defendant contends that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the statute is incorrect* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that that interpretation should be reviewed de novo. The defendant argues that, if the interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>of \u00a7 4-61 that it urges is accepted and applied, then the plaintiffs claims would be untimely<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and thus barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The plaintiff responds that the trial court properly accepted the arbitrator\u2019s determination regarding arbitrability because the defendant had waived judicial review of that issue when it submitted it to the arbitrator without objection. Accordingly, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review. \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [denial] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Bonner, 290 Conn. 468, 477-78, 964 A.2d 73 (2009). \u201c[T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Columbia Air Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>293 Conn. 342, 347, 977 A.2d 636 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of the common law that a state cannot be sued without its consent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Martinez v. Dept. of Public Safety, </em>263 Conn. 74, 78, 818 A.2d 758 (2003). \u201cWe have held that a plaintiff seeking to circumvent the doctrine of sovereign immunity must show that . . . the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 314, 828 A.2d 549 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">As an initial matter, we note that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal regardless of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the confirmation of the award. See <em>Gemmell </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>42 Conn. App. 682,684 n.3, 680 A.2d 346 (1996) (appellate court has jurisdiction to determine whether trial court had subject matter jurisdiction). We also note that a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over an application to confirm an arbitration award derives from General Statutes \u00a7 52-417, which provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time within one year after an award has been rendered and the parties to the arbitration notified thereof, any party to the arbitration may make application to the superior court . . . for an order confirming the award. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">With regard to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, it is undisputed that the plaintiff asserted its claims pursuant to \u00a7 4-61, \u201cwhich waives the state\u2019s sovereign immunity with respect to certain claims arising under public works contracts . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019\u2019Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>287 Conn. 1, 2-3, 946 A.2d 1219 (2008) <em>(White Oak). </em>It is also undisputed that the plaintiffs claims arise from the type of contract to which \u00a7 4-61 applies. The basis for the defendant\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity is that the plaintiff did not assert its claims within the time limitations set forth in the statute. The trial court, in its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, found that the issue of timeliness, or arbitrability, had been submitted to the arbitrator for decision, and that the arbitrator resolved that issue in favor of the plaintiff. The trial court, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, accepted the arbitrator\u2019s decision and did not review the issue of arbitrability de novo. The defendant claims that this was improper. Accordingly, we review de novo whether the trial court properly accepted the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>tor\u2019s determination regarding the arbitrability of the dispute and, on that basis, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We begin by noting that, in <em>White Oak, </em>this court acknowledged that federal arbitration law has distinguished between conditions precedent to arbitration, such as time limitations, on the one hand, and substantive issues of arbitrability, on the other. See id., 7-8 n.8. We observed that the former is committed exclusively to the arbitrator\u2019s authority, whereas the latter is committed to the court\u2019s authority. See id. (under federal law, \u201can arbitrator shall decide whether a condition precedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled . . . i.e., whether prerequisites such as time limits, notice, laches, estoppel, and other conditions precedent to an obligation to arbitrate have been met\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), quoting <em>Howsam </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 84-85, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002). Nonetheless, this court concluded in <em>White Oak </em>that it \u201cneed not decide whether the defense of sovereign immunity generally is a procedural question for the arbitrators to decide under the federal Arbitration Act; see 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; or the state arbitration provision; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-408; because, under the circumstances . . . the scope of the arbitral submission [was] not defined by a contractual agreement to arbitrate, but, rather, by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity [under \u00a7 4-61].\u201d <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 7-8 n.8. Accordingly we concluded that \u201cwhether an arbitration is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity pursuant to [\u00a7 4-61] is a matter for the courts, not for the arbitrators, to decide.\u201d Id., 7 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Although <em>White Oak </em>did not involve the time limitations for bringing a claim under \u00a7 4-61, for the reasons stated in that decision, we conclude that the issue of arbitrability in the present case is one over which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>courts have primary authority. Therefore, we turn to our case law addressing the procedures by which parties may obtain de novo judicial review of the issue of arbitrability and the circumstances under which parties may lose the right to such review.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>229 Conn. 465, 641 A.2d 1381 (1994), we stated that \u201cthere are two procedural routes by which a party may preserve the issue of the arbitrability of a particular dispute for judicial determination. First, a party may refuse to submit to arbitration at the outset and instead compel a judicial determination of the issue of arbitrability. . . . Alternatively, threshold questions of arbitrability may properly be committed to the arbitrators themselves for determination under the terms of the contract, along with the merits of the underlying dispute. ... In such cases a court, on a motion to vacate, may properly entertain a challenge to an award alleging disregard of the limits in the parties\u2019 agreement with respect to arbitration.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 476. With regard to this second route, we noted that it was limited by our prior holdings, in which we stated that \u201ca party who voluntarily submits a dispute to arbitration without objecting to the arbitrability of the dispute waives judicial review of that issue.\u201d Id., 477. Thus, we determined that, when a party has opted to take the second route, the issue of whether that party has preserved judicial review of arbitrability turns on whether it properly objected to the arbitrability of the dispute. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Thus, as the previous discussion reflects, in cases such as the present case, three distinct inquiries may arise: (1) whether the matter is arbitrable; (2) who has primary authority to decide that question\u2014the arbitrator or the court; and (3) if the matter is one over which the court would have primary authority, did the parties engage in, or fail to engage in, conduct that precludes judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision on that mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ter. See <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 942, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995) (clearly setting forth first two questions); <em>White </em>v. <em>Kam-pner, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 475-78 (addressing whether defendants, by their actions, waived judicial review of issue of arbitrability when court had primary authority to decide that issue but parties nonetheless submitted it to arbitrator). The third inquiry has two distinct parts: preservation and waiver. A party has preserved its challenge to the arbitrability of the matter for judicial review by raising that issue before the arbitrator. A party who has made such a challenge nonetheless may <em>waive </em>its right to judicial review by agreeing to vest the arbitrator with authority to decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In the present case, the defendant took the initial step necessary to preserve the arbitrability issue by raising its sovereign immunity defense before the arbitrator. Had it done nothing further, it would have been entitled to de novo judicial review. We conclude, however, that the defendant waived its right to judicial review<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by agreeing that the arbitrator would be the final authority on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Specifically, the record reveals that the defendant, rather than objecting to or protesting the arbitrator\u2019s authority to decide the arbitrability of the dispute, actually embraced and availed itself of the arbitration pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ceedings to determine that issue. In April, 2006, during a preliminary telephone conference between the parties and the arbitrator, it was <em>the defendant </em>who requested that the arbitrator determine the issue of arbitrability. Thereafter, in its answering statement of October 12, 2006, the defendant stated: \u201cThe actual issues in this proceeding are [the plaintiffs] delay and disruption claims, and [the defendant\u2019s] special defenses that: [the plaintiffs] claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity; [the plaintiff] released [the defendant] from its claims; and [the plaintiff] settled its claims with [the defendant]. <em>Those issues may be heard and fully and finally determined by this </em>arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant stated in the next sentence, which started a new paragraph: \u201cThis approach is precisely what the parties anticipated at the outset of this arbitration.\u201d We conclude that the defendant\u2019s unequivocal declaration that \u201c[the] issues may be heard and <em>fully and finally determined </em>by this arbitration\u201d; (emphasis added); demonstrates that the defendant intended to be bound by the arbitrator\u2019s decision and constitutes a waiver of judicial review<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the issue of arbitrability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The defendant nonetheless argues that the issue of arbitrability and the applicability of the doctrine of sov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ereign immunity, in particular, are matters for the court to decide de novo, regardless of the arbitrator\u2019s determination of these issues. In support of this argument, the defendant relies on <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Perez-Henderson, </em>49 Conn. App. 653, 714 A.2d 1281, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 917, 722 A.2d 807 (1998) <em>(Prudential), Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 1, <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>ECAP Construction Co., </em>250 Conn. 553, 737 A.2d 398 (1999) <em>(ECAP), White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 465, <em>and MBNA America Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Boata, </em>283 Conn. 381, 926 A.2d 1035 (2007). These cases, however, are distinguishable from the present case or do not otherwise support the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">First, <em>Prudential </em>is completely inapposite. <em>In Prudential, </em>the Appellate Court held that the plaintiff in that case could challenge the issue of arbitrability by way of an application to vacate, even though that issue was decided in the arbitration. See <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Perez-Henderson, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 658. In reaching this decision, however, the court specifically declined to address whether the plaintiff had waived judicial review of the issue of arbitrability because it \u201cfail[ed] to appear in court to respond to the defendant\u2019s application to compel arbitration.\u201d Id., 658 n.4. Thus, because the court did not address the issue of waiver, <em>Prudential </em>is irrelevant to our analysis in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The defendant\u2019s claim that <em>White Oak </em>is dispositive of the issue in the present case also is incorrect. As we previously noted, <em>White Oak </em>addressed the issue of who, as between the courts and arbitrators, has primary authority to decide whether a claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 4-61 is not arbitrable because it is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 7 n.8. \u201c[U]nder the circumstances of <em>[White Oak, </em>we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>eluded that the courts had primary authority to decide that issue because] the scope of the arbitral submission [was] not defined by a contractual agreement to arbitrate, but, rather, by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity [under \u00a7 4-61].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 7-8 n.8. <em>White Oak, </em>however, did not address the issue of waiver because the defendant in that case, which opposed arbitration, declined to submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator and, instead, filed an action in court for a permanent injunction barring the arbitration. Id., 5. In the present case, on the other hand, the defendant chose to forgo the route of judicial intervention and, instead, opted affirmatively to submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator by means of its answering statement and oral request that the arbitrator rule on its affirmative defense of sovereign immunity. Thus, unlike in <em>White Oak, </em>in which the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitral submission was based solely on the language of \u00a7 4-61, in the present case, the parties explicitly agreed<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, and, therefore, the scope of their submission was supplemented by their agreement and not defined solely by \u00a7 4-61. Accordingly, <em>White Oak </em>has no bearing on the issue of waiver, which is the precise issue that we must resolve in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">To the extent that the defendant claims that <em>White Oak </em>precludes parties from agreeing to submit the issue of arbitrability under \u00a7 4-61 to an arbitrator, we disagree. <em>White Oak </em>stands for the proposition that, when a case arises under \u00a7 4-61, in the absence of an agreement between the parties to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability, the courts have primary authority to decide that issue. See id., 7-8 n.8. <em>White Oak </em>does not, however, prohibit parties from affirmatively submitting such an issue to an arbitrator if they so choose. Indeed, such a prohibitory interpretation would be contrary to our decisions in <em>Welch Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Creative Drywall, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 464, 576 A.2d 153 (1990), and <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270,231 A.2d 531 (1967), in which we stated that \u201c[wjhether a particular dispute is arbitrable is a question for the court, <em>unless, by appropriate language, the parties have agreed to arbitrate that question, also.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 274; accord <em>Welch Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Creative Drywall, Inc., </em>supra, 467. Moreover, our decision in <em>White Oak </em>implicitly recognized that, in any particular case, the scope of the arbitral submission may be defined by an agreement rather than by statute alone. See <em>Dept, of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 7-8 n.8. Finally, in <em>White Oak, </em>we relied in part on <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 465, a case in which the parties subsequently agreed to submit the issue of arbitrability to an arbitrator, even though the scope of the arbitral submission did not, in the first instance, commit that issue to the arbitrator. See id., 469, 475. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Accordingly, just as we reached the issue of waiver of judicial review in <em>Kampner; </em>id., 475-78; we conclude that <em>White Oak </em>does not prevent us from reaching that issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">As with <em>White Oak, </em>our decision in <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>ECAP Construction Co., </em>supra, 250 Conn. 553, also is not dispositive of the issue in the present case. In <em>ECAP, </em>the department of public works (department) filed an action seeking a permanent injunction barring a contractor from arbitrating a claim against the department for breach of an agreement that purported to settle various claims that the contractor had against the department relating to a construction contract. Id., 556. Specifically, the department claimed that the contractor\u2019s claim did not fall within the limited waiver of sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 4-61 because the parties\u2019 disagreement over the settlement agreement \u201cdid not constitute a disputed claim arising \u2018under\u2019 the contract within the meaning of the statute.\u201d Id., 557. On appeal, we agreed with the department and stated: \u201cIt is clear . . . that the parties\u2019 purported settlement agreement . . . constitutes a separate agreement that, although related to the [construction] contract, does not arise \u2018under\u2019 that contract.\u201d Id., 562. \u201cThe legislature\u2019s use of the word \u2018under\u2019 [in \u00a7 4-61 (a)], as opposed to a broader term such as \u2018related to,\u2019 \u2018connected with\u2019 or \u2018derived from,\u2019 indicates an intent to authorize only those disputed claims against the state that fall directly under the contract itself. To permit an action against the state for a claim that is related to or connected with a public works contract would expand the limited waiver of immunity inherent in \u00a7 4-61 beyond the statute\u2019s plain language. . . . We are not persuaded that the legislature intended such an expansion of \u00a7 4-61.\u201d Id., 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Although <em>ECAP </em>correctly interprets the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 4-61, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>does not address whether a court or an arbitrator has primary authority to determine if a particular claim falls within that scope. Moreover, <em>ECAP </em>does not address the issue of waiver. These issues were not present in <em>ECAP </em>because, unlike in the present case, the department in <em>ECAP </em>declined to submit the issue of sovereign immunity to the arbitrator and, instead, filed an action in court for a permanent injunction barring the arbitration. Id., 556. Accordingly, as with <em>White Oak, ECAP </em>has no bearing on the issue of whether the defendant in the present case, having submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, thereby waived judicial review of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Our decisions in <em>Kampner </em>and <em>MBNA America Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Boata, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 381, are directly on point because they address the issue of whether a party has waived judicial review of the issue of arbitrability. The facts in those cases, however, differ from those of the present case and thus dictate a different result. In <em>Kampner, </em>the parties submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator even though the contractual submission did not include the issue of arbitrability- See <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 469, 475. The plaintiff in <em>Kampner </em>argued that the submission of the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator constituted a waiver of the defendants\u2019 right to have that issue reviewed by a court. Id., 475. We disagreed and concluded that the defendants had preserved judicial review of the issue of arbitrability because \u201cthe defendants repeatedly objected to the arbitrability of the dispute before the commencement of arbitration proceedings . . . .\u201d Id., 478. Those objections included numerous written communications to the American Arbitration Association and to the plaintiff stating that arbitration should not proceed because of the failure of a condition precedent to arbitration. Id., 469 and nn.3-4. In addition, we noted that the trial court had made an \u201cexplicit finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the issue [of arbitrability] was submitted [to the arbitrator] in the context of the [defendants\u2019] objection to the arbitration proceedings.\u201d Id., 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Similarly, in <em>Boata, </em>we held that the defendant in that case was entitled to contest the arbitrability of a dispute by means of an objection to the plaintiffs application to confirm an award because such objection was made on the ground that the parties never had entered into an agreement to arbitrate and because the defendant properly had preserved that claim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>MBNA America </em>Bank, <em>N.A. </em>v. Boata, supra, 283 Conn. 395-96. With regard to the issue of preservation of judicial review, we noted that, at the outset of the arbitration, \u201c[t]he defendant, representing himself pro se, responded to the plaintiff by claiming, inter alia, that he \u2018was never informed that there [was] an [arbitration [c]lause,\u2019 and that he \u2018never agreed under any contractual relationship to arbitrate his disputes with [the plaintiff] . . . [and] is not bound by the [arbitration] [agreement presented by the [plaintiff] . . . .\u2019 Accordingly, the defendant requested that the arbitrator dismiss the plaintiffs claim.\u201d Id., 384. Notwithstanding these objections, the arbitrator proceeded with the arbitration and issued an award without \u201caddress[ing] the defendant\u2019s claim that he had not agreed to binding arbitration or his related request for dismissal of the plaintiffs claim.\u201d Id. Under these circumstances, we held that the defendant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>not waive review of the issue of arbitrability because his objection properly preserved his claim. Id., 395-96. Indeed, the absence of <em>any </em>agreement to arbitrate necessarily would deprive the arbitrator of <em>any </em>authority to decide the claims. See id., 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The facts in the present case clearly distinguish it from those in <em>Kampner </em>and <em>Boata, </em>and demonstrate that the defendant in the present case waived judicial review of the issue of arbitrability. Unlike the defendants in <em>Kampner </em>and <em>Boata, </em>the defendant in the present case did not object to the arbitrator\u2019s authority to decide the arbitrability of the dispute before the commencement of arbitration proceedings or claim that no arbitration agreement existed between it and the plaintiff. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that the defendant <em>expressly </em>agreed to the arbitration proceedings. Not only did the defendant submit the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, but, more significantly, it also explicitly stated in its answering statement that that issue <em>\u201cmay be heard and fully and finally determined by this </em>arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such actions are wholly unlike those of the defendants in <em>Kampner </em>and <em>Boata, </em>who never agreed to be bound by the decisions of their respective arbitrators and, moreover, vehemently objected to the arbitration proceedings from beginning to end. Therefore, we conclude that the defendant in the present case waived judicial review of the issue of arbitrability. In light of this conclusion, it follows that the trial court properly accepted the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs claims were timely and arbitrable under \u00a7 4-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffs application to confirm the award. Specifically, the defendant claims that (1) the plaintiffs claims are not arbitrable, and (2) the award does not conform to the submission. The standard for reviewing these claims require \u201cwhat we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>have termed in effect, de novo judicial review. . . . [0]ur inquiry generally is limited to a determination as to whether the parties have vested the arbitrators with the authority to decide the issue presented or to award the relief conferred.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Comprehensive Orthopaedics &amp; Musculoskeletal Care, LLC </em>v. <em>Axtmayer, </em>293 Conn. 748, 754-55, 980 A.2d 297 (2009). The defendant\u2019s remaining claims, like its sovereign immunity claim, are premised entirely on the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly accepted the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs claims were timely and arbitrable under \u00a7 4-61. Because we have concluded that the trial court properly accepted the arbitrator\u2019s determination, these claims have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\"> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 waives the state\u2019s sovereign immunity with respect to certain claims arising under public works contracts and provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person, firm or corporation which has entered into a contract with the state, acting through any of its departments, commissions or other agencies, for the design, construction, construction management, repair or alteration of any highway, bridge, building or other public works of the state or any political subdivision of the state may, in the event of any disputed claims under such contract or claims arising out of the awarding of a contract by the Commissioner of Public Works, bring an action against the state to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford for the purpose of having such claims determined ....</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u201c(b) As an alternative to the procedure provided in subsection (a) of this section, any such person, firm or corporation having a claim under said subsection (a) may submit a demand for arbitration of such claim or claims for determination under (1) the rules of any dispute resolution entity, approved by such person, firm or corporation and the agency head and (2) the provisions of subsections (b) to (e), inclusive, of this section, except that if the parties cannot agree upon a dispute resolution entity, the rules of the American Arbitration Association and the provisions of said subsections shall apply.

Moreover, I cannot find from the evidence presented a meeting of the minds on the terms of the \u2018release\u2019 as argued by [the defendant]. Clearly, for there to be an accord and satisfaction, there must be a meeting of the minds.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Although the defendant, in its motion to vacate the award, argued that the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the issue of release and settlement violates public</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\"> The defendant also claimed in its motion to vacate the award that the award violates public policy and that the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law in making the award. The defendant has not raised either of these claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b728-7\"> The court\u2019s determination on the issue of res judicata appears to have been premised on the fact that the parties had submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator and, therefore, that the defendant could not relitigate that issue in court. The court relied on this same reasoning in addressing the sovereign immunity issue. Accordingly, although the defendant has not appealed specifically from the trial court\u2019s res judicata determination, the defendant, in raising the issue of sovereign immunity, necessarily challenges on appeal the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision on the res judicata issue. Thus, our resolution of the issue of sovereign immunity necessarily resolves the issue of res judicata.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> The trial court also cited as an additional reason for denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that the motion was procedurally improper. The court stated that the defendant should have contested jurisdiction in its motion to vacate rather than contesting it in a motion to dismiss. Because \u201ca claim that a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during the proceedings\u201d; <em>Coldwell Banker Manning Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>293 Conn. 582, 610, 980 A.2d 819 (2009); including on appeal, we must address the issue regardless of the procedural vehicle through which it is raised. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the defendant used the proper procedural vehicle to raise the issue in the trial court proceedings. See id., 610 n.31 (rejecting appellant\u2019s procedurally based argument that court should not consider alternate ground for affirmance when such ground involved court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>lack of subject matter jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> The court also concluded that the arbitrator did not manifestly disregard the law and that the award did not violate public policy. The defendant has not challenged these determinations on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\"> The time limitation period contained in \u00a7 4-61 is triggered by either the defendant\u2019s issuance of \u201ca certificate of acceptance ... to the contractor or . . . the termination of the contract, whichever is earlier.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (b). The defendant claims that the arbitrator incorrectly interpreted the phrase \u201cthe termination of the contract,\u201d as used in \u00a7 4-61 (b), to mean a premature termination of the contract rather than the mere conclusion of the contract. We have not previously interpreted this phrase in connection with \u00a7 4-61 and, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, have no reason to interpret it in this case. We therefore express no opinion as to whether the arbitrator correctly interpreted that phrase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\"> The defendant argues that the phrase \u201ctermination of the contract,\u201d as used in \u00a7 4-61 (b), means the conclusion of performance of the contract. The defendant argues that if this definition is applied to the facts of this case, then the contract terminated in 1994, when the plaintiff completed its work on the project and was entitled to payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> In the present case, the waiver of judicial review applies only to the arbitrator\u2019s decision regarding arbitrability and does not prevent the defendant from attacking the arbitrator\u2019s decision on the basis of any of the grounds enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) for vacating an arbitration award: \u201c(1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\"> We are mindful that only the legislature, and not the attorney representing the state in a particular dispute, may waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. See, e.g., <em>Miller </em>v. Egan, supra, 265 Conn. 313-14. Our conclusion in the present case does not violate this tenet because we merely hold that the defendant waived <em>judicial review </em>of the issue of sovereign immunity and not sovereign immunity itself. Indeed, the facts of the present case reveal that the defendant not only did not waive sovereign immunity but vigorously litigated that issue in <em>its </em>chosen forum, before the arbitrator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> At oral argument, counsel for the defendant claimed that the defendant \u201cobjected to the arbitration.\u201d It is unclear as to what the defendant\u2019s counsel was referring to when he made this statement. To the extent that the defendant is attempting to equate an \u201cobjection\u201d with its initial submission of the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator in April, 2006, such claim is belied by the defendant\u2019s answering statement, which provides that \u201cthe parties anticipated <em>at the outset of this arbitration\u201d </em>that the \u201cissues may be heard and <em>fully and finally determined </em>by this arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b737-5\"> Specifically, we determined that the language of \u00a7 4-61 (b) dictates that \u201cthe authority to file a demand for arbitration under \u00a7 4-61 (b) is contingent [on] the existence of a disputed claim . . . for which an action in the Superior Courts properly could be filed under \u00a7 4-61 (a). Stated another way, waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity under \u00a7 4-61 (a) is a condition precedent to the arbitral submission in \u00a7 4-61 (b).\u201d <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 287 Conn. 7 n.8.

In reaching this conclusion, we relied on our decision in <em>White </em>v. <em>Kampner, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 473, 475, for the proposition that when the issue of arbitrability (i.e., whether a condition precedent to arbitration is satisfied) is not part of the contractual submission, that issue is a matter for the court to decide. <em>Dept, of Transportation </em>v. <em>White Oak Corp., </em>supra, 7 n.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\"> The defendant\u2019s answering statement indicates that the parties had an agreement to arbitrate the issue of sovereign immunity or arbitrability.
