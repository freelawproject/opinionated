Fingon later died from causes unrelated to the accident. The plaintiff claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>accident was caused by the negligence of the named defendant, Stephen Feldman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a jury trial, a verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff, awarding him economic damages in the amount of $1188 and zero noneconomic damages. The plaintiff filed motions to set aside the verdict, for additur and for a new trial, claiming, inter alia, that the jury\u2019s award of zero noneco-nomic damages was inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motions, finding that the jury\u2019s award was reasonable in light of the facts of the case. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The plaintiff raises three claims on appeal. He claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied the aforementioned motions because the jury\u2019s award was inconsistent with the evidence; (2) relied in part, when denying the motions, on the fact that Fingon since had died of causes unrelated to the accident; and (3) excluded certain evidence because it was admissible pursuant to the dead man\u2019s statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-172.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree with each of the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In short, we have reviewed the evidence and the parties\u2019 arguments and conclude that, in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>particular circumstances of this case, the jury reasonably could have found as it did. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s refusal to disturb the verdict was not an abuse of discretion. See <em>Wickers </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>252 Conn. 174, 188-89, 745 A.2d 789 (2000). Moreover, the plaintiff has not shown that the trial court, in ruling on the plaintiffs motions, relied on any improper considerations. Finally, although the evidence that the plaintiff sought to introduce generally was admissible pursuant to \u00a7 52-172, the trial court acted within its discretion in excluding it as a sanction because of the plaintiffs failure to comply with the expert witness disclosure requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 and to respond to other discovery requests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 13-14 (a) and (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-14\"> Margaret Siligato, an administratrix for Helen Fingon\u2019s estate, originally filed this action. Thereafter, William Gambardella was appointed as the temporary administrator of Fingon\u2019s estate and, accordingly, was substituted as the plaintiff. All references herein to the plaintiff are to Gambardella</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> The plaintiff also named Ann Sullivan, the driver of the vehicle in which the plaintiff was a passenger, as a defendant and raised claims of negligence against her. The trial court granted Sullivan\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and the plaintiff has not appealed from that ruling. Consequently, Feldman is the only defendant remaining in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-172 provides: \u201cIn actions by or against the representatives of deceased persons, and by or against the beneficiaries of any life or accident insurance policy insuring a person who is deceased at the time of the trial, the entries, memoranda and declarations of the deceased, relevant to the matter in issue, may be received as evidence. In actions by or against the representatives of deceased persons, in which any trustee or receiver is an adverse party, the testimony of the deceased, relevant to the matter in issue, given at his examination, upon the application of such trustee or receiver, shall be received in evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> The plaintiff has not argued that the trial court\u2019s rulings, in this regard, were improper, but only that the evidence was admissible pursuant to \u00a7 52-172.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
