Santa Barbara, </em>294 Conn. 803,988 A.2d 221 (2010); <em>New England Estates, LLC </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>294 Conn. 817, 988 A.2d 229 (2010); arise from the exercise of eminent domain by the defendant town of Branford (town), with respect to an approximately seventy-seven acre parcel of land, known as 48-86 Tabor Drive, in the south central area of town. The town appeals from the judgments of the trial court in favor of the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Thomas Santa Barbara, Jr., and Frank Perrotti, Jr., the owners of the subject property at the time of the taking (owners), and the plaintiff, New England Estates, LLC (New England Estates), a developer that had entered into an option contract with the owners to purchase the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The town claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the highest and best use of the property was for residential development. The town bases this claim primarily on the contention that, in order for the trial court to so conclude, it first must have concluded that New England Estates would have prevailed in an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g from the decision of the town planning and zoning commission (zoning commission) denying its application for site plan approval, and that such a conclusion would have been improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>claims that the trial court improperly allowed New England Estates\u2019 expert witness to testify regarding his opinion that on appeal the trial court would have reversed the denial of New England Estates\u2019 affordable housing application. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The trial court found the following relevant facts. The property consists of 76.91 acres, and residential development is the predominant use of the land surrounding the property. The property is bordered on the west by Tabor Drive, along which are residences, a church, a cemetery, salt marshes and small industrial sites. The property is bordered on the north by an active railroad line, which separates the property from residential neighborhoods to the north. The northeastern comer of the property abuts Pine Orchard Road. A landfill borders the property on the southwest, and land owned by the Branford Land Tmst makes up the remainder of the southern border of the property. To the east are a dog kennel, a veterinary clinic and more residential neighborhoods. The property is about one mile southeast of the town center and is southeast of the Branford River. Long Island Sound is about three quarters of a mile to the south of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Because the site formerly had been mined for sand and gravel, much of the topsoil has been removed. Wetlands comprise 7.35 acres of the property, including a 4.7 acre pond. Although the northwest portion of the site is within a flood plain, according to a flood insurance rate map dated June 16, 1992, and November 18, 1983, a majority of that portion of the property is located in an area of minimal flooding. Dirt and gravel roads mn through the site, and sewer, water, electricity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>telephone service are available to the property. At the time of the taking in January, 2004, most of the site was zoned IG-2 industrial, and a small portion was zoned R-3 residential.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There also was a special development area<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> overlay zone over the entire site. The property previously had been designated a planned development district, but the town had eliminated that designation for the property in 2002 pursuant to \u00a7 35.11 of the town zoning regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>In 1988, notwithstanding the zoning classification of the property as IG-2 industrial, the town had approved a site plan application for the construction of a development on the property consisting of 298 residential condominiums, a community building and a nine hole golf course. In the early 1990\u2019s, the owners purchased the property at a foreclosure auction for $2.11 million, and in 2001, entered into an option agreement with New England Estates for a purchase price of $4.75 million. New England Estates, which had been formed for the purpose of purchasing and developing the property, agreed to pay $10,000 per month for the option to purchase, as well as the costs of testing, engineering, site designs, and town approvals for the proposed residential development, including legal fees associated with the approval process. The contract allowed for renewal periods at higher monthly rates, and subsequent amendments allowed New England Estates to extend the term of the option agreement. The contract provided for an additional payment at closing of $100,000, plus $45,000 per revised renewal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">After entering into the option agreement, New England Estates began its efforts to secure site plan approval for a residential development on the property. Initially intending to resurrect the 1988 plan, it hired the same engineering, planning and landscaping firm that had prepared that plan. Ultimately, New England Estates submitted a plan for a 268 unit development with a golf course. The town\u2019s inland wetlands commission and the United States Army Corps of Engineers both granted permits for the site plan, in May, 2002, and March, 2003, respectively. The zoning commission, however, denied New England Estates\u2019 application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>seeking anew planned development district designation for the property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In May, 2003, New England Estates submitted a new plan, this time under the affordable housing statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g. The plan called for 354 units, but did not include a golf course. At the same time, New England Estates sought a modification to the permit it had received from the inland wetlands commission in 2002, for the 268 unit proposed development. In June, 2003, New England Estates once again submitted a site plan application for a 354 unit affordable housing development, this time including a golf course. In August, 2003, the inland wetlands commission informed New England Estates that it would not consider a modification of the 2002 inland wetlands permit, and that an application for a new permit was required.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In July, 2003, the representative town meeting, the town\u2019s legislative body, voted to take the property by eminent domain, and on December 18, 2003, the town filed a notice of condemnation and statement of compensation in the amount of $1,167,800. That sum was deposited with the clerk of the court. In the meantime, the zoning commission conducted public hearings on New England Estates\u2019 June, 2003 proposed site plan and \u00a7 8-30g application. The town acquired the site by eminent domain on January 5, 2004, and subsequently denied New England Estates\u2019 \u00a7 8-30g application. In separate actions, the owners and New England Estates each filed appeals and applications for review of the statement of compensation. The two actions were consolidated and transferred to the complex litigation docket in the judicial district of Waterbury, where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>were tried together before the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judgments in those cases give rise to these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The trial court heard the testimony of two appraisers on behalf of the owners and New England Estates, R. Bruce Hunter and Richard A. Michaud, and one appraiser on behalf of the town, Albert W. Franke III. Hunter and Michaud, both of whom testified that it was reasonably probable that New England Estates\u2019 would obtain approval for residential development of the property, began with the premise that the highest and best use of the land was residential, while Franke, who concluded that such approval was \u201chighly speculative at best,\u201d began with the assumption that the highest and best use was for the land to remain vacant and undeveloped.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hunter, relying on the sales comparison approach,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> determined that the market value of the land was $6.1 million based on the 354 unit affordable housing development proposal, and $6.2 million based on the 268 unit market rate housing development proposal. Michaud relied on both the sales comparison approach and the development approach,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and arrived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>at a valuation of $6.9 million under the sales comparison approach and a valuation of approximately $6.4 million under the development approach. Giving slightly greater weight to the development approach, Michaud arrived at a final valuation of $6.5 million. Franke relied on the sales comparison approach to arrive at a valuation of $770,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The trial court found that the highest and best use of the land was residential, and, accordingly, rejected Franke\u2019s opinion. The court relied on the appraisals of Hunter and Michaud, as well as all of the testimony presented during the trial and the court\u2019s visual inspection of the property, to arrive at a valuation of $4.6 million.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In arriving at its conclusion, the court specifically found that the town had presented no credible evidence of environmental contamination of the site. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The town first claims that the trial court improperly determined that the highest and best use of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>was for residential development. The town argues that because the property was zoned industrial at the time of the taking, New England Estates could not have secured approval for a residential development without a zone change. Because it was not reasonably probable that New England Estates would have been successful in obtaining a zone change, the town argues, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the highest and best use of the property was residential was improper. We disagree that the appeal turns on whether New England Estates successfully would have obtained a zone change. Instead, because there were sufficient facts in the record independent of that issue to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the highest and best use of the land is residential, we conclude that the court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\u201cThe owner of land taken by condemnation is entitled to be paid just compensation. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 11.\u201d <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 67, 73, 355 A.2d 42 (1974). \u201c[T]he amount that constitutes just compensation is the market value of the condemned property when put to its highest and best use at the time of the taking.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>ATC Partnership, </em>256 Conn. 813, 828, 776 A.2d 1068 (2001). \u201cGenerally speaking, market value is the price that would in all probability\u2014the probability being based upon the evidence in the case\u2014result from fair negotiations, where the seller is willing to sell and the buyer desires to buy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 83, 88, 239 A.2d 482 (1968). \u201cThe highest and best use concept, chiefly employed as a starting point in estimating the value of real estate by appraisers, has to do with the use which will most likely produce the highest market value, greatest financial return, or the most profit from the use of a particular piece of real estate. ... In determining its highest and best use, the [trier] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>must consider whether there was a reasonable probability that the subject property would be put to that use in the reasonably near future, and what effect such a prospective use may have had on the property\u2019s market value at the time of the taking.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Northeast Ct. Economic Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>ATC Partnership, </em>supra, 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\u201cBecause a change in zoning restrictions obviously could affect the price of real property, where such a change is reasonably probable and not merely a remote or speculative possibility, the probability may properly be considered in the determination of the fair value of the property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>221 Conn. 736, 745, 607 A.2d 402 (1992). In determining the market value of a property in light of a reasonably probable zone change, \u201cthe true issue is . . . the value of the property as zoned at the time of the taking as it is affected by the probability of a change.\u201d <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 89. The questions of the highest and best use of the property and the reasonable probability of a zone change are questions of fact, and a trial court\u2019s determination of these issues will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Tilcon Minerals, Inc., </em>284 Conn. 55, 65, 931 A.2d 237 (2007); <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>203 Conn. 364, 375, 525 A.2d 68 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In reviewing the factual findings of the trial court under the highly deferential, clearly erroneous standard of review, \u201c[w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it ... or when although there is evidence in the record to support it, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Living Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>290 Conn. 695, 706-707, 966 A.2d 188 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Implicit in the trial court\u2019s finding that the highest and best use of the land is residential is the finding that it was reasonably probable that New England Estates would succeed in obtaining approval to use the land for residential development under at least one of the proposed development plans\u2014either the 354 unit affordable housing development or the 268 unit market rate development\u2014and that it was also reasonably probable that New England Estates successfully would obtain any necessary zone changes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court had more than sufficient evidence before it to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>those implicit factual findings. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision recognizes that at the time of the taking, the property was zoned as IG-2 industrial under the town\u2019s zoning regulations. The court noted, however, that in 1988, when the properly also was zoned as IG-2 industrial, the town approved a proposal for a 298 unit condominium development that would have included a community building and a nine hole golf course.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court considered the following additional facts: The property was located within a special development area, and previously had been designated a planned development district. As part of the town\u2019s plan of conservation and development, adopted in 1997, the town\u2019s future land use map designated most of the property for use as moderate to high density residential development. In May, 2002, New England Estates received a permit from the town\u2019s inland wetlands commission for its proposal for a 268 unit condominium development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>with a nine hole golf course. In March, 2003, in connection with the same proposed development, New England Estates received a permit under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 from the United States Army Corps of Engineers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The court also found that the property\u2019s location is an \u201cideal setting for residential use,\u201d located close to both Long Island Sound and the town center, with considerable frontage on the existing streets of Tabor Drive and Pine Orchard Road. There are residential neighborhoods to the north, east and west of the property. The property has easy access to utilities, including a sanitary sewer line and a municipal water line. Two of the three experts who testified at trial stated their opinion that it was reasonably probable that New England Estates would be successful in obtaining approval for a residential development on the property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> New England <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Estates had entered into an option agreement with the owners, which the trial court recounted in great detail. That agreement established a purchase price of $4.75 million, required New England Estates to pay tens of thousands of dollars monthly for the option, and also required that New England Estates pay the costs of obtaining the necessary approvals for the development. New England Estates diligently sought such approval, filing three separate site plan applications for residential development of the property. The court also relied on its own visual inspection of the property. Finally, the court found that there was no credible evidence to support the primary reason proffered by the town\u2014 that the property was environmentally contaminated\u2014 for rejecting the development plan submitted by New England Estates.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s express determination that the highest and best use of the property was residential, and its implicit determination that it was reasonably probable that New England Estates would obtain the necessary approvals for a residential development, including any necessary zoning changes. We find particularly significant the prior approvals by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>both the town inland wetlands commission and the zoning commission of a similar development plan in 1988, prepared by the same engineering, planning and landscaping firm, under the same applicable zoning restrictions. Those prior 1988 approvals, coupled with the designation of the property on the future land use map as intended for moderate to high density residential use, the 2002 inland wetlands commission approval, the 2003 approval by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the opinions of the two experts relied upon by the court, the fact that the property\u2019s location is ideally suited for residential development, and the fact that the trial court did not find credible the town\u2019s proffered reason for denial of approval for the June, 2003 development plan\u2014that the property was environmentally contaminated\u2014all combine to provide more than enough support for the trial court\u2019s findings. We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s determination that the highest and best use of the land was for residential development, and its underlying, implicit determination that New England Estates would have obtained the necessary approvals and any necessary zoning changes were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The town argues that, in order to affirm the trial court, we must conclude that New England Estates would have prevailed in an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g of the zoning commission\u2019s denial of New England Estates\u2019 site plan application for the affordable housing development. We disagree. Put most simply, the trial court did not address this issue, and, because there was sufficient, other evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding, it did not need to resolve the question in order to decide the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">As we have stated, in reviewing the court\u2019s findings for clear error, \u201cwe focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as <em>the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, </em>to determine whether it is legally correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>and factually supported.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Living Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>supra, 290 Conn. 707. It is unnecessary to consider whether a method <em>not </em>relied upon by the trial court\u2014namely, a determination of whether New England Estates would have prevailed in an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g\u2014would have had merit. In concluding that it was reasonably probable that New England Estates would have obtained approval for residential development of the property, the court relied on the testimony of experts, evidence of a previous similar approval, the characteristics of the property that render it suitable for residential development, the town\u2019s development plan and its own visual inspection of the land. In resolving these appeals, we are required to decide whether the trial corut\u2019s determination was clearly erroneous based on the record presented. The trial court did <em>not </em>rely, in arriving at its determination of highest and best use, on a conclusion that New England Estates would have been required to prevail in an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g, and would have so prevailed. Moreover, the court did not base its valuation on a specific finding that the property would be developed as an affordable housing development. Rather, it based its valuation at least in part on the testimony of Hunter, who appraised the property based both on the 268 unit market rate development and the 354 unit affordable housing development. Because the record is devoid of evidence that the court based its decision on an evaluation of the merits of an appeal by New England Estates pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g, and because there is ample evidence to support the court\u2019s determination, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether New England Estates would have prevailed in a \u00a7 8-30g appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The town next claims that the trial court improperly allowed Mark K. Branse, an attorney who testified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>New England Estates\u2019 zoning law expert witness, to offer his opinion that the trial court would have reversed the denial of New England Estates\u2019 affordable housing application. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Branse testified that it was his opinion that the reasons offered by the zoning commission in denying New England Estates\u2019 application would have been insufficient to withstand a challenge in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g. The town objected that the testimony was inappropriate because it constituted an interpretation of the law, and was testimony as to the ultimate issue in the case. The court overruled the objection. Because we already have concluded in this opinion that the question of whether New England Estates would have prevailed in an appeal of the decision of the zoning commission pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g is irrelevant to the resolution of this appeal, it hardly can be said that Branse offered testimony as to the ultimate issue in the case. Similarly, even if the testimony was improperly admitted on the basis that it constituted impermissible legal opinion because the record is devoid of evidence that the court grounded its decision on the likelihood of a successful appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\"> On August 16, 2007, the town of Branford filed two separate appeals from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court. Subsequently, we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and granted a motion by Thomas Santa Barbara, Jr., Frank Perrotli, Jr., and New England Estates, LLC, to consolidate the appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\"> In the first case, the town filed a certificate of taking and the owners subsequently sought review of the statement of compensation. In addition to the owners, the first case also included the following parties: National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Adelbert Mautte, Dorothy Mautte, Dennis Butler, Barbara Butler, Barbara Kennedy, the town sewer authority, Edward Parzyck and Mary Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">In the second case, New England Estates sought review of the statement of compensation filed by the town. Thereafter, the trial court consolidated the appeals challenging the statement of compensation. Although the first case is captioned <em>Town of Branford </em>v. <em>Thomas Santa Barbara, Jr., et al., </em>because the town filed the certificate of taking, \u201c[t]his court has recognized that the filing of a statement of compensation does not originate a civil action. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Conn. 492, 494 n.1, 280 A.2d 352 (1971).\u201d <em>Branford </em>v. <em>Santa Barbara, </em>supra, 294 Conn. 811 n.10. Consequently, we recognize the town as the defendant and New England Estates and the owners as the plaintiffs in these appeals. We refer to these parties by name, however, rather than by party status, in order to avoid any confusion that may result from any contrary identification by the parties in certain pleadings at the trial level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\"> The town also argues that, because neither the owners nor New England Estates appealed from the zoning commission\u2019s denial of the application for site plan approval to develop the property as affordable housing, each of them waived their right to argue that they would have prevailed in such an appeal. Because we conclude that the question of whether New England Estates would have prevailed in an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-30g is not necessary to the resolution of the present appeals, it is unnecessary for us to resolve whether either of them waived their right to argue that they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>have prevailed in an appeal from the denial of the application for site plan approval. Moreover, the town\u2019s taking of the land rendered any such appeals moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-5\"> Chapter n, \u00a7 23.12, of the Branford zoning regulations defines IG-2, or \u201c[gjeneral industrial [djistrict #2\u201d as follows: \u201cThese districts consist of areas intended to be used for heavy commercial and industrial development on a less intensive basis than the [general industrial district #1] [djistricts.

The town contends that the town\u2019s zoning regulations prohibit residential development in an IG-2 industrial zone. The town also points to the fact that New England Estates\u2019 site plan application sought the creation of a new \u201c[hjousing [opportunity [district,\u201d in the town\u2019s zoning regulations, and the designation of the property as a housing opportunity district. Lastly, in response to New England Estates\u2019 contention that the creation of a planned development district would not require a zone change, the town points out that the creation of a planned development district results in the modification of the zoning regulations. See Branford Zoning Regs., c. Ill, \u00a7 35.6 (upon establishment of planned development district, \u201cthese [zjoning [Regulations and the [z]oning [m]ap shall be considered to be modified to permit the establishment of the development as approved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">We need not decide whether a zone change was required to develop the land residentially. Instead, we read the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to include an implicit determination that, if a zone change was required, it was reasonably probable that New England Estates would have obtained one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b822-5\"> We recognize that on July 24, 2003, the zoning commission voted to amend the town zoning regulations, amending the town\u2019s plan of conservation and development to remove from the future land use map the designation of the property as intended for moderate/high density residential use to office/industrial use and amending the IG-2 classification by changing the letting of rooms within that classification from a permitted use to a prohibited use. New England Estates\u2019 application, however, was filed in June, 2003. Accordingly, the zoning regulations that were in effect at the date of the application apply. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-2h (a) C\u2018[a]n application filed with a zoning commission, planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals or agency exercising zoning authority of a town, city or borough which is in conformance with the applicable zoning regulations as of the time of filing shall not be required to comply with, nor shall it be disapproved for the reason that it does not comply with, any change in the zoning regulations or the boundaries of zoning districts of such town, city or borough taking effect after the filing of such application\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Although the town correctly states that land is valued as it is zoned at the time of the taking; see <em>Budney </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 89; the factual circumstances of the present case\u2014particularly the timing of the changes to the zoning regulations in relation to New England Estates\u2019 June, 2003 site plan application for an affordable housing development and in relation to the date of the taking\u2014persuade us that the property should be valued as it was zoned at the time of the June, 2003 application.

The town cites to <em>Tandet v. Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>179 Conn. 293, 299, 426 A.2d 280 (1979), for the proposition that: \u201cWhere in the opinion of the appraiser the property is not, on the date of taking, being put to its highest and best use, it is incumbent upon the appraiser to provide the trier with sufficient evidence from which it could conclude that it is reasonably probable that the land to be taken would, but for the taking, be devoted to the proposed use by a prudent investor in the near future.\u201d First, we note that we did not state in <em>Tandet </em>that the evidence testified to by the experts must in isolation support a trial court\u2019s determination that there is a reasonable probability that a property would be put to its highest and best use. On the contrary, the court was entitled to consider the testimony of Hunter and Michaud in the context of <em>all </em>the evidence presented at trial relevant to the proposed use of the property, and, as we have explained in this opinion, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the conclusion that there was a reasonable probability that the property would have been put to residential use but for the taking. Second, we note that both experts testified as to the basis for their conclusion that it was reasonably probable that New England Estates would obtain the necessary approvals. Specifically, Hunter testified that it was a reasonable assumption that either of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>proposed developments\u2014both the 268 unit market rate development and the 354 unit affordable housing development\u2014would have been approved. He based his opinion primarily on the 1988 approval of the 298 unit development proposal, which, he observed, went through with no change in the zoning regulations. Michaud had based his appraisal only on the 354 unit affordable housing development proposal, and testified that, based on his general knowledge of affordable housing applications, it was a reasonable assumption that the development ultimately would be approved. The trial court properly could consider the testimony of the experts as to the probability that the property would be put to use as residential, and evaluate the credibility of that testimony in light of the basis for those opinions, in the context of all of the relevant evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> In making this finding, the court noted that it had precluded the testimony of the town\u2019s expert on the issue of environmental contamination on the basis of the town\u2019s failure to disclose the expert within a reasonable time prior to trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 13-4. The town does not challenge in these appeals the court\u2019s decision to preclude the expert testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
