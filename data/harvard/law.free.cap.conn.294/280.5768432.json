Bran-tley and Christopher Texeira,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> two African-American firefighters employed by the fire department. The jury found that, by promoting other firefighters through a practice called \u201cunderfilling,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendants had diS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>criminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of race in violation of their right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The dispositive issue in these appeals is whether the trial court improperly denied the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdicts because the plaintiffs had failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their equal protection claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the jury reasonably could not have found in favor of the plaintiffs on the basis of the evidence before it and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">This court previously examined the defendants\u2019 practice of underfilling in <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>270 Conn. 133, 160, 179, 851 A.2d 1113 (2004) <em>(Broadnax I), </em>and concluded that the practice of underfilling violates the city\u2019s charter, its municipal ordinances and its civil service rules and regulations and affirmed the judgment of the trial court enjoining the city from engaging in the practice prospectively. In <em>Broadnax I, </em>this court also reversed the judgment of the trial court striking the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claims, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>allowing the trial that is the subject of these appeals to proceed. Id., 173-75; see footnote 24 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to the present appeals. \u201cThe city and its fire department have been involved in litigation dating back to 1975, when the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Zampano, J., ordered the fire department to increase its hiring of minority firefighters on a prescribed timeline with a targeted hiring goal [consent decree]. Thereafter, in 1989, the New Haven Firebird Society (Firebird Society), an organization of minority firefighters, brought an action challenging a practice in the fire department known as \u2018stockpiling.\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>New Haven Firebird Society </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners, </em>32 Conn. App. 585, 587-88, 630 A.2d 131, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 902, 634 A.2d 295 (1993). . . . Stockpiling was held to violate the city\u2019s charter and civil service rules and regulations because the practice resulted in some promotions actually taking effect after the applicable civil service eligibility list had expired. Id., 592-93. As a result of the litigation by the Firebird Society, the practice of stockpiling was abandoned prospectively, and promotions that had taken effect after the expiration of the eligibility list were judicially invalidated retroactively. Id., 589. This reshuffling of positions, as well as the retirement of other higher ranking firefighters, caused several vacancies in the fire department\u2019s command structure, particularly among the ranks of lieutenant and captain. Further, in the years following the trial court\u2019s decision in the action brought by the Firebird Society, the fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>department ceased to administer civil service examinations, which prevented it from filling those vacancies through promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u201cPromotions within the fire department are governed by the city\u2019s civil service rules and regulations, which require individuals to pass an examination before becoming eligible to be promoted to a particular position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After the examination results are calculated, the names of passing candidates,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> along with their corresponding examination scores, are placed on an eligibility list. Names on the list are arranged in \u2018rank order,\u2019 meaning that the individual with the highest examination score is listed first, followed by names arranged in descending examination score order.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cWhen a vacancy opens for a particular position, individuals are promoted from the eligibility list in rank order, on the basis of their examination score.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For example, if two positions for the rank of lieutenant are vacant, the two individuals who scored the highest on the most recent lieutenants examination, i.e., the two names atop the eligibility list, will be promoted to lieutenant. In this regard, promotions within the fire department are predictable; so long as there is a current eligibility fist for a particular position, firefighters know who is next in line to be promoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cPursuant to the civil service rules and regulations, eligibility lists expire two years from the date on which they are certified, i.e., the date on which the examination results are officially released. Accordingly, if an eligibility list for a particular position has expired, and the fire department has yet to administer another examination for that position, then the fire department will be unable to promote to that position; until, of course, an examination is administered and a new eligibility list is certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cIn addition, promotions in the fire department are funded through the city\u2019s annual budget. The city\u2019s board of aldermen creates the budget, which when passed and signed by the city\u2019s mayor, has the force of a city ordinance. When the board of aldermen produces the budget, it does so on a line-by-line basis. Thus, when the budget was enacted for fiscal year 1996-1997, it did not authorize a \u2018bottom line\u2019 for the fire department\u2019s funding; rather, the budget specified the number of firefighter personnel authorized to receive pay at each rank and the funds allotted for those positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201cAs previously alluded to, while the fire department was awaiting the finality of the Firebird Society litigation, the fire department refrained from promoting individuals to certain positions, and failed to administer civil service examinations. As a result, the most recent eligibility lists for lieutenant and captain had expired in March, 1988, and December, 1989, respectively. Thus, by the mid-1990s, although the fire department needed to promote firefighters to certain supervisory positions, such as lieutenant and captain, it could not do so until new promotional examinations were administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u201cMartin J. O\u2019Connor was the chief of the fire department from January, 1996, to January, 1998. In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>fill the fire department\u2019s need for additional lieutenants, captains and battalion chiefs, O\u2019Connor requested that civil service examinations be administered for those positions. In September, 1995, a lieutenants examination was administered, and [eligibility list No. 96-02] . . . was certified in January, 1996, expiring in January, 1998. A captains examination, however, was not administered until April, 1998. Thus, in early 1996, even though the fire department needed to fill vacancies for the positions of lieutenant and captain, it could only promote individuals to lieutenant because a captains examination had not yet been administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cAccording to O\u2019Connor, the fire department\u2019s command structure was seriously lacking in supervisory positions. It was O\u2019Connor\u2019s position that the fire department could not wait for the administration of additional civil service examinations; rather, O\u2019Connor set out to fill vacant positions immediately.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, between 1996 and 1997, the fire department promoted to lieutenant, in standard rank order, forty individuals who had passed the September, 1995 lieutenants examination. This brought the total number of lieutenants beyond that which the city budget allowed. In order to pay the excess lieutenants, the fire department used funds allocated for vacant captain and battalion chief positions. Thus, although the fire department exceeded the appropriations in the budget allocated for lieutenants, the department was within the budget for the appropriations devoted to captains and battalion chiefs; and it was within its total budgeted salary expense. The practice of using funds allocated for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>vacant higher rank to pay individuals employed at a lower rank is known as \u2018underfilling.\u2019<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u201cAfter serving the requisite time in grade; see footnote [8] of this opinion; the newly promoted lieutenants, including those promoted through underfilling, became eligible to sit for a captains examination, which was administered in April, 1998. Some of the underfilled lieutenants were subsequently promoted to captain on the basis of their success on the captains examination.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Broadnax </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 139-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The following additional facts were adduced at trial and are not in dispute. On March 13, 1996, the defendants promoted to lieutenant, in the usual rank order, twenty-two firefighters, including the plaintiffs, from eligibility list No. 96-02.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 150-51. The defendants thereafter promoted, again in rank order, eleven firefighters on July 3,1996,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and seven firefighters on October 16, 1996.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 151. For purposes of this litigation, the first twenty of those lieutenants who were promoted in March, 1996, including the plaintiffs, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>considered to have been promoted without the benefit of underfilling.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The last twenty are considered to have been underfilled.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Thirty-nine of the newly appointed lieutenants, including the plaintiffs and nineteen of the twenty who had been underfilled,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> passed the 1998 captains examination. Six firefighters who had attained the rank of lieutenant prior to 1996 also passed that examination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Their names appeared, in rank order based on test scores, on eligibility list No. 98-35, which was certified on September 2, 1998. Id. The defendants thereafter promoted to captain, in standard rank order, thirty-four lieutenants from eligibility list No. 98-35. Id., 152. Thirty-nine lieutenants ranked higher than Texeira on eligibility list No. 98-35, and at least forty lieutenants, including Texeira, ranked higher than Brantley on that list.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id. Accordingly, neither plaintiff was promoted to the rank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of captain. Both plaintiffs would have been promoted to captain if the defendants had not underfilled firefighters into the rank of lieutenant in 1996. Id., 158. In addition, three Caucasian firefighters promoted to budgeted positions as lieutenants would have been promoted to captain if not for underfilling.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The plaintiffs brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 (a)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and 1983<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> challenging the defendants\u2019 use of underfilling. In their substitute complaint,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the plaintiffs allege that, as a result of underfilling, they were denied promotions to the rank of captain despite having passed the April, 1998 captains examination and further were denied the opportunity to compete in subsequent promotional examinations for the positions of battalion chief and deputy chief. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that underfilling \u201cso diluted the pool of eligible candidates for promotional positions within the [fire department] that the plaintiffs\u2019 opportunity to be promoted ha[s] been unfairly and adversely affected, resulting in their respective chances for promotional advancement being unfairly, substantially and discrimi-natorily diminished.\u201d The plaintiffs further alleged that underfilling disproportionately favored similarly situated firefighters who were not African-American. Therefore, the plaintiffs claimed, they were denied the equal protection of laws in direct violation of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeks, inter alia, damages for lost wages, future lost wages, known as \u201cfront pay,\u201d lost pension value and noneconomic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The plaintiffs tried the issues of liability, lost wages and noneconomic damages to a jury, and the parties agreed that the trial court would decide the issues of front pay and lost pension value.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> On June 29, 2005, the jury returned verdicts for the plaintiffs and awarded damages as follows: (1) for Brantley, $43,218 in lost wages and $217,260 in noneconomic damages; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>for Texeira, $71,712 in lost wages and $178,920 in non-economic damages.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendants then filed motions to set aside the jury verdicts and for remittitur.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 16-35.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendants contended, inter alia, that the verdicts should be set aside because the plaintiffs had failed to produce any evidence that the defendants had treated them differently than similarly situated individuals who were not African-American or that the defendants had intentionally discriminated against them or had showed deliberate indifference to their equal protection rights. The trial court rejected this argument on the ground that the plaintiffs had presented evidence that the intended beneficiaries of the practice of underfilling were six firefighters who were not African-American and had been demoted as the result of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision that the practice of stockpiling violated the city\u2019s charter and civil service rules. See <em>New Haven Firebird Society </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 593. Although the trial court appeared to acknowledge that the percentage of African-American firefighters in the pool of lieutenants promoted through underfilling was no smaller than the percentage of African-Americans in the pool of lieutenants promoted through the ordinary promotion process, the court concluded that, under <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>L. C., </em>527 U.S. 581, 599 n.10, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 144 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>2d 540 (1999), \u201c[t]he fact that one person in the protected class has lost out to another person in the protected class is . . . irrelevant, so long as he has lost out because of his [protected status].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On January 2, 2007, after additional evidentiary hearings in July and August, 2006, the trial court issued its ruling on the issues of front pay and lost pension value. With respect to Texeira, the court credited the estimate of the defendants\u2019 expert, Jerome Sagnella, Jr.,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and awarded damages in the amount of $51,250.18 for front pay and $41,098.26 for loss of pension value. With respect to Brantley, the court noted that the fire department had terminated him from his position prior to the jury verdict, but that, if Brantley prevailed in his appeal from the fire department\u2019s decision to terminate him, which was then pending in the Appellate Court, and was restored to his position as lieutenant, the front pay and loss of pension amounts presented by the parties\u2019 experts would have to be recalculated. Accordingly, the trial court declined to award front pay or calculate loss of pension value with respect to Brantley. The trial court further expressed its \u201cbelie [\u00b6] that under [Practice Book] \u00a7 17-4,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> it has contmumg jurisdiction to entertain a motion to [open] the judgment\u201d if Brantley\u2019s termination is reversed by the Appellate Corut.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">On January 19, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to set aside the decision of the trial court with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to the plaintiffs\u2019 front pay and lost pension value. The defendants argued that the award of front pay to Texeira should be set aside because he had failed to mitigate his damages. With respect to Brantley, the defendants argued that: (1) the trial court lost jurisdiction to decide the issues of front pay and lost pension value because it had failed to render judgment within the 120 day timeline set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b; and (2) Brantley failed to submit evidence of the likelihood that he would win his appeal and be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">On July 25, 2007, the trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments and denied their motion to set aside the January 2, 2007 decision. In the meantime, the Appellate Court had reversed Brantley\u2019s termination. <em>See Brantley v. New Haven, </em>100 Conn. App. 853, 854-55, 920 A.2d 331 (2007) (reversing judgment of trial court vacating decision by department of labor board of mediation and arbitration to reinstate Brantley\u2019s employment). Accordingly, the trial court determined that a supplemental hearing would be scheduled to address the unsettled issue of Brantley\u2019s front pay and lost pension value.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The defendants then filed two of the present appeals. The first appeal, SC 17971, challenges the January 2, 2007 judgment of the trial court with respect to Texeira,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the second appeal, SC 17972, challenges the January 2, 2007 judgment of the trial court with respect to Brantley. Both appeals challenge the denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>defendants\u2019 motion to set aside that judgment. On December 5, 2007, this court stayed the defendants\u2019 appeals pending notice of the trial court\u2019s decision on the issue of front pay as to Brantley.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On February 19,2008, after a final evidentiary hearing on September 20 and October 5, 2007, the trial court awarded Brantley $17,273.23 in front pay and $149,347.17 in lost pension value. The defendants thereafter amended their appeal in SC 17972 to include February 19, 2008, as the judgment date, and also filed a third separate appeal, SC 18146, challenging the February 19, 2008 judgment. After transferring the appeals to this court; see footnote 2 of this opinion; we granted the defendants\u2019 motion to consolidate the appeal in SC 18146 with the appeals in SC 17971 and SC 17972.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">With this procedural history in mind, we first consider whether the defendants\u2019 appeal in SC 17972, from the January 2, 2007 decision of the trial court with respect to Brantley, should be dismissed for lack of a final judgment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although the parties did not raise this issue, we address it suasponte because \u201c[t]he appellate courts have a duty to dismiss, even on [their] own initiative, any appeal that [they lack] jurisdiction to hear.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lone Star Industries, Inc., </em>290 Conn. 767, 794, 967 A.2d 1 (2009). We conclude that the defendants\u2019 appeal in SC 17972 should be dismissed for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u201cThe lack of a final judgment implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of an appellate court to hear an appeal. A determination regarding . . . subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>jurisdiction is a question of law . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 793. A judgment \u201crendered only upon the issue of liability without an award of damages\u201d is interlocutory in character and not a final judgment from which an appeal lies. <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 84, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985); see <em>also Balf Co. </em>v. <em>Spera Construction Co., </em>222 Conn. 211, 212, 608 A.2d 682 (1992) (summary judgment rendered upon issue of liability only, without deciding damages, is not final judgment from which appeal lies).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In the present case, the jury returned verdicts as to the defendants\u2019 liability and awarded back pay and noneconomic damages to the plaintiffs, but did not decide the remaining issues of front pay and lost pension value. The trial court\u2019s January 2, 2007 decision further postponed a final determination of Brantley\u2019s front pay and lost pension value claims. The resolution of those claims for relief was a necessary predicate to the finality of the judgment with respect to Brantley because the claims seek compensation for the alleged wrongful conduct of the defendants, which \u201cdepend[s] upon an assessment of the underlying merits of the transaction between the parties. \u201d <em>Balf Co. </em>v. <em>Spera Construction Co., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 215. Moreover, a resolution of the issues of front pay and lost pension value would afford this court \u201ca better opportunity to review in its entirety the alleged wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiffs full damages, as well as other matters of equity bearing on the merits of the litigation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s January 2,2007 decision to delay the resolution of Brantley\u2019s front pay and lost pension value claims was interlocutory and postponed the finality of the judgment with respect to him. See <em>Mazurek </em>v. <em>Great American Ins. Co., </em>284 Conn. 16, 34, 930 A.2d 682 (2007) (dismissing appeal for lack of final judgment when parties entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>into agreement that effectively put certain remaining claims \u201con hold\u201d pending outcome of appeal). We therefore dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeal in SC 17972 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Having concluded that this court lacks jurisdiction over the defendants\u2019 appeal in SC 17972, we next address the merits of the defendants\u2019 remaining appeals. In SC 17971, the defendants appeal from the January 2, 2007 judgment in favor of Texeira. In SC 18146, the defendants appeal from the February 19, 2008 judgment in favor of Brantley. In both appeals, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly denied their motion to set aside the jury verdicts. The defendants argue that the jury reasonably could not have found that they had violated the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights because there was insufficient evidence that the defendants had treated the plaintiffs differently than similarly situated non-African-American firefighters because of their race. Because the plaintiffs presented <em>no </em>evidence that the practice of underfilling reduced the chances of African-American firefighters as a class to obtain a promotion to captain or increased the chances of non-African-American firefighters as a class for such a promotion, we agree with the defendants that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that they had violated the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cA party challenging the validity of the jury\u2019s verdict on grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support such a result carries a difficult burden. In reviewing the soundness of a jury\u2019s verdict, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pestey </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>259 Conn. 345, 369, 788 A.2d 496 (2002). \u201cFurthermore, it is not the function of this court to sit as the seventh juror when we review the sufficiency of the evidence . . . rather, we must determine . . . whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the jury\u2019s verdict .... [I]f the jury could reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand, even if this court disagrees with it.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Griffin Health Services Corp., </em>249 Conn. 523, 534, 733 A.2d 197 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u201cTo prevail on a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must [prove] (1) that some person has deprived him of a federal right, and (2) that the person who has deprived him of that right acted under color of . . . law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>401 F.3d 75, 84 (2d Cir. 2005). The defendants do not dispute that they were acting under color of law when they implemented the practice of underfilling. They focus entirely on the question of whether they violated the plaintiffs\u2019 federal right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The legal principles underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim axe well established. \u201cThe [e]qual [protection [c]lause of the [f]ourteenth [a]mendment commands that no [s]tate shall \u2018deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,\u2019 which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\u201d <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.

Therefore, the plaintiff must prove that the action had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. . . . Put another way, the plaintiff must establish that he, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively treated . . . and . . . that such selective treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DiMartino </em>v. <em>Richens, </em>263 Conn. 639, 673, 822 A.2d 205 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In the present case, the plaintiffs have alleged that the facially neutral, evenly applied practice of underfill-ing has had an adverse effect on African-American firefighters and was motivated by discriminatory animus. \u201cTo establish that an even-handedly applied, facially neutral law should be [treated as if it classified on the basis of race], the challenger normally must show that (1) the law has such a disproportionate impact on one of several groups (i.e., race, national origin, alienage, gender or illegitimacy) that we may view the law as if it created such a classification on its face, and (2) a discriminatory purpose motivated the actions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>government officials.\u201d <em>Orange Lake Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>21 F.3d 1214, 1226 (2d Cir. 1994); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 465, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996) (ordinary equal protection standards require plaintiff to prove that government action had discriminatory effect and was motivated by discriminatory purpose). Because we find that there was insufficient evidence presented to support a finding that the practice of underfilling had a discriminatory effect and, therefore, that the plaintiffs cannot satisfy the first prong of an equal protection violation, we need not decide whether there was sufficient evidence to support the second prong of discriminatory intent. See footnote 42 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u201c[T]he analytical predicate [of an equal protection claim] is a determination of who are the persons . . . similarly situated.\u201d <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>289 Conn. 135, 158, 957 A.2d 407 (2008). Accordingly, before we address the substance of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we must identify the persons who must be compared in order to determine whether underfilling had a disproportionately adverse effect on African-American firefighters because of their race. In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the practice of underfilling \u201cso diluted the pool of eligible candidates for promotional positions . . . that the plaintiffs\u2019 opportunity to be promoted ha[s] been unfairly and adversely affected\u201d because of their race. They further alleged that, \u201c[c]onversely, by virtue of the practice of underfilling, Caucasian, white firefighters of [various] ranks, who either were or are similarly situated to the plaintiffs have disproportionately benefited with respect to promotions within the [department.\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs claim that the African-American firefighters who were eligible for and desired promotion, i.e., those who took the 1998 captains examination, had, as a class, reduced chances of being promoted as the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of underfilling, while the non-African-American firefighters who took the examination had, as a class, increased chances of promotion. Thus, in order to determine whether underfilling treated all similarly situated persons alike; see <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>supra, 473 U.S. 439; we must compare the effect of underfilling on the pool of African-American lieutenants who took the examination with its effect on the pool of non-African-American lieutenants who took the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In support of their claim that the practice of underfill-ing decreased the chances that African-American lieutenants would be promoted to the rank of captain in favor of non-African-American lieutenants, the plaintiffs offered, in the form of testimony and a written report, the opinion of Gerald Jaynes, a professor of economics and African-American studies at Yale University, who testified as an expert in employment discrimination. Jaynes opined that underfilling had \u201ca discriminatory effect in the sense that it diluted the [plaintiffs\u2019] promotion . . . possibilities by increasing the pool of individuals they had to compete with.\u201d He further testified that underfilling \u201cfavored white males because white males were the greater portion of individuals who were, in fact, underfilled.\u201d Thus, Jaynes testified that, because a larger number of non-African-American firefighters than African-American firefighters were promoted to lieutenant through underfilling, underfilling had a detrimental impact on the opportunities for African-American firefighters to be promoted to captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The fact that a larger number of non-African-American firefighters were promoted to lieutenant through underfilling than African-American firefighters does not establish, however, that underfilling had a disproportionate impact on the chances of African-American firefighters <em>as a class </em>to obtain a promotion to captain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Rather, a disproportionate impact on African-American firefighters as a class could be demonstrated only by establishing that, compared to the percentage of budgeted lieutenants who were African-American, a disproportionately small percentage of underfilled lieutenants were African-American. If the percentage of underfilled lieutenants who were African-American exceeded or equaled the percentage of budgeted lieutenants who were African-American, then the chances for African-American lieutenants, as a class, to obtain promotions would be greater than or equal to their chances to obtain promotions if underfilling had not been implemented, all other things being equal.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Although the evidence established that the practice of underfilling benefited the class of underfilled lieutenants by increasing their chances for promotion and adversely affected the class of budgeted lieutenants by reducing their chances for promotion,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the plaintiffs presented <em>no </em>evidence that the <em>percentage </em>of underfilled African-American lieutenants who were eligible for promotion to captain was smaller than the percentage of budgeted African-American lieutenants. Indeed, the evidence presented by the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>unequivocally demonstrated the opposite.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Accordingly, even if we assume that the jury reasonably could have rejected the defendants\u2019 evidence that underfilling had <em>increased </em>the chances of African-American firefighters to be promoted, there was no evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the practice of underfilling had <em>reduced </em>the chances of African-American firefighters as a class to be promoted or that it had increased the chances of non-African-American firefighters as a class to be promoted. Thus, there was no evidence that underfilling had a disproportionate impact on African-American firefighters thereby allowing the jury to conclude that underfilling should be treated as if it had created a racial classification on its face. See <em>Orange Lake Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>supra, 21 F.3d 1226 (to establish that facially neutral law violates equal protection clause, plaintiff must establish that it has such disproportionate impact on protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>group that it may be viewed as if it classifies on basis of group membership).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We recognize that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the practice of underfilling adversely affected the <em>individual plaintiffs. </em>Indeed, the defendants concede that, if not for the practice, the plaintiffs would have been promoted.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We emphasize, however, that the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim is that underfilling adversely affected African-American firefighters <em>as a class </em>by reducing the chances that African-American lieutenants would be promoted to captain. Proof that individual African-American firefighters were adversely affected by the practice does not establish that underfilling adversely affected similarly situated African-American firefighters as a class. As we have indicated, there is no evidence that the practice of underfilling reduced the percentage of African-American lieutenants in the pool of lieutenants who took the 1998 captains examination. Indeed, the only evidence presented on the issue demonstrated the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We further recognize that, but for the practice of underfilling, four African-American lieutenants would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>have been promoted to captain instead of three.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In order to establish that this was an effect of underfilling, however, the plaintiffs would have had to establish that a practice that <em>increased </em>the percentage of African-American firefighters who were eligible to take the captains examination somehow had the effect of <em>decreasing </em>their chances for promotion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It is clear, as a matter of pure logic, that no such causal relationship can exist. Rather, any disparate impact resulted from the unforeseeable fortuity that a smaller percentage of African-American lieutenants passed the captains examination. As we have indicated, the plaintiffs have made no claim that the captains examination was discriminatory. See footnote 35 of this opinion. Accordingly, the fact that, contrary to what the defendants reasonably could have foreseen, fewer African-American lieutenants were promoted to captain than would have been promoted if underfilling had not been implemented, cannot establish that underfilling itself had an adverse impact on African-American lieutenants as a class. It would be anomalous to hold that the practice of underfilling, which had the effect of actually increasing the chances for African-American firefighters as a class to be promoted to captain, violated the equal protection clause when the undisputed evidence demonstrated that the reason that fewer African-American lieutenants were promoted was the test results, which the plaintiffs do not claim were the result of discrimination. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>there is no evidence that the defendants had any control over the test results or that they could have predicted them at the time that underfilling was implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The plaintiffs claim, however, that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendants had discriminated against them on the basis of their race because the \u201cindividuals who the jury undoubtedly considered for purposes of determining whether disparate treatment occurred with respect to the plaintiffs were those white firefighters whose badges had been taken away\u201d as the result of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>New Haven Firebird Society </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 592-93.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contend that the identification of the similarly situated individuals is a question of fact for the juiy; see <em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Suffolk, </em>316 F.3d 368, 379 (2d Cir. 2003); and that the jury reasonably could have found that the plaintiffs were similarly situated to the lieutenants who had been demoted following <em>New Haven Firebird Society, </em>but not to any of the other lieutenants who took the captains examination. Finally, they contend that the evidence supports a finding that the defendants intended to treat the firefighters who had been demoted more favorably than them. Specifically, they point to evidence of a history of litigation against the fire department challenging its minority hiring practices, evidence that the stockpiling case had resulted in racial tension in the department, evidence that the practice of underfilling had no bona fide job-related purpose and the fact that all of the demoted firefighters were Caucasian.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We are not persuaded. First, the plaintiffs never asked the jury to find that they were similarly situated <em>only </em>to the underfilled firefighters who previously had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>demoted. Rather, the plaintiffs argued to the jury that the members of the unprotected class to whom they were similarly situated were the \u201clieutenants [with whom] they sat . . . for the captains [examination].\u201d The plaintiffs then argued to the jury that the evidence established that the defendants had treated the plaintiffs \u201cdifferently than members of another identifiable group such as those individuals who lost their badges.\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs suggested that, if the jury found that the plaintiffs were similarly situated to one group, i.e., the lieutenants who sat for the captains examination, and if it then found that the defendants had treated them differently than a mere subset of this group, i.e., the underfilled lieutenants who previously had been demoted, this different treatment would constitute discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Second, and more fundamentally, the plaintiffs have not explained to this court why their treatment reasonably may be compared <em>only </em>to the treatment of the underfilled lieutenants who previously had been demoted, and not to the treatment of the similarly situated non-Afiican-American budgeted firefighters whose chances of promotion also were reduced as the result of underfilling. Nor do they explain why the treatment of the demoted firefighters should be compared <em>only </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 treatment, but not to the treatment of the similarly situated African-American underfilled lieutenants whose chances of promotion also were increased as the result of underfilling. They simply make the bare assertion that the jury reasonably could have compared the favorable effect of underfilling <em>only </em>on the demoted firefighters with the adverse effect <em>only </em>on the plaintiffs in determining whether the defendants had discriminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>their race.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Because the plaintiffs cannot point to any factual or legal grounds in support of their claim that the jury reasonably could have ignored the effects of underfilling on the African-American underfilled lieutenants or on the non-African-American budgeted lieutenants in making its determination as to whether the defendants had discriminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of their race, we reject this claim.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>elude, therefore, that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants had violated their equal protection rights by implementing the practice of underfilling.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The defendants\u2019 appeal in SC 17972 is dismissed. With respect to SC 17971 and SC 18146, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to grant the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the jury verdicts and to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In November 3, 1999, the New Haven Firefighters Union Local 825 (union) filed a motion to intervene as a defendant, which the trial court subsequently granted.

For example, if ten individuals are promoted to lieutenant, and only five vacancies exist in the budget for the position of lieutenant, but several vacancies exist in a higher ranking position, such as captain or battalion chief, the first five newly appointed lieuten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ants are promoted and paid with budgeted lieutenant funds, but the next five newly appointed underfilled lieutenants are paid with funds reserved for the vacant captain or battalion chief positions.

In its memorandum of decision on the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the January 2, 2007 judgment, the trial court simply stated that it had discussed in its January 2, 2007 judgment the defendants\u2019 claim that Texeira had failed to mitigate damages and that it \u201cstill is of the opinion that the defendants have not proven this claim.\u201d Accordingly, to the extent that we address the issue of mitigation of damages in SC 17971, we focus our analysis on the trial court\u2019s January 2, 2007 judgment in favor of Texeira.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\"> We assume that the defendants filed the appeal in SC 17972 to protect their right to appeal if the reviewing court determined that the trial court\u2019s January 2,2007 decision regarding Brantley was a final, appealable judgment. Similarly, we assume that they filed their appeal in SC <em>18146 to protect their </em>right to appeal if the reviewing court determined that there was no final judgment with respect to Brantley until the trial court\u2019s February 19, 2008 decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 61-9 has been amended to provide that \u201c[i]f, after an amended appeal is filed, the original appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the amended appeal shall not be void as long as the amended appeal was filed from a judgment or order from which an original appeal could have been filed.\u201d See Connecticut Law Journal, Vol. 71, No. 10, p. 4C (September 8, 2009). This amendment is not effective until January 1, 2010. Accordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 amended appeal did not cure the jurisdictional defect. See <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 86 n.3 (this court has no power to allow amendment conferring jurisdiction, since that in itself would be exercise of jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em> </em>The plaintiffs bore the burden of proving an equal protection violation by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Pozzi, </em>352 F.3d 79, 103 (2d Cir. 2003). The plaintiffs sustained their burden of proof as to the essential elements of their equal protection claims \u201cif the evidence, considered fairly and impartially, induce[d] in the mind[s] of the [jurors] a reasonable belief that it [is] more probable than otherwise that the facts involved in that element [are] true.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Griffin Health Services Corp., </em>249 Conn. 523, 535 n.8, 733 A.2d 197 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> The plaintiffs have made no claim that there were factors other than underfilling that unfairly decreased the chances of African-Americans to be promoted to captain. Specifically, the plaintiffs have made no claim that the captains examination or that the promotions in rank order based on test scores were discriminatory in intent or effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> We recognize, therefore, that the practice of underfilling did not have the same effect on all similarly situated individuals. It benefited the underfilled lieutenants and adversely affected the budgeted lieutenants. In the absence of any evidence that a disproportionately large percentage of the underfilled lieutenants were not African-American, however, this disparate treatment of the two sets of individuals cannot be viewed as if it created a racial classification on its face. See <em>Orange Lake Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>supra, 21 F.3d 1226 (to establish that facially neutral law violates equal protection clause, plaintiff must establish that it has such disproportionate impact on protected group that it may be viewed as if it classifies on basis of group membership).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\"> The defendants presented evidence that fifty-nine lieutenants applied to take the 1998 captains examination, including the twenty underfilled lieutenants. Nine, or 15.25 percent, of the fifty-nine applicants were African-American. When the underfilled lieutenants are excluded from this group, only five, or 12.82 percent, of the thirty-nine remaining lieutenants are African-American. Fifty lieutenants actually took the examination. Eight, or 16 percent, of these were African-American. When the underfilled lieutenants are excluded from this group, only four, or 13.33 percent of the thirty remaining lieutenants are African-American.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Jaynes testified and stated in his expert report that, when the 1998 captains examination was administered, only ten of the lieutenants who took the examination would not have been eligible to take it but for the practice of underfilling, and all ten of these firefighters were Caucasian. The trial court instructed the jury, however, that, for purposes of this case, the jury was required to find that twenty firefighters, namely, John Ryan, Miguel Rosado, Sheryl Broadnax, Charles Hewitt, William Integlia, Ralph Santora, Julian Garay, Edward Riordan, Christopher Sanchez, Thomas Heins, Thomas Dwyer, Anthony Annunziato, Howard McCann, Anthony Gallicchio, Dennis Miller, Ronald Dumas, Michael Walker, James Stacy, David Morgan and Steven Andreucci, were to be considered underfilled. The trial court specifically instructed the jury that it was to disregard any testimony by Jaynes to the contrary. The plaintiffs make no claim on appeal that this instruction was improper. Of the twenty underfilled lieutenants, four were African-American, namely, Dumas, Broadnax, Walker and Hewitt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> The evidence also showed, however, that three Caucasian budgeted lieutenants who would have been promoted if not for underfilling were not promoted. As we have indicated, the three lieutenants were James Schwartz, Gerald Boucher and Joseph DeCato. See footnote 21 of this opinion. The plaintiffs contend that Schwartz, Boucher and DeCato were not similarly situated to them because Schwartz, at some point after the administration of the 1998 captains examination, was appointed as an acting captain and Boucher and DeCato previously had taken the captains examination and failed to pass. It is undisputed, however, that, like the plaintiffs, these three budgeted lieutenants took the 1998 captains examination for the purpose of obtaining a promotion to captain and, like the plaintiffs, they would have obtained the promotions if not for underfilling. We conclude that no reasonable jury could have concluded that the distinctions relied on by the plaintiffs were salient. Accordingly, we conclude that the only reasonable conclusion that the jury could have reached was that the three Caucasian budgeted lieutenants were similarly situated to the plaintiffs and suffered the same adverse effect from underfilling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\"> Two budgeted African-American lieutenants, Anthony Calloway and Ralph Black, and one underfilled African-American lieutenant, Michael Walker, were promoted to captain as a result of the 1998 captains examination. The defendants concede that, if underfilling had not been implemented, Calloway, Black, Brantley and Texeira would have been promoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\"> As we have indicated, the only evidence in this case was that the percentage of African-American lieutenants in the pool of lieutenants who were eligible to take the captains examination actually increased after underfilling. Accordingly, the foreseeable effect of the practice would be to increase the percentage of African-American lieutenants who actually could be promoted to captain, not to reduce it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> These firefighters were William Seward, John Ryan, William Integlia, James Stacy, Steven Andreucci and Julian Garay. All but Seward had been promoted to lieutenant through underfilling. All but Ryan were promoted to captain as the result of the 1998 captains examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b333-5\"> The plaintiffs argue, and the trial court found, that the evidence supports a finding that the <em>intent </em>of the defendants in implementing underfilling was to give preferential treatment to the firefighters who previously had been demoted, all of whom were Caucasian, and that this intent was in reckless disregard of the rights of the budgeted lieutenants, including the two African-American plaintiffs. Even if we assume that the defendants had such an intent, however, the plaintiffs cannot establish that the defendants violated their equal protection rights unless they also establish that underfilling had an adverse <em>impact </em>on African-American firefighters as a class. <em>DiMartino </em>v. <em>Richens, </em>supra, 263 Conn. 673 (to establish equal protection violation plaintiff must prove both discriminatory effect and discriminatory purpose). As we have explained, to determine whether there was such an adverse impact, we must compare the effect of underfilling on all similarly situated individuals. Even if the defendants\u2019 intent was to give preferential treatment to the previously demoted firefighters, they gave the same preferential treatment to <em>all </em>firefighters who were eligible for promotion through underfilling, a proportional number of whom were African-American. Consequently, they did not treat similarly situated individuals differently because of their race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> Because we conclude that the jury reasonably could not have concluded that it should limit itself to comparing the effect of underfilling on the demoted firefighters with its effect on the plaintiffs, and because the plaintiffs have not identified any other persons who were similarly situated to them but were treated differently because of their race, we need not decide whether the identification of a similarly situated class is a question of fact for the jury or a question of law for the court. We note, however, that our research has revealed no case in which an appellate tribunal has deferred to a fact finder\u2019s determination as to whether persons were similarly situated for purposes of evaluating a claim under the equal protection clause. Cf. <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Illinois State Police, </em>251 F.3d 612, 637 (7th Cir. 2001) (rejecting District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiff was not similarly situated to person who was treated differently); <em>Desris </em>v. <em>Kenosha, </em>687 F.2d 1117, 1119, 1121 (7th Cir. 1982) (rejecting District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs were similarly situated to persons who were treated differently), cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1120, 103 S. Ct. 3090, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1350 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In their brief to this court, the plaintiffs also cite <em>Pyke </em>v. <em>Cuomo, </em>258 F.3d 107, 108-109 (2d Cir. 2001), for the proposition that a \u201cplaintiff alleging an equal protection claim under a theory of discriminatory application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>law, or under a theory of discriminatory motivation underlying a facially neutral policy or statute, generally need not plead or show the disparate treatment of other similarly situated individuals.\u201d In <em>Pyke, </em>the plaintiffs, Native Americans living on a <em>reservation, </em>alleged that the defendants, officials of the state of New York, had failed to provide them with police protection because they were Native Americans. Id., 108. The court held that the plaintiffs were not required to show that the defendants had treated others who were similarly situated differently because of their race. Id., 108-109. The court reasoned that \u201c[i]t would be difficult, if not impossible, to find other individuals whose situation is similar to Native Americans living on a reservation and exercising a substantial measure of self-government independent of [the] [s]tate.\u201d Id., 109. It was implicit in the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, however, that, if a group of non-Native Americans living on a reservation and exercising a measure of self-government independent from the state had existed, the defendants would have treated them more favorably because of their race. Thus, it does not follow from the court\u2019s reasoning that, if the plaintiffs <em>are </em>similarly situated to other individuals and the evidence establishes that all similarly situated individuals are treated the same regardless of their race, then the plaintiffs can establish an equal protection violation. As we have indicated, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the present case assumes that all of the lieutenants who were eligible to take the 1998 captains examination were similarly situated, despite their inconsistent claim that they were similarly situated <em>only </em>to the underfilled lieutenants who previously had been demoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
