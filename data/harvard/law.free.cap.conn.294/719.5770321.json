The plaintiff sought the declaration after the parties had entered into a settlement agreement (agreement) that required ProMutual to pay Skolnick\u2019s $1 million policy limit to the plaintiff and under which they stipulated that: (1) the agreement was to be considered a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for purposes of the offer of judgment statute, General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-192a;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) the plaintiff would have been entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>to offer of judgment interest had the case been tried to conclusion. On appeal, the parties are aligned in their position that the trial court improperly declined to resolve the matter on the basis of the issue presented to it, in light of the stipulations in their agreement and the declaratory posture of the action. They disagree, however, as to whether the pertinent policy provision, which defined damages to include prejudgment interest, can be given effect so as to bar an award of such interest when the total recovery would exceed the policy limit. We conclude that the parties\u2019 stipulations did not satisfy the necessary predicate to an award of offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a, namely, a judgment in the plaintiffs favor after a trial. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>we conclude that the trial court properly declined to reach the issue on which the plaintiff had sought a declaration. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In August, 2004, the plaintiff commenced a malpractice action against Skolnick, a general internist, and Skolnick\u2019s medical practice, the defendant Darien Medical Group, alleging that Skolnick\u2019s negligent failure to properly diagnose and treat the plaintiff had caused him to suffer severe hypertension and end stage renal failure, which ultimately required him to undergo a kidney transplant. The plaintiff, who had been a senior vice president with The Bank of New York, further alleged that these injuries had resulted in his reassignment to a position at substantially reduced compensation and had derailed his promising career. On September 30, 2005, the plaintiff filed an offer of judgment in the amount of $1 million, the limit of liability under Skolnick\u2019s malpractice policy with ProMutual. That offer was not accepted within the thirty day period mandated under \u00a7 52-192a (a) and, therefore, was deemed rejected as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Approximately nineteen months after the filing of the offer of judgment, the plaintiff, Skolnick and ProMutual executed the agreement to settle the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the agreement, ProMutual was to pay Skolnick\u2019s $1 million policy limit to the plaintiff in exchange for the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>release of all claims against the defendants under the pending action except for a claim against ProMutual for offer of judgment interest. With respect to offer of judgment interest, the agreement provided in relevant part: \u201cThe [plaintiff] and [Skolnick and ProMutual] agree that the issue of whether or not [ProMutual is] obligated, under the terms of the policy of insurance that [ProMutual] issued to [Skolnick], for the payment of offer of judgment interest is an issue that needs to be decided by a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThe [plaintiff] and [Skolnick and ProMutual] have agreed to reserve to the court the question on offer of judgment interest as set forth . . . below in the interests of judicial efficiency, in order to avoid a full trial that the parties agree would result in a judgment of at least [$1 million] representing the underlying policy limits in this action. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\u201c[I]t is agreed that if the action were tried to conclusion, the [plaintiff] would become entitled to recover from [ProMutual] the sum certain of [$1 million] plus offer of judgment interest in the amount of $293,000.00. For all purposes under the prejudgment [interest] statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this [agreement shall be considered to be a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff, it being both parties\u2019 desire to promote a fair and efficient resolution of the prejudgment . . . interest issue without the time and expense to the parties and the judicial system of a long and protracted trial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\u201cThe question reserved to the court is whether, given that a valid offer of judgment was filed by the plaintiff in the amount of [$1 million], and assuming a verdict entered after trial of at least [$1 million] such that offer of judgment interest would be due on the [$1 million] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>verdict, is [ProMutual] required to pay said offer of judgment interest where, as here, it exceeds the [$1 million] policy limits?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The agreement further acknowledged that, if the court ruled in the plaintiffs favor, such a decision would obligate ProMutual to pay $293,000 in offer of judgment interest, and, conversely, if the court ruled in ProMutual\u2019s favor, such a decision would obligate the plaintiff to release all further claims against ProMutual beyond the $1 million policy payment. The agreement provided that in no event would Skolnick incur any obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In accordance with their agreement, the plaintiff thereafter filed a motion to cite in ProMutual as a party defendant, which the court, Karazin, <em>J., </em>granted. The plaintiff concurrently filed an amended complaint, along with a copy of the agreement, in which he added to his original medical malpractice count against Skol-nick a count against ProMutual for a declaratory judgment as to the question reserved in the agreement regarding offer of judgment interest. ProMutual thereafter filed an answer and asserted as a special defense that it was not hable for offer of judgment interest because the policy defines damages to include prejudgment interest<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and its agreement to pay the $1 million policy limit had exhausted its obligation under the pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>icy. ProMutual subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment count, and the plaintiff simultaneously filed a motion for a declaratory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">After argument on the motions, the trial court, <em>J. R. Downey, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision addressing both motions, making dispositive determinations in favor of ProMutual, but on a different ground than the one raised by the parties. Specifically, the court pointed to the fact that \u00a7 52-192a permits an award of offer of judgment interest only \u201c \u2018[a]fter trial\u2019 . . . .\u201d The court therefore reasoned that, because the matter had been settled <em>before </em>trial by way of a settlement, \u00a7 52-192a did not authorize offer of judgment interest. Although the court recognized that the parties had sought a determination as to the effect of the policy limit on offer of judgment interest, the court concluded that its construction of the statute rendered that determination unnecessary. The parties thereafter unsuccessfully invoked several procedural mechanisms in an attempt to obtain a ruling on the issue not addressed by the trial court. First, the parties filed a joint motion for reargument, specifically directing the trial court to the language in the agreement wherein the parties had stipulated that the agreement was to be treated as a verdict and judgment for purposes of the motions before the court. Judge Downey granted the motion for reargument, but denied the relief requested. Next, after the plaintiff had appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment, ProMutual filed a motion for articulation in the trial court as to the following question: \u201cAre insurance companies and policyholders free to enter into liability insurance contracts that limit the amount the insurer must pay as damages on behalf of the policyholder, including any prejudgment interest that may be assessed against the policyholder?\u201d Judge Downey thereafter issued an articulation stating that he had considered, but not decided, the hypothetical question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>posed because \u201cthe necessary predicate, a trial, had not occurred.\u201d The court further explained that reaching this question would have been rendering an advisory opinion, which courts are not inclined to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On appeal to this court; see footnote 2 of this opinion; the plaintiff contends, and ProMutual agrees, that the trial court improperly declined to answer the question that the parties had presented to it because that question properly was before the court and did not require it to render an advisory opinion. With respect to the merits of this question, the plaintiff contends that the policy provision defining the limit on damages to include prejudgment interest cannot be given effect because: (1) the offer of judgment statute is mandatory and punitive; and (2) the policy\u2019s definition of damages as including prejudgment interest is unenforceable because it is an attempt to circumvent the legislative directive under \u00a7 52-192a and the policy\u2019s characterization cannot change the actual nature of the interest. As to its view of the merits, ProMutual contends that it cannot be obligated to pay offer of judgment interest because, under the unambiguous terms of Skolnick\u2019s policy, it had paid the policy limit to the plaintiff and public policy does not weigh in favor of superseding such unambiguous contract language. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Our analysis begins with the question of whether the trial court properly based its decision on the dictates of \u00a7 52-192a or whether, as the parties claim, the trial court\u2019s decision should have been determined solely by the effect of the policy\u2019s limit on damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>contend that this issue properly was before the court in light of the express terms of their agreement that: (1) the agreement would constitute a verdict and judgment in the plaintiffs favor for all purposes of the offer of judgment statute; and (2) the plaintiff was entitled to interest under that statute. Therefore, they contend that the <em>only </em>issue properly before the court was whether ProMutuai is obligated to pay offer of judgment interest when that interest, coupled with the $1 million settlement, would exceed the policy limit on damages. The parties also contend that, because a decision on the issue presented would have resulted in the payment or nonpayment of interest, the trial court improperly concluded that a decision on this question would have been merely advisory. In support of all of these contentions, ProMutuai specifically contends that the trial court mistakenly treated the claim as one for an award of interest under \u00a7 52-192a, rather than a claim for a declaratory judgment under General Statutes \u00a7 52-29<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> regarding a policy coverage dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>We note that, because the parties\u2019 claim centers on whether the trial court applied the proper legal standard, our review is plenary. <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Soneco/Northeastern, Inc., </em>287 Conn. 20, 32, 946 A.2d 839 (2008); <em>Hartford Courant Co. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>261 Conn. 86, 96-97, 801 A.2d 759 (2002). Upon such review, we conclude that the trial court properly declined to decide whether the policy limitation on damages barred payment of offer of judgment interest because it properly concluded that a necessary predicate to reaching this question had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We first point out that, although the parties have attempted to characterize their dispute as arising wholly out of contract\u2014the agreement and the policy\u2014the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement and their respective positions regarding the declaratory judgment action belie that characterization. The agreement provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cFor all purposes under the prejudgment [interest] statute, </em>this [agreement shall be considered to be a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff, it being both parties\u2019 desire to promote a fair and efficient resolution of the prejudgment . . . interest issue without the time and expense to the parties and the judicial system of a long and protracted trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The agreement expressly instructed the trial court to <em>\u201cassum[\u00e9] a verdict was entered after trial </em>of at least [$1 million] such that offer of judgment interest would be due on the [$1 million] verdict . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the first statement, the parties acknowledge that \u00a7 52-192a is the source of the obligation of offer of judgment interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In both statements, the parties implicitly acknowledge that the plaintiff would not be entitled to interest unless he had satisfied a predicate to recovery under that statute, namely, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>trial upon which judgment was rendered in the plaintiffs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The nature of the disagreement between the parties as to the question raised in the declaratory judgment count further underscores that \u00a7 52-192a was the necessary starting point for the trial court\u2019s analysis. The parties did not dispute the meaning of the policy. Rather, their dispute centered on whether it would be consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 52-192a to give effect to a contract provision that unambiguously defined its limitation on damages to include prejudgment interest. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Specifically, the plaintiff focused on the mandatory nature and punitive intent of the statute and contended that the policy\u2019s characterization of such interest as damages could not change the essential nature of the interest. Thus, it is clear that \u00a7 52-192a is the source of the obligation that the plaintiff invokes and that ProMu-tual seeks to avoid in this case. Therefore, despite their attempt to characterize the issue before the trial court as one arising solely out of contract, the record is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">It also is evident that, by deeming their agreement tantamount to a judgment in the plaintiffs favor and directing the court to assume as much, the parties proceeded from the presumption that the requirements of \u00a7 52-192a had been met, such that the only question left to the court was whether the policy limit could bar the award of \u00a7 52-192a interest. The mere fact, however, that parties assume that a necessary predicate to their claim has been satisfied does not preclude the court from considering that predicate issue. See, e.g., <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Allan S. Goodman, Inc., </em>286 Conn. 390, 403-404, 944 A.2d 925 (2008) (addressing question of whether provision of Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 et seq., imposes same duty on employers to provide reasonable accommoda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>tion to disabled individuals that is required under federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., despite fact that parties were in agreement for purposes of appeal that same duty applied, \u201c[b]ecause this question is an essential predicate to our analysis of the plaintiffs claim in the present case\u201d); <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 33, 792 A.2d 835 (2002) (deciding that, before court could reach issue raised as to whether attorney\u2019s fees fell within <em>exclusion </em>to General Statutes \u00a7 31-303, statute assessing interest on late payments due under workers\u2019 compensation award, it must decide threshold issue as to whether such fees constituted \u201c \u2018payment due under an award\u2019 \u201d under that statute, which was issue that neither party had disputed); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>245 Conn. 209, 214-15, 715 A.2d 680 (1998) (\u201c[b]efore addressing the certified issue of whether the facts and circumstances of this case were sufficient to create a legal duty to protect the victim from parental abuse pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-59 [a] [3], we turn our attention to the question of whether, even if we assume such a duty exists, the failure to act can create liability under that statute\u201d), rev\u2019d, 274 Conn. 727, 878 A.2d 1118 (2005); see also <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>291 Conn. 307, 331-32, 968 A.2d 396 (2009) (addressing predicate assumption before addressing plaintiffs\u2019 ultimate claim on appeal). Therefore, the trial court properly considered the predicate issue of whether a settlement agreement deemed by the parties to be a verdict and judgment in the plaintiffs favor for purposes of \u00a7 52-192a could invoke the court\u2019s authority under that statute prior to addressing the parties\u2019 dependent claim as to whether the policy limit barred offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>Bania </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>138 Conn. 172, 175, 83 A.2d 165 (1951) (\u201cin an action for a declaratory judgment we are not limited by the issues joined or by the claims of counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Accordingly, we turn to the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision, which turns on the proper construction of \u00a7 52-192a. Well settled rules guide our inquiry. \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Veri-diem, Inc., </em>291 Conn. 537, 547, 970 A.2d 630 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 2005) \u00a7 52-192a (b) provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cAfter trial </em>the court shall examine the record to determine whether the plaintiff made an \u2018offer of judgment\u2019 which the defendant failed to accept. If the court ascertains from the record that the plaintiff has recovered an amount equal to or greater than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>sum certain specified in the plaintiffs \u2018offer of judgment\u2019, the court shall add to the amount so recovered twelve per cent annual interest on said amount . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As this language makes clear, the trial court is authorized to award offer of judgment interest only after a trial. A settlement clearly is not a trial. Indeed, \u201c[w]hen parties agree to settle a case, they are effectively contracting for the right to <em>avoid </em>a trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Audubon Parking Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Barclay &amp; Stubbs, </em>225 Conn. 804, 812, 626 A.2d 729 (1993). A settlement bears none of \u201cthe distinctive hallmarks of a trial.\u201d <em>Nunno </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>257 Conn. 671, 679, 778 A.2d 145 (2001); see id., 678-82 (concluding that award rendered pursuant to court mandated arbitration proceeding does not constitute trial within meaning of \u00a7 52-192a and explaining substantive and procedural distinctions between proceedings). A trial and a settlement achieve different purposes and have different legal consequences. See <em>Black </em>v. <em>Goodwin, Loomis &amp; Britton, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 144, 168, 681 A.2d 293 (1996) (\u201c[w]hen an award is made pursuant to a settlement . . . the underlying issues have not been fully and fairly litigated, and, therefore, the earlier award can have no preclusive effect on a subsequent action\u201d); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, 83 </em>Conn. App. 599, 613, 851 A.2d 320 (\u201c[a]n issue that has been resolved by virtue of a settlement agreement has not actually been litigated\u201d), cert, denied, 271 Conn. 909, 859 A.2d 561 (2004); see also <em>Janus Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>801 F.2d 578, 582 (2d Cir. 1986) (\u201c[i]n determining the details of relief [pursuant to a settlement agreement], the judge may not award whatever relief would have been appropriate after an adjudication on the merits, but only those precise forms of relief that are either agreed to by the parties ... or fairly implied by their agreement\u201d [citations omitted]). Indeed, as in the present case, in a settlement, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>dant may deny or refuse to concede the factual predicate for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Although we have no doubt that the parties were acting in good faith to resolve the matter expeditiously and properly, just as \u201cputting a contract tag on a tort claim will not change its essential character\u201d; <em>Gazo </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>255 Conn. 245, 263, 765 A.2d 505 (2001); calling a settlement a verdict after trial does not make it so. See also id. (\u201c[p]utting a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim will no more change its essential character than calling a bull a cow will change its gender\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Therefore, the legislative grant of authority to the courts in \u00a7 52-192a to award offer of judgment interest \u201c[a]fter trial\u201d reasonably cannot be construed to mean \u201cafter a settlement,\u201d even if the parties agree to treat the settlement as a verdict and judgment in the plaintiffs favor. The plaintiff in the present case sought an order from the court requiring ProMutuai to pay offer of judgment interest. Although the parties could have agreed as part of their <em>settlement </em>to the payment or nonpayment of offer of judgment interest, they have provided no case law, and we are aware of none, that holds that a court may award relief conferred solely by statute under terms that are inconsistent with those under which the legislature conferred such authority. See <em>Tele Tech of Connecticut Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>270 Conn. 778, 790, 855 A.2d 174 (2004) (\u201cauthority to act refers to the way in which that power [to hear and to determine the controversy] must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We are mindful that the stated purpose of the parties\u2019 settlement is consistent with the purpose of the offer of judgment statute, which is \u201cto encourage pretrial settlements and, consequently, to conserve judicial resources.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stiffler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>288 Conn. 38, 43, 950 A.2d 1270 (2008). The statute also, however, is intended to provide an incentive to accept a reasonable offer of judgment within thirty days after the offer is made. In the present case, the defendants continued to litigate this issue for nineteen months after the offer of judgment was made for the same amount agreed to upon settlement, the policy limit. Nonetheless, even if the position advanced by the parties was entirely consistent with the policy underlying the statute, \u201c[w]here there is no ambiguity in the legislative commandment, this court cannot, in the interest of public policy, engraft amendments onto the statutory language.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>184 Conn. 317, 325, 439 A.2d 1008 (1981); accord <em>Hotarek </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>211 Conn. 121, 129, 557 A.2d 1259 (1989) (\u201c[t]he statutes cannot be changed by the court to make them conform to the court\u2019s conception of right and justice in a particular case\u201d); <em>Local 218 Steamfitters Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Cobra Pipe Supply &amp; Coil Co., </em>207 Conn. 639, 645, 541 A.2d 869 (1988) (\u201cWe are bound to interpret legislative intent by referring to what the legislative text contains, not by what it might have contained. . . . Nor can we engraft language not clearly intended by its enactment onto legislation.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). If the legislature concludes that it is consistent with the purpose of the offer of judgment statute to allow parties to stipulate to treating their settlement as a judgment in the plaintiffs favor for purposes of that statute, it has the sole authority to add such language to the statute. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 216, 901 A.2d 673 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The parties also claim that the trial court improperly concluded that a decision on the issue presented as to the effect of the policy limit would be an improper advisory opinion. Our analysis in part I of this opinion demonstrates that the court properly declined to address the question as framed in the declaratory judgment count, not because to do so would have been to render an advisory opinion, but because a necessary predicate to reaching the issue raised had not been met. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345, 377, 952 A.2d 784 (2008) (concluding that, because defendant did not establish necessary predicate to application of particular test, trial court properly declined to apply test); <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 587, 626 A.2d 259 (1993) (concluding that, because plaintiffs\u2019 site plan application did not comply with zoning statutes\u2019 requirements, which was necessary predicate to claimed entitlement to writ of mandamus, court need not consider whether defendants had mandatory duty under statutes that warranted extraordinary remedy of mandamus relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The issue as framed by ProMutual in its motion for articulation, however, called on the trial court to render an advisory opinion. For purposes of raising an alternate ground for affirmance, ProMutual sought a broad declaration as to whether \u201cinsurance companies and policyholders [are] free to enter into liability insurance contracts that limit the amount the insurer must pay as damages on behalf of the policyholder, including any prejudgment interest that may be assessed against the policyholder . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of the trial court\u2019s deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>mination that prejudgment interest could not be awarded under \u00a7 52-192a under the facts of the present case, the answer to such a question could not have determined any rights or obligations of the parties. Thus, as framed, ProMutual impermissibly \u201csought a declaratory judgment, not to settle a present controversy, but rather to avoid one in the future.\u201d <em>Milford Power Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Alstom Power, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 616, 629, 822 A.2d 196 (2003). Indeed, at oral argument before this court, ProMutual acknowledged that it actually was seeking a \u201cblack letter\u201d ruling, applicable to all insurance companies and policyholders. Such a determination, however, is too abstract to be determined properly by a court. See <em>Milford Power Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Alstom Power, Inc., </em>supra, 625-26 (\u201cdeclaratory judgment procedure may not be utilized merely to secure advice on the law ... or to establish abstract principles of law [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]\u201d); see also <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 654, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990) (\u201c[l]aw suits are not determined by a consideration of philosophy in the abstract, but by the application of legal principles to the facts of a particular case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Numerous considerations might bear on such an issue, none of which are evident in this record and none of which necessarily would be uniform in every case, such as, for example, whether, for a greater premium, the policyholder had the ability to purchase a policy that would not bar such interest, whether the policyholder precluded the insurer from accepting the offer of judgment or whether the insurer acted in bad faith in declining to accept an offer of judgment. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly declined to grant the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment on the ground that the predicates for an award of offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In this opinion ROGERS, C.

The majority reaches this erroneous conclusion because it confuses the authority of a trial court generally to order an award of such interest under \u00a7 52-192a, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>on the one hand, and the authority of the court <em>in the present case to render a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 52-29 (a), </em>on the basis of the facts and representations contained in the parties\u2019 stipulation. In my view, it is clear that, under well established precedent governing requests for declaratory judgments, the trial court was required, first, to accept the parties\u2019 factual stipulation and, second, to render a decision in accordance with that stipulation on the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment. As a general matter, only if a dispute is nonjusticiable is a court permitted to decline to render a decision. The majority\u2019s contrary conclusion ignores the fact that, in the present case, the plaintiff is not seeking to have the court invoke its authority under \u00a7 52-192a to make an award of offer of judgment interest; rather, the plaintiff is asking the court to enforce the terms of the parties\u2019 stipulation, which <em>itself </em>authorizes the award of such interest if, as the plaintiff claims, ProMutual lawfully cannot shield itself contractually from paying that interest. Unfortunately, the failure of the trial court and the majority to address the issue posed by the parties deprives the plaintiff of his right to a judicial resolution of his claim that ProMutual is obligated to pay him $293,000 in offer of judgment interest under the parties\u2019 stipulation. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The facts, which are set forth in the majority opinion, are undisputed and straightforward, and need not be repeated in detail here. It is sufficient merely to underscore that the plaintiff filed an offer of judgment in the amount of $1 million, and approximately nineteen months later,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiff settled his malpractice claim against Skolnick for the $1 million limit of the ProMu-tual insurance policy. The plaintiff, however, did not wish to give up his claim against ProMutual for offer of judgment interest in the amount of $293,000. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the issue of whether ProMutual would have been liable for such interest if the case had been tried to conclusion remained in dispute between the parties. For the purpose of providing a vehicle for the resolution of that dispute, the plaintiff, without objection from ProMu-tual, amended his complaint to include a count seeking a judgment declaring that ProMutual was liable for such interest, over and above the policy limits, despite language in the policy to the contrary. To facilitate the court\u2019s resolution of the plaintiffs claim, the parties jointly agreed, by way of a stipulation, to treat the case as if it had proceeded to trial, with the plaintiff receiving an award of at least $1 million. Finally, the parties agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s decision as to whether ProMutual was liable for interest in accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Despite the parties\u2019 joint request for a judicial resolution of their dispute, the trial court declined to decide the issue raised by the plaintiffs request for declaratory relief. Specifically, the court stated that, \u201c[a]s clearly stated in [\u00a7 52-192a (c)], the awarding of [offer of judgment] interest only occurs \u2018after trial\u2019 .... No trial occurred in this case. Therefore, the court may not award interest per statute.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The court thereafter rendered judgment for ProMutual on the plaintiffs claim for declaratoiy relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>In a joint motion to reargue, the parties explained that they \u201csimply [were] asking the court to decide an issue of law based [on] agreement that all conditions for operation of the prejudgment remedy statute have . . . been met, including that there was a verdict [after trial] exceeding the <em>offer of </em>judgment amount.\u201d The parties further maintained that the court\u2019s refusal to decide the issue would frustrate the parties\u2019 settlement agreement and thwart the remedial purpose of the declaratory judgment statute because a decision on the question would have resolved \u201ca bona fide and substantial issue in dispute between [them]\u201d and rendered a trial on the merits of the plaintiffs malpractice claim unnecessary. It was the parties\u2019 contention that, by settling the plaintiffs malpractice claim against Skolnick, the parties had sought to conserve not only their own resources but also those of the court. If the case had proceeded to trial, they maintained, the plaintiff likely would have obtained a judgment that exceeded the policy limits, and the issue of whether ProMutual was responsible for the payment of the offer of judgment interest, to which the plaintiff was statutorily entitled, necessarily would have been litigated at that time. The trial court granted the parties\u2019 motion for reargument but denied the relief sought therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">As the majority has explained, on appeal to this court, the parties claim that, in light of their stipulation, \u201cthe <em>only </em>issue properly before the [trial] court was whether ProMutual is obligated to pay offer of judgment interest when that interest, coupled with the $1 million settlement, would exceed the policy limit on damages. . . . In support of . . . [this contention], ProMutual specifically contends that the trial court mistakenly treated the claim as one for an award of interest under \u00a7 52-192a, rather than a claim for a declaratory judgment under [\u00a7 52-29 (a)] regarding apolicy coverage dispute.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The majority rejects the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>claim, concluding that the trial court properly declined to render a decision on the issue raised in connection with the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment. Although the majority acknowledges that the trial court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs request, the majority concludes that the court was not bound by the parties\u2019 agreement to treat the case as if it had proceeded to trial. The majority further concludes that, because the case had not been tried, and because \u00a7 52-192a applies only to cases that result in a trial, the court properly determined that it lacked authority to award offer of interest judgment under \u00a7 52-192a.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I fully agree with the majority that the trial court had jurisdiction to render a decision on the declaratory judgment count of the plaintiffs complaint. I disagree with the majority, however, that the trial court properly declined to do so because it lacked authority under \u00a7 52-192a to award offer of judgment interest. The majority reaches the wrong conclusion because it views the issue raised by this appeal through the wrong lens; instead of determining whether, in light of the parties\u2019 stipulation, the trial court has the authority <em>under \u00a7 52-29 (a) </em>to render a declaratory judgment resolving the parties\u2019 dispute, the majority treats the issue as implicating the court\u2019s authority to award offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a. Even if it is assumed that the majority is correct in concluding that \u00a7 52-192a applies only after a trial has occurred, there simply is no justification for the trial court to have rejected the stipulation filed by the parties for the purpose of obtaining a judgment declaring their rights in accordance with \u00a7 52-29 (a). Because the parties agreed both to treat the case as if it had proceeded to trial and to be bound by the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issue raised by the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment, the court clearly has the authority to answer the question reserved to it and, if the court agrees with the plaintiffs claim, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>render a decision <em>in accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation </em>that ProMutua! is obligated to pay offer of judgment interest to the plaintiff. In other words, although the trial court in the present case would have lacked the authority to award offer of judgment interest <em>solely on the basis of \u00a7 </em>52-192a\u2014this is so because no trial actually took place, and the court\u2019s authority to make an award under \u00a7 52-192a is limited to cases in which a trial has occurred\u2014the decision that the plaintiff seeks is not predicated on \u00a7 52-192a but, rather, on the parties\u2019 stipulation. Because the trial court had the authority to render a decision on the plaintiff\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment on the basis of the parties\u2019 stipulation, the trial court properly could not refuse to consider the plaintiff\u2019s declaratory relief claim for lack of such authority. As I explain hereinafter, only if the issue presented were nonjusticiable would the court have been free to decline to resolve the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. That is not the case here, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\u201cThe principles that underlie justiciability are well established. Justiciability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nielsen </em>v. State, 236 Conn. 1, 6-7, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996). \u201cIn deciding whether the plaintiff\u2019s complaint presents a justiciable claim, we make no determination regarding its merits. Rather, we consider only whether the matter in controversy [is] capable of being adjudicated by judicial power according to the aforestated well established principles.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Milford Power Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Alstom Power, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 616, 626, 822 A.2d 196 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The plaintiff sought to invoke the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over his claim for declaratory relief \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 52-29, which, as we have recognized, provides a valuable tool by which litigants may resolve uncertainty of legal obligations. . . . The [declaratory judgment] procedure has the distinct advantage of affording to the court in granting any relief consequential to its determination of rights the opportunity of tailoring that relief to the particular circumstances. ... A declaratory judgment action is not, however, a procedural panacea for use on all occasions, but, rather, is limited to solving justiciable controversies. . . . Invoking \u00a7 52-29 does not create jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>224 Conn. 110, 116, 617 A.2d 433 (1992) (Implicit in [\u00a7 52-29 and Practice Book \u00a7 17-54] is the notion that a declaratory judgment must rest on some cause of action that would be cognizable in a nondeclaratory suit. ...

Finally, the determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tion of the controversy must be capable of resulting in practical relief to the complainant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Milford Power Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Alstom Power, Inc., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 625-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Applying these principles to the present case, I conclude that the declaratory judgment count of the plaintiffs complaint meets all of the criteria of the justiciability doctrine. First, the parties\u2019 interests were adverse. Second, an actual bona fide and substantial question over the effect of \u00a7 52-192a on ProMutual\u2019s obligations under the insurance policy prohibited the parties from reaching a final settlement of the plaintiffs claims against Skolnick. Third, a determination of the controversy in the plaintiffs favor would afford him practical relief because it would entitle him to an additional $293,000 above and beyond the $1 million that he already was entitled to receive under the terms of the settlement agreement. Moreover, the fact that the parties have entered into a partial settlement does not render the case nonjusticiable. Indeed, in that respect, this case is identical to <em>Connecticut Medical Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulikowski, </em>286 Conn. 1, 942 A.2d 334 (2008), a declaratory judgment action in which this court recently was required to determine, after a partial settlement had been reached between the parties, the extent of coverage under a medical malpractice insurance policy. Id., 3\u20144 and n.3; see also, e.g., <em>Guin </em>v. <em>Ha, </em>591 P.2d 1281, 1282-83 (Alaska 1979) (plaintiff in medical malpractice action settled all claims against defendant physician, expressly reserving issue of insurer\u2019s liability for prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits, and, thereafter, parties filed stipulation reciting terms of settlement and request for declaration by court as to whether insurer was liable for prejudgment interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Indeed, the majority acknowledges that the question reserved to the trial court is a justiciable one. As I have indicated, however, the majority asserts that \u201cthe trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>court properly considered the predicate issue of whether a settlement agreement deemed by the parties to be a verdict and judgment in the plaintiffs favor for purposes of \u00a7 52-192a could invoke the court\u2019s authority under that statute prior to addressing the parties\u2019 dependent claim as to whether the policy limit barred offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a.\u201d The majority further concludes that \u201cthe parties\u2019 stipulations did not satisfy the necessary predicate to an award of offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a, namely, a judgment in the plaintiffs favor after a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The majority cites to no authority, and I have found none, in which a court assumed jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action, declined to answer the question presented therein, and then rendered judgment in favor of one of the parties on a claim that no party had raised. The majority argues, however, that the trial court in the present case properly did just that because a predicate event to an award of interest under \u00a7 52-192a, namely, a trial, had not occurred. Not one of the cases that the majority cites, however, supports the proposition that parties may not stipulate to facts\u2014 even essential predicate facts underlying a claimed entitlement\u2014in the context of a <em>declaratory judgment action. </em>Indeed, not one of the cases on which the majority relies involves a claim for declaratory relief. The first such case, <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Allan S. Goodman, Inc., </em>286 Conn. 390, 403-404, 944 A.2d 925 (2008), simply stands for the proposition that, on appeal, parties may not bind the court with respect to the applicable <em>law. </em>The remaining cases that the majority cites also provide no support for its conclusion; they merely articulate the general rule that courts often must decide predicate <em>legal issues </em>before reaching the ultimate issue in a case. See <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>291 Conn. 307,319-20 n. 15, 968A.2d396 (2009); <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 33, 792 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>835 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>245 Conn. 209, 214-15, 715 A.2d 680 (1998), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 274 Conn. 727, 878 A.2d 1118 (2005). None of these cases, however, supports the conclusion that parties may be barred from stipulating to predicate <em>facts </em>in a declaratory judgment action. Thus, none of the foregoing cases supports the majority\u2019s determination that, because a trial court is not authorized to award offer of judgment interest in the absence of a trial, the trial court in the present case lacked the authority <em>under \u00a7 52-29 (a) to </em>determine the effect of \u00a7 52-192a on the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations under Skolnick\u2019s malpractice insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In fact, the only declaratory judgment case that is even mentioned in the majority opinion, namely, <em>Bania </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>138 Conn. 172, 83 A.2d 165 (1951), manifestly does not support the proposition that parties may be prohibited from presenting their case to the court via a stipulation of facts. To the contrary, <em>Bania </em>itself, like most declaratory judgment actions, was submitted to the trial court upon a stipulation of facts. Id., 173. The majority, however, takes language from <em>Bania </em>out of context and then uses that language to support its conclusion that the trial court in the present case properly declined to answer the question presented to it. Specifically, the majority cites <em>Bania </em>for the principle that, \u201cin an action for a declaratory judgment we are not limited by the issues joined or by the claims of counsel.\u201d Id., 175. In <em>Bania, </em>however, this court relied on the foregoing principle as a basis for <em>deciding </em>the issue on which the plaintiff in that case had requested a declaratory judgment, even though certain predicate facts necessary to support the plaintiffs claim were not apparent in the record. See id., 175-76. Specifically, the court stated: \u201cWhile the questions presented to the trial court under the plaintiffs claim for a declaratory judgment lack the clarity . . . which is desirable [when] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>such a judgment is sought, they suffice to warrant our passing [on] the fundamental and controlling inquiry . . . .\u201d Id. We reached this determination in <em>Bania </em>because, as we further explained, \u201c[a]n action for a declaratory judgment is a special statutoiy proceeding . . . implemented by the rules [of practice] .... The relief thus afforded <em>is highly remedial and the statute and rules should be accorded a liberal construction to carry out the purpose underlying such judgments. . . . </em>The object of the action is to secure an adjudication of rights which are uncertain or in dispute. . . . The complaint must allege such uncertainty or dispute and set forth the facts necessary for the determination of the question. It must also contain facts sufficient to show that the question is not moot and that the plaintiff is a proper party. However, in an action for a declaratory judgment we are not limited by the issues joined or by the claims of counsel. . . . Under [the rules of practice], a prerequisite to resort to the action is that there must be an issue in dispute or an uncertainty of legal relations which requires settlement between the parties. <em>This . . . means no more than that there must appear a sufficient practical need for the determination of the matter, and that need must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances involved in each case.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In the present case, the practical need for a determination of the question presented to the trial court stemmed from the parties\u2019 desire, on the eve of trial, to reach an equitable and fair settlement of the plaintiffs claims against Skolnick, which they were unable to accomplish completely because of a dispute over whether ProMutual would be obligated to pay the offer of judgment interest if the case proceeded to trial and, as the parties anticipated, the plaintiff obtained a verdict in excess of his offer of judgment. Thus, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>stipulated to the fact that, if the case had been tried to conclusion, the plaintiff would have received a damages award of at least $1 million, thereby entitling him to offer of judgment interest in the amount of $293,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Finally, I am aware of no reason why the parties were not entitled to treat the case as if it were one that had proceeded to trial by entering into a stipulation to that effect. Unless such an agreement operates as a fraud on the court, purports to create a controversy when none actually exists, violates public policy or otherwise is improper,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there simply was no basis for the court to reject the parties\u2019 agreement. Aside from the majority\u2019s reliance on the unexceptional proposition that a court is not bound to abide by the parties\u2019 agreement on the law\u2014a principle that also has no applicability to the present case\u2014the majority makes no attempt to explain why the court was entitled to refuse to decide the issue presented in accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation. As the majority itself has explained, the parties settled their case in good faith, seeking to save the court and themselves the inconvenience of a lengthy trial, and they agreed to the likely outcome of any such trial. Moreover, by signing the stipulation, ProMutual effectively waived any objection that it otherwise would have been entitled to raise, because the case was resolved in advance of trial, with respect to an award of offer of judgment interest. Finally, as the majority concedes, the fact that no trial actually occurred is not a jurisdictional impediment to a resolution of the plaintiffs claim for a declaratory judgment. Thus, \u00a7 52-192a manifestly did <em>not </em>bar the court from rendering a decision, pursuant to \u00a7 52-29 (a), in accordance with and predicated on the parties\u2019 stipulation, concerning the question posed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>by the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In sum, it is true that, ordinarily, when a plaintiff seeks offer of judgment interest under \u00a7 52-192a but no trial has occurred, the court lacks authority to award such interest because a condition precedent for that award has not been met. In the present case, however, the plaintiff filed an action for a declaratory judgment, and, for purposes of that action, the parties entered into a stipulation reflecting their agreement, first, to treat the case as one in which a trial had occurred and, second, to be bound by the court\u2019s decision concerning ProMu-tual\u2019s liability for offer of judgment interest. In such circumstances, the trial court clearly had the authority, under \u00a7 52-29 (a), to render a decision concerning Pro-Mutual\u2019s obligation to pay interest to the plaintiff because the plaintiffs declaratory judgment action, predicated as it is on the parties\u2019 stipulation, provides a perfectly proper vehicle for the court\u2019s resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the parties\u2019 dispute. Put differently, the court did not lack the authority to award offer of judgment interest to the plaintiff in light of the parties\u2019 stipulated agreement that the plaintiff <em>is, in fact, entitled to such interest </em>if the court concludes, upon consideration of the claims underlying the plaintiffs declaratory judgment action, that ProMutual is hable for that interest, over and above the $ 1 million policy limit, notwithstanding the policy language to the contrary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I would address and resolve the plaintiffs claim that he is entitled to recover $293,000 in offer of judgment interest from ProMutual. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> Richard Costantino\u2019s wife, Melissa Costantino, also was named as a plaintiff in the original complaint but no longer is a party to 1his action.

ProMutual . . . required to pay said offer of judgment interest where, as here, it exceeds the [$1 million] policy limits?\u201d In addition to seeking an answer to the foregoing reserved question, the plaintiff, in the declaratory judgment count of his complaint, sought certain relief to which he necessarily would be entitled in the event that the court ruled in his favor on that count. Specifically, the plaintiff sought \u201c[a] declaration that [ProMutual is] required to pay prejudgment interest above the policy limits of liability\u201d and \u201c[a]n order requiring [ProMutual] to pay said prejudgment interest in the amount agreed to by the parties following a ruling that [ProMutual is] required to pay prejudgment interest above the policy limits . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">None of these concerns is applicable in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b775-5\"> The majority insists, nevertheless, that it is not \u201cproper for parties to stipulate to facts that are false in order to bring their conduct within the ambit of a statute and in turn obtain a declaratory judgment that rests on those facts.\u201d Footnote 12 of the majority opinion. I do not agree. First,, the majority cites no authority for its proposition, and I have found none. Moreover, if, as in the present case, the parties\u2019 dispute is a justiciable one and there is nothing about the parties\u2019 factual stipulation that violates public policy, I see no basis for the court to avoid deciding the dispute merely because the parties have agreed to certain facts solely for the purpose of invoking a particular statutory provision. This is so because the legal requirements of justiciability have proven to be perfectly adequate to root out controversies that are not genuine or for which no practical relief can be afforded. When, therefore, the requirements of justiciability are met, as the majority concedes they have been in the present case, I can think of no reason for this court to decline to render a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Finally, even if the majority were correct that the trial court was not bound to accept the parties\u2019 factual stipulation, that does not also support the conclusion that the trial court <em>lacked the authority </em>to decide the issue presented by the plaintiffs claim for a declaratory judgment. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, at the most, the stipulation would provide a basis for the court to have <em>elected </em>not to render a decision on that claim, presumably for prudential reasons. As I have explained, however, there is nothing about the stipulation that is against public policy or that otherwise would provide a basis for the court\u2019s refusal to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\"> It is worth noting that the result that the majority and the trial court reach verges on the bizarre because, under the majority\u2019s holding, if the plaintiff, with the agreement of the defendants, had proceeded to an exceedingly brief, one witness trial at which all parties agreed to a $1 million judgment in favor of the plaintiff, then the parties would have been entitled to a resolution of the question that the trial court and the majority decline to address. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, there simply is no reason why the parties were required to engage in the pretense of a trial merely to resolve their dispute over the offer of judgment issue. Indeed, the majority suggests that the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment is defective because, in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, they \u201cconcede that they are asking the court to assume [a fact, namely, that a trial occurred] that the court knows not only [has] not happened, but that never can happen by virtue of their choice to enter into the settlement agreement.\u201d Footnote 12 of the majority opinion. I take issue with this assertion. There is nothing to prevent the parties from voiding their settlement agreement and proceeding to \u201ctrial\u201d\u2014an event that will take all of a few minutes\u2014following which, under the majority opinion, they then will be entitled to a resolution of the issue presented by this appeal. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, there is no reason why a trial cannot occur in the future. Requiring such a trial, however, results in a waste of time and resources because this court is fully authorized to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute in the context of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
