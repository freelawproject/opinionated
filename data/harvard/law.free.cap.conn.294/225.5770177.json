The defendant, the commissioner of revenue services, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the tax appeal of the plaintiff, Key Air, Inc., from the defendant\u2019s assessment of a sales and use tax against the plaintiff for the tax period from July 1,1997, through June 30, 2000. Because we conclude that the pilot training services in question are excluded from the definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>of taxable business management services pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii), we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff is a Connecticut corporation doing business at the Waterbury-Oxford Airport in Oxford. The plaintiff is a certificated air carrier that contracts with owners of various midsize cabin jet aircraft to operate, maintain and charter their aircraft<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for commercial operation under its air carrier certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (administration). Pursuant to its contracts with the aircraft owners, the plaintiff is required to provide pilots who are qualified with respect to all administration requirements to fly the relevant aircraft and, accordingly, the plaintiff purchases pilot training services, as prescribed by administration regulations; see generally 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 135 et seq.; from vendors located in various other states. The plaintiff pays those vendors for the cost of that training and, in turn, charges those fees back to the aircraft owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On November 21, 2002, the defendant conducted a sales and use tax audit of the plaintiffs business and concluded that, for the audit period from July 1, 1997, through June 30, 2000, the plaintiff had failed to pay sales and use taxes associated with its purchase of pilot training services from the out-of-state vendors. The plaintiff protested the imposition of a sales and use tax on these transactions to the defendant, which upheld the tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The plaintiff then appealed from the deficiency assessment to the Superior Court pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 12-422,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contending, inter alia, that \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) excluded pilot training services from the general definition of taxable services. After a trial to the court, the trial court concluded that the pilot training services were excluded from the definition of taxable business management services pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii), and thus were not taxable under the Sales and Use Taxes Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 12-406 et seq. Specifically, the court concluded that the operative phrase in the definition \u201cin connection with [a qualified] aircraft,\u201d as utilized in \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii), has a broad meaning that simply required a causal relationship between the services and the aircraft. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment sustaining the plaintiffs tax appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for reargument and reconsideration with the trial court, which subsequently denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>that motion. This appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs purchase of the pilot training services came within the scope of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii), by disregarding both the transactional nature of the sales and use tax and the well established principles of tax construction governing tax exemptions\u2014namely that exemptions are strictly construed against the party seeking the exemption. More specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly focused on the reimbursement transactions between the plaintiff and the aircraft owners as the basis for concluding that the pilot training services\u2014 provided by out-of-state vendors and used and consumed by the plaintiff\u2014were used \u201cin connection with\u201d qualifying aircraft pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). The defendant proposes that the trial court should have examined the transaction for the pilot training services between the vendors and the plaintiff independently of the reimbursement transactions between the plaintiff and the aircraft owners to discern whether the former services were used in connection with qualifying aircraft. Further, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly interpreted the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) to mean that there must be only a causal relationship between the pilot training services and the operation of the qualifying aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly concluded that the pilot training services at issue were rendered in connection with qualifying aircraft pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). The plaintiff claims that the court\u2019s construction of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of the statute was based on the statute\u2019s plain and unambiguous meaning and, therefore, that it is unnecessary to use a judicial presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>to construe the statute. The plaintiff also asserts, however, that even if this court concludes that such an ambiguity does, in fact, exist, the applicable presumption would be one in favor of the plaintiff as taxpayer, because \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) does not establish a tax exemption, but rather addresses the imposition of a tax and, thus, implicates an exclusion from the definition of a taxable service for purposes of the sales and use tax. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court properly determined that the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous and that the plaintiffs purchase of job related pilot training services is excluded from the definition of taxable business management services pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201c[A] sales and use tax appeal taken pursuant to \u00a7 12-422 is a trial de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rainforest Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue Services, </em>293 Conn. 363, 371, 977 A.2d 650 (2009). Consequently, \u201c[t]he scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Leonard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>264 Conn. 286, 294, 823 A.2d 1184 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s claim challenging the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii), which is an issue of first impression,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is a \u201c[question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rainforest Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Reve</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>nue Services, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 371-72. \u201cIn seeking to determine that meaning . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In addition to these principles, \u201cwe are also guided by the applicable rules of statutory construction specifically associated with the interpretation of tax statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Old Farms Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>279 Conn. 465, 481, 903 A.2d 152 (2006). In the present case, \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) addresses the imposition of a tax. \u201c[W]hen the issue is the imposition of a tax, rather than a claimed right to an exemption or a deduction, the governing authorities must be strictly construed against the commissioner [of revenue services] and in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In accordance with \u00a7 l-2z, we begin our analysis with the text of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). To provide a framework for this provision, we briefly survey its statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>context. Section 12-407 generally defines terms used within the act. Subdivision (2) of subsection (a) provides a list of enumerated actions that constitute \u201c \u2018[s]ale\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018selling\u2019 \u201d for purposes of the act, which includes \u201c[t]he rendering of certain services, as defined in subdivision (37) of this subsection, for a consideration, exclusive of such services rendered by an employee for the employer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (a) (2) (I). In turn, subdivision (37) defines over thirty categories of services that are taxable under the act. General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (A) through (FF). Specifically, \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii), the provision at issue in this appeal, provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Services\u2019 for purposes of subdivision (2) of this subsection, means . . . (J) [b]usiness analysis, management, management consulting and public relations services, <em>excluding . . </em>. (iii) . . . any business analysis, management, management consulting and public relations services when such services are rendered in connection with an aircraft leased or owned by a certificated air carrier or <em>in connection with </em>an aircraft which has a maximum certificated take-off weight of six thousand pounds or more . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">It is undisputed that the pilot training services in question are business management services under \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) and as defined by the defendant\u2019s regulations,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the size of the clients\u2019 aircraft comes within the ambit of that statute. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>contends, however, that the exclusion does not apply because the pilot training services were not \u201crendered in connection with\u201d qualifying aircraft but, rather, instead were used and consumed solely by the plaintiff, independently of the reimbursement transactions between the plaintiff and the aircraft owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In construing this statutory language, we must first consider the text of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) to discern whether the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is \u201cplain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rainforest Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 293 Conn. 372. Reviewing the act in its totality, we first note that the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined anywhere therein. See also footnote 7 of this opinion. \u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cIf a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rainforest Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The dictionary defines the word \u201cconnection\u201d as, inter alia, a \u201ccausal or logical relation or sequence . . . contextual relation or association . . . [or] relationship in fact . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Accordingly, the plain meaning of the statutory phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d necessarily includes <em>any </em>factual, contextual or causal relationship. Thus, with respect to the pilot training services at issue, the plain meaning of the words \u201cin connection with\u201d implies that, if the services have some cognizable relation or association with the statutorily identified air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>craft, those services are excluded from the definition of taxable business management services pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). Had the legislature intended there to be a narrower meaning of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d and, thus, a narrower exclusion of taxable business management services, it could have either: (1) used clarifying language to narrow the scope of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d; or (2) used language other than \u201cin connection with\u201d that has a more restrictive meaning. Moreover, in contrast to the first provision of clause (iii), which is limited to \u201caircraft leased or owned by a certificated air carrier,\u201d the second provision of clause (iii) provides for a broad exclusion for services \u201crendered in connection with an aircraft,\u201d as long as such aircraft weighs over 6000 pounds. General Statutes \u00a7 12-107 (a) (37) (J) (iii). A broad interpretation of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language is, thus, consistent with such an expansive provision. See <em>Stanley Works </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>122 Conn. 547, 555, 190 A. 743 (1937) (\u201cthe use of the broad words \u2018in connection with business\u2019 has significance, for had the narrower construction contended for by the [s]tate been intended, it would have been natural for the [legislature to use a phrase with a more restricted meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Our understanding of the plain meaning of the definition of \u201cconnection\u201d is consistent with this court\u2019s construction in tax cases of the meaning of the phrase \u201cin connection with . . . .\u201d For example, in <em>Stanley Works </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>supra, 122 Conn. 548-49, this court considered whether a corporation, having its principal place of business in Connecticut, but receiving dividends in three Canadian coiporations doing business solely in Canada, received such income \u201cin connection with business without the state\u201d for the purpose of allocating those dividends under the former \u00a7 420c of the Corporation Business Tax Act. Interpreting the language of the statute \u201cfrom the standpoint of substance and not of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>form\u201d; id., 554; this court concluded that such income had been received \u201cin connection with business without the state,\u201d as the Connecticut corporation had \u201cmade use of the activities of these subsidiary corporations as essential parts of its business . . . and that it did, in a very real and practical sense, employ these stocks as an instrumentality in carrying on its business . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 554-55. Similarly, in construing the now repealed federal cabaret tax statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> federal courts consistently have held that the phrase \u201cin connection with conveys its meaning plainly and does not connote that those things connected are in the relationship of primary and subsidiary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Birmingham </em>v. <em>Geer, </em>185 F.2d 82, 85 (8th Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 951, 71 S. Ct. 571, 95 L. Ed. 686 (1951); see also <em>Avalon Amusement Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>165 F.2d 653, 654 (7th Cir. 1948) (\u201c[w]e can see no justification for so torturing the plain meaning of the phrase \u2018in connection with\u2019\u2014it does not connote that those things connected are also in the relationship of primary and subsidiary\u201d). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the dictionary definition of \u201cconnection\u201d and the persuasive value of the broad construction given to the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d by this court and others in tax statute cases, we conclude that the \u201cin connection with\u201d language in \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) prescribes a factual, contextual or causal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The services provided in the present case were job related pilot training services given to the plaintiffs employee pilots by various out-of-state vendors, in order to keep those pilots qualified to perform their jobs as required by administration regulations. Compliance with these administration regulations was an integral part of the relationship between the plaintiff and its client aircraft owners, as evidenced by the language of the operating agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, without such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>training, the pilots would not have maintained the qualifications required by the administration and, in turn, would not have been able to operate the owners\u2019 aircraft, all of which were subject to statutory exclusion. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The pilot training services were, therefore, \u201cin a very real and practical sense, employ[ed] ... as an instrumentality in carrying on [the plaintiffs] business . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stanley Works </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>supra, 122 Conn. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Thus, the operating agreement, as well as the testimony of Newton Buckner, an accountant who performed services for the plaintiff, which explained the agreement\u2019s practical effect,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> demonstrate that the pilot training services were inextricably linked to the plaintiffs provision of qualified pilots for its clients\u2019 aircraft. Further testimonial evidence confirms this conclusion. David Brainard, the plaintiffs vice president and director of maintenance, testified that the pilot training services were job related training that the plaintiffs pilots were required to obtain in order to be authorized to fly the clients\u2019 aircraft. Brainard also emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>that each pilot\u2019s training was specific to the particular aircraft he was designated to fly, stating that the pilots \u201creceive[d] initial training in a specific type of aircraft and then periodic, recurrent training depending on their capacity,\u201d and that the training was \u201cspecific to the model aircraft that [they were] flying.\u201d Having credited this testimony, the trial court properly determined that the pilot training services were indeed \u201crendered in connection with\u201d the qualifying aircraft pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The defendant nonetheless contends that, because \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) provides for a tax exemption, it must be narrowly construed against the taxpayer. We disagree. The defendant fails to recognize that \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) does not involve the application of a tax exemption but, rather, the definition of what is taxable in the first instance. See <em>Plasticrete Block &amp; Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>216 Conn. 17, 26, 579 A.2d 20 (1990) (\u201c[t]his language is definitional in nature, and serves to determine whether certain charges are taxable, not whether certain charges that are ordinarily taxable should be exempt from taxation as amatter of legislative grace\u201d); <em>Hartford Hospital </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>160 Conn. 370, 374, 279 A.2d 561 (1971) (\u201cIt is to be noted that . . . the statute does not grant an exemption in the technical sense. Rather it merely states a rule of nontaxability. Consequently, it does not come within the rule that tax exemption statutes must be construed strictly against the taxpayer.\u201d). Section 12-407 (a) is definitional in nature and, specifically, subparagraph (J) of subdivision (37) defines, inter alia, taxable business management services for purposes of the act. Furthermore, clause (iii) of that provision clearly excludes from the definition of taxable services \u201cany business . . . management . . . services when such services are rendered in connection with an aircraft . . . which has a maximum certificated take-off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>weight of six thousand pounds or more . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). Thus, the statute creates an <em>exclusion </em>from the definition of taxable business management services, not an <em>exemption </em>from an otherwise taxable service. Accordingly, as we already have stated, \u201c[w]hen the issue is the imposition of a tax, rather than a claimed right to an exemption or a deduction, the governing authorities must be strictly construed against the commissioner [of revenue services] and in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Old Farms Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 481. Therefore, the judicial presumption weighs in favor of the plaintiff, not against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We agree with the plaintiff in this case, however, that we need not rely on any presumption because there is no ambiguity in the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). See <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>178 Conn. 81, 84, 420 A.2d 1160 (1979) (\u201cthis doctrine [of a presumption] applies only in case of a clear ambiguity in language which substantially leaves the statute equally open to different interpretations\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Curlis </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>93 Conn. 648, 657,107 A. 506 (1919) (same). In the present case there is no clear ambiguity associated with the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). Under these circumstances, we do not, therefore, need to apply a presumption in favor of the plaintiff. Accordingly, we conclude that the pilot training services at issue are excluded from the definition of taxable business management services pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Despite this evidence pointing to a contrary conclusion, the defendant further asserts that the transaction between the plaintiff and the vendors for the pilot training services was separate and distinct, and thus not \u201crendered in connection with\u201d the plaintiffs provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>of qualified pilots for its clients\u2019 statutorily identified aircraft. We disagree. The focus of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii) is not on who pays for the business management services but, rather, whether the purchase of those services was used \u201cin connection with\u201d the qualifying aircraft. In the defendant\u2019s regulations, it acknowledges that, \u201c[i]t is the <em>nature </em>of the services being rendered, and not what those services are called or termed by the service provider or service recipient, that determines whether services described in section 12-407 (2) (i) (J) of the general statutes are being rendered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (J)-1 (c) (1). Moreover, we are guided by the principle that \u201c[i]n tax law . . . substance rather than form determines tax consequences.\u201d <em>Cottage Savings Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>499 U.S. 554, 570, 111 S. Ct. 1503, 113 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1991) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), citing <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Court Holding Co., </em>324 U.S. 331, 334, 65 S.

Thereafter, the defendant moved for an articulation of the trial court\u2019s judgment, asking that court to clarify whether the sole basis for sustaining the plaintiffs appeal was its determination that the pilot training services came within the exclusion from sales and use taxes set forth in \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). In its articulation, the court stated that its decision to sustain the plaintiffs appeal was, in fact, based on its determination that the services in question came within the scope of \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii). The trial court added that its discussion, in its memorandum of decision, of whether the services were consumed, for purposes of the act, in either Connecticut or in the other states in which the training actually had occurred, was \u201c[n]ot central to the main issue\u201d of the exclusion from taxation of the services in question pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> Although, in its articulation, the trial court disavowed any reliance on the fact that the training services were rendered out of state; see footnote 5 of this opinion; the defendant also claims on appeal that the trial court improperly applied General Statutes \u00a7 12-411 in concluding that the pilot training services at issue were not subject to the use tax. We do not reach this claim, however, in light of our conclusion that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of pilot training services came within the scope of the exclusion contained in \u00a7 12-407 (a) (37) (J) (iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> We note that identical language is present in other definitions within \u00a7 12-407 (a).

Accordingly, with respect to whether the services at issue were subject to the sales and use tax, our analysis is limited to whether the services were rendered \u201cin connection with\u201d the qualifying aircraft.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\"> See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700 (e) (1) (1946) (defining \u201ccabaret\u201d as, in relevant part, \u201cany . . . hall . . . where music and dancing privileges ... are afforded the patrons <em>in connection with </em>the serving or selling of . . . refreshment\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> Outside of the tax context, courts consistently have construed the statutory phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d broadly.

Ct. 1454, 22 L. Ed. 2d 756 (1969), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the \u201cin connection with\u201d language in this context should be \u201cbroadly construed\u201d for the reason that \u201ca corporation\u2019s misleading material statement may injure an investor irrespective of whether the corporation itself, or those individuals managing it, are contemporaneously buying or selling the stock of the corporation.\u201d See also, e.g., <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Miramon, </em>614 F.2d 1372, 1378 n.11 (5th Cir. 1980) (\u201c[t]he plaintiff in [an action predicated upon fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of a security] need not establish a direct or close relationship between the fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>transaction and the purchase or sale, but only that the transaction involving the sale <em>\u2018touch \u2019 </em>the transaction involving the defendant\u2019s fraud\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gruenberg, </em>989 F.2d 971, 976 (8th Cir. 1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Additionally, <em>courts </em>have broadly construed the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in the context of private contracts.

In the event that a pilot is unable to perform pilot duties for a requested flight, [the] [ojperator shall supply other qualified flight personnel acceptable to [the] [c]ompany within a reasonable period of time.\u201d Pertinent to the administration required pilot training services in question, the operating agreement further provides that \u201c[a]ll pilots will be qualified with respect to all [administration] regulations and [the] [ojwner\u2019s and [the] [cjompany\u2019s insurance requirements and will be available for all requested flights when the [a]ircraft is in an airworthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>status.
