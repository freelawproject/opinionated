App. 336, 337, 913 A.2d 483 (2007). We agree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cFollowing the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiff . . . submitted a claim for dependent widow\u2019s benefits pursuant to ... \u00a7 31-306. . . . The decedent was employed by the [named] defendant [Dan Perkins Chevrolet Geo, Inc.]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and sustained a compensable injury to his cervical spine when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident on June 26,1997. As a result of the injury, the decedent experienced radiculopathy into his left side and [left arm]. He underwent [surgery, after which he] continued to experience [pain in his neck and the left side of his body, as well as numbness and tingling in] his left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u201cPrior to his death on January 12, 2002, the decedent had suffered from injuries and illnesses that were unrelated to his compensable injury. He had chronic bilateral shoulder and low back pain that [was] the result of a bicycle accident [that] he had in 1974. Since before 1982, the decedent had been treated for a chronic hepatitis C infection, a result of his intravenous drug use. The decedent was diagnosed with adult onset diabetes in 1995. In 1994 or 1995, he was diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol. The decedent\u2019s diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol [all of which are risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease] were controlled by medication. On December 1, 2001, the decedent was hospitalized with complaints of dizziness, [excessive perspiration] and pain. The symptoms were caused by the effect [that] Interferon, a medicine he took [for his] hepatitis C infection, had on his blood sugar level.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u201cOn the evening of January 11, 2002, the plaintiff observed that the decedent was mumbling and incoher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ent. [The decedent] complained that he had severe lower back pain, [that] his stomach was bothering him, and [that] he was constipated. At midnight [on January 12, 2002], the decedent struggled successfully to have a bowel movement, after which he said that he felt better. The plaintiff last saw the decedent [alive] at 2 a.m. on January 12, 2002. Because the plaintiff and the decedent slept in separate rooms, the plaintiff was unaware of the decedent\u2019s activities between 2 and 8 a.m. when she discovered his body. Members of the Milford police department responded to the plaintiffs call for assistance. . . . [T]he decedent was declared dead at 8:50 a.m. on January 12, 2002, and . . . [his] body was not examined by the medical examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u201cCosmo Filiberto, a board certified family practitioner and expert in preventive medicine and care, prepared the decedent\u2019s death certificate. Filiberto stated that the cause of death was heart disease, secondary to atherosclerotic heart disease. Filiberto had treated the decedent for twenty years and had seen him days before his death but did not examine his body postmortem. No autopsy was performed on the decedent\u2019s body. The record is silent as to why no postmortem examination or autopsy was done. Filiberto opined at the hearing before the commissioner that the decedent\u2019s death was brought about by the curtailment of his physical activities. His weight sometimes exceeded 300 pounds. [In Filiberto\u2019s view, the decedent\u2019s] weight gain and resulting inactivity, along with the heavy doses of narcotics [that] he was required to take to control his pain, made it \u2018medically probable and certain that the stress\u2019 of [his] compensable injury and its treatment substantially contributed to his death . . . because they severely limited his ability to maintain his physical fitness and aerobic conditioning. Prior to [sustaining] the . . . compensable injury, [the decedent] was able to control his pain [from] prior accidents with over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the-counter medication and muscle relaxants. Relief from the pain of the decedent\u2019s 1997 accident, however, required high doses of narcotics, eventually reaching 3200 milligrams [each] day.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u201cJonathan Alexander, a cardiologist at Danbury Hospital and clinical faculty member of Yale University School of Medicine, testified for the defendant. Alexander based his opinion and report on a review of the decedent\u2019s medical records, including Filiberto\u2019s records. Alexander found no evidence of atheroscle-rotic heart disease in the decedent\u2019s medical records. Alexander concluded, therefore, that neither the treatment the decedent received as a result of his cervical injury nor his inactivity nor his weight gain [was a factor] in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cThe commissioner was not persuaded by Alexander\u2019s opinions. [The commissioner] found, on the basis of Filiberto\u2019s twenty year[s] [of] treatment of the decedent and familiarity with [the decedent\u2019s] ongoing medical conditionfs], that there was a relationship between the compensable injury and the decedent\u2019s death. He concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-306. The defendant thereafter filed a motion to correct the findings and award, which the commissioner denied .... The defendant [thereafter] appealed to the board.\u201d Id., 338-40. \u201cThe board concluded that the commissioner\u2019s award was not contrary to law, without evidence or based on unreasonable or impermissible inferences. The board, therefore, affirmed the commissioner\u2019s award. The defendant appealed.\u201d Id., 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the board improperly had affirmed the commissioner\u2019s findings for two interrelated reasons, namely, that those \u201cfindings were predicated on expert medical testimony grounded in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>jecture, speculation or surmise,\u201d and that \u201cthe expert medical testimony was not supported by the subordinate facts . . . .\u201d Id., 338. The Appellate Court agreed with both of the defendant\u2019s contentions. Id. In doing so, the Appellate Court first observed that the commissioner, in concluding that the plaintiff was entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits, had credited the testimony of Filiberto, the decedent\u2019s personal physician. Id., 343. The Appellate Court stated: \u201cWe accept the commissioner\u2019s credibility determination for purposes of our analysis, but the testimony of even the most persuasive expert witness cannot be credited if it is not based on facts. The determinative question, therefore, is not whether Filiberto was credible but whether there are sufficient subordinate facts in the record to support his opinion that the decedent\u2019s death was causally related to his compensable injury.\u201d Id., 343-44. The Appellate Court then concluded that the record was devoid of such facts, explaining: \u201cFiliberto testified before the commissioner on May 5, 2004, and a copy of his deposition testimony was placed into evidence. Our review of the transcripts reveals that the decedent was morbidly obese in 1982 and that he gained twenty to thirty pounds after the 1997 accident and thirty to thirty-five more pounds after his [surgery]. Due to the decedent\u2019s weight and the drugs [that the decedent] took to control his pain, Filiberto opined that the decedent was unable to exercise and that he would have lived longer had he exercised. According to Filiberto, the decedent died of a heart attack caused by atherosclerotic disease, although he never ordered tests to determine whether the decedent, in fact, had atherosclerotic heart disease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Filiberto also opined that Oxycontin, which the decedent was taking for pain, can cause constipation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>According to Filiberto, straining to have a bowel movement can cause changes in the body\u2019s system that can produce cardiac arrest. [Filiberto testified, however, that he could not state to a reasonable medical probability that the decedent\u2019s constipation was connected to his work-related injury or to his death.]</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u201cFiliberto also testified that he did not examine the decedent\u2019s body [postmortem] . . . and that no autopsy had been performed. Filiberto did not know whether the decedent had a congenital heart defect that could have caused a heart attack and acknowledged that a ruptured aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, stroke or sudden arrhythmia can cause sudden death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He conceded that, without an autopsy, there [was] no way [of] know[ing] the exact cause of the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u201cOn cross-examination before the commissioner, the defendant\u2019s counsel presented Filiberto with a copy of the . . . records [from the decedent\u2019s admission to Milford Hospital on December 1, 2001], which he previously had not seen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6[Those records indicated that a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>gastroenterologist [had been] treating the decedent\u2019s chronic hepatitis C infection, and Filiberto [testified that he] was unaware that the decedent had [started] taking Interferon [before his admission to the hospital]. Filiberto conceded that the symptoms [that] the decedent complained of on January 11, 2002, [the evening before his death] could have resulted from taking Interferon. . . . The reality is that it was not possible to determine with any reasonable degree of probability the cause of the decedent\u2019s death given the factual gaps in the record. [The Appellate Court concluded] [o]n the basis of [its] examination of Filiberto\u2019s testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>opinion . . . that there were insufficient subordinate facts to support his opinion that the decedent\u2019s death was causally related to the compensable injury or to remove the cause of death from the realm of conjecture.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) Id., 344-46.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201c[Filiberto]: If he had gotten it close to that time frame.

The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . Neither the . . . board nor this court has the power to retry facts.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Scherwitzky Gutter Co., </em>279 Conn. 265, 272, 901 A.2d 1176 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">To recover under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), an employee must meet the two part test embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 31-275,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> namely, that the injury claimed arose out of the employee\u2019s employment and occurred in the course of the employment. E.g., <em>Blakeslee </em>v. <em>Platt Bros. &amp; Co., </em>279 Conn. 239, 243-44, 902 A.2d 620 (2006). \u201c[I]n Connecticut traditional concepts of proximate cause constitute the rule for determining . . . causation [in workers\u2019 compensation cases].\u201d <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>204 Conn. 104, 118, 527 A.2d 664 (1987); accord <em>Solonick </em>v. <em>Electric Boat Corp., </em>111 Conn.

Further, it is the plaintiff who bears the burden to prove an unbroken sequence of events that tied his injuries to the [defendant\u2019s conduct]. . . . The existence of the proximate cause of an injury is determined by looking from the injury to the negligent act complained of for the necessary causal connection. . . . This causal connection must be based [on] more than conjecture and surmise. ... An actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm is a proximate cause of that harm. . . . The finding of actual cause is thus a requisite for any finding of proximate cause.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Posades, </em>281 Conn. 50, 56-57, 913 A.2d 407 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">When, as in the present case, it is unclear whether an employee\u2019s death is causally related to a compensable iiyuiy, it is necessary to rely on expert medical opinion. See, e.g., <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Skinner Precision Industries, Inc., </em>162 Conn. 142, 152, 291 A.2d 743 (1972). \u201cUnless the medical testimony by itself establishes a causal relation, or unless it establishes a causal relation when it is considered along with other evidence,\u201d the commissioner cannot reasonably conclude that the death is causally related to the employee\u2019s employment. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cExpert opinions must be based [on] reasonable probabilities rather than mere speculation or conjecture if they are to be admissible in establishing causation. ... To be reasonably probable, a conclusion must be more likely than not. . . . Whether an expert\u2019s testimony is expressed in terms of a reasonable probability that an event has occurred does not depend [on] the semantics of the expert or his use of any particular term or phrase, but rather, is determined by looking at the entire substance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>expert\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, 205 </em>Conn. 542, 554-55, 534 A.2d 888 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Finally, although \u201can award must stand unless it results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them . . . there must be subordinate facts from which the conclusion that there is a causal connection between the employment and the injury can be drawn. . . . [Thus] [t]he right of a claimant to compensation must be based [on] more than speculation and conjecture.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>D\u2019Angelo </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>146 Conn. 505, 508, 152 A.2d 636 (1959); see also <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>166 Conn. 418, 426, 352 A.2d 773 (1974) (\u201cthe jury must reject the opinion of an expert to the extent that it is based on subordinate facts which [the jury does] not find proven\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Fur-man </em>v. <em>National Dairy Products Corp., </em>123 Conn. 327, 329,195 A. 182 (1937) (\u201cthe finding of the commissioner cannot be sustained unless supported by the subordinate facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that there were insufficient subordinate facts in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s finding, predicated on Filiberto\u2019s expert testimony, that the decedent\u2019s death was causally related to his back injury because the back injury severely limited his ability to exercise, which, in turn, caused him to suffer a fatal heart attack. The plaintiff contends that, although the decedent never had been formally diagnosed with atherosclerotic heart disease, Fili-berto\u2019s opinion that he died from the disease was adequately supported by circumstantial evidence, namely, that the decedent suffered from many of the risk factors for the disease, including hypertension, diabetes and morbid obesity. The plaintiff maintains, therefore, that, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, it is of no moment that the decedent never was formally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>diagnosed with atherosclerotic heart disease, that no one witnessed his death and that no autopsy was performed. According to the plaintiff, the fact that the decedent exhibited certain risk factors for atheroscle-rotic heart disease was sufficient to establish, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the decedent had died of a cardiac event triggered by the disease, and that, if the decedent had been able to improve his physical fitness, which he could not do because of his compensable injury, \u201che would have been less of a candidate for a cardiac event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">There are several problems with the plaintiffs claim, not the least of which is that, apart from the fact that the decedent had suffered from certain risk factors associated with atherosclerotic heart disease\u2014factors that, according to the record, were all fully under control at the time of the decedent\u2019s death<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2014the plaintiff produced no evidence linking the decedent\u2019s death to a heart attack. We agree with the Appellate Court that, without such evidence, either in the form of an autopsy report, an eyewitness account of what appeared to be a heart attack; see <em>Stier </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>119 Conn. 44, 48-51, 174 A. 332 (1934) (affirming commissioner\u2019s finding that decedent had suffered heart attack in course of his employment based, in part, on witness\u2019 testimony that decedent was pale, sweating and complaining of chest pain shortly before his death); or an actual diagnosis of atherosclerotic heart disease, the evidence simply was insufficient to support Filiberto\u2019s testimony as to the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The inadequacy of Filiberto\u2019s testimony is compounded by the fact that, as the Appellate Court noted; <em>see DiNuzzo </em>v. <em>Dan Perkins Chevrolet Geo, Inc., </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 345-46; Filiberto acknowledged at the hearing before the commissioner that when he gave his opinion on direct examination, he was not aware that the decedent had been hospitalized approximately one month before his death for certain side effects of Interferon. See footnote 5 of this opinion. After reading the hospital record, Filiberto further acknowledged that the symptoms that the decedent had exhibited on the night of his death could have been the result of his use of Interferon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When asked, however, whether the symptoms also were consistent with a heart attack, Filiberto could only speculate as to how they \u201cconceivably\u201d might be connected. In the end, Filiberto was forced to concede that he did not \u201cactually know whether there was a heart attack that precipitated the [decedent\u2019s] death, as opposed to some other event, such as a stroke or brain embolism, or an aortic burst or something like that. ...\u201d He also acknowledged in his deposition testimony that, even if it could be established conclusively that the decedent had died of a heart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>attack, without an autopsy, it would be impossible to know whether the heart attack could have been prevented if the decedent had been able to exercise more because some heart attacks are caused by congenital heart defects that are not amenable to improvement through exercise. Specifically, Filiberto testified in relevant part at his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Now, as matter of fact, you don\u2019t know whether, if [the decedent] had been in perfect shape, he might [not] have dropped dead of a heart attack, because you don\u2019t know what the heart defect was that killed him; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201c[Filiberto]: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: So you cannot say, because you do not know, what his heart defect was specifically; no autopsy having been performed, you cannot say that, had he maintained himself in better physical condition ... he would certainly have lived longer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201c[Filiberto]: Well, it certainly means more likely than not than\u2014yeah, I can say that. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">\u201c[The Defendant\u2019s Counsel]: Because you don\u2019t know what his heart defect was, you can\u2019t say whether physical conditioning had anything to do with the heart defect that killed him; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">\u201c[Filiberto]: Since we don\u2019t know exactly what that defect was, that\u2019s true.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Despite these evidentiary deficiencies, the plaintiff proffers several arguments in support of her claim that the judgment of the Appellate Court must be reversed. The plaintiff argues, first, that the decedent\u2019s medical condition \u201cshould not be lost in cardio-semantics\u201d and that it is unfair to penalize her because the decedent\u2019s medical records \u201cdo not contain the magic words \u2018ath-erosclerotic heart disease\u2019 . . . .\u201d We disagree that the evidentiary deficiencies in the plaintiffs case are merely semantical. To the contrary, as we have explained, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>plaintiffs claim to survivor\u2019s benefits was predicated on a series of inferences, some of them quite attenuated, that the commissioner was required to draw from the fact that the decedent had suffered a compensable injury in 1997. These inferences included: (1) the decedent\u2019s 1997 injury severely limited the decedent in his ability to exercise and therefore to maintain his physical fitness; (2) the decedent\u2019s lack of exercise worsened an undiagnosed case of atherosclerotic heart disease or caused him to develop that disease in the first place; and (3) the decedent suffered a fatal heart attack as a result of the first two factors. Putting aside the lack of an evidentiary foundation to support the first inference; see footnote 11 of this opinion; we agree with the Appellate Court that, without some evidence establishing that the decedent in fact suffered a fatal heart attack or actually suffered from atherosclerotic heart disease, the causal link between his compensable injury and his alleged manner of death simply becomes too attenuated to support a reasonable inference that the two events were connected.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The plaintiff also contends that <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Rider Dairy Co., </em>125 Conn. 380, 5 A.2d 855 (1939), <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>125 Conn. 132, 3 A.2d 844 (1939), and <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>74 Conn. 699, 52 A. 490 (1902), support the proposition that when there is conflicting medical testimony as to the cause of death in a workers\u2019 compensation action, and the employee\u2019s death certificate is entered into evidence, the commissioner may rely on the death certificate as evidence of the facts asserted therein. Although we agree with the plaintiff that, as a general matter, a death certificate is evidence of the facts contained therein, the foregoing cases are all distinguishable: in those cases, in contrast to the present case, the physician who prepared the death certificate did not testify, as Filiberto testified in the present case, that he did not actually know what had caused the decedent\u2019s death, that he had not conducted a postmortem examination of the decedent\u2019s body and that an autopsy had not been performed. In light of Filiberto\u2019s testimony, the evidentiary presumption that ordinarily would attach to a death certificate is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that, in keeping with the humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>should not be penalized for failing to request an autopsy of her husband\u2019s body at a time when she was overcome with grief and attending to the details of his funeral. The plaintiff asserts that, if the judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed, it will place future widows in the unfortunate position of having to take steps to secure their survivor\u2019s benefits before attending to the needs of loved ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">It is well established that, in resolving issues of statutory construction under the act, \u201cwe are mindful that the act indisputably is a remedial statute that should be construed generously to accomplish its purpose. . . . The humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation. . . . Accordingly, [i]n construing workers\u2019 compensation law, we must resolve statutory ambiguities or lacunae in a manner that will further the remedial purpose of the act. . . .

App. 813, 819, 728 A.2d 527 (1999). The plaintiff asserts that the Appellate Court improperly relied on the testimony of Alexander, the defendant\u2019s expert, and disregarded the testimony of Filiberto, because it found Alexander to be more credible. It is clear from the opinion of the Appellate Court, however, that that court did not do so. The Appellate Court reversed the decision of the board on the basis of its conclusion that there were insufficient subordinate facts in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s findings, not because it found Alexander to be more credible than Filiberto. Indeed, the Appellate Court expressly disavowed that it had rejected Filiberto\u2019s testimony as lacking in credibility, explaining, rather, that its resolution of the issue presented was predicated on the absence of subordinate facts sufficient to support Filiberto\u2019s conclusions. See <em>DiNuzzo </em>v. <em>Dan Perkins Chevrolet Geo, Inc., </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 343-44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\"> There is no evidence in the record as to whether the decedent took Interferon in the days preceding his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\"> We note that the defendant also maintained in the Appellate Court that, in addition to there having been no subordinate facts in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s finding regarding the cause of the decedent\u2019s death, there were no subordinate facts in the record to support any of the commissioner\u2019s other findings. The defendant argued, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he central findings of the . . . commissioner [were] based [on] the conjecture, surmise, and speculations of the plaintiffs expert witness [Filiberto]. They [were] also based [on] conclusions that ha[d] no definite basis in the facts, lack[ed] supporting foundation in the underlying facts, and [were] otherwise incompetent to prove the facts found.\u201d The defendant further maintained that \u201cthe testimony of . . . Filiberto in several key areas [was] either given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>no support by subordinate facts, or [was] directly contradictory to the subordinate facts.\u201d Although, in this court, the defendant focuses primarily on the lack of support for the commissioner\u2019s finding that the decedent died of a heart attack, we note that the evidence also directly contradicts the commissioner\u2019s finding that the decedent\u2019s death was proximately caused by his compensable work injury because that injury prevented him from exercising. Filiberto testified at his deposition that the decedent started to see him as a patient in 1982 and that, from that time until his death in 2002, the decedent was morbidly obese and that his exercise was limited to walking due to serious injuries that he had sustained in a 1974 bicycle accident. Filiberto further testified that, shortly before the decedent\u2019s death, the decedent informed him during a routine office visit that he was \u201ccontinuing to walk\u201d for exercise. When the plaintiffs counsel asked Filiberto whether he knew \u201cif it was to the same degree and to the same extent and for the same distances that it was prior to the [1997 work-related] accident,\u201d Filiberto responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Thus, to the extent that the decedent was limited in his ability to maintain his physical fitness, the evidence in the record indicates that that limitation was the result of injuries that he had sustained in 1974, not 1997. We have identified nothing in the record establishing that the 1997 work-related injury placed any <em>additional </em>limitation on the decedent; in fact, Filiberto conceded that he did not know whether the decedent walked less as a result of the 1997 injury. As we previously have explained, the claimant in a workers\u2019 compensation case bears the burden of proving that the employee\u2019s employment proximately caused the claimed iryury. See <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 546, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988) (\u201c[t]he rational mind must be able to trace resultant personal injury to a proximate cause set in motion by the employment and not by some other agency, or there can be no recovery\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Although it appears that this factual lacunae would constitute a second, independent basis for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court, we need not rely on it because, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we fully agree with that court\u2019s determination that there were no subordinate facts in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s finding as to the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\"> We disagree with the plaintiff that <em>Blados v. Blados, 151 </em>Conn. <em>391, 198 </em>A.2d 213 (1964), anegligence action, compels a different conclusion because, in <em>Blados, </em>the cause of the decedent\u2019s unwitnessed death was determined, without an autopsy, on the basis of reasonable inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence. See id., 393-96. In <em>Blados, </em>the circumstantial evidence adduced at trial overwhelmingly supported the medical examiner\u2019s finding that the decedent in that case had died of a fractured skull that was caused by a fall from a defective stairwell. See id., 394-96. In the present case, the inferences that the commissioner would have been required to draw with respect to the decedent\u2019s cause of death are not reasonable because they are not supported by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The plaintiff also relies on <em>Stier v. Derby, </em>supra, 119 Conn. 44, <em>and MacFarquhar </em>v. <em>Columbia Graphophone Co., </em>107 Conn. 73, 139 A. 684 (1927), for the principle that an autopsy is not required to determine the cause of death. Of course, we take no issue with the general proposition that an autopsy generally is not required to ascertain a person\u2019s cause of death. In <em>Stier, </em>however, as in <em>Blados, </em>there was ample circumstantial evidence from which the trier of fact reasonably could have inferred the decedent\u2019s cause of death. See <em>Stier </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>supra, 49-52. In <em>MacFarquhar, </em>we were not required to determine whether there were sufficient subordinate facts in the record to support the commissioner\u2019s finding as to the cause of death. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>See generally <em>MacFarquhar </em>v. <em>Columbia Graphophone Co., </em>supra, 74-76. The issue in that case, rather, was whether the trial court properly had granted a motion to correct the finding of the commissioner that, although the decedent in that case had died of a heart attack, his death was unrelated to bum ii\\juries that he had sustained in a work-related accident. See id., 74. The trial court had granted the motion to correct by striking that portion of the finding in which the commissioner stated that the death of the decedent was unrelated to bums that he had sustained on the job, and by adding a paragraph that stated that the death was related. Id. We affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that \u201c[t]he holding of the commissioner that the heart disease did not result from the bums did not accord with the view of the experts on either side, and apparently judging by the evidence was not in accordance with the position taken [even] by [the] defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d Id., 75-76. Thus, neither <em>Stier </em>nor <em>MacFarquhar </em>supports the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
