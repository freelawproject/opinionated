Winot, following a jury trial, of kidnapping in the second degree<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>95 Conn. App. 332, 362, 897 A.2d 115 (2006). We agree with the state that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that \u00a7 53a-94 (a) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id., 343. Moreover, we disagree with the defendant that we should affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on the alternative ground that it improperly concluded that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of certain evidence was proper. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The Appellate Court summarized the relevant facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, as follows: \u201cOn the evening of July 19, 2002, at approximately 6 p.m., the twelve year old female victim was walking alone on Spruce Street in Manchester when she noticed a green car moving slowly along the opposite side of the street. The defendant, the driver of the car, stopped the car in the middle of the road and lowered the driver\u2019s side window. He pointed his finger at the victim and yelled, \u2018I\u2019m going to get you. You\u2019re getting in my car.\u2019 He then got out of the car and walked across Spruce Street toward the victim with his arms stretched in front of him as if he was going to give the victim a bear hug. When he was approximately six feet from the victim, she ran away toward her house on Bissell Street. It took her only a matter of seconds to reach her house, where she told her mother what had transpired. The incident was not reported to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\u201cFour days later, on July 23, 2002, at approximately 5 p.m., the victim was again walking home on Spruce Street when she noticed the same green car and driver. The defendant stopped the vehicle and rolled down the window. This time, without saying anything to the victim, he left the car and began walking toward her. She began to walk faster, but the defendant forcibly took her right arm. When she asked him to let go, he refused, yelling, \u2018[n]o, it\u2019s too wet out here; you\u2019re getting in my car today.\u2019 He tried to pull her toward his car, but she resisted, pulling back in the opposite direction. To get him to release her, the victim then leaned over to bite the defendant, at which point he quickly let go and rushed back to his car. In doing so, the defendant was almost hit by a maroon car. Upon being released, the victim ran home and told her mother what had transpired. The entire incident lasted only a few seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cThe victim\u2019s mother called the police, and the victim gave a signed statement regarding the incidents, which took place on July 19 and 23, 2002. The victim also provided the police with a license plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\u201cThe police traced the license plate number to the defendant. Upon arriving at his residence that same day, the police observed a turquoise Ford Thunderbird with plates matching the number provided by the victim. Officer David Evans of the Manchester police department asked the defendant whether he had been on Spruce Street around 5 p.m. Although the defendant admitted that he had driven through that area on his way home from work, he initially denied having spoken to anyone. Subsequently, however, he admitted to Sergeant Jeffrey Lampson that he had offered a young woman a ride. The police brought the victim to the defendant\u2019s house, where she positively identified him as the man who had approached her on both occasions. The defendant was then arrested, handcuffed and placed in a police cruiser. Thereafter, Officer Evans obtained the defendant\u2019s permission to search his car. The subsequent search revealed a rope noose and various debris in the trunk. Only the noose was seized. At the police station, the defendant admitted that on his way home from work, he had offered a young girl a ride home because it was raining, but denied any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201cIn a three count substitute information, the state charged the defendant with attempt to commit kidnapping in the second degree in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 53a-94 (a) and 53a-49 (a) (2), kidnapping in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-94 (a) and risk of injuiy to a child in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1). After the jury found the defendant guilty on all three counts, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal. The court sentenced the defendant to eight years impiis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>onment followed by ten years of special parole.\u201d Id., 335-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The defendant\u2019s appeal from his conviction to the Appellate Court followed. There, he argued, inter aha, that \u00a7 53a-94 (a), proscribing the offense of kidnapping in the second degree, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct on July 23, 2002. Specifically, he argued that, in light of the brevity of his encounter with the victim and the minimal amount of restraint he employed, the statute failed to give him fair notice that his conduct was prohibited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 338,341. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant, concluding that his movement or confinement of the victim was \u201c \u2018miniscule,\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, that the resulting kidnapping conviction was \u201cabsurd and unconscionable . . . .\u201d Id., 343. Moreover, according to the Appellate Court, to uphold the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cwould risk the encouragement of arbitrary and discretionary enforcement of [\u00a7 53a-94 (a)] by overzealous prosecutors.\u201d Id. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The state contends on appeal that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of kidnapping in the second degree because the statute proscribing that crime is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct on July 23, 2002. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">We begin with the applicable standard of review and general governing principles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6The determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>whether a statutory provision is unconstitutionally vague is a question of law over which we exercise de novo review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Knybel, </em>281 Conn. 707, 713, 916 A.2d 816 (2007). In undertaking such review, we are mindful that \u201c [a] statute is not void for vagueness unless it clearly and unequivocally is unconstitutional, making every presumption in favor of its validity. ... To demonstrate that [a statute] is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, the [defendant] therefore must . . . demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] had inadequate notice of what was prohibited or that [he was] the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. . . . [T]he void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute . . . and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. ... If the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [m]any statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Farricielli, </em>269 Conn. 187, 204, 848 A.2d 1206 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Com! has set forth standards for evaluating vagueness. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. ... [A] law forbidding or requiring conduct in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates due process of law. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>\u201cSecond, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications. . . . Therefore, a legislature [must] establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>284 Conn. 573, 584, 937 A.2d 24 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Tempering the foregoing considerations is the acknowledgment that many statutes proscribing criminal offenses necessarily cannot be drafted with the utmost precision and still effectively reach the targeted behaviors. Consistent with that acknowledgment, the United States Supreme Court has explained: \u201cThe root of the vagueness doctrine is a rough idea of fairness. It is not a principle designed to convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited.\u201d <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1972); see also <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 322, 732 A.2d 144 (1999) (\u201cBecause perfect precision is neither possible nor required . . . the [vagueness] doctrine does not mandate the invalidation of all imprecisely drafted statutes. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48,49,96 S. Ct. 243,46 L. Ed. 2d 185 [1975]; <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 [1972] . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). Simply put, \u201c[w]hile some ambiguous statutes are the result of poor draftsmanship, it is apparent that in many instances the uncertainty is merely attributable to a desire not to nullify the purpose of the legislation by the use of specific terms which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>would afford loopholes through which many could escape. W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law (1972) \u00a7 11, pp. 84-85.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Section 53a-94 (a), by its plain terms, indisputably prohibits intentional, nonconsensual restraint of a person, by means of physical force, when that restraint is coupled with the intent to prevent that person\u2019s liberation. See footnote 3 of this opinion. It further is clear that the statutory definition of \u201crestraint\u201d encompasses both movement of a person from one place to another and confinement of a person in the place where a restriction of movement commences. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (1); see also footnote 3 of this opinion. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s argument that, although he held the victim in place against her will through physical force, he did so for such a brief period of time that the statute did not afford him adequate notice that his behavior would be regarded as criminal and, moreover, to convict him of kidnapping on the basis of a brief restraint would allow for arbitrary enforcement of \u00a7 53a-94 (a). <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 95 Conn. App. 342-43. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">For many years prior to the events underlying this appeal, Connecticut\u2019s appellate courts routinely rejected challenges to kidnapping convictions based on claims that the movement or confinement at issue was minimal and/or merely incidental to the commission upon the victim of another assault type crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>287 Conn. 509, 531, 949 A.2d 1092 (2008) (citing cases). We reasoned, in part, that \u201cbecause the statutory definitions of the terms \u2018restrain\u2019 and \u2018abduct\u2019 contain no time or distance specifications, the offense of kidnapping does not require proof that the victim was confined for any minimum period of time or moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>any minimum distance.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 531-32. Accordingly, we repeatedly explained, the touchstone for determining whether the movement or confinement at issue constituted kidnapping was not its extensiveness, but rather, \u201cwhether it was accomplished with the requisite intent, that is, to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>In several instances, we applied these principles to uphold kidnapping convictions that involved movement of the victim for a rather brief distance and/or confinement of the victim for quite a short period of time. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 503, 594 A.2d 906 (1991) (movement of victim throughout her apartment during robbery, sexual assault); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>215 Conn. 173,182,575 A.2d216 (1990) (movement of victim across and off of road); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 606, 614-15, 469 A.2d 767 (1983) (movement of victim from front of store to back stockroom during sexual assault); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>188 Conn. 406, 409, 416, 450 A.2d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>356 (1982) (confinement of victims in freezers for two to fifteen minutes during robbery); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>177 Conn. 335,344,417 A.2d 354 (1979) (movement of victim from stairway to bedroom and detention there for fifteen minutes during robbery); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>58 Conn. App. 797, 802-803, 755 A.2d 919 (movement of victim down driveway and under stairwell during sexual assault), cert, denied, 254 Conn. 936, 761 A.2d 763 (2000).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At times, however, we allowed that there conceivably could be \u201cfactual situations in which charging a defendant with kidnapping based [on] the most miniscule [movement or duration of confinement] would result in an absurd and unconscionable result . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 532 n.21; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 315, 677 A.2d 917 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>supra, 503; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 180. The Appellate Court concluded that the facts of this case presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>such a situation. We disagree with that conclusion because, although the defendant\u2019s restraint of the victim was brief, it was coupled with unusually strong evidence of his intent to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation. Consequently, we are not convinced that \u00a7 53a-94 (a) afforded this defendant inadequate notice that his behavior was prohibited or that, by being prosecuted for kidnapping, he was a victim of arbitrary law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Substantial vagueness jurisprudence provides that when a criminal statute is imprecise in describing the actions it proscribes, the presence of a specific intent requirement can temper that imprecision, thus clarifying the meaning of the statute, narrowing its application, and \u201cpurg[ing] a potentially vague [provision] of constitutional infirmity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 460, 542 A.2d 686 (1988). \u201c[A] scienter requirement may mitigate a law\u2019s vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the [party] that his conduct is proscribed.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 499, 102 S. Ct. 1186, 71 L. Ed. 2d 362, reh. denied, 456 U.S. 950,102 S. Ct. 2023, 72 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1982); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Dairy Products Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 35, 83 S. Ct. 594, 9 L. Ed. 2d 561 (necessary specificity of warning afforded when statutory elements include both intent to achieve result and act done in furtherance of that result), reh. denied, 372 U.S. 961, 83 S. Ct. 1011, 10 L. Ed. 2d 13 (1963). In short, \u201cwhere the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits, the accused cannot be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law.\u201d <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91,102, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945); see also <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 342, 72 S. Ct. 329, 96 L. Ed. 367 (1952) (\u201crequirement of the presence of culpable intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>as a necessary element of the offense does much to destroy any force in the argument that application of [a statute] would be so unfair that it must be held invalid\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">We conclude that this court\u2019s repeated pronouncements that there are no minimum time or distance requirements to establish a restraint within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-94 (a),* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> coupled with the statute\u2019s prohibition of the act of restraint only when it is accomplished with the specific intent of preventing a victim\u2019s liberation, defeats the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 53a-94 (a) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to his actions on July 23, 2002. Although the defendant\u2019s restraint of the victim was brief, when it is viewed in conjunction with the powerful evidence of his intent to prevent her liberation, any argument that he was unaware of the criminality of his behavior, or that he was a victim of arbitrary enforcement, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Because direct evidence of an accused\u2019s state of mind typically is not available, his intent often must be inferred from his conduct, other circumstantial evidence and rational inferences that may be drawn therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>285 Conn. 447, 455, 939 A.2d 581 (2008). For example, intent may be inferred from the events leading up to, and immediately following, the conduct in question; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>280 Conn. 779, 814-15, 911 A.2d 1099 (2007); the accused\u2019s physical acts and the general surrounding circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Towns, </em>114 Conn. App. 155,159, 968 A.2d 975 (2009). An accused\u2019s own words, however, constitute particularly compelling, direct evidence of his intent. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorabella, </em>277 Conn. 155, 178-79, 891 A.2d 897 (defendant\u2019s electronic communications with victim clearly established that he intended to have sexual intercourse with her upon meeting her in Connecticut), cert denied, 549 U.S. 821, 127 S. Ct. 131, 166 L. Ed. 2d 36 (2006). Finally, when a jury evaluates evidence of a defendant\u2019s intent, it properly \u201crel[ies] on its common sense, experience and knowledge of human nature in drawing inferences and reaching conclusions of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 59, 502 A.2d 360 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In the present case, any potential for vagueness of \u00a7 53a-94 (a) as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct, standing alone, was counteracted by the overwhelming evidence that he possessed the requisite specific intent to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation. The events of July 23, 2002, were not the victim\u2019s first encounter with the defendant; rather, he was convicted of attempting to kidnap the victim only four days earlier. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas W., </em>115 Conn. App. 467, 475, 974 A.2d 19 (jury reasonably could be expected to conclude that defendant\u2019s viewing of child victim in bathroom was for purpose of sexual gratification in light of earlier incident in which defendant exposed himself and masturbated in victim\u2019s presence), cert, granted on other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>grounds, 294 Conn. 911, 983 A.2d 276 (2009). On both occasions, the defendant\u2019s verbal statements provided clear manifestations of the prohibited intent. Specifically, the defendant yelled repeatedly that he was going to \u201cget\u201d the victim and that she was going to get into his car. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>296 App. Div. 2d 22, 25-26, 745 N.Y.S.2d 528 (2002) (defendant\u2019s intent to abduct victim clearly evidenced by his statement, following his observation of children for forty-five minutes while masturbating, \u201c \u2018I want to take you home\u2019 \u201d), leave to appeal denied, 99 N.Y.2d 534, 782 N.E.2d 572, 752 N.Y.S.2d 594 (2002). Additionally, the defendant\u2019s car, an enclosed space capable of movement away from the scene, contained a noose made of rope and duct tape in its trunk. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>207 Mich. App. 465, 467 and n.l, 469, 525 N.W.2d 484 (1994) (defendant\u2019s intent to detain child, within meaning of kidnapping statute, clearly evidenced by grabbing and throwing her into car after offering her money if she helped him retrieve cat), cert. denied, 449 Mich. 852, 535 N.W.2d 789 (1995); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>56 Cal. App. 3d 954, 956-57, 129 Cal. Rptr. 24 (1976) (defendant\u2019s intent to abduct thirteen year old girl clearly evidenced by grabbing her by head and hair and ordering her into vehicle with running motor; trier \u201ccould reasonably find that [the] defendant not only intended to force the girl into his vehicle but intended to carry her away some appreciable distance\u201d). Finally, the defendant grabbed the victim and pulled her toward the car as she pulled back. See <em>Laster </em>v. <em>State, </em>275 S.W.3d 512, 522 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (defendant\u2019s intent to abduct child evidenced by his pulling her away from her brother, who pulled her back in opposite direction). On the basis of the foregoing, a juiy, applying its common sense and knowledge of human nature, reasonably could be expected to conclude that the defendant restrained the victim with intent to prevent her liberation. Consequently, the defendant cannot claim surprise that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>would be arrested, prosecuted and convicted of that crime, or that he was the innocent victim of an unfair and arbitrary enforcement of \u00a7 53a-94 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We note in closing that our disposition of this matter \u201cis informed by the understanding that the fundamental purpose of the void for vagueness doctrine is to ensure fair warning in order to avoid traps <em>for the innocent. . . . </em>The defendant has made no plausible argument, nor can we conceive of one, that [on July 23, 2002] he acted in reliance on the belief that his conduct was lawful, or that a person of ordinary intelligence would have no reason to know that he was engaging in prohibited conduct.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 779, 695 A.2d 525 (1997), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>269 Conn. 481, 490, 849 A.2d 760 (2004). Rather, the defendant in his brief implies only that he was charged improperly, i.e., that he ought to have been charged with either unlawful restraint or attempt to commit kidnapping,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and not that his conduct was not criminal. For purposes of vagueness analysis, this argument is not persuasive. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467-68, 111 S. Ct. 1919, 114 L. Ed. 2d 524 (rejecting vagueness claim and noting that \u201cwhatever debate there is [over meaning of statute] would center around the appropriate sentence and not the criminality of the conduct\u201d), reh. denied, 501 U.S. 1270, 112 S.

It is enough that he [or she] knows that what he [or she] is about to do is probably or certainly criminal.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]); <em>Welton </em>v. <em>Nix, </em>719 F.2d 969,970 (8th Cir. 1983) (same); <em>Knutson </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>619 F.2d 747, 750 (8th Cir. 1980) (rejecting that defendant had right to expect to be convicted of lesser crime only, finding it \u201csignificant that the issue of construction involved here is not the drawing of a line between legal conduct and illegal conduct\u201d). In such circumstances, a defendant does not meet the heavy burden of showing that a statute, as applied to the facts of his case, is unconstitutionally vague. See <em>Knutson </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, 750. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we agree with the state that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of kidnapping in the second degree on the ground that \u00a7 53a-94 (a), as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct, was unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The defendant argues that we may affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on an alternative ground, namely, that the Appellate Court failed to conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and her prior statement to police improperly denied him the right to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. We are not persuaded.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The following additional facts and procedural history, as recounted by the Appellate Court, are relevant. \u201cPrior to driving the victim to the defendant\u2019s house for the identification, Officer Aaron Calkins interviewed both the victim and her mother. The victim told Calkins about the incident that had just occurred and the one that had taken place on July 19. Calkins prepared a written statement, read it to the victim and had her sign it under oath. The statement indicated, in error, that the forcible taking incident had taken place on July 19 and the yelling incident had taken place on July 23. At trial, the victim testified that, two weeks earlier, she had reread the statement and noticed that the dates were mixed up. She also testified that she was not the one who had mixed them up and that she accurately had reported to her mother what had taken place on the respective dates. Calkins testified that the statement reflected what the victim had told him on July 23 about the sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cAfter the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defense counsel announced his intention to call the victim\u2019s mother and, through her, to offer a prior inconsistent statement to impeach the credibility of the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Counsel indicated that he anticipated that [the mother] would testify, consistently with her written statement, that [the victim had told her<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that] the forcible taking incident had taken place on July 19 and the yelling incident had taken place on July 23. After the state claimed that the mother would contradict her sworn statement [by agreeing with the victim\u2019s testimony as to the dates of the charged incidents], the defendant indicated he would introduce her written statement for substantive purposes under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S.

App. 354-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The state objected, arguing, inter alia, that \u201cthe [mother\u2019s] statement was hearsay and that offering it for impeachment purposes was a mere subterfuge for introducing substantively inadmissible evidence [as contemplated by \u00a7 6-4 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence].<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Outside of the presence of the jury, the mother repudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ated her statement, and the court sustained the state\u2019s objection and excluded the [s]ubterfuge testimony . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant argued that the mother\u2019s statement was admissible under <em>Whelan </em>and was not barred by \u00a7 6-4 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The Appellate Court disagreed, concluding that the trial court properly excluded the statement as hearsay because it purported to report the statements of the victim. Id., 356-57. According to the Appellate Court, \u201c[i]t is clear that the defendant\u2019s primary purpose in calling the [victim\u2019s] mother to testify, after being informed that she would recant, was to impeach her. In impeaching her, the defendant\u2019s objective was to get the statement before the jury with the intent that it be used substantively . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 357. Alternatively, the Appellate Court determined that the statement was inadmissible because it amounted to irrelevant extrinsic evidence offered to impeach the victim on a collateral matter, namely, the dates of the charged offenses. Id., 357 n.16. The Appellate Court held, therefore, that the statement properly was excluded. Id., 357. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The defendant argues that, pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>he had the right to present the signed, sworn statement of the victim\u2019s mother as substantive evidence when she indicated that she would repudiate that statement if called to testify at trial, because the statement was in writing and had been signed under oath by the mother, and the mother had personal knowledge of what the victim had told her.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> According to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>dant, the trial court improperly disregarded <em>Whelan </em>and instead relied on <em>State </em>v. Graham, 200 Conn. 9, 509 A.2d 493 (1986), which underlies \u00a7 6-4 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence and pertains to prior oral statements only, when it disallowed the mother\u2019s testimony and written statement. The defendant claims that exclusion of this evidence violated his constitutional right to present a defense. We agree with the Appellate Court that the evidence properly was excluded and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense was not compromised.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable legal principles. \u201cThe federal constitution require[s] that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. . . . The sixth amendment . . . [guarantees] the right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, [and] is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so that it may decide where the truth lies. . . . When defense evidence is excluded, such exclusion may give rise to a claim of denial of the right to present a defense. ... A defendant is, however, bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>rules of evidence in presenting a defense. . . . Although exclusionary rules of evidence cannot be applied mechanistically to deprive a defendant of his rights, the constitution does not require that a defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wishes. ... If the proffered evidence is not relevant, the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not affected, and the evidence was properly excluded.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>274 Conn. 605, 624-25, 877 A.2d 787, cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1049, 126 S. Ct. 775, 163 L. Ed. 2d 601 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Tutson, </em>278 Conn. 715, 750-51, 899 A.2d 598 (2006) (no violation of constitutional right to present defense where trial court properly excluded evidence on hearsay grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Finally, \u201cwe note that [t]he admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>is a matter within the . . . discretion of the trial court. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. ... On review by this court, therefore, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>286 Conn. 634, 643, 945 A.2d 449 (2008); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 217-19, 926 A.2d 633 (2007) (Adopting the \u201c \u2018hybrid\u2019 \u201d approach to hearsay claims and concluding that \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law . . . for an abuse of discretion. ... In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\u201d [Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>tion omitted.]). We now turn to the rules cited by the parties when arguing whether the mother\u2019s statement was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Prior to 1986, Connecticut courts adhered to the common-law rule disallowing a party from impeaching or discrediting its own witnesses, in the absence of certain exceptions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 15. That year, however, in <em>Graham, </em>we determined that there was \u201cno longer justification for the common law rule prohibiting a party from impeaching his own witness,\u201d and held that, henceforth, \u201c[a] party may impeach his own witness in the same manner as an opposing party\u2019s witness,\u201d for example, by \u201cusing prior inconsistent statements.\u201d Id., 17. We emphasized, however, that a party \u201cmay not use a prior inconsistent statement under the guise of impeachment for the primary purpose of placing before the jury evidence which is admissible only for credibility purposes in hope that the jury will use it substantively.\u201d Id., 18. In that circumstance, we explained, the \u201cimpeachment would become a subterfuge and the court should not permit it.\u201d Id. The holding of <em>Graham, </em>along with the foregoing caveat, thereafter was codified as \u00a7 6-4 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See footnote 18 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Shortly after deciding <em>Graham, </em>we decided <em>Whelan. </em>Prior to deciding <em>Whelan, </em>we \u201cadhered to the traditional view that a prior inconsistent statement of a nonparty witness is inadmissible hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein and, therefore, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>admissible only for impeachment purposes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 303, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000). In <em>Whelan, </em>we abandoned, in certain circumstances, that limitation in favor of \u201ca rule allowing the substantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 304. We reasoned that, under those circumstances, the non-party witness\u2019 prior statement generally is sufficiently reliable to be admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. Id., 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The rule of <em>Whelan </em>had implications for the rule of <em>Graham, </em>as the commentary to \u00a7 6-4 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence explains: \u201c[I]f the prior inconsistent statement [offered to impeach a witness] is substantively admissible under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>[supra, 200 Conn. 753] ... or under other exceptions to the hearsay rule, the limitation on impeachment will not apply because impeachment with the prior inconsistent statement cannot result in introducing otherwise inadmissible evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) In other words, if the prior inconsistent statement is admissible pursuant to <em>Whelan </em>or another hearsay exception, there can be no subterfuge because the statement properly may be used for substantive purposes, not just impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The defendant argues, in short, that the trial court improperly excluded the written statement of the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>tim\u2019s mother pursuant to the Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7 6-4 because the statement was admissible substantively pursuant to the rule of Whelan, and, therefore, could not have been offered as subterfuge pursuant to <em>Graham. </em>We agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court properly excluded the mother\u2019s statement for substantive purposes because, although that statement met the criteria of <em>Whelan </em>and was not itself hearsay, it nevertheless contained within it another level of hearsay for which no hearsay exception applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Specifically, because the mother had personal knowledge of what the victim said to her, the mother\u2019s signed, sworn statement recounting the victim\u2019s statements regarding the events of July 19 and 23, 2002, met the criteria of <em>Whelan, </em>and, therefore, was not itself hearsay. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>277 Conn. 42, 59, 890 A.2d 474 (trial witness\u2019 written statement to police recounting statements made in his presence by codefendants met criteria of <em>Whelan), </em>cert, denied, 547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>227 Conn. 1, 22, 629 A.2d 386 (1993) (trial witness\u2019 tape-recorded statement to police recounting admissions made to him by defendant met criteria of <em>Whelan). </em>The victim\u2019s statements to her mother, however, that is, her accounts of the events, constituted <em>another </em>level of hearsay within her mother\u2019s <em>Whelan </em>statement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 802, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998) (third party\u2019s statements to informant, recounted in informant\u2019s statement to police, constitute multiple levels of hearsay). \u201cWhen a statement is offered that contains hearsay within hearsay, each level of hearsay must itself be supported by an exception to the hearsay rule in order for that level of hearsay to be admissible.\u201d Id.; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-7; C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.62.2, p. 750. Accordingly, when \u201cprior statements [admissible under <em>Whelan] </em>are admitted for substantive purposes, hearsay contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>in such prior statements should not be admitted unless such hearsay itself satisfies a hearsay exception.\u201d C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 8.33.2, p. 681; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Buster, </em>224 Conn. 546, 560 n.8, 620 A.2d 110 (1993); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 66-67 (witness\u2019 <em>Whelan </em>statement properly admitted because defendants\u2019 statements recounted therein met dual inculpatory statement and adoptive admission exceptions to hearsay rule); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>supra, 22 (witness\u2019 <em>Whelan </em>statement properly admitted because statement recounted therein met hearsay exception for admission of party). In the present matter, because the defendant suggested no hearsay exception<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that would warrant admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements to her mother for substantive purposes, the trial court properly excluded the mother\u2019s <em>Whelan </em>statement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Pursuant <em>to Pierre, </em>and, generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>our rules governing hearsay within hearsay, it is not permissible to bootstrap nonadmissible hearsay into admissible evidence by ensconcing it within a <em>Whelan </em>statement. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we reject the defendant\u2019s proposed alternative ground for affirming the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed in part and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of conviction of kidnapping in the second degree.

We previously have equated vagueness doctrine under the two documents and have declined to analyze vagueness claims any differently under the Connecticut constitution. See <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 845-47, 761 A.2d 705 (2000); <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 98-99, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). We adhere to that approach in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\"> Additionally, we reasoned, \u201cbecause there is no general prohibition against a person being convicted of multiple crimes arising out of the same act or acts, it is of no moment that the confinement or movement that provides the basis of a kidnapping conviction is merely incidental to the commission of another crime against the victim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\"> In <em>Salamon, </em>we examined more closely the contours of the intent to prevent a victim\u2019s liberation. Although we did not attempt to provide a comprehensive definition of that intent, we determined that the legislature meant to exclude from its scope an intent to confine or move a victim that is wholly incidental to the commission of another crime which, by its nature, necessitates some restraint of the victim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 542. We did not otherwise limit the definition of \u201cintent to prevent . . . liberation\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2); or restrict the jury\u2019s role in determining whether it has been proven. Indeed, we emphasized that the holding in <em>Salamon </em>was not a complete refutation of the principles established by our prior kidnapping jurisprudence, specifically, that no minimum period of confinement or degree of movement is required to establish kidnapping. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 546. We noted that \u201c[w]hether the movement or confinement of the victim is merely incidental to and necessary for another crime will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case\u201d and that, \u201cwhen the evidence reasonably supports a finding that the restraint was <em>not </em>merely incidental to the commission of some other, separate crime, the ultimate factual determination [of whether the defendant intended to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation] must be made by the jury.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 547-48. We reversed the defendant\u2019s kidnapping conviction and remanded the case for such a determination. Id., 549-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Salamon, </em>we heard two appeals that similarly challenged kidnapping convictions on the ground that the restraint at issue was brief and wholly incidental to the commission of another crime, which, in each case, was sexual assault. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>288 Conn. 418, 426, 953 A.2d 45 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>287 Conn. 608, 612, 949 A.2d 1156 (2008), overruled in part by <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 437, superseded in part after reconsideration by <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>291 Conn. 574, 969 A.2d 710 (2009). In deciding these cases, we determined that their facts implicated the new rule announced in <em>Salamon </em>and, therefore, required reversal of the defendants\u2019 kidnapping convictions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 428; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 625-26. We concluded further that the correct remedy was to remand each case for a new trial in which the jury properly would be instructed as to the rule of <em>Salamon </em>and the state would have the opportunity to present evidence and to argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>that the restraint involved was not entirely incidental to the defendant\u2019s commission of sexual assault. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 589-90; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 438-39. We reasoned that double jeopardy concerns did not mandate acquittal when the evidence presented was sufficient to establish kidnapping under the standard applicable at the time of trial, but not under the standard newly articulated in <em>Salamon, </em>because any insufficiency in proof resulted only from the subsequent change in the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 588; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 436. Following our decision in <em>DeJesus, </em>we issued, sua sponte, an order directing the parties in the present case to file simultaneous supplemental briefs addressing the impact of that decision on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Upon review of those briefs, contrary to the view of the dissenting justices, we are not persuaded that the rule of <em>Salamon </em>and, therefore, the remedy established by <em>DeJesus, </em>is implicated by the facts of the present appeal. First, the defendant did not claim, before either the trial court or the Appellate Court, that \u00a7 53a-94 (a) was unconstitutionally vague as applied because his restraint of the victim was incidental to his commission of another crime, but rather, only because the restraint was of short duration. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 426-27 (defendant argued that restraint was wholly incidental to commission of sexual assault); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 619 (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 516 (defendant argued that conduct constituted physical assault to which any restraint was incidental).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Second, there was no evidence presented at trial suggesting that the defendant, when he grabbed the victim\u2019s arm, was in the process of committing another crime against her to which the restraint potentially was incidental. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 422-23 (evidence of sexual assault during restraint); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 615 (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 515 (evidence that defendant grabbed victim by neck, causing her to fall, punched her and shoved his fingers down her throat while holding her down by her hair, causing her injury); <em>State </em>v. <em>Misner, </em>410 N.W.2d 216, 223 (Iowa 1987) (because there was substantial evidence to support claim that confinement and movement of hostages was incidental to other crime, court should have so instructed); <em>People </em>v. <em>Rappuhn, </em>78 Mich. App. 348, 354, 260 N.W.2d 90 (1977) (where there was evidence of forced sexual activity, incidental instruction was warranted); with <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>132 Ga. App. 399, 402, 208 S.E.2d 183 (1974) (because evidence did not disclose any other crime involved, unnecessary for court to decide whether incidental rule would apply); <em>People </em>v. <em>Kittle, </em>140 Ill. App. 3d 951, 954-55, 489 N.E.2d 481 (1986) (noting that factors of incidental analysis refer to separate offense and therefore are inapplicable when no such offense committed or contemplated). More specifically, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion that the evidence \u201cdisclose[d] conduct that could constitute another crime,\u201d there was no evidence that the defendant injured or struck the victim. Accordingly, a jury could not find that the defendant\u2019s restraint of the victim was incidental to the commission of assault in the third degree or breach of the peace in the second degree. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1) and 53a-181 (a) (2). Moreover, as we explain hereinafter, the evidence was overwhelming that the defendant, when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>accosted the victim, intended to prevent her liberation. Particularly, the defendant told the victim, while pulling on her arm, that she was \u201cgetting in [his] car today,\u201d after having stated on a recent, separate occasion that he was \u201cgoing to get [her]\u201d and that she was \u201cgetting in [his] car.\u201d Consequently, under the unique factual circumstances presented by this case, even if the defendant\u2019s restraint of the victim also could be found to constitute the \u201cviolent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d proscribed by our statutes criminalizing creation of a public disturbance; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a (a) (1); and disorderly conduct; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1); no jury reasonably could conclude that the kidnapping was incidental to his commission of those crimes, rather than the converse. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>506 S.W.2d 437,440 (Mo. 1974) (rejecting applicability of incidental analysis and holding that, on evidence presented, any assaults committed upon girl when defendant forced her into car, transported her some distance and prevented her from escaping were \u201cincidental to the kidnapping, rather than vice versa\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Third, we disagree with the defendant that he is entitled to an incidental instruction in connection with the charge of risk of injury to a child because his conviction for that crime was reversed by the Appellate Court for insufficiency of the evidence and, therefore, he will not face retrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 95 Conn. App. 362. Given that circumstance, a remand of this matter for an instruction on the incidental rule in relation to risk of injury would be illogical and wholly confusing to the jury. See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>47 Va. App. 114, 122-24, 622 S.E.2d 282 (2005) (incidental rule inapplicable where defendant acquitted of robbery), aff'd, 272 Va. 511, 636 S.E.2d 476 (2006); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>131 Mich. App. 429, 433, 346 N.W.2d 333 (1984) (incidental rule inapplicable where trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict on underlying assault charge); <em>State </em>v. <em>French, </em>139 Vt. 320, 321, 428 A.2d 1087 (1981) (incidental rule inapplicable where defendants acquitted of sexual assault); but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>80 N.Y.2d 146, 152, 603 N.E.2d 938, 589 N.Y.S.2d 833 (1992) (analysis unaltered even if defendant acquitted of rape or robbery).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b789-5\"> Case law decided subsequent to the events underlying the defendant\u2019s kidnapping conviction extended the logic of these holdings even further. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em>262 Conn.179, 202-204, 811 A.2d 223 (2002) (movement of victim from couch to floor and confinement limited to brief period during which defendant attempted sexual assault adequate to sustain kidnapping conviction); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>83 Conn. App. 142, 159-60, 848 A.2d 1246 (kidnapping statute not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant\u2019s movement of victim out of police substation doorway followed by brief confinement during physical assault), cert. denied, 270 Conn. 915, 853 A.2d 530 (2004). These holdings, as well as most of those cited in the main text, were undermined by our decision in <em>Salamon, </em>but only to the extent that the restraints involved were completely incidental to the accompanying crimes, which the defendant has not claimed here, and not merely because of their brevity. We reemphasize that <em>Salamon </em>did not refute the previously established principle that, pursuant to the terms of Connecticut\u2019s kidnapping statute, no minimum period of confinement or degree of movement must be established to prove the commission of that crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 546.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> In deciding <em>Salamon, </em>we noted that a challenge based on this predicate remained viable under the vagueness doctrine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 532 n.21, 546 n.31; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>288 Conn. 418, 433 n.12, 953 A.2d 45 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>287 Conn. 608, 623 n.14, 949 A.2d 1156 (2008), overruled in part by <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 437, superseded in part after reconsideration by <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>291 Conn. 574, 969 A.2d 710 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> Connecticut courts frequently have relied on this reasoning to reject vagueness challenges to statutes with specific intent requirements. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>238 Conn. 784, 798-99, 680 A.2d 1306 (1996) (first degree kidnapping statute not unconstitutionally vague because it requires specific intent to terrorize); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>200 Conn. 664, 668-69, 513 A.2d 646 (1986) (statute disallowing tampering with witness not unconstitutionally vague because it requires specific intent to cause witness to testify falsely or to refrain from testifying at all); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adgers, </em>101 Conn. App. 123, 132, 921 A.2d 122 (requirement in harassment statute that mailings be sent \u201c \u2018with intent to harass, annoy or alarm\u2019 \u201d victim buttressed conclusion that statute not unconstitutionally vague), cert, denied, 283 Conn. 903, 927 A.2d 915 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\"> In order to provide the requisite notice and fair warning to a defendant that his conduct is criminal, judicial opinions need not involve precisely the same factual scenario as the defendant\u2019s case; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>supra, 423 U.S. 51; or even \u201c \u2018fundamentally similar\u2019 \u201d facts. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 268, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L.

Ct. 131, 166 L. Ed. 2d 36 (2006). Accordingly, it is of no consequence that all of our previous kidnapping jurisprudence involved restraints of more substantial duration than that at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> The defendant did not raise any distinct claim in his appeal before the Appellate Court, as to either his conviction of kidnapping in the second degree or attempt to commit kidnapping in the second degree, that his conduct actually constituted some other crime. Accordingly, that court did not consider such a claim. As a consequence, this case gives us no occasion to explore in detail the precise delineation between an attempt to commit kidnapping and a completed kidnapping.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> More precisely, the defendant requests that we modify the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment, from a directed judgment of acquittal on the charge of kidnapping in the second degree to a reversal of that conviction followed by a remand and retrial on that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\"> The state argues at the outset that we should not review the defendant\u2019s claim because it has been waived. Specifically, it claims that, although the defendant petitioned this court for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment, he did not request review of the issue presented here and, therefore, improperly has circumvented this court\u2019s discretionary review process. Moreover, according to the state, the defendant\u2019s proposed alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tive ground for affirmance improperly seeks to have this court impose a different judgment than that rendered by the Appellate Court, namely, a remand and retrial rather than an acquittal. See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">We disagree with the state that the defendant has waived his claim. A party need not first seek certification for review of an issue in order to raise it as an alternative ground for affirmance. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 596, 599-600 n.3, 748 A.2d 278 (2000). All that is necessary is that the alternative ground was raised and briefed in the appeal before the Appellate Court. See Practice Book \u00a7 84-11 (a). Additionally, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11 (b), \u201c[a]ny party may also present for review any claim that the relief afforded by the appellate court in its judgment should be <em>modified, </em>provided such claim was raised in the appellate court either in such party\u2019s brief or upon a motion for reconsideration.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See, e.g., <em>Carrano </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>279 Conn. 622, 625-26, 904 A.2d 149 (2006) (reviewing appellees\u2019 claim that they were entitled to judgment as matter of law rather than new trial). At the Appellate Court, the defendant sought reversal of his conviction of kidnapping in the second degree on the ground that \u00a7 53a-94 (a) was void for vagueness or, alternatively, because that conviction was obtained unfairly due to multiple allegedly improper evidentiary rulings, including the one at issue here. Accordingly, the defendant may seek modification of the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\"> Generally, \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior inconsistent statement made by the witness.\u201d Conn.

A party\u2019s impeachment of a witness it calls by using the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements is improper when: (1) the primary purpose of calling the witness is to impeach the witness; and (2) the party introduces the statement in hope that the jury will use it substantively.

Id., 547-48. Indeed, in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 418, despite the fact that there was little doubt that the defendant\u2019s restraint of the victim was merely incidental to his assault of the victim, we nevertheless refused to engage in speculation, to conduct a sufficiency of the evidence analysis, or even to examine in detail the specific evidence adduced at trial, deciding instead that whether there was a separate restraint was a question better left to a properly instructed jury. See id., 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Notably, following our decision in <em>DeJesus, </em>we granted a motion for reconsideration of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseverino, </em>287 Conn. 608, 949 A.2d 1156 (2008), in which, after deciding that the facts of <em>Sansev-erino </em>implicated the rule announced in <em>Salamon, </em>we had concluded that the defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal rather than a new trial on the kidnapping charge because it seemed so apparent that the defendant\u2019s restraint had been wholly incidental to his commission of a sexual assault. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sansev-erino, </em>supra, 291 Conn. 578. Upon reconsideration, however, the court changed its approach, concluding instead that the proper remedy was to remand the case to afford the state the opportunity to retry the defendant on the kidnapping charge at which trial the jury properly would be instructed as to the rule of <em>Salamon </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>state would have the opportunity to present evidence and argue that the restraint involved was not entirely incidental to the defendant\u2019s commission of sexual assault. Id., 589-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Despite this case law, in the present case, the majority concludes that the remedy established by <em>DeJesus </em>is not implicated because, inter alia, there was \u201cno evidence presented at trial suggesting that the defendant, when he grabbed the victim\u2019s arm, was in the process of committing another crime against her to which the restraint was incidental.\u201d I disagree. The evidence did indeed disclose conduct that could constitute another crime, i.e., assault in the third degree, breach of the peace, creating a public disturbance or disorderly conduct, to which a jury reasonably could find the restraint was wholly incidental.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, I believe the incidental rule does apply and that it would be necessary for the trial court, on remand, to submit the issue to a properly instructed jury in accordance with our newly established kidnapping jurisprudence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>because there is evidence of another crime and because the evidence reasonably would support a finding that the restraint was merely incidental to the commission of that other, separate crime, the ultimate factual determination regarding the defendant\u2019s intent ultimately must be made by the jury on remand.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Salamon, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 528-48, we reconsidered our longstanding interpretation of our kidnapping statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-91 through 53a-94a, encompassing even restraints that merely were incidental to and necessary for the commission of another substantive offense, such as robbery or sexual assault. We ultimately concluded that \u201c[o]ur legislature . . . intended to exclude from the scope of the more serious crime of kidnapping and its accompanying severe penalties those confinements or movements of a victim that are merely incidental to and necessary for the commission of another crime against that victim. Stated otherwise, to commit a kidnapping in conjunction with another crime, a defendant must intend to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which is necessary to commit the other crime.\u201d Id., 542.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> In light of this conclusion, I do not address the majority\u2019s determination that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the kidnapping in the second degree statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 (a), was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. See <em>Carrano </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>279 Conn. 622, 635 n.15, 904 A.2d 149 (2006) (\u201c[t]his court has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Moore v.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinchen, </em>243 Conn. 690, 699, 707 A.2d 1255 (1998) (\u201cThere can be no doubt that [tjhe doctrine of separation of powers requires judicial respect for the independence of the prosecutor. . . . Prosecutors, therefore, have a wide latitude and broad discretion in determining when, who, why and whether to prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>cute for violations of the criminal law. . . . This broad discretion, which necessarily includes deciding which citizens should be prosecuted and for what charges they are to be held accountable . . . rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Whether the state decides to charge the defendant with these other offenses, however, is irrelevant to the analysis of the question before this court. \u201cApplying [the pertinent] standard to the facts in <em>Salamon, </em>we concluded that, although the defendant had not been charged with assault, the judgment of conviction of kidnapping in the second degree had to be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial because the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction explaining that a kidnapping conviction could not he if the restraint was merely incidental to the assault.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanseveri.no, </em>supra, 287 Conn. 624.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b809-16\"> Certainly, this evidence is no more clear-cut than the evidence in <em>Salamon </em>that we concluded required a remand.
