In support of his claim, the defendant contends that only a weapon that discharges a shot by gunpowder constitutes a firearm under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (19), which defines \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of our Penal Code as \u201cany sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or other weapon, whether loaded or unloaded from which a shot may be discharged,\u201d and that, because a BB gun does not discharge a shot by gunpowder, it is not a firearm as a matter of law. We reject this claim and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately noon on June 19, 2005, the victim, Eric Ruiz, was walking on Stratford Avenue in Bridgeport in the direction of his mother\u2019s house after visiting a convenience store on the comer of Stratford and Hollister Avenues (comer store). The defendant was walking ahead of him, in the same direction, wearing a large, black, Afro-style wig. As the victim walked past the defendant, the defendant stuck an object into the victim\u2019s back and demanded all of his money. Although the victim did not see the object that had been pressed into his back, the defendant told him that it was a gun. The defendant also told the victim that if he moved or attempted to run, he would shoot him. The defendant then directed the victim to an open car in a nearby parking lot. As they approached the car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the victim told the defendant that he had no money and that, \u201c[i]f you are going to shoot me, just do it; that\u2019s my house next door.\u201d At that moment, a group of people began walking toward the two men, which prompted the defendant to flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">After the defendant fled, the victim entered his mother\u2019s house. A short time later, while looking out the window, he noticed that the defendant had returned and was kicking the back of the car of the victim\u2019s mother. At this time, however, the defendant was not wearing a wig. The victim called the police, and, when the responding officer, Raymond Ryan, arrived soon thereafter, the victim gave him a description of the defendant. As Ryan was leaving the house of the victim\u2019s mother, a woman arrived and informed him that she had just seen the defendant standing near the comer store. Ryan immediately got into his patrol car and drove to the comer store. As he was exiting his vehicle, Ryan saw the defendant walking nearby. At that moment, another police officer arrived, and he and Ryan approached the defendant. While doing so, they observed the defendant bend down and grab his right leg. Concerned that he might be reaching for a gun, Ryan grabbed the defendant\u2019s right hand and the other officer grabbed the defendant\u2019s left hand. They then placed the defendant against a wall and patted him down. During the patdown, Ryan discovered a BB gun in the waistband of the defendant\u2019s pants, which Ryan seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The defendant then was handcuffed and placed under arrest. Before transporting him to police headquarters, however, the officers took the defendant to the victim\u2019s house, where the victim identified him as the person who had attempted to rob him. After learning that the defendant had borrowed his mother\u2019s car earlier that day, the police located the car and discovered a large, black, Afro-style wig on the front seat. Thereafter, the defendant was charged with attempt to commit robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>in the first degree, commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm, that is, the BB gun that the police had found in the defendant\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest, and carrying a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The defendant\u2019s case subsequently proceeded to trial. At trial, the state adduced testimony from Marshall Robinson, a firearms expert. According to Robinson, the weapon in the defendant\u2019s possession at the time of his arrest was an operable Marksman Repeater spring-loaded air gun designed to shoot .177 caliber steel BBs. Robinson further testified that the BB gun was capable of discharging a shot that could cause serious bodily injury. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty as charged. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of imprisonment of seventeen years. With respect to the charge of commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k, the court sentenced the defendant to a prison term of five years, to be served consecutively to the twelve year prison sentence imposed by the court for the underlying felony, namely, attempt to commit robbery in the first degree, as \u00a7 53-202k requires.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction under \u00a7 53-202k. Specifically, the defendant contends that the BB gun that the state proved that he had used in connection with his attempted robbery of the victim is not a firearm within the meaning of \u00a7 53-202k because, under the applicable definitional provision of the Penal Code, \u00a7 53a-3 (19), a gun is not a firearm unless it uses gunpowder to discharge its shot, and it is undisputed that a BB gun does not use gunpowder. We disagree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Whether a BB gun constitutes a firearm under \u00a7 53a-3 (19) presents a question of statutory interpretation over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>288 Conn. 1, 10, 950 A.2d 1247 (2008). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning [General Statutes] \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextua! evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We turn first, therefore, to the relevant statutory language. General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k provides for a mandatory, consecutive, nonsuspendible five year prison term for \u201c[a]ny person who commits any class A, B or C felony and in the commission of such felony uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of, or displays, or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses any firearm, as defined in section 53a-3 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (19), in turn, defines \u201cfirearm\u201d as \u201cany sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or other weapon, whether loaded or unloaded from which a shot may be discharged . . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 53a-3 (19) defines \u201cfirearm\u201d as a \u201cweapon . . . from which a shot may be discharged\u201d without reference to the use of gunpowder. Under the express terms of \u00a7 53a-3 (19), it therefore would appear that a gun capable of firing a shot is a firearm irrespective of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>gun discharges the shot by use of gunpowder or by some other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Recently, in <em>State </em>v. Hardy, 278 Conn. 113, 130, 896 A.2d 755 (2006), this court considered identical statutory language and arrived at that very conclusion, that is, that a \u201cweapon . . . from which a shot may be discharged\u201d includes weapons that discharge their shots without the use of gunpowder. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (19). In <em>Hardy, </em>after a trial to the court, the court found the defendant, Raymond Hardy, guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>supra, 115. Specifically, the court found that Hardy had been involved in the robbery of a taxicab driver and that a deadly weapon, namely, an air pistol, had been used in that robbery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See id., 116-17. The Appellate Court affirmed Hardy\u2019s conviction of first degree robbery; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>85 Conn. App. 708, 719, 858 A.2d 845 (2004); and we granted his petition for certification to appeal limited to two issues, one of which was whether a gun is a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6), <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which defines \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d in relevant part as \u201cany weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, from which a shot may be discharged,\u201d even if the gun does not discharge its shot by gunpowder. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>272 Conn. 906, 863 A.2d 699 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>On appeal to this court, Hardy raised the following argument in support of his claim that only guns that discharge their shots by gunpowder are deadly weapons. He reasoned, first, that, \u201cbecause all of the weapons listed as firearms in \u00a7 53a-3 (19), namely, \u2018any sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, pistol, [or] revolver,\u2019 use gunpowder as their method of discharge, under the principle of ejusdem generis,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a weapon must use gunpowder as a method of discharge to be considered a firearm.\u201d <em>State v. Hardy, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 128-29. Hardy further asserted that, because subdivisions (6) and (19) of \u00a7 53a-3 define \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d and \u201cfirearm,\u201d respectively, by use of \u201cidentical language,\u201d that is, both provisions include within their purview \u201cweapon^] . . . from which a shot may be discharged\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 128; the two provisions \u201cmust be given the same meaning in each instance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Hardy thus argued that a weapon qualifies as a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 53a-3 (6) only if it discharges its shot by gunpowder. See id., 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">We rejected the construction of \u00a7 53a-3 (6) advocated by Hardy without deciding whether a \u201cfirearm\u201d under \u00a7 53a-3 (19) must use gunpowder to discharge its shot. See id., 130-31. In doing so, we explained that \u201cthe legislature has defined deadly weapon to mean any <em>weapon </em>from which a <em>shot </em>may be discharged,\u201d and that Hardy had not claimed \u201cthat the air gun [he used during the robbery] was not a weapon or that it did not fire shots.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 120. Relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>heavily on the \u201cplain [statutory] language,\u201d we further observed that \u00a7 53a-3 (6) \u201cdoes not require that the shot be discharged by gunpowder. Rather, the statute refers to <em>any </em>weapon, whether loaded or unloaded . . . from which a shot may be discharged .... Had the legislature intended to include in its definition only those weapons that discharged by use of gunpowder, it could have done so expressly through the language of the statute.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Guided by our analysis and construction of \u00a7 53a-3 (6) in Hardy, we reach the same conclusion with respect to the meaning of \u00a7 53a-3 (19). The legislature broadly included within the scope of \u00a7 53a-3 (19) those weapons \u201cfrom which a shot may be discharged . . . As we explained in <em>Hardy </em>with reference to language defining \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 53a-3 (6) that is identical to the language of \u00a7 53a-3 (19), the legislature readily could have restricted the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in \u00a7 53a-3 (19) to those guns that use gunpowder to discharge their shots. The fact that the legislature elected not to do so is strong evidence that it did not intend to limit the term in that manner. See, e.g., <em>Stitzer </em>v. <em>Rinaldi\u2019s Restaurant, </em>211 Conn. 116, 119, 557 A.2d 1256 (1989) (legislature knows how to use limiting terms when it chooses to do so). Furthermore, although not disposi-tive of the issue, our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that, ordinarily, the same or similar language in the same statutory scheme will be given the same meaning. E.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 282, 777 A.2d 645 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>250 Conn. 188, 201, 736 A.2d 790 (1999) (\u201cin the absence of persuasive evidence to the contrary, we may presume that a word used in different parts of the same statutory scheme has the same meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>We acknowledge that the principle of ejusdem gene-ris; see footnote 12 of this opinion; provides some support for the interpretation of \u00a7 53a-3 (19) that the defendant urges us to adopt. We are not persuaded, however, that the doctrine is controlling in the present case. Although each of the guns specifically enumerated in \u00a7 53a-3 (19) uses gunpowder to discharge its shot, the statutory language at issue is expansive. As we observed in <em>Hardy, </em>moreover, that language is as plain as it is broad. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Finally, as this court previously has noted, the \u201ccommonly understood meaning of \u2018firearm,\u2019 found in [the tenth edition of] Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary ... is \u2018a weapon from which a shot is discharged <em>by gunpowder </em>. . . (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>259 Conn. 799, 809, 792 A.2d 86 (2002). It is reasonable to presume that the legislature was well aware of this commonly understood meaning of firearm when, for purposes of the Penal Code, it defined the term broadly, without reference to gunpowder, as a \u201cweapon . . . from which a shot may be discharged . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (19). \u201cEjusdem generis ... is merely an axiom of statutory construction, not an inviolate rule of law; and, like all such axioms, it provides a guideline to legislative meaning, but it cannot displace the result of careful and thoughtful interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 703 n.34, 855 A.2d 212 (2004). That process of interpretation leads us to conclude that a BB gun does not fall outside the definitional purview of \u00a7 53a-3 (19) merely because it operates without gunpowder. Accordingly, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim that the evidence adduced by the state was insufficient to establish that the BB gun he used in connection with his attempted robbery of the victim was a firearm for purposes of \u00a7 53a-3 (19) and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>it therefore was insufficient to support his conviction under \u00a7 53-202k.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k provides: \u201cAny person who commits any class A, B or C felony and in the commission of such felony uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of, or displays, or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses any firearm, as defined in section 53a-3, except an assault weapon, as defined in section 53-202a, shall be imprisoned for a term of five years, which shall not be suspended or reduced and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for conviction of such felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\"> We note that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 698 A.2d 297 (1997), this court concluded that \u201c\u00a7 53-202k is a sentence enhancement provision and not a separate crime.\u201d Id., 150. In the present case, both the state and the defendant, in their briefs to this court, refer to the defendant\u2019s \u201cconviction\u201d under \u00a7 53-202k or the fact that the defendant was \u201cconvicted\u201d under \u00a7 53-202k. In the interest of consistency, we refer to the finding of the jury with respect to the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 53-202k as a \u201cconviction,\u201d albeit with the recognition that it is not a separate crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...
