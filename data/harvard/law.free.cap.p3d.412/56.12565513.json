We also consider whether attorneys litigating pro se and/or on behalf of their law firms can recover attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We conclude that an attorney is not an \"agent\" under NRS 116.31183 for claims of retaliatory action where the attorney is providing legal services for a common-interest community homeowners' association. We further conclude that attorneys litigating pro se and/or on behalf of their law firms cannot recover fees because those fees were not actually incurred by the attorney or the law firm. However, we conclude that attorneys litigating pro se and/or on behalf of their law firms can recover taxable costs in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants David and Rochelle Dezzani own a condominium in Incline Village, Nevada. Like all unit owners, the Dezzanis are members of the McCloud Condominium Homeowners' Association (HOA), which is governed by a board of directors and subject to the Revised Declaration of Limitations, Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions of McCloud Condominium Homeowners' Association (CC&amp;Rs). Respondents Gayle Kern, a Nevada attorney, and her law firm, Kern &amp; Associates (collectively, Kern), represent the HOA and provide legal advice to its governing board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2013, a dispute arose between the Dezzanis and the HOA regarding an extended deck on the Dezzanis' unit: The previous unit owner installed the deck extension with board approval in 2002. The board issued the Dezzanis a notice of violation (NOV) with drafting assistance from Kern informing the Dezzanis that the deck encroached into the common area and thus violated the CC&amp;Rs. The NOV indicated that the Dezzanis had two choices: (1) submit an architectural application to the board to revert the deck back to its original size; or (2) execute a covenant for the deck extension, which would allow it to remain for the Dezzanis' ownership and one subsequent conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the Dezzanis responded to the NOV, Kern sent the Dezzanis a letter stating that she represented the HOA and restating the board's position on the deck extension. Kern and the Dezzanis exchanged several letters wherein Kern communicated the board's position regarding the deck and the Dezzanis challenged the NOV and criticized Kern's legal advice, understanding of Nevada law, and competency. The board held a hearing and ultimately upheld the NOV. Throughout this time, Kern advised the HOA regarding the Dezzanis' and other members' deck extensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Dezzanis filed a complaint against Kern and board member Karen Higgins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged retaliation based on NRS 116.31183. This statute allows a unit owner to \"bring a separate action\" for compensatory damages, attorney fees, and costs. NRS 116.31183(2)(a), (b). Such an action is permissible when \"[a]n executive board, a member of an executive board, a community manager or an officer, employee or agent of an association\" takes\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   retaliatory action against a unit's owner because the unit's owner has:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (a) Complained in good faith about any alleged violation of [NRS Chapter 116] or the governing documents of the association;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b) Recommended the selection or replacement of an attorney, community manager or vendor; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (c) Requested in good faith to review the books, records or other papers of the association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   NRS 116.31183(1). The Dezzanis alleged that Kern retaliated against them because they requested that the HOA retain a new attorney; however, the Dezzanis did not specify how Kern retaliated against them other than furnishing advice to the HOA and communicating with the Dezzanis on behalf of the HOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court granted Kern's NRCP 12(b)(5) motion to dismiss with prejudice after finding that NRS 116.31183 does not permit attorneys to be held personally liable for action taken on behalf of a client, and that \"to permit such causes of action against Kern would result in a chilling effect on individuals' ability to hire and retain counsel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court awarded fees and costs to Kern pursuant to NRS 18.010(2)(b) and NRCP 11, finding that the Dezzanis' claims were intended to harass Kern because Kern informed the Dezzanis that their claims were meritless. The Dezzanis appealed both orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Dezzanis' appeals were consolidated and assigned to the Court of Appeals, where that court affirmed the order dismissing the complaint and reversed the attorney fees and costs award because the Dezzanis failed to submit their claim to mediation under NRS 38.310(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dezzani v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Kern &amp; Assocs.,\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 69410 &amp; 69896 (Order Affirming in Part and Reversing in Part, Nev.

Kern points to NRS 116.31164, which governs foreclosure of liens, and argues that because NRS 116.31164 uses the words \"agent\" and \"attorney\" distinctly, it demonstrates that the Legislature purposefully distinguished an attorney from an agent under NRS Chapter 116. Therefore, Kern contends that the Legislature specifically omitted attorneys from NRS 116.31183, and the term \"agent\" does not include attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree. NRS 116.31164(4) states that a foreclosure sale can be \"conducted by the association, its agent\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   attorney.\" (Emphasis added.)

The dissent concludes that the lack of a comma separating the words \"agent\" and \"attorney\" in NRS 116.31164(4) is sufficient to demonstrate that the Legislature intended the phrase \"agent or attorney\" to mean that \"an attorney is merely a subset or an example of an agent, as opposed to not-an-agent.\" Dissenting opinion\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 66.

But this interpretation is contrary to the plain language of NRS Chapter 116 and overlooks the Legislature's distinct use of the term \"agent\" when intending to address matters concerning agents and not attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   NRS 116.3107(1) (requiring unit owners to allow \"agents\" to pass through their units in order for the association to uphold its duty to maintain the common elements);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   NRS 116.31073(3)(a) (allowing \"[t]he association, the members of its executive board and its officers, employees, agents and community manager\" to enter a unit to repair a security wall). Thus, such a broad interpretation of the word \"agent\" does not comport with the statutory framework as a whole. Accordingly, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to include attorneys in the term \"agent\" for purposes of NRS 116.31183. Public policy does not support including attorneys as agents under NRS 116.31183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Notwithstanding the statutory language and interpretation, the Dezzanis ask us to conclude as a matter of public policy that attorneys are included in the term \"agent\" in NRS 116.31183. Based on the unique characteristics of an attorney-client relationship that distinguish it from a general agent-principal relationship, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"agent\" as \"[s]omeone who is authorized to act for or in place of another; a representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Agent, Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014).

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Adams v.

In resolving the issue, we noted that the respondent's lawyer's \"abandonment of his client and his professional obligations to his client ... alone ... might not warrant relief, as the lawyer is the client's agent and the acts and omissions of an agent ordinarily return to the principal who hired the faithless agent, not those who dealt with the agent in his representative capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20P.3d%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in a case where the lawyer fraudulently entered into a settlement agreement on behalf of his clients without authority, we concluded that the clients were not bound to the agreement because the lawyer's fraud negated his authority as an agent.\n   <em>\n    NC-DSH, Inc. v.

Doing so, and imposing liability on an attorney for representing his or her HOA client, would impermissibly intrude on the attorney-client relationship and interfere with an HOA's ability to retain an attorney and the attorney's ability to ethically represent the HOA.

Additionally, given the unique characteristics of the attorney-client relationship that distinguish the attorney-client relationship from a general agent-principal relationship, we agree with Kern that the two relationships should not be treated the same in NRS 116.31183. Thus, because an attorney who is providing legal services and acting on behalf of a common-interest community homeowners' association is not an \"agent\" of the association for purposes of NRS 116.31183, there can be no cause of action against that attorney pursuant to NRS 116.31183 and the district court did not err when it dismissed the Dezzanis' action against Kern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    The district court erred in awarding Kern attorney fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Dezzanis also challenge the district court's award of attorney fees to Kern for the services she performed on behalf of herself and her firm.

An attorney is, by definition, the \"agent\" of the client he or she represents. Since NRS 116.31183 applies to an HOA's agent-and makes no exception for attorney-agents-I cannot agree with the majority's decision to dismiss the homeowners' wrongful retaliation complaint against the HOA board's attorney\n   <em>\n    with prejudice\n   </em>\n   . This decision effectively exempts attorneys from NRS 116.31183, granting them an absolute immunity from suit that neither the statute's text nor the common law supports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To recover compensatory damages for violation of NRS 116.31183, a homeowner must establish a compensable injury, i.e., that the retaliation was wrongful and caused harm. Here, the wrongfulness of the retaliation alleged substantially depends on the covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) and whether they justified the measures the HOA's attorney pursued against the homeowners. As the court of appeals correctly held, NRS 38.310's mandatory mediation requirements therefore apply. Under NRS 38.310, this case should have been dismissed\n   <em>\n    without prejudice,\n   </em>\n   pending mediation. If mediation failed, the district court would then have to decide whether wrongful retaliation occurred. This is a merits-based determination, not a matter of absolute immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The district court decided this case on an NRCP 12(b)(5) motion to dismiss.

As support, the majority relies first on NRS 116.31164(4), then on public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The statute the majority relies on for the proposition attorneys are not agents, NRS 116.31164(4), concerns HOA lien foreclosure sales. It provides that an HOA foreclosure sale \"may be conducted by the association,\n   <em>\n    its agent or attorney,\n   </em>\n   or a title insurance company or escrow agent licensed to do business in this state.\" (Emphasis added.) To the majority, NRS 116.31164(4)'s use of the word \"or\" between \"agent\" and \"attorney\" signifies that, for purposes of all of NRS Chapter 116. the Legislature has redefined \"agent\" to exclude \"attorneys.\" Majority opinion\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 59 (accepting Kern's argument that \"because NRS 116.31164 uses the words 'agent' and 'attorney' distinctly, it demonstrates that the Legislature purposefully distinguished an attorney from an agent under NRS Chapter 116\"). Continuing, the majority credits Kern's position that the Legislature should be seen as having \"specifically omitted attorneys from NRS 116.31183\"-though it did no such thing-so that, for purposes of NRS Chapter 116. \"the term 'agent' does not include attorneys.\" Majority opinion\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Respectfully, this reads more into the word \"or\" than it can support. Doubtless, an \"or\" preceded by a comma can indicate a disjunctive, such that two words that are separated by an \"or\" have two alternative definitions. But an \"or\" is not always disjunctive, and \"it is important not to read the word 'or' too strictly where to do so would render the language of the statute dubious.\" 1A Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer,\n   <em>\n    Sutherland Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 21.14 (7th ed. 2009). As shown above, \"attorney\" is universally understood to mean \"agent.\" To read the \"or\" in NRS 116.31164(4) as redefining \"attorney\" for purposes of NRS Chapter 116 to mean not-an-agent renders the language of the statute \"dubious\" indeed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934939\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/242/470/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Also, NRS 116.31164(4) refers to an association or \"its agent or attorney\" and not \"its\n   agent, or attorney.\" The lack of a comma suggests that, in this context, an attorney is merely a subset or an example of an agent, as opposed to not-an-agent.\n   <em>\n    See Sutherland Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction\n   </em>\n   , at \u00a7 21.15 (\"A comma should always separate each member of a class.\"). The phrase that follows \"agent or attorney\" in NRS 116.31164(4) -\"a title insurance company or escrow agent\"-reinforces this reading, as a \"title insurance company\" can serve as an \"escrow agent,\" and those terms, too, are joined by \"or\" in NRS 116.31164(4), with no comma separating them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The true basis for the majority's decision to exempt attorneys from NRS 116.31183 seems policy-driven, not textual. It is the majority's view that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ... imposing liability on an attorney for representing his or her HOA client [ ] would impermissibly intrude on the attorney-client relationship and interfere with an HOA's ability to retain an attorney and the attorney's ability to ethically represent the HOA [so, we] conclude that the term \"agent\" in NRS 116.31183 does not include an attorney who is providing legal services to, and acting on behalf of, a[n HOA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Majority opinion\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 62;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3934939\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/242/470/#p485\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 61-62 (citing and quoting from\n   <em>\n    Greenberg Traurig v.

And so it is that lawyers and law firms representing clients have been held liable under the federal securities, RICO, and civil rights statutes, as well as certain federal and state consumer protection statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 56 cmts. i &amp; j.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Legislature rationally could have exempted attorneys from NRS 116.31183, for the policy reasons the majority identifies. But it did not. Instead, it passed a statute prohibiting retaliation against homeowners who complain about, among other things, an HOA's attorney and imposing civil liability on HOAs and agents of HOAs who engage in prohibited conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The legislative history behind NRS 116.31183 is sparse but what there is confirms that NRS 116.31183 and its companion statute, NRS 116.31184, apply to attorneys equally with any other HOA agent. Thus, in 2009, the Legislature amended NRS 116.31183 to add subparagraph (1)(b), prohibiting retaliation against a homeowner who seeks to have the HOA's attorney replaced, S.B. 182, 75th Leg. (Nev. 2009), and the remedial provisions codified in subparagraph (2), A.B. 350, 75th Leg. (Nev. 2009). Among the concerns expressed by S.B. 182's sponsor, Senator Mike Schneider, were the \"immensely chilling effect\" HOA attorney retaliation against homeowners can have-and an FBI report suggesting that \"such conduct may also be another means to perpetuate [the] self-dealing between corrupt managers\n   <em>\n    and attorneys\n   </em>\n   \" that befell Nevada homeowners in the years preceding the amendment. Hearing on S.B. 182 Before the Senate Judiciary Comm., Exhibit D 8-9, 75th Leg. (Nev., March 18, 2009) (emphasis added). And in 2013, the Legislature added NRS 116.31184, which makes it a misdemeanor to \"threaten, harass or otherwise engage in a course of conduct against,\" inter alia, unit owners or their guests, so as to cause them \"harm or serious emotional distress\" or to create \"a hostile environment for [such] person.\" 2013 Nev. Stat., ch. 437, \u00a7 1. Like NRS 116.31183, NRS 116.31184 applies to, among others, \"an officer, employee or agent of an association,\" without exception for attorneys. The majority's interpretation of NRS 116.31183 would necessarily immunize HOA attorneys from NRS 116.31184 as well as NRS 116.31183, which is, I submit, unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority also holds that NRS 38.310 does not apply \"because the question before this court involves an interpretation of NRS 116.31183, not an interpretation of the HOA's CC&amp;Rs.\" Majority opinion\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 59, n.3. Again, I disagree. In my view, a homeowner does not have a claim for compensatory damages for violation of NRS 116.31183 unless the retaliation was wrongful and caused improper harm. It is in this context that the policy concerns that lead the majority to confer absolute immunity on Kern apply, for I interpret NRS 116.31183 to say that if all Kern did was fairly demand that the Dezzanis comply with the CC&amp;Rs, wrongful retaliation did not occur.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKnight Family, LLP v. Adept Mgmt. Servs., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412260\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/129/610/#p615\">\n    129 Nev. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412260\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/129/610/#p615\">\n    310 P.3d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (2013) (recognizing contractual nature of CC&amp;Rs),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 57 (\"[A] lawyer who ... assists a client to ... break a contract ... is not liable to a nonclient for interference with contract ... if the lawyer acts to advance the client's objectives without using wrongful means.\"). Determining whether wrongful retaliation occurred requires interpreting portions of the CC&amp;Rs that relate to the dispute between the Dezzanis and the HOA regarding the extended deck on the Dezzanis' unit, including but not limited to the Dezzanis' obligations by virtue of purchasing the unit,\n   the HOA's enforcement rights, and CC&amp;R-based dispute-resolution requirements. Since the Dezzanis' claims call for interpretation of the CC&amp;Rs, by law they must proceed to mediation before going to court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamm v.

Whatever the Dezzanis' prospects for success on the merits, this case has significance beyond the parties because of the principles of statutory interpretation and attorney immunity involved. The Legislature sets policy and writes statutes that the courts in turn must enforce as written, unless the statutes are constitutionally infirm. As NRS 116.31183 applies to HOA agents, without exception for attorneys, and attorneys do not enjoy blanket immunity from suit outside the litigation context, the Dezzanis' complaint should not have been dismissed with prejudice at this stage of the proceedings. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
