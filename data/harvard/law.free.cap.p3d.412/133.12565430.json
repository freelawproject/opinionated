J. pro tempore\n  This is an appeal from a trial court judgment dismissing plaintiffs' complaint under ORCP 21 A(8) for failure to allege facts sufficient to state claims for relief. Plaintiffs Kerry and Scott Tomlinson (the parents) and their son, T, brought separate negligence claims against defendants Mary K. Wagner, MD, Metropolitan Pediatrics, LLC, and Legacy Emanuel Hospital &amp; Health Center. In their respective claims, the parents and T alleged that defendants provided medical services to the parents' older son, M, failed to timely diagnose M's genetic disorder, and failed to inform the parents of that disorder.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  In addition, the parents and T each alleged that \"[the parents] relied on the defendants, and each of them, to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence on their behalf\" and that \"defendants had an ongoing duty to properly diagnose [M's] condition from November 16, 2004 until the diagnosis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy [DMD] was finally made in October 2010.\" The parents and T further alleged that, \"[h]ad defendants, and each of them, timely diagnosed [M's] DMD, [the parents] would not have produced another child suffering from [DMD].\" The parents and T each alleged that defendants' negligence caused them to suffer economic and noneconomic damages.\n </history>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court entered a judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that neither the parents nor T were patients of defendants and, therefore, the court reasoned, defendants owed no obligation of professional care toward them. The Court of Appeals reversed that judgment as to the parents but affirmed as to T. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, and we reverse in part and affirm in part the trial court judgment dismissing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In reviewing a judgment dismissing a complaint under ORCP 21 A(8), we assume the truth of all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in favor of plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Deckard v. Bunch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802533\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/754/#p757\">\n    358 Or. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 757,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802533\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/358/754/#p757\">\n    370 P.3d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). We\n   set out the pertinent allegations in the complaint in accordance with that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parents' son, M, was born in 2003. The parents took M to defendants for patient care in November 2004 after he began exhibiting developmental abnormalities. Over the course of many visits, defendants \"undertook to assess the cause of [M]'s developmental abnormalit[ies],\" but failed to do so. While still not knowing the cause of M's continuing developmental abnormalities, the parents conceived another child in early 2008. That child, T, a son, was born in November 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2010, the cause of M's developmental abnormalities was diagnosed as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). According to the complaint, DMD is an inheritable genetic disorder with severe and progressively debilitating symptoms, including muscle weakness and wasting, loss of the ability to walk (usually by age 12), progressive paralysis, and premature death. Those symptoms typically affect only males with the defective gene. Females with the defective gene are typically only carriers who do not show symptoms of DMD. If a couple has a child with DMD, then there is a fifty-percent chance that other male children born to that couple will also have DMD. After M's diagnosis, T also was diagnosed with DMD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their respective claims, the parents and T alleged that defendants negligently failed to perform appropriate diagnostic testing for the symptoms that M was presenting and, therefore, failed to timely diagnose M with DMD. According to the parents and T, because defendants failed to timely diagnose M, defendants failed to timely inform the parents of the reproductive risks resulting from M's diagnosis. As noted, the parents and T alleged that if defendants had \"timely diagnosed [M]'s DMD, [the parents] would not have produced another child suffering from [DMD].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parents and T further alleged that, as a result of defendants' negligence, they have suffered significant financial and emotional burdens. Specifically, the parents sought economic damages for the cost of T's medical care, education, and other support that they have already incurred and expect to incur until he reaches adulthood. They also sought\n   noneconomic damages for emotional distress. T separately sought economic damages for his medical care and support in adulthood and for his lost future earning capacity. Like the parents, T also claimed noneconomic damages for emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the trial court, defendants moved to dismiss both claims under ORCP 21 A(8). Defendants asserted numerous reasons for dismissal. As noted, the trial court granted the motion on the ground that neither the parents nor T alleged that they had been patients of defendants. In an initial letter opinion, the trial court characterized the complaint as asserting medical negligence claims and explained that, \"to survive dismissal, a complaint must include an allegation of a professional relationship between a physician and patient in a medical negligence case.\" Because the parents and T had conceded that only the parents' first-born son, M, had been defendants' patient, the trial court therefore dismissed both claims. The court also ruled that T's claim was not actionable because \"there is no yardstick by which to measure his damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a subsequent letter opinion, the trial court clarified that its dismissal of T's claim was based on the premise that Oregon law does not recognize a claim by a child asserting that he or she never should have been born. The court explained that it was dismissing the parents' claim because, unlike similar claims recognized in other jurisdictions, the complaint in this case did not allege that \"the parents [were] treated with, or relied upon, the advice of [defendants] in deciding whether to conceive a second child.\" The trial court further ruled that, even if the parents had alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for relief, such a claim could not include noneconomic damages for emotional distress, because \"[n]o physical impact or duty to plaintiffs to avoid emotional harm has been alleged.\" Based on those rulings, the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the dismissal of T's claim but reversed the dismissal of the parents' claim, including the dismissal of their request for noneconomic damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson v. Metropolitan Pediatrics, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    275 Or.

In its analysis, the Court of Appeals first addressed whether the trial court properly had dismissed the parents' and T's claims for failing to allege a physician-patient relationship. The Court of Appeals framed the issue as being whether \"a plaintiff is categorically precluded from stating a negligence claim against a physician where the professional standard of care owed to a patient requires the physician to exercise care on behalf of nonpatients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 673,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court's ruling on that issue, holding that \"the absence of a physician-patient relationship [does] not preclude nonpatients from recovering in negligence against the physician.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court of Appeals then addressed issues specific to the parents' claim. As relevant to our review, the Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court's conclusion that \"there are no allegations of treatment, consultation, or reproductive or genetic counseling or screening involving the [parents]. Further, there are no allegations of affirmative misdiagnoses or representations on which the [parents] relied in deciding to conceive another child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n. 10. The court opined, however, that those omissions were not critical: \"[W]here defendants negligently failed to diagnose [M] and failed to inform [the parents] of his genetic condition and [the parents'] reproductive risks, [the parents'] failure to allege that they inquired as to whether [M] might have a genetic condition so as to obtain some affirmative representation from defendants is not dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals held that it was sufficient to allege that defendants \"fail [ed] to diagnose the congenital or hereditary nature of [an older child's] ailment before the parents unknowingly conceived and bore a second child suffering from the same genetic condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court of Appeals next addressed whether the parents sufficiently had alleged a basis to recover noneconomic damages for emotional distress. The court noted that, in the absence of a physical impact, \"a plaintiff may recover for purely psychic injury 'where the defendant's conduct infringed on some legally protected interest apart from causing the claimed distress[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hammond v.

But the court accepted the parents' contention that they had a legally protected interest in controlling their reproductive choices, the violation of which is actionable in a negligence claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that \"a relationship of reliance\" could be established based on \"the limited circumstances alleged here-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , circumstances in which a medical provider, under the operative standard of care, is obligated to inform the biological parents that their child (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the provider's patient) suffers from a genetic condition and to advise them as to the reproductive consequences of such a diagnosis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Court of Appeals held that the parents' relationship with defendants \"gave rise to a duty to avoid infringing on the [parents]' interest in making informed reproductive choices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Further, the Court of Appeals concluded that such an interest is sufficient to support recovery for emotional injuries resulting from negligent conduct. According to the Court of Appeals, \"there can be little doubt that informing parents of their child's genetic condition so that they can make informed reproductive decisions is an obligation imposed to avoid the severe emotional distress that is the direct consequence of its infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals viewed the parents' interest in making informed reproductive choices as implicating fundamental issues of personal autonomy, the violation of which \"may be thought of as the deprivation of moral initiative and ethical choice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 686-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Thus, the Court of Appeals held that the parents' allegations were sufficient to support the recovery of noneconomic damages for emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, the Court of Appeals noted that one defendant had \"moved to dismiss the [parents]' negligence claim on the ground that, because they could not recover noneconomic damages for emotional distress, their claim reduced to one of purely economic losses that are generally not recoverable in a negligence action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 687 n. 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court rejected that argument \"[f]or the same reasons that the trial\n   court erred in dismissing the [parents]' negligence claim on the ground that their allegations pertaining to noneconomic damages were legally\n   insufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court had erred in dismissing the parents' negligence claim against defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Turning to T's claim, the Court of Appeals explained that \"[T] alleges that, but for defendants' negligence, he would never have been born. Thus, [T]' s alleged injury is life itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794063\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/275/658/\">\n    366 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In adopting that view, the court rejected T's argument that his injury was the impairment that accompanies his life rather than his life itself. The court further concluded that, even if such impairment could be an injury, T had failed to state a negligence claim against defendants because T had not alleged legally cognizable damages. According to the Court of Appeals, calculating T's alleged damages would be an impossibility:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   \"As applied to [T]'s claim, a trier of fact would be required to compare the value of nonexistence-the state that [T] would have been in but for defendants' alleged negligence-and the value of his life with DMD.

The Court of Appeals therefore affirmed the part of the judgment dismissing T's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In sum, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the parents on their claim and in favor of defendants on T's claim. Both T and defendants petitioned for review of the Court of Appeals' rulings that were adverse to their respective positions. This court allowed both petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As discussed, in reviewing the trial court's ruling dismissing plaintiffs' complaint under ORCP 21 A(8), we \"assess[ ] the legal effect\" of the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those allegations.\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

The primary dispute in this case is narrow.

When a physician holds herself out as such and undertakes to provide medical services, the physician represents having a certain level of medical skill and competence, often in a particular medical discipline. In doing so, the physician invites a patient (or others acting to advance the patient's interests) to rely on the physician to provide the patient with the level of care that a reasonably prudent, careful, and skillful practitioner of the physician's discipline would have provided to the patient under the same or similar circumstances and within the same community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creasey v.

In such circumstances, the professional's relationship with a client not only gives rise to an obligation to protect the interests of the client, but it also can give rise to an obligation to protect the interests of a third party. The facts of particular cases will determine what interests and what third parties receive such protection.

We do not attempt to identify all possible factors that could be relevant in considering whether to recognize such a claim. But, as explained in\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   , an important consideration is whether the relationship between the parties is a type of relationship that generally entails a mutual expectation of service and reliance.

And, as in other circumstances involving liability for economic and emotional injuries, we have considered whether the potential plaintiffs were identifiable to the defendant or otherwise\n   could be defined as a class that avoids indeterminate liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n    360 Or. at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n    385 P.3d 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Emotional distress, like economic loss, ripples throughout society as a foreseeable result of negligent conduct. Without some limiting principle in addition to foreseeability, permitting recovery for emotional injuries would create indeterminate and potentially unlimited liability.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With those considerations in mind, we examine the parents' factual allegations. The parents alleged that defendants undertook to diagnose M's symptoms that, according to the parents, presented the potential of a genetic disorder. As M's legal guardians, the parents alleged that they expected to receive information from defendants about M's diagnosis. And as M's biological parents, the parents alleged that M's diagnosis potentially implicated their own genetic risks. Further, the parents alleged that they relied on defendants to exercise their professional skill and ability to diagnose M's symptoms and would not have conceived and born T if they had known of M's genetic disorder, a condition that they allege a physician of reasonable skill and ability would have diagnosed soon enough to avoid T's conception and birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We conclude that those factual allegations are sufficient, if proved, to establish that, in addition to their obligation to protect M's interests, defendants had a limited obligation to protect the parents' interests as well. Defendants' undertaking to provide medical care to M subjected them to a standard of care requiring the exercise of reasonable professional skill and care. Under the facts alleged, that standard required defendants to reasonably perform specific tasks: diagnose M's genetic disorder and communicate that diagnosis to the parents. The parents' relationship with defendants arose within the context of defendants' undertaking and the parents' status as M's biological parents and primary caregivers. We hold that, under the facts alleged in this case, such a relationship gives rise to legal protection. By failing to reasonably diagnose M's genetic disorder and communicate that diagnosis to the parents, defendants failed to reasonably protect M's interests in receiving medical care and failed to reasonably protect the parents' separate interests in avoiding the reproductive risks associated with their own genetic composition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nonpatients, including biological parents who are legal guardians and who are already in communication with a physician about their child's medical condition, reasonably may expect to receive warnings about potential risks to them that are germane to the physician's medical diagnosis of the child.

As alleged in the complaint, T was born and was born with DMD as a result of defendants' conduct. The question remains, however, whether being born and being born with DMD constitutes harm that defendants caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Central to determining causation of harm is a comparison between what actually happened and what would have happened if the defendant had not engaged in the allegedly negligent conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dobbs\n   <em>\n    et al\n   </em>\n   , 1\n   <em>\n    Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 187 at 626 (\"The but-for test of causation can be applied only by comparing what happened with a hypothetical alternative.\");\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third)\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26 (explaining\n   that \"[c]onduct is a factual cause of harm when the harm would not have occurred absent the conduct\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   T contends that he can establish that defendants' conduct caused him harm without comparing the value of life to the value of nonexistence. According to T, the harm that defendants caused him is analogous to a prenatal injury to a fetus, which requires no comparison to nonexistence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In the case of a prenatal injury resulting in disability, the plaintiff can establish harm based on a comparison between his or her life with the disability and his or her life without the disability, because the defendant actually caused the alleged disability. As a result, establishing harm from a prenatal injury does not require comparing life to nonexistence. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Mallison v. Pomeroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2430327\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/205/690/\">\n    205 Or. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2430327\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/205/690/\">\n    291 P.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955), a defendant negligently caused a traffic accident that resulted in the plaintiff being born with a disability. In that case, but for the defendant's negligence,\n   the plaintiff would have been born without the disability. The defendant, therefore, caused the plaintiff harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   T's claim, however, is not analogous to a prenatal injury. It is true that, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mallison\n   </em>\n   , T has alleged that defendants' negligence caused him to be born with a disability. But unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mallison\n   </em>\n   , T has not alleged that, but for defendants' negligence, T would have been born without the disability. Instead, as noted above, T has alleged that, \"[h]ad defendants, and each of them, timely diagnosed [M's] DMD, [the parents] would not have produced another child suffering from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.\" In short, as alleged, the alternatives for T were that he would be conceived and born with DMD or that he would not be conceived and born at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The comparison is not avoided merely because T has alleged that defendants caused him economic and emotional burdens. The role of nonexistence in that analysis is different depending on whether the damages that T seeks are deemed to be components of damages resulting from a physical injury or whether those burdens themselves constitute economic and emotional injuries. That distinction is highlighted by T's analogy to prenatal injuries. For a plaintiff who suffers a permanent impairment resulting from a prenatal injury, the impairment is a physical injury, and the financial and emotional burdens resulting from living with that impairment are components of damages needed to compensate for the physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   T alleges that, as a result of defendants' negligence, his parents \"unknowingly conceived and bore a child with a severe genetic defect,\" and that \"[T] was born with \"Duchenne's muscular dystrophy [.]\" It would be incorrect to describe such a harm as a \"physical\" injury. A physical injury makes a person physically worse off than he or she would have been otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See Restatement (Third)\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4 comment c (\"[A]ny detrimental change in the physical condition of a person's body or property counts as a harmful impairment[.]\"). A defendant therefore causes a plaintiff to suffer a physical injury when the defendant causes the plaintiff to be physically worse off than he or she otherwise would have been. But, as alleged here, T would have\n   had no physical state of being but for defendants' conduct, because the parents would have either not conceived T or would have terminated the pregnancy. Absent the possibility of some kind of\n   <em>\n    in utero\n   </em>\n   genetic therapy, which is not alleged, the only way that the parents could have conceived and born a child without DMD was if the parents had conceived and born a child who was not T. As a result, based on the facts that T alleges, defendants could not have caused T a physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Describing T's argument as asserting economic and emotional injuries presents a different dilemma. On the one hand, we could analyze those alleged harms the same way that we analyzed the contention that T suffered a physical injury. Under that analysis, it would be incorrect to say that defendants' conduct made T's economic and emotional well-being worse off because, but for defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   negligence, T would have had\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   economic or emotional well-being to begin with. In that sense, T's claim would fail because he could not allege and prove that he suffered any economic or emotional harm as a result of defendants' conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On the other hand, we could analyze T's economic and emotional burdens as injuries that, but for defendants' alleged negligence, T would not have suffered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that analysis, the comparison needed to establish that defendants caused T harm would not depend on a comparison between T's life with a disability and T's life without a disability, as in the example of the prenatal injury. Instead, the harm would be established by comparing the economic and emotional burdens that T will experience in his life with DMD to the complete lack of economic and emotional burdens experienced by a person who is never born in the first place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Using that comparison to establish harm creates a problem for T. Framing T's argument in that way does not\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   a comparison between life and nonexistence, as T contends. Instead, it\n   <em>\n    enables\n   </em>\n   a comparison between life and nonexistence by asserting at least a partial conception of what nonexistence is like-namely, a state of being in which one experiences no economic or emotional burdens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Nevertheless, we need not decide whether T can establish cognizable harm by comparing the economic and emotional burdens that he will experience in his life to the complete lack of economic and emotional burdens experienced by a person who is never born. Even if that comparison were sufficient to establish economic and emotional harms, T would then have to establish that his economic and emotional harms constitute the impairment of a legally protected interest that defendants were obligated to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \"Not all negligently inflicted harms give rise to a negligence claim.

As explained earlier, without a cognizable justification for legal protection, negligence law generally does not require a person to affirmatively protect others from physical and nonphysical harm and generally does not require a person to avoid causing injury to the economic and emotional interests of others. Instead, recognizing a third-party professional negligence claim for T requires that we identify T's interest in avoiding defendants' negligence and then determine whether that interest is subject to legal protection, which is the same threshold issue that we considered with respect to the parents' third-party professional negligence claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although we have concluded, under the facts alleged, that defendants could be required to affirmatively protect the parents' economic and emotional interests, it does not necessarily follow that defendants were required to affirmatively protect T's interests. We have recognized the\n   parents' claim because of their relationship to defendants and the identifiable interest that the parents had in making informed reproductive choices. T, however, did not have the same relationship to defendants and his interests are distinct from the parents' interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In attempting to identify T's interest in avoiding defendants' negligence, the parties offer competing definitions of the interest at\n   stake. T defines his interest narrowly as a right to avoid the economic and emotional burdens of living with DMD, and he resists defendants' efforts to define his interest more broadly as a right not to be born or a right to remain in a state of nonexistence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We agree with defendants that, based on T's allegations, the only way for T to avoid the economic and emotional burdens of living with DMD was to avoid being born in the first place. In other words, the specific manner in which T proposes that he should have avoided the economic and emotional burdens of living with DMD is by not being born. For T, avoiding life and avoiding the economic and emotional burdens of living with DMD are factually inseparable. Thus, protecting any interest that T could have in avoiding the economic and emotional burdens of living with DMD would result in T not being born at all. If T had no interest in avoiding life, then he had no interest in avoiding the economic and emotional burdens of living with DMD. Because, for T, avoiding life with DMD and avoiding life at all are coextensive, it is more accurate to define T's interest as an interest in avoiding life. That is, of course, the same as saying that defendants infringed T's interest in remaining in a state of nonexistence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In assessing whether T can state a third-party professional negligence claim based on an interest in avoiding life, we consider, among other factors, whether, and to what extent, recognizing such a claim would interfere with or impair the obligations that the defendants owe to others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   362 Or. at 446.

We do not share that view. As explained earlier, without a further justification for legal protection, negligence law generally does not require a person to avoid causing injury to the economic and emotional interests of others.

According to the dissent, \"Although T's parents allege, as a fact, that defendants' negligence caused the loss of their reproductive choice, they do not seek a remedy for that loss in and of itself. Rather, they seek the same thing that T seeks-a remedy for the consequences of that loss.\" 362 Or. at 479, 412 P.3d at 161 (Walters, J., dissenting).

However, the determination whether (as the Connecticut court assumed) a parental privilege exists in such circumstances necessarily implicates the question whether the parents' right to exercise reproductive choice effectively overrides any interest of the child in being born free of disability. Merely to state the question highlights the inherent tension between the interests of a preconceived child at risk for disability and parents who exercise reproductive choice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The allegations in T's claim reveal-but do not purport to contend with, let alone resolve-the differences in perspective between the interests of the parents and the interests of T in relation to the decisions to conceive and bear him. Plaintiffs' failure to acknowledge and provide a coherent way to harmonize those differences counsels against recognition of a claim that ultimately depends on the parents' informed decision as being sufficient to protect the interests of T in the circumstances alleged here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Beyond those differences in perspective between the parents' interests and the interests of T under the facts alleged in T's claim, a fundamental conceptual difficulty lies in determining whether a preconceived child has an interest in remaining in a state of nonexistence. That is a different endeavor from determining what interests a child would have\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    he or she is conceived and born. For example, once conceived and born, a child has an interest in avoiding physical\n    injury, even if the injury is caused by conduct that occurred before the child was conceived and born. T's claim, however, depends on the premise that a preconceived child has an interest in avoiding conception and birth in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Determining whether a preconceived child has an interest in not being born, and the extent to which that interest is potentially inconsistent with the parents' interest in reproductive choice, directly raises the issue of nonexistence. Would a preconceived child want to be born even if doing so entailed the risk of a genetic disorder? Would it depend on the degree of risk? Is it possible that a preconceived child\n    would want to be born even if a genetic disorder were a certainty? Or would a preconceived child prefer not to be born even if there were no chance of a genetic disorder? Answering those questions requires the comparison that T's argument attempts to avoid-the comparison between life and nonexistence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    It is insufficient to answer that a wrongful life claim does not necessarily make any statement about the value that a preconceived child places on life itself, but simply asserts that such a child would prefer never having lived at all to living in her afflicted state.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    That answer only underscores the problem: T's theory of relief starts from the premise that, if defendants had not been negligent, he would not have been born. Thus, as T's claim is pleaded, and regardless of how the injury is defined, we cannot avoid the question of how a preconceived child would value a life-whether impaired or not-compared to remaining in a state of nonexistence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The question of how a preconceived child would value life as compared to nonexistence is not a question of how T, himself, subjectively answered that question before his conception and birth. So framed, that question presupposes an obvious factual impossibility.

The few courts that have permitted awards of economic damages for wrongful life have attempted to apportion the child's injury based on the idea that the defendant caused the economic loss flowing from the child's disability, but not the child's entire existence. But, that approach fails to acknowledge that the premise of such a claim-including the claim pleaded here-is that defendants' negligence caused T's very existence in an impaired state.

A loss-of-chance injury is grounded on the mutual expectation of service and reliance that defines the physician-patient relationship. If a patient has a 33 percent chance of recovering at the time of seeking treatment from a physician, then the patient fully expects, and relies upon, the physician to preserve that 33 percent chance. A physician who fails to take reasonable care to preserve that chance clearly has acted adversely to the patient's interests. In short, under the loss-of-chance theory, \"it is the alleged medical malpractice itself that makes it impossible for the plaintiff to prove that he or she would have achieved that better outcome.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414892\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/456/#p480\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414892\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/456/#p480\">\n     at 473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414892\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/456/#p480\">\n     393 P.3d 1106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    In contrast, T's claim requires us to identify the interests that we should attribute to a preconceived child-specifically, whether a preconceived child has an interest in remaining in a state of nonexistence-and determine how those interests relate to the interests of parents to whom a physician owes a duty of professional care. Although the\n    same or similar analysis would apply in other cases where a plaintiff alleges that, but for the defendant's negligence, the plaintiff would not have been born, the specific facts alleged in this case underscore the difficulty in determining the interests of a preconceived child.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    As noted, as alleged, the parents had about a 25 percent chance of having a child with DMD and about a 75 percent chance of having a child without DMD. T's claim rests on the premise that, if the parents had been informed of those risks, they would not have conceived and born another child. Therefore, if defendants had informed the parents of those risks, defendants would have deprived the parents' preconceived child of both a 25 percent chance of a life with DMD and a 75 percent chance of a life without DMD. Is it in the interest of the preconceived child for defendants to inform the parents of those risks? It is difficult enough to determine whether a preconceived child has an interest in nonexistence when the alternative is a life with DMD. According to T, a life with DMD is shorter and involves more physical pain and medical expenses than a life without DMD. But it is not at all clear that those alleged facts make nonexistence preferable to a life with DMD. Further, how would a preconceived child value the 75 percent chance of being born without DMD as compared to nonexistence? How would the value of that 75 percent chance compare to the 25 percent chance of being born with DMD? And how significant are those differences to a preconceived child, given that, even a child without DMD can expect to incur substantial medical costs and emotional distress over the course of his or her life? The interests of a preconceived child in these circumstances are sufficiently imponderable that recognizing T's claim would require a departure from the traditional negligence principles that justified this court's recognition of the loss-of-chance theory of injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    None of the courts that have recognized a limited right to recover economic damages in such claims has effectively confronted the difficulties that we have discussed. Instead, they primarily have resorted to practical or sympathetic considerations. For example, among the reasons that a few courts have given for recognizing a limited right to recover economic damages in similar claims is the concern\n    for uncompensated medical and other expenses that a disabled child might incur as an adult.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <em>\n     Turpin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1980029\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/31/220/#p236\">\n     31 Cal. 3d at 238\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20337\">\n     182 Cal.Rptr. 337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=643%20P.2d%20954\">\n     643 P.2d at 965\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In that regard, we note that, for whatever reason, the parents here have not sought in their own claim to recover damages for T's economic expenses in adulthood.

The court noted that \"some courts do not permit recovery of post-majority expenses, on the theory that the parents' obligation of support terminates when the child reaches twenty-one,\" but it further noted that, in New Hampshire, \"parents are required to support their disabled adult offspring.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%20341\">\n     513 A.2d at 350\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The same extraordinary expenses\n    <em>\n     Turpin\n    </em>\n    would allow in wrongful life actions are covered by our rule allowing parental recovery of post-majority expenses. Because such expenses cannot be recovered by both parent and child, the net effect is the same. Recognition of the wrongful life action would make\n    a substantial difference only in limited circumstances, as when the statute of limitations bars the parental but not the filial claim (as in\n    <em>\n     Procanik\n    </em>\n    ) or when the parents are unavailable to sue.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 251,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%20341\">\n     513 A.2d at 354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    In sum, although we do not reach the issue whether the parents could recover economic damages from defendants for costs of T's support in adulthood, it is because of the parents' own pleading decision in this case, not because of an established substantive limitation on their ability to recover post-majority economic damages in their own claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    However, the doctrinal implications of recognizing T's right to recover such damages would be significant. To summarize: Without a principled way to determine the relative values of life and nonexistence under the circumstances alleged in this case, we cannot conclude that T had a legally protected interest in remaining in a state of nonexistence.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <em>\n     Lininger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10398870\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/764/1202/\">\n     764 P.2d at 1212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Our inability to find an injury to [child] does not, of course, rely on any claim that recognizing such an injury constitutes a 'disavowal of the sanctity of human life,' but only on the fundamental conceptual impossibility of determining what that injury is.\"). Nor can we conclude that defendants caused T to suffer an injury to a legally protected interest. Moreover, we conclude that the line that the very few courts (and none since the mid-1980s) that have permitted limited recovery have drawn between the recoverability of economic damages and noneconomic damages in grappling with those problems-although commendably sympathetic-lacks a sound foundation in doctrinal principle. In short, were we to disregard the causation and injury requirements for T's negligence claim, it would be \"difficult to envision any principled basis for refusing to extend the reasoning to other elements and other situations.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4412804\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/128/231/#p245\">\n     128 N.H. at 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%20341\">\n     513 A.2d at 354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Nelson v.

As we and other courts have observed, the objection that a medical\n    negligence claim by the parents involving the birth of a disabled child depends on the valuation of human life is not well taken. Under the parents' theory of relief, the relevant injury is not the resulting life, but the negligent deprivation of information that was important to the parents' protected interest in making informed reproductive\n    choices.\n    <em>\n     Plowman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335236\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/896/393/#p399\">\n     896 N.W.2d at 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

T's theory is fundamentally different: As pleaded, and despite an effort to apportion his alleged damages to avoid the problem, T's claim necessarily depends on the premise that T had a legally protected interest in not being born, rather than risk being born with DMD. As such, it is subject to the objections that we have described.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Finally, we recognize that, whenever a court denies recovery at common law to a sympathetic plaintiff, especially where expanding scientific knowledge or social principles are at play, it exposes itself to criticism for being on the wrong side of history. And, it is true that the common law typically has found ways over time to provide appropriate redress for civil wrongs by applying settled or advancing principles to novel circumstances. But, whatever the merits of other possible theories to recover the damages that T seeks may be, there is too much gap in settled principles of negligence law to bridge for us to recognize the claim that he has pleaded here.

Medical expenses and emotional distress fit that description. Oregon law does not require that a plaintiff prove, in addition, that she is generally \"worse off\" than she would have been absent those expenses and that distress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    When a defendant causes a plaintiff to incur economic costs and emotional distress, the plaintiff can seek damages for that harm regardless of the fact that, as a result of a defendant's negligence, the plaintiff's circumstances are improved.\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second) of Torts\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 (1979). Thus, as explained in the\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    , if A tortiously imprisons B for two weeks, B is entitled to bring a claim for false imprisonment against A, even if at the end of the imprisonment B obtains large sums for writing an account of the imprisonment.\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second)\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 illustration 6. However, when a defendant's tortious conduct has caused harm to the plaintiff, and, in doing so, also has conferred a special benefit to the interest of the plaintiff that was harmed, the value of the benefit conferred is considered in the mitigation of damages.\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    362 Or. at 453, 412 P.3d at 146-47 (so stating). So, for example, \"if a surgeon performs an unprivileged operation resulting in pain and suffering, it may be shown that the operation averted future suffering.\"\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second)\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 comment a.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    In assessing T's parents' claim, the majority recognizes and applies that\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    rule. 362 Or. at 453-54, 412 P.3d at 146-47. That has two important consequences for an assessment of T's claim. The first is that the benefits conferred by defendants' negligence-T's life and its accompanying joys-cannot be a basis for denying T's claims; they can only be a basis for mitigating his damages. The\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    rule is a rule that requires mitigation of damages; it is not a rule used to determine the legal viability of a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The second consequence that follows from application of section 920 is that T's damages can be calculated without comparing the relative values of life and nonexistence. As to T's economic damages, section 920 allows an offset only\n    when a defendant's negligence confers special benefits \"to the interest of the plaintiff that was harmed.\"\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second)\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    362 Or. at 453, 412 P.3d at 146 (so stating). Thus, as explained in the\n    <em>\n     Restatement\n    </em>\n    , and again as the majority recognizes in analyzing T's parents' claim, \"damages resulting from an invasion of one interest are not diminished by showing that another interest has been benefitted.\"\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second)\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 comment b;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    362 Or. at 453-54, 412 P.3d at 146-47 (so stating). For example, \"damages for pain and suffering are not diminished by showing the earning capacity of the plaintiff has been increased by the defendant's act.\"\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second)\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 920 comment b. Conversely, and as relevant here, section 920 does not permit a jury to offset the economic damages that it awards T by the emotional benefits that accompany his life. To calculate T's economic damages, a jury need only calculate T's medical expenses; it need not determine the value of T's life, the value of nonexistence, or whether T would prefer one to the other.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The same is true for T's emotional distress damages. Section 920 permits a jury to offset the emotional benefits that T actually experiences against the emotional harm that he actually suffers. A jury would not be required to compare the relative benefits of life and nonexistence to make that calculation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Furthermore, even if T's harm were to depend, in some way, on a comparison between nonexistence and life, T's claim would not fail because he could not prove, as a factual matter, the precise nature of nonexistence. A jury could conclude that, if T had not been born, he would not have had DMD or experienced its associated economic and noneconomic burdens. And even if that were beyond a jury's ken, a court could take notice that if T had not been born, he would not have had legal obligations to pay medical bills or emotional distress compensable in\n    damages. When T was born with DMD and its attendant burdens, the legal nature of his experience changed and he suffered cognizable harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Understandably, then, the majority is loath to decide, and does not decide, that T cannot establish that he was harmed by defendants' negligence. Instead, the majority\n    concludes that T's interest in avoiding that harm is not legally cognizable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The first step in deciding whether a plaintiff's interest is legally protected against invasion is to correctly describe the interest at issue. This court describes the plaintiff's interest as an interest in avoiding the harm caused by the wrongful act for which the plaintiff seeks recovery. For instance, in\n    <em>\n     Philibert v. Kluser\n    </em>\n    , the court described the \"simplest legally protected interest\" as an interest in being \"free from physical harm at the hands of another.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n     360 Or. 698\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 703,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n     385 P.3d 1038\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016) (internal quotation omitted). And, in\n    <em>\n     Philibert\n    </em>\n    , the court granted legal protection to the plaintiffs' interest in avoiding certain emotional harm-the emotional distress that occurs in observing the physical injury of a close family member.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n     at 708\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187446\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/698/#p703\">\n     385 P.3d 1038\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Recognition of T's interest does not impose any greater obligation on physicians than already exists; it requires only that physicians act reasonably to diagnose the medical conditions of their\n    minor patients and communicate those diagnoses to their parents.

That question is easily answered: Recognizing T's claim would not interfere with or impair the obligations that defendants owed to their patient, M, or M's parents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    In recognizing T's parents' claim, the majority explains that defendants' obligation to exercise professional skill on behalf of M also required them to reasonably perform other tasks for those who were intended beneficiaries of their skills, including M's parents. The majority concludes that the applicable standard of care required defendants to diagnose M's genetic disorder and communicate it to his parents. 362 Or. at 447, 412 P.3d at 143.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    And, the majority says, \"satisfying the parents' reasonable expectations merely required defendants to provide M with the level of care that a reasonably prudent, careful, and skillful physician would have otherwise provided to M.\" 362 Or. at 448, 412 P.3d at 143. Recognition of T's claim requires no more. Like his parents, T is an intended beneficiary of defendants' diagnosis and recognizing T's claim would not interfere with or impair the obligations that defendants owed to their patient, M, or his parents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Rather than disputing that conclusion, the majority asserts that T's interest is \"distinct from, and potentially at odds with, the parents' interests.\" 362 Or. at 462, 412 P.3d at 151. That is, of\n    course, an entirely different issue, but one that also is easily addressed. T's interest may be distinct from his parents' but there is no tension between them. Like T's interest, T's parents' interest is in avoiding the consequences of defendants' negligence and the burdens associated with T's medical disorder. The majority so describes T's parents' interest throughout much of its opinion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    362 Or. at 460, 412 P.3d at 150 (majority determines that defendants \"could be required to affirmatively protect the parents'\n    <em>\n     economic and emotional interests\n    </em>\n    \") (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 443, 412 P.3d at 141 (majority reasons that there must be a source of liability in addition to foreseeability to protect the parents' \"\n    <em>\n     economic and emotional interests\n    </em>\n    \") (emphasis added). The majority is able to identify \"tension\" between the two interests only by describing T's interest as an interest \"in being conceived and born (or not being conceived and born)\" and his parents' interest as an interest in \"deciding whether or not to conceive and bear that child.\" 362 Or. at 463, 412 P.3d at 152. That error is fundamental. As noted, T's interest\n    is not an interest in being conceived and born or being in a state of nonexistence. And his parents' interest is not an interest in having a reproductive choice. Although T's parents allege, as a fact, that defendants' negligence caused the loss of their reproductive choice, they do not seek a remedy for that loss in and of itself. Rather, they seek the same thing that T seeks-a remedy for the consequences of that loss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    In this case, T's parents had no reproductive choice. Therefore, there could be no tension between what they chose and what T would \"want\" them to choose. What happened, happened. T was conceived and born with DMD and its associated burdens. As a result, both T and his parents suffered economic and noneconomic harm and have the same legal interest in recovering damages for that harm.
