The Town Council held a public meeting at which it discussed and voted on a matter relating to the town's ambulance service. The matter was not listed on the meeting's previously published agenda. The impromptu discussion and vote troubled Lynn Nemeth, a Whitehall resident and qualified elector, and\n   she sought a recall election to determine whether Davis, Keogh, Housman, Jenkin, and Adams (together, the Elected Officers) should be recalled from their respective positions before the end of their terms. In Montana, the Montana Recall Act, \u00a7\u00a7 2-16-601 to -635, MCA, governs recall elections and requires an elector seeking a recall election to produce a recall petition and a circulation sheet for each elected officer she wishes to recall. To effectuate her desired recall election, Nemeth prepared five sets of documents seeking recall of the Elected Officers. Sections 2-16-616 and -617, MCA, provide suggested forms for recall petitions, which must contain a general statement of the reasons for seeking recall, and circulation sheets. The suggested forms are not mandatory and the documents are considered sufficient if they substantially follow the forms. Section 2-16-618, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Nemeth provided a sample of her recall petitions and circulation sheets to Bonnie Ramey, Jefferson County Election Administrator, for approval as is required by \u00a7 2-16-617(3), MCA. Ramey consulted a deputy county attorney from Lewis and Clark County who aided in determining that Nemeth's documents were sufficient. As Nemeth collected the requisite number of signatures from other qualified electors, she brought with her and distributed a \"fact sheet.\" The fact sheet mentioned other matters, additional to those contained in the petitions, as reasons Nemeth sought to recall the Elected Officers. Jefferson County verified the signatures and subsequently notified the Elected Officers that a recall election would occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Elected Officers objected to the recall election based, in part, on their observations that Nemeth's recall petitions and circulation sheets did not substantially conform to the statutory forms. The Elected Officers discussed the alleged deficiencies with Jefferson County in an attempt to resolve the problem prior to litigation. Dialogue between the parties was unsuccessful, however, and the Elected Officers filed an application for injunctive relief in District Court, naming Jefferson County as the only respondent and asking the court to enjoin the recall election pursuant to \u00a7 2-16-615, MCA. Section 2-16-615(2), MCA, provides that a court may enjoin certification, printing, or recall election based on a showing that a filed petition is statutorily insufficient. As the case proceeded, the Elected Officers amended their original application for injunctive relief twice, adding Nemeth as a party to the proceeding and including a petition for declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). In the amended filings, the Elected Officers requested that the court declare the recall petitions legally insufficient and thus invalid and grant them attorney fees and costs. The Elected Officers\n   alleged that Nemeth inappropriately filed, and Ramey improperly approved, the nonconforming documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Nemeth eventually stated her intention to voluntarily withdraw the recall petitions. The Elected Officers supported Nemeth's decision and requested that Nemeth and Jefferson County pay their attorney fees and costs. Nemeth and Jefferson County refused, and, consequently, the Elected Officers continued to pursue their action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment. Ultimately, the District Court analyzed Nemeth's recall petitions and circulation sheets and found that the documents did not substantially conform to the statutory forms. Accordingly, the court granted the Elected Officers' petition for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment. That decision is not at issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 In its order granting injunctive relief and declaratory judgment, the District Court issued three conclusions of law regarding the Elected Officers' requests for attorney fees and costs. It noted that the Elected Officers\n   may have a right to attorney fees and costs pursuant to either \u00a7\u00a7 27-8-313 or 25-10-711, MCA, but requested additional briefing before issuing its final judgment on the matter. Once the parties submitted their briefing, the court held a telephonic conference to discuss the matter. The parties agreed that the issue of whether attorney fees and costs should be awarded was a matter of law that could be decided separately from the issue of how much should be awarded. Therefore, the court decided that it would first decide whether the Elected Officers were entitled to attorney fees and costs, and then, if it decided they were, would later decide whether the requested fees and costs were reasonable. The parties agreed to the court's approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The District Court ultimately decided, based on the briefing, that the Elected Officers were not entitled to attorney fees or costs. The court issued two orders denying the Elected Officers' requests. One order denied attorney fees for \"the reasons Ramey and Nemeth argue.\" The other order denied costs and disbursements for \"the reason argued in Nemeth's Answer Brief that there is no legal basis for taxing costs against Nemeth.\" The Elected Officers appeal those orders, seeking reimbursement from Nemeth and Jefferson County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 This Court reviews for correctness a district court's determination of whether legal authority exists to award attorney fees, as it is a conclusion of law.\n   <em>\n    Mlekush v.

Actions\n   for injunction and declaratory judgment are often filed together, but the Montana Recall Act and our holdings in\n   <em>\n    Braach\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sheehy\n   </em>\n   specifically note that an action for injunction is the appropriate course for an elected officer to take under these circumstances. Injunctive relief under \u00a7 2-16-615(2), MCA, provides full protection to elected officers when recall petitions are statutorily insufficient. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Braach\n   </em>\n   clearly establishes that attorney fees and costs are not recoverable under the Montana Recall Act when an injunction is the requested avenue for relief. Accordingly, we cannot find that the equities support an award for attorney fees or costs under the UDJA in this case because full relief was available to the Elected Officers under the Montana Recall Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Elected Officers contend the declaratory judgment action was\n   necessary to protect their rights in their elected positions-that they needed the District Court to declare the documents invalid in order to ensure the same documents would not be utilized against them or anyone else in the future. However, the ultimate goal of the present action was to stop the pending recall election, an outcome made possible based on the Elected Officers' application for injunctive relief under the Montana Recall Act. We cannot conclude that the additional declaratory judgment action was necessary or proper to stop the recall election or to invalidate the documents to ensure against their future use. Even considering this additional argument, equity does not support awarding the Elected Officers the attorney fees and costs they requested under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. Under these circumstances, the Elected Officers were provided full relief from the filing of the insufficient recall petitions under the Montana Recall Act and our decisions interpreting \u00a7 2-16-615(2), MCA. Because we find equity does not support an award of attorney fees or costs, we end our inquiry and do not apply the tangible parameters test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in concluding that the Elected Officers were not entitled to attorney fees or costs from Jefferson County under \u00a7 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 Section 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA, provides that in any civil action brought against a political subdivision, the opposing party is entitled to certain enumerated costs and reasonable attorney fees if the court finds that the political subdivision's defense was frivolous or pursued in bad faith. A defense is frivolous or pursued in bad faith if it is \"outside the bounds of legitimate argument on a substantial issue on which there is a bona fide difference of opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Western Tradition P'ship\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ostergren v.

They allege that the County's position was outside the bounds of legitimate argument because the recall petitions and circulation sheets were invalid on their faces. Thus, they contend that the County's defense of the documents was unquestionably frivolous. The Elected Officers further argue that Jefferson County's refusal to resolve the issue before and during litigation was in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Jefferson County responds, arguing that its position was not frivolous or pursued in bad faith. We agree with the County. Nemeth provided the recall petitions to Ramey for approval as is required by \u00a7 2-16-617(3), MCA. Ramey then consulted outside counsel to aid in\n   determining whether the petitions were statutorily sufficient. Counsel assessed the petitions, noted various deficiencies, and suggested changes. Nemeth made the suggested changes and counsel approved the new documents. Ramey relied on counsel's certification that the petitions were statutorily sufficient when she permitted their filing. The District Court later found that the petitions and circulation sheets did not sufficiently comply with the statutory forms, indicating that counsel's analysis of the documents was incorrect. However, when the Elected Officers challenged the documents' statutory sufficiency, the County justifiably relied on counsel's assessment. A party can act within the bounds of legitimate argument but also be incorrect. There is nothing in the record suggesting that the County acted outside the bounds of legitimate argument; it\n   appears the County legitimately disputed the sufficiency of the documents. Further, settlement is not mandatory, and the District Court found no evidence that the County's refusal to settle with the Elected Officers was outside the bounds of legitimate argument. We accordingly find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Elected Officers' request for attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22\n   <em>\n    3.

Nemeth responds that an injunction was never sought or granted against her and thus no legal basis exists for an award of costs against Nemeth. We agree with Nemeth. The Elected Officers requested the District Court to enjoin Jefferson County and its agents from proceeding with the recall election; the Elected Officers did not request any action by Nemeth to be enjoined. The District Court subsequently enjoined Jefferson County from holding a recall election, as is proper under \u00a7 2-16-615(2), MCA. The District Court declared Nemeth's recall petitions and circulation sheets invalid, but did not enjoin her actions. Thus, we hold the District Court did not err in concluding that the Elected Officers were not entitled to their costs from Nemeth under \u00a7 25-10-101(8), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 As a final point, we address the Elected Officers' allegation that the District Court's orders denying attorney fees, costs, and disbursements were insufficient because the orders did not contain\n   specific findings of fact.

The Elected Officers agreed that the District Court's decision regarding whether to award attorney fees and costs was a matter of law. The District Court made specific findings and conclusions in its order granting the Elected Officers' requests for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment. The court then correctly interpreted the law to establish that the Elected Officers were not entitled to attorney fees and costs. It would have been more prudent for the District Court to have better supported its reasoning, but in this case, where there is no legal authority upon which to grant the Elected Officers attorney fees and costs, we do not have to speculate as to the District Court's reasoning and conclude the District Court's orders sufficiently supported its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 Equities do not support awarding the Elected Officers attorney fees and costs under the UDJA because the proper way to stop a recall election based on an insufficient recall petition is to request an injunction pursuant to the Montana Recall Act. Further, the Elected Officers are not entitled to attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA, because Jefferson County's defense was not frivolous or in bad faith. We further conclude that the District Court properly denied the Elected Officers' request for costs against Nemeth under \u00a7 25-10-101(8), MCA, because the District Court did not enjoin Nemeth, it enjoined the County. We therefore affirm the District Court's orders denying the Elected Officers attorney fees, costs, and disbursements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   DIRK M.
