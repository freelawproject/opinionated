The presumptive sentence for those crimes is probation. However, under ORS 475.900(1)(b), when the state establishes that those crimes constituted commercial drug offenses, the presumptive sentence is imprisonment. To prove a commercial drug offense, the state must establish any three out of eleven statutorily enumerated factors, one of which is that the \"delivery\" of the drug was \"for consideration.\" This case requires us to determine whether that factor may be proved by evidence that the defendant possessed the drugs with an intent to sell them, or, instead, requires the state to prove a completed sale of drugs or an existing agreement to sell them. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the legislature intended the latter, and we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant was stopped for a traffic violation. During that stop, officers discovered 141.98 grams of methamphetamine divided into separate bags, more than $4,000 cash, three cellphones, and a ledger that the police believed contained drug records. The state charged defendant with unlawful possession of methamphetamine under ORS 475.894 and unlawful delivery of methamphetamine under ORS 475.890. At trial, the state sought to prove delivery by showing that defendant possessed a large amount of methamphetamine with the intent to transfer it. The Court of Appeals has held that such evidence, commonly referred to as a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery, is sufficient to prove a delivery under ORS 475.005(8).\n   <em>\n    State v.

That statute provides that unlawful possession, delivery, or manufacture of certain controlled\n   substances is a commercial drug offense if accompanied by any three of eleven factors (CDO factors). In this case, the state alleged the existence of four CDO factors: (1) the delivery was of methamphetamine \"and was for consideration\"; (2) defendant was in possession of $300 or more in cash; (3) defendant was in possession of drug records; and (4) defendant was in possession of eight grams or more of methamphetamine. The state also alleged another fact, independent of the CDO factors, that, if proved, would result in an enhanced sentence under ORS 475.900 (1)(a)(C). The state alleged that defendant had delivered a \"substantial quantity\" of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the close of evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \"for consideration\" CDO factor, ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A). He argued that, to satisfy that factor, the state needed to show that there was \"actual\" or \"real\" consideration, which \"must have already been given to the defendant or[,] in the very least, a bargain must have been struck leaving only the consideration to be exchanged between parties.\" The state disagreed and argued that, because \"constructive delivery is included in delivery,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   the \"for consideration\" factor is appropriate in a \"constructive delivery case.\" The trial court agreed with the state and denied defendant's motion. The jury found defendant guilty of unlawful possession and unlawful delivery of methamphetamine. It also found that the state had proved three of the four alleged CDO factors, including the \"for consideration\" factor, and the \"substantial quantity\" enhancement. Based on those findings, the trial court imposed a commercial drug offense sentence under ORS 475.900. For defendant's delivery conviction, the court placed defendant in crime category 9-I\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the sentencing guidelines grid and sentenced him to 36 months' prison. For defendant's possession conviction, the court placed defendant in crime category 8-I and sentenced him to 16 months' prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, where he renewed his argument about the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the \"for consideration\" CDO factor. The Court of Appeals agreed with defendant that the evidence was insufficient to prove that factor.\n   <em>\n    Villagomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186867\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/29/#p41\">\n    281 Or.App. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186867\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/29/#p41\">\n    380 P.3d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the parties dispute the meaning of the phrase \"for consideration\" as that term is used in ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A). Defendant contends that, absent a completed sale, a \"delivery\" cannot be \"for consideration\" unless there is a contract of sale: one person must have agreed to deliver drugs in exchange for some benefit or forbearance by another. According to defendant, delivery is not \"for consideration\" when one person unilaterally hopes or intends to make such a bargain in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state disagrees, not with the legal definition of the term \"consideration\" but with how the word \"for\" is used in the phrase \"for consideration.\" That word, the state contends, means \"in order to bring about or further\"; \"with the purpose or object of\"; \"in order to obtain * * * or gain\"; or \"so as to secure as a result.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   886 (unabridged ed. 2002). Thus, the state argues, a defendant who possesses drugs with the intent to sell them in the\n   future engages in \"delivery\" and does so \"for\" consideration. The defendant intends to deliver the drugs \"with the purpose of\" or \"in order to obtain\" consideration in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In our view, defendant's construction of the phrase \"for consideration\" gives greater effect to the legal meaning of the term \"consideration\" and is therefore more likely to be the construction that the legislature intended. As explained, that term is used to describe the basis for a bargain that two parties reach; it is what is sought by the promisor in exchange for a promise and given\n   by the promisee in exchange for the promise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enco, Inc. v.

Nonetheless, ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A) plausibly may be read as the state reads it, and we turn to context for additional clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The state argues that the way that Oregon law defines \"delivery\" provides important context supporting its position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state observes that\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   had been decided when the legislature adopted the CDO factors in ORS 475.900(1)(b). Thus, it argues, the legislature's use of the word \"delivery,\" without restriction, evinces an intent to punish defendants who possess large amounts of drugs with the intent to sell\n   them, even if the state does not also establish a completed sale or the existence of an agreement to sell those drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As explained later in our discussion of legislative history, we agree with the state that the legislature was aware of the Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   and thought that a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery could be punished as the crime of \"delivery.\" We also agree that the legislature intended that a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery would be eligible for enhanced sentencing. But we do not agree that the legislature's use of the word \"delivery\" in ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A) necessarily indicated an intent to make a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery sufficient to establish the \"for consideration\" CDO factor. Instead, the legislature may have intended to require proof of facts in addition to those necessary to prove a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery to establish a commercial drug offense. The other CDO factors in ORS 475.900 (1)(b) provide helpful context for that view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Force v. Dept. of Rev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673839\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/179/#p188\">\n    350 Or. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=252%20P.3d%20306\">\n    252 P.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (stating that \" 'context' includes, among other things, other parts of the statute at issue\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ORS 475.900(1)(b) allows a sentence for a drug conviction to be increased from a crime category carrying a presumptive sentence of probation to a crime category carrying a presumptive sentence of imprisonment if the underlying violation is a \"commercial drug offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.900(1)(b) (stating that a commercial drug offense is crime category 8); ORS 475.900(3)(a), (b) (stating default crime categories for possession and delivery of controlled substance are 1 and 4, respectively). To establish that a delivery is a \"commercial drug offense,\" as opposed to an \"ordinary\" or \"regular\" delivery, the legislature requires the state to prove at least three out of eleven enumerated CDO factors. ORS 475.900(1)(b). Thus, the purpose that those factors serve is to distinguish the two types of offenses and to punish the more serious offense-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the commercial drug offense-more severely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Logically, then, those eleven CDO factors would describe facts separate from, and in addition to, those required to prove \"ordinary\" or \"regular\" delivery that, in the legislature's view, would make an \"ordinary\" or \"regular\" delivery more serious. A review of those eleven factors\n   supports that deduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, subparagraph (B) of\n   ORS 475.900(1)(b) requires evidence that the \"offender was in possession of $300 or more in cash\"; subparagraph (C) requires evidence that the \"offender was unlawfully in\n   possession of a firearm or other weapon\"; and subparagraph (D) requires evidence that the \"offender was in possession of materials being used for the packaging of controlled substances.\" ORS 475.900(1)(b)(B)-(D). To prove those factors, the state must produce evidence that is not required to prove \"ordinary\" or \"regular\" delivery; the state may prove unlawful delivery without adducing evidence that the defendant was in possession of cash, weapons, or packaging materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   If we interpret the \"for consideration\" CDO factor as defendant suggests, it also would require proof of facts that are not necessary to prove delivery. To prove a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery, the state need prove only that a defendant possessed a large amount of drugs with the intent to sell them.\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2347053\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/92/51/#p54\">\n    92 Or.App. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2347053\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/92/51/#p54\">\n    756 P.2d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the state's proposed construction of the \"for consideration\" CDO factor, however, proof of a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery alone would establish that factor. That is, possession of a large amount of a controlled substance with the intent to sell it would establish both \"delivery\" and delivery \"for consideration.\" But, under defendant's construction, an additional fact would be necessary: the state would be required to adduce evidence of a completed sale or an agreement to sell the drugs. With that interpretation, the \"for consideration\" factor would have the same function as other enumerated factors. It would specify a fact that, in addition to those necessary to prove a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery, is needed to prove a commercial drug offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The state sees it differently. The state agrees that other CDO factors provide helpful context for an understanding of the \"for consideration\" factor. However, the state contends, because those factors do not require proof of a completed sale or an existing agreement with a particular buyer, there is no reason to think that the legislature intended the \"for consideration\" factor to require such proof. We do not find it surprising that evidence needed to establish the \"for\n   consideration\" factor is different from the evidence required to prove the other CDO factors. Each factor\n   describes a different circumstance that, in combination with others, may indicate that a particular drug crime is a commercial drug offense. To prove a commercial drug offense, the state may offer evidence of any three or more enumerated factors. Thus, the state may obtain the enhanced punishment that a commercial drug offense provides without proving a completed sale or an existing agreement to sell, as long as it relies on CDO factors other than the \"for consideration\" factor to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In our view, the CDO factors that the legislature enumerated to establish that a delivery is a commercial drug offense are indicators that the legislature intended the \"for consideration\" CDO factor to have the meaning for which defendant advocates. Our endeavor is not complete, however; we also consider legislative history to ascertain legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ORS 475.900 was enacted as a result of the constitutional concerns created by one of the provisions in the 1989 sentencing guidelines classifying the manufacture, delivery, or possession of a controlled substance as a crime category 8 on the sentencing guidelines grid in a particular circumstance. If the violation \"occurred as part of a drug cultivation, manufacture or delivery scheme or network,\" the violation was classified as crime category 8 and resulted in a presumptive prison sentence.\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   OAR 253-04-002(3) (Sept. 1, 1989);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Or.

First, under subsection (1), a defendant could receive a crime category 8 placement if the violation \"[c]onsisted of delivery for consideration of heroin, cocaine or methamphetamine.\" Bill File, HB 2390, Dec. 10, 1990 (Draft Bill). Second, if that criterion were not met, the statute provided a list of ten factors under subsection (2) that could lead to a defendant receiving a crime category 8 placement.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Representative Mason explained that \"subsection (1), the sale-you know 'the distribution for consideration'-sale,\" came at the request of the district attorneys to address their concern that, without that provision, the presumptive sentence for drug sales would not be time in prison.

Representative Mason described \"consideration\"-which he stated was \"lawyer talk for 'sell' \"-as a limiting word because the term \"delivery\" is very broad; he further explained that defendants who sell are subject to an enhanced penalty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Attorney Ross Shepard, a witness appearing on behalf of OCDLA, testified that HB 2390 went a long way in addressing the problems of the \"scheme or network\" provision that was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Moeller\n   </em>\n   . Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, HB 2390, Jan 30, 1991, Tape 11, Side A\n   (statement of Ross Shepard).

Notably, on February 19, the House Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections-the same subcommittee that considered HB 2390-held a hearing on HB 2502 (1991), a bill that sought to enhance the penalty for the delivery of controlled substances to minors within 1,000 feet of a school. Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, HB 2502, Feb. 19, 1991, Tape 25, Side A (statement of Rep.

Jim McIntyre of the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office stated that giving all drug deliveries Class A felony treatment would make a \"clear statement to drug dealers\" but that the fiscal impact \"would be incredible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Jim McIntyre). Interjecting in that discussion, Representative Mason explained that \" 'delivery' is not synonymous with 'sale.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep.

Do not the vast majority of what we have been talking about here, would the 18-year-old kid fit in 'delivery for consideration' ?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep.

Representative Mason answered Representative Park's question in the affirmative and stated that, although \"much of the time there is indeed consideration,\" \"you can be charged with delivery by circumstances other than cash\" as result of the Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep.

Parks). In attempting to explain the difference between the two bills, Representative Mason stated that one of the reasons HB 2390 was phrased in terms of \"delivery for consideration\" \"was to avoid the\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   situation, which has got[ten] a little flexible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep.

Representative Mason described the doctrines of constructive delivery and possession as the reason HB 2390 was \"fairly circumscribed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Representative Mason further explained that he had no problem with enhancing criminal penalties for the delivery of a controlled substance, but he stated that he \"would like them enhanced based on 'delivery for consideration' because [he] want[s] at the real thing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The next day, on February 20, the subcommittee held a public hearing and work session on HB 2390, but the focus of the discussion was centered on amendments proposed by ODAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, HB 2390, Feb. 20, 1991, Tape 30, Side A; Tape 31, Side A; and Tape 30, Side B (discussing amendments). There does not appear to have been a significant discussion at that hearing regarding the \"for consideration\" factor or making all deliveries for consideration a Class A felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After the House's final work session on the bill in March, HB 2390 provided two pathways for increasing a defendant's sentence for a drug violation to a crime category 8 on the sentencing guidelines grid: (1) the state could plead and prove that a defendant possessed, delivered, or manufactured a substantial quantity of a controlled substance; or (2) the state could plead and prove factors that indicated that a defendant was engaged in a commercial drug offense. Bill File, HB 2390, Mar. 18, 1991 (A-Engrossed Bill). The \"for consideration\" factor, which was one of eleven enumerated factors, did not receive much attention when it reached the Senate Committee on Judiciary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The most notable\n   statements regarding that factor came from an exchange between Ross Shepard, Representative Mason, and Senator Jim Bunn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the time of that exchange, the discussion was focused on paragraph (2)(d) of HB 2390, which provided, \"The offender was in possession of materials used for the packaging of controlled substances such as scales, wrapping or foil.\" Bill File, HB 2390, Mar. 18, 1991 (A-Engrossed Bill). Senator Bunn asked Shepard whether he thought that someone delivering a drug to someone else, other than when the person holds the drug in her hand to transfer it, covered two of the CDO factors almost immediately-namely, as Senator Bunn put it, \"you've got a container that it is in plus the drug.\" Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Judiciary, HB 2390, May 24, 1991, Tape 188, Side A (statement of Sen. Bunn). Shepard agreed with Senator Bunn that those two factors-paragraph (2)(d) covering drug packaging materials and, presumably, paragraph (2)(k) covering possession of an amount of a controlled substance greater than that needed for personal use-would be met under those circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Shepard). Senator Bunn then modified the hypothetical and stated that, \"if delivery takes place for consideration, which is [paragraph (2) ](a), then you've got one of your three, and as long as the amount of the delivery was over the threshold you've got all three.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Sen. Bunn). Shepard again agreed with Senator Bunn's conclusion and stated that that would be a good reason to require more than three factors to establish an enhanced penalty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Shepard).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At that point, Representative Mason briefly explained to the committee that, \"in drug law, the term delivery is much, much broader\" than actual hand-to-hand transfers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep. Mason). Senator Bunn stated that that only extended the point that he was trying to make, and he then suggested that someone who had a bag in their home with a large amount of a drug might meet all\n   three factors automatically.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Sen.

In response to that suggestion, Representative Mason stated that a person in that situation would \"meet at least two.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Rep.

Senator Bunn went on to ask \"why we have the wrapping [factor] when it virtually, automatically guarantees two and we are looking for separate criteria to be met?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (statement of Sen. Bunn). He was concerned that, although it was not the intent of the drafters of the bill, the state would just plead the packaging factor in the event that it needed to get over the threshold of three factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response to Senator Bunn's concerns, paragraph (2)(d) was amended so that the packaging that the drug was in did not count for the purposes of that factor. Bill File, HB 2390, June 24, 1991 (B-Engrossed Bill).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   HB 2390 went through one more work session in the Senate, but there does not appear to have been any more discussion on the \"for consideration\" factor. HB 2390 was eventually passed by the legislature and became ORS 475.900,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the focus of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The legislative history strongly supports our understanding of the meaning of ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A). That CDO factor, like the others the legislature enumerated, was intended to limit and specifically describe the circumstances that would permit a jury to find that a defendant had committed a commercial drug offense carrying a presumptive sentence of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In enacting ORS 475.900(1)(b), the legislature sought to address the problems raised by the \"scheme or network\" provision and the Court of Appeals' holding in\n   <em>\n    Moeller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n    105 Or.App. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2354894\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/105/434/#p441\">\n    806 P.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that that provision is unconstitutionally vague. Over the course of the legislative proceedings, the legislature removed facts that were vague and that had, in effect, placed the burden on the defendant to explain why the factor did not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, Jan. 30, 1991, Tape 12, Side A (statements of Rep. Mason and Hon Haas) (Mason explaining that heavy traffic on premises factor and possession of valuable property without plausible means of lawful income factor too \"slippery\" to keep in HB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2390, and Haas suggesting that those factors might force the defendant to testify); Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Crime and Corrections, HB 2390, Feb. 20, 1991, Tape 30, Side A (statement of Rep. Parks) (stating that possession of property without plausible means of lawful income factor too vague and better not to have in HB 2390).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In contrast to the facts that were deleted from the bill, the CDO factors that the legislature finally included were factors that required an objective determination. For example, some of the factors require that the defendant possess specific items-cash, weapons, materials used to package drugs, drug records or customer lists, stolen property, manufacturing paraphernalia, or specific amounts of drugs. ORS 475.900(1)(b)(B)-(F), (H), (K). Others require a showing that structures were modified or constructed, or that land was used in a certain way. ORS 475.900(1)(b)(I), (J). Interpreting subparagraph (A) to also require an objective determination of the existence of a completed sale or an agreement to sell, rather than permitting the state to rely only on evidence of a subjective intent to sell, is consistent with that legislative effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even more significantly, the legislative history is replete with indications that the legislature intended the \"for consideration\" CDO factor to require a sale, as opposed to an intent to sell. As noted, much of the discussion of that factor described it as requiring a \"sale.\" And, the legislature frequently distinguished between a\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   delivery and delivery \"for consideration.\" The only aspects of the legislative history to which the state points as supporting its interpretation of the \"for consideration\" factor are the legislature's understanding that \"delivery\" is a broadly defined term that would encompass\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   deliveries and that the legislature intended to identify facts that it believed would evidence participation in a drug enterprise. We agree that the legislature had those thoughts in mind, but we do not see them as inconsistent with our understanding of the meaning of ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The state is correct that the legislature adopted a broad definition of \"delivery\" in ORS 475.005(8) that does\n   not require a completed sale or an existing agreement to sell to prove a conviction. Yet, that broad definition of \"delivery\" is not inconsistent with a legislative intent to make one of the CDO factors providing a basis for enhanced punishment be a completed sale or an existing agreement to sell specified drugs. The state also is correct that the legislature enumerated CDO factors that it believed were circumstantial-and not direct-evidence of a defendant's participation in a drug enterprise. However, that description of the legislature's purpose also is not inconsistent with a legislative intent to include a completed sale or an existing agreement to sell drugs as one of those factors. Such a sale or agreement may be indirect evidence of participation in a drug enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Looking at the legislative history as a whole, we understand the legislature's intent to be an intent to describe objective circumstances that warrant sentencing a crime involving controlled substances as a more serious crime-a commercial drug offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Interpreting the \"for consideration\" CDO factor as requiring proof of a completed sale or an existing agreement to sell drugs is consistent with that intent. And, contrary to the state's primary argument, that interpretation is not inconsistent with the statutory text. As noted, \"consideration\" is a legal term. It describes one of the circumstances that is necessary for an existing contract to be enforceable: it must be supported by \"consideration\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a bargained-for exchange. We do not fail to give heed to that text when we interpret ORS 475.900(1)(b)(A) to require proof of a completed sale or an existing agreement to sell the drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this case, the state concededly did not adduce evidence sufficient to establish the \"for consideration\" CDO factor as we have construed it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal on that factor. And, as the Court of Appeals held, without the \"for consideration\" factor, the state proved only two CDO factors. Therefore, it was error for the trial court to impose\n   an enhanced sentence as a commercial drug offense under ORS 475.900(1)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Villagomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186867\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/29/#p41\">\n    281 Or.App. at 40-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186867\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/281/29/#p41\">\n    380 P.3d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
