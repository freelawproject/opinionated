We hold Cable One's tangible property falls squarely within the Property Tax Code's (the Code), NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 7-35-1 to -38-93 (1973, as amended through 2016), definition of \"communications system\" pursuant to Section 7-36-30(B)(1) and that the Department properly reclassified it and subjected it to valuation also pursuant to Section 7-36-30. The district court having concluded otherwise, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {2} Cable One operates two cable systems in New Mexico: one in Sandoval County (the Rio Rancho system) and one in Chavez County (the Roswell system). Each system is capable of providing Cable One's customers with cable television service (i.e., video programming), internet access, and interconnected VoIP. When Cable One began its operations in New Mexico in the early 1980s, its primary purpose was to provide cable television service. Between 2002 and 2011, Cable One repurposed a number of its channels in both the Rio Rancho and Roswell systems in order to provide high-speed data (internet) and interconnected VoIP services. Cable One's tangible property within New Mexico includes a \"headend\" for each of the two systems it operates. According to Cable One, a \" 'headend' ... serves as a collection system for signals over the cable television system\" and \"also houses equipment that enables Cable One to provide internet access service and interconnected VoIP service to customers over the same cable television system.\" Cable One's system uses optical means to transmit and receive information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {3} In 2008, the Department \"became aware that many cable companies were transitioning from one-way to two-way communication services.\" Historically, cable television companies were considered to provide \"one-way\" service, meaning that their systems were designed to transmit but not receive information and were thus not considered \"communications systems\" for purposes of\n   central assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Telephone companies, by contrast, provide two-way service because their systems are capable of both transmitting and receiving information. In response to the \"ever[-]evolving technological advancements [in] the cable television, broadband internet, VoIP, and traditional telephone industr[ies,]\" the Department began centrally assessing \"all cable companies operating in the state which provided two-way communications services that [Sections] 7-36-2 and 7-36-30 ... governed.\" Specifically, the Department now centrally assesses \"all cable television companies which provide broadband internet and VoIP services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {4} Upon being notified that the Department reclassified Cable One's property as a \"communications system,\" Cable One began paying its taxes under protest. Cable One filed a complaint in January 2014 seeking a partial refund of its 2013 taxes paid and a declaratory judgment that its property is not part of a communications system. In response to the district court's question at the motion for summary judgment hearing regarding why its internet access and VoIP services did not qualify under Section 7-36-30(B)'s definition of \"communications system,\" Cable One conceded that those services \"would fit within [Section 7-36-30(B)(1)'s] definition\" but argued that the court could not look at Subsection (B)(1) \"in a vacuum.\" Cable One argued that \"canons of statutory construction are clear ... that [courts are] to look at a statute in its whole and give effect to every provision of it.\" Cable One contended that the Department's reliance on Subsection (B)(1)'s definition of \"communications system\" to guide its determination failed to consider the Code's overall scheme of central assessment and whether the Legislature intended for property such as Cable One's to come within that scheme. As evidence that the Legislature did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend for its property to be centrally assessed, Cable One relied on (1) distinctions between it and other centrally-assessed industries, such as whether they are regulated by the Public Regulations Commission and cross county lines; (2) the definition of \"plant\" property contained in Section 7-36-30(B)(4), of which Cable One contended it had none, meaning it had no relevant property to be centrally assessed; (3) the failure of House Bill 617 (H.B. 617) during the 2008 legislative session, which would have amended the definition of \"communications system;\" and (4) the Department's own long-standing construction that cable companies are not subject to central assessment, which Cable One argues should be controlling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {5} The Department responded that when Cable One repurposed parts of its existing system between 2002 and 2011 in order to be able to both transmit and receive information, it-like such similarly capable telecommunications companies-became subject to central assessment under Sections 7-36-2 and 7-36-30 because its property then plainly qualified under the statutory definition of \"communications system.\" The Department noted that the definition employs and the statute in general refers to the broader term \"communications system\" rather than the narrower term \"\n   <em>\n    tele\n   </em>\n   communications system\" that Cable One urged the district court to conclude the Legislature intended. The Department also challenged Cable One's interpretation of the definition of \"plant\" as violative of rules of statutory construction and its reliance on H.B. 617 \"to infer legislative intent\" as \"groundless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {6} The district court granted in part Cable One's motion for summary judgment,\n   concluding that Cable One's property \"is not part of a 'communication[s] system' under the ... Code.\" In its order, the district court never addressed whether Cable One's property met Section 7-36-30(B)(1)'s definition of \"communications system.\" Instead, it primarily relied on the administrative gloss doctrine-i.e., that \"[a]n administrative interpretation of even ambiguous language might bind an agency over a period of time to a particular construction\" as the district court described it-and its view of the failure of H.B. 617 as \"persuasive evidence that [the Legislature] intended to preserve the then current assessment practices concerning cable television property\" to conclude that Cable One's property \"is not part of a 'communication[s] system' under the ... Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {7} The district court denied Cable One's summary judgment motion with respect to its claim for a refund of its 2013 taxes based upon its need to conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the refund amount to which Cable One may be entitled. While the January 2014 action was still pending, Cable One filed a second complaint in January 2015 seeking the same relief as to its 2014 taxes. After the cases were consolidated, Cable One moved for summary judgment on its refund claims for tax years 2013 and 2014. The parties stipulated to the refund amounts for those two years and agreed that there was no need for an evidentiary hearing. In its final judgment, the district court ordered the Department to refund Cable One $54,387.40 of its 2013 taxes and $53,986.84 of its 2014 taxes, amounts that represent the \"difference between the property taxes Cable One paid under central assessment ... and what it would have paid under local assessment.\" The Department timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {8} The singular question before us is whether the Department properly reclassified Cable One's property as a \"communications system?\" The Department argues that when Cable One repurposed its equipment to expand its services to include both internet access and VoIP, it \"transformed its[ ] business from a cable company into a communications system\" as defined in Section 7-36-30(B)(1), thus bringing Cable One under the Department's authority. Cable One argues that the Legislature intended the term \"communications system\" to apply only to \"traditional, regulated telecommunications companies,\" which Cable One is not, meaning the Department had no authority to reclassify Cable One's property and value it under Section 7-36-30. We agree with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {9} \"Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Self v.

As the Department points out, the Legislature's definition evinces its intent that any property that-(1) is used for the transmission and reception of information; (2) employs electronic, magnetic, or optical means, or any combination thereof, to accomplish the transmittal and reception of information; and (3) that it be available for use by another person for consideration is considered part of a \"communications system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727646\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/116/742/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The undisputed facts in the record establish that Cable One's property qualifies under the plain language of Section 7-36-30(A) and (B)(1) for classification as part of a \"communications system.\" Cable One, in fact, conceded at the motion for summary judgment hearing that its property in New Mexico meets the definition of \"communications system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {12} Cable One argues, however, that the fact that the Department \"begin [s] and end[s its] argument with the definition of 'communications system' \" in Section 7-36-30(B)(1) constitutes \"selective parsing of the statutory scheme.\" According to Cable One, another statutory provision-specifically Section 7-36-30(B)(4)-\"give[s] rise to [an] ambiguity\" regarding whether the Legislature intended for Cable One's property to be considered part of a \"communications system.\" Thus, Cable One argues that we must turn to other interpretive aids in order to determine whether the statutory definition of \"communications system\" applies to Cable One's property. What Cable One disregards, however, is that \"techniques in aid of construction of a statute are used to resolve an ambiguity, not to create one.\"\n   <em>\n    Tafoya v. N.M.

Moreover, in instances such as this where the Legislature has specially defined a term, the Department's focus on Section 7-36-30(B)(1)'s definition is appropriate because \"our analysis is bound by the statutory language\" and we are not at liberty to \"go beyond the plain language\" of the definition.\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166640\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmsc/2016/027/12166640/\">\n    2016-NMSC-027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20P.3d%20836\">\n    376 P.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is particularly so where, as here, the party challenging the application of the definition has failed to allege-much less establish-that the definition either leads to an unreasonable result, is arbitrary, is incongruous with the rest of the statute, defeats the legislative purpose of the statute, or generates confusion because it is so discordant to common usage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20P.3d%20836\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 ;\n   <em>\n    Wilschinsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989-NMSC-047\">\n    1989-NMSC-047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592831\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/108/511/\">\n    108 N.M. 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592831\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/108/511/\">\n    775 P.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {13} Thus, because Cable One has failed to challenge the statutory definition itself under the applicable standard, no further construction\n   is required.

According to Cable One, \"[n]one of Cable One's property in ... New Mexico meets [Section 7-36-30(B)(4)'s] definition [of 'plant'], as Cable One has never maintained and is not required to maintain its books and records in accordance with any uniform system of accounting.\" Cable One contends that the phrase \"uniform system of accounting\" refers specifically and only to the Federal Communications Commission's Uniform System of Accounts (USOA)-\"a historical financial accounting system\" that is intended \"for use by telephone companies,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2032.1\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20220\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (2012)-despite the facial differences between the terms. Thus, reasons Cable One, because it does not and is not required to use the USOA, it does not have property that qualifies as a \"plant\" as contemplated by Section 7-36-30(B)(4), and because it does not have property that qualifies as a \"plant,\" it cannot be considered to have property that is part of a \"communications system\" as defined in Section 7-36-30(B)(1). Cable One's strained reading of Section 7-36-30-particularly its decontexualization of the term \"plant\" and the inordinate weight it places on the term \"uniform system of accounting\" as used within the definition of \"plant\"-is an extreme deviation from not only the approach taken throughout the Code with respect to the relationship between property classification and valuation, but also well-established rules of statutory construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {15} Our Legislature enacted a property tax code that distinguishes between different classes of property and establishes special methods of valuation tied to a property's classification.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7-36-1 to -33.

Critically, Cable One's analysis ignores that the term \"plant\" appears in neither the definition of \"communications system\" nor in Section 7-36-30(A), which establishes the applicable scope of Section 7-36-30.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7-36-30(A) (\"All property that is part of a communications system and is subject to valuation for property taxation purposes shall be valued in accordance with the provisions of this section.\"). That is to say, the Legislature did not make a property's\n   <em>\n    classification\n   </em>\n   as a \"communications system\" contingent on whether a taxpayer's property includes a \"plant\" and most certainly did not make classification dependent on whether the taxpayer employs the USOA. Rather, \"plant\" appears only in Section 7-36-30(B)(4), wherein it is defined as set forth previously, and Section 7-36-30(D), which prescribes one of two\n   <em>\n    valuation\n   </em>\n   methods that a taxpayer whose property is classified as \"communications system\" may elect to have the Department apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7-36-30(C) (providing that \"[e]ach taxpayer having property subject to valuation under this section shall elect to have that property valued by the [D]epartment in accordance with either Subsection D or Subsection F of this section\"); \u00a7 7-36-30(D) (providing a valuation method that focuses on the value of the taxpayer's \"plant,\" \"construction work in progress,\" and \"materials and supplies\").

In light of this legislative history and the clear, unambiguous definition of \"communications system,\" we conclude that\n   the Legislature intended to grant the Department the authority to classify Cable One's property as \"communications system\" and assess it under Section 7-36-30 when Cable One elected to repurpose portions of its system in order to provide two-way communications services (i.e., internet and VoIP) to its customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Cable One's Other Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {24} Cable One makes a number of other arguments regarding why its property should not be subject to central assessment by the Department. We briefly address each one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Failure of H.B. 617 During the 2008 Legislative Session\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {25} Cable One argues that absent action by the Legislature to amend the Code, the Department is bound by its previous interpretation that Cable One is not subject to central assessment and must leave valuation of its property to county assessors. Cable One points to a failed attempt by the Legislature in 2008 to amend Section 7-36-30's definition of \"communications system\" as evidence that the Legislature did not intend for its property to be centrally assessed under the then-existing-and still-existing-definition of \"communications system.\" Given our foregoing analysis of and conclusion regarding Section 7-36-30, we find it unnecessary to address arguments related to what intent may be gleaned from the Legislature's failure to amend the definition of \"communications system\" in 2008, other than to caution parties and district courts against jumping to and relying on legislative inaction as somehow providing evidence of legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wegner v.

Overreach by the Department\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {26} Cable One also argues that the Department never \"attempt[ed] to clarify or broaden the ... Code through a regulation or ruling\" and that the Department's sua sponte decision in 2008 to begin centrally assessing Cable One and similar companies was an unlawful assertion of authority. Again, for the reasons previously discussed, we conclude that the Department was not required to \"clarify or broaden\" the interpretation of what property was subject to central assessment under Sections 7-36-2(B)(2) and 7-36-30 in order to assess Cable One because the Legislature had already provided the Department with such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Department Was Required to Leave Assessment of Cable One's Property to County Assessors and Allow County Assessors to Value Cable One's Property in Accordance with Section 7-36-2(F)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {27} Finally, Cable One argues that the Department does not have sole authority to value \"communications system\" property and contends that Section 7-36-2(F) provides county assessors with the ability to \"value property belonging to companies subject to central assessment.\" Section 7-36-2(F) provides\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The [D]epartment is authorized to enter into one or more agreements with each county assessor ... under which the county assessor agrees to perform the valuation of property for which the [D]epartment is responsible under Subsection B of this section\n   but which property is not subject to the special methods of valuation set forth in Sections 7-36-27, 7-36-28[,] and 7-36-30 through 7-36-32.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   According to Cable One, this subsection indicates that the Legislature (1) \"contemplated that some property of 'communications systems' would not be susceptible to valuation under either of [Section 7-36-30's] special methods,\" and (2) \"chose not to vest [the Department] with plenary power to use any other method to value such property.\" Cable One misconstrues Section 7-36-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {28} Subsection F\n   <em>\n    permits\n   </em>\n   -but does not require-the Department to enter into agreements with county assessors to have county assessors perform valuations\n   <em>\n    if and only if\n   </em>\n   it is for property listed Section 7-36-2(B) that \"is not subject to the special methods of valuation set forth in Sections 7-36-27, 7-36-28[,] and 7-36-30 through 7-36-32.\" The only type of property listed in Section 7-36-2(B) that is not subject to a special valuation method in the enumerated sections is \"public utility\" property. All other types of property-railroad, communications system, pipeline, and airline-have prescribed special methods of valuation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 7-36-27 (providing a special method of valuation for oil, natural gas, carbon dioxide, and liquid hydrocarbons pipelines); \u00a7 7-36-28 (providing a special method of valuation for water pipelines); \u00a7 7-36-30 (providing a special method of valuation for \"communications system\" property); \u00a7 7-36-31 (providing a special method of valuation for railroads); \u00a7 7-36-32 (providing a special method of valuation for commercial aircraft). Cable One's claim that Section 7-36-2(F) allows county assessors to value \"communications system\" property under a valuation method other than those provided in Section 7-36-30 is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {29} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cable One and remand for entry of judgment in light of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {30}\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   MICHAEL E.
