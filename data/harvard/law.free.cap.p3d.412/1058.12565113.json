The City and MMIA released to Nelson all non-privileged documents and provided privilege logs describing those documents withheld\n   on the ground of attorney-client or attorney-work-product privilege. The District Court granted summary judgment to the City and MMIA on the ground that Nelson had received all of the documents that he was entitled to examine. Nelson appeals, arguing that Montana's constitutional right to know forecloses the City's and MMIA's privilege claims. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Steven Feuerstein, a former Billings City police officer, secured a $1.6 million judgment in a 2006 civil rights lawsuit against the City. MMIA, an interlocal government agency that provides insurance coverage to the City, paid the full judgment to Feuerstein. MMIA determined, however, that the City's policy did not cover certain portions of the judgment and sought reimbursement from the City for $900,000. The City's and MMIA's reinsurer, Specialty National, declared bankruptcy and did not participate in paying the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Sometime in 2009, the City and MMIA attempted to discuss the matter in a closed session. The\n   <em>\n    Billings Gazette\n   </em>\n   filed suit to enjoin the closed session, and a district court issued a preliminary injunction, prohibiting any non-public discussions about the matter. That case was dismissed as moot when the City and MMIA agreed not to engage in further discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 MMIA later filed suit in district court against the City and Specialty National for reimbursement. Nelson alleges that during the\n   course of that litigation, the City held closed meetings-in violation of the Montana Constitution and Open Meeting laws-to discuss litigation strategy, including a work session on June 24, 2013, which Nelson had asked to attend. The City and MMIA eventually reached a settlement agreement in which the City agreed to pay MMIA $500,000 to dispose of MMIA's lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Nelson first requested documents from MMIA relating to the Feuerstein matter in August 2013. Nelson wrote a letter asking for \"all documents in the matter of City of Billings/Feuerstien [sic].\" He wrote that he would \"pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $50.00\" for the documents. MMIA responded to Nelson's letter and informed him that MMIA's files contained privileged documents that would need to be reviewed by general counsel and redacted before the documents could be given to Nelson. MMIA explained that, given Nelson's broad request, the costs of reviewing the documents and copying them would far exceed fifty dollars. MMIA sent another letter to Nelson a few weeks later that included copies of agendas and minutes for all MMIA meetings in which the Feuerstein case was discussed. In response, Nelson requested \"all communication\" \"in the matter of MMIA/City of Billings/Feuerstein,\" including all correspondence between the parties and their attorneys. Nelson again stated that he would pay copying and postage fees up to fifty dollars. MMIA responded with a letter again explaining that the documents Nelson requested may be protected from disclosure by privilege and that in order to fulfill Nelson's request general counsel would need to review thousands of documents at a cost far exceeding fifty dollars \"in staff time and legal bills.\" MMIA requested that Nelson agree to pay these costs before MMIA proceeded. MMIA never received a response from Nelson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Nelson also requested documents from the City in August 2013. His initial request to the City was for meeting minutes and agendas from three dates, including the June 24, 2013 meeting from which he was excluded. The City provided him with minutes and agendas from two of the meetings he requested, along with minutes and agendas from two other meetings that took place around the same time. The City informed him that there were no minutes from the June 24, 2013 meeting because at that time Montana law did not require minutes to be kept for closed litigation strategy sessions. In a follow-up letter, Nelson requested \"access to and copy of in the matter of MMIA/City of Billings/Feuerstein, all communication.\" As in his correspondence to MMIA, Nelson wrote that he would pay copying and postage fees up to fifty dollars. The City responded that some of the requested documents\n   may be protected by privilege and that given the broad request, the cost of searching for, reviewing, and copying the documents would exceed fifty dollars. The City requested Nelson to advise it on how he wished to proceed.\n   The City never received a response from Nelson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 On July 23, 2014, Nelson filed with the District Court a Petition for Release of Documents against MMIA and the City, asking for the release of \"everything\" \"related to the matter of Steve Feuerstein/The City of Billings/Montana Municipal Insurance Authority.\" His petition also alleged that the closure of meetings during the litigation was a violation of the Montana Constitution and open meeting laws. He asked the court to compel the release of all documents, order an investigation to determine whether his constitutional rights were violated, and order other remedies. MMIA and the City provided Nelson with over seven thousand pages of documents and a privilege log detailing the documents withheld. MMIA and the City then moved for summary judgment on the basis that all non-privileged documents had been released. Nelson did not file a response or opposition to that motion, but rather filed a one-page \"Motion to Deny Summary Judgment\" with no supporting brief. Following a hearing, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of MMIA and the City and dismissed the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 This Court exercises plenary review over matters of constitutional interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Cross v.

He argues that because neither the City nor MMIA can claim any right to individual privacy, they cannot refuse to produce any documents to him based on the attorney-client or attorney-work-product privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 MMIA and the City argue that privileged documents are not subject to disclosure under the Montana Constitution because they are not \"documents ... of ... public bodies.\" Therefore, they reason, Article II, Section 9, does not require the City and MMIA to make documents protected by the attorney-client or attorney-work-product privileges\n   available for Nelson's examination. Alternatively, the City and MMIA argue that the District Court's order can be affirmed summarily because Nelson failed to respond in a procedurally proper manner to their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 We first reject the City's and MMIA's argument that the District Court's grant of summary judgment can be affirmed in a summary manner due to Nelson's procedural deficiencies. Although Nelson failed to brief the issues before the District Court on summary judgment, this failure to respond did \"not relieve the District Court of the duty to engage in a Rule 56 analysis when presented with a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

In its report to the whole convention, the Bill of Rights Committee explained that the purpose of the provision was to \"presume the openness of government documents and operations\" to combat \"government's sheer bigness[, which] threatens the effective exercise of citizenship.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 631. The Bill of Rights Committee of the 1972 Constitutional Convention clearly modeled the language of Article II, Section 9, on Montana's 1963 open meeting law, which applied to \"[a]ll meetings of\n   <em>\n    public or governmental bodies\n   </em>\n   , boards, bureaus, commissions [and]\n   <em>\n    agencies of the state or any political\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    subdivision\n   </em>\n   .\" See \u00a7 82-3402, RCM (1947) (emphasis added); 1963 Mont. Laws ch. 159, \u00a7 2; Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, pp. 631-32; Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1669-70. The Committee intended that Article II, Section 9, would expand the availability of government documents beyond the more narrow 1895 statutory definitions of public and private writings then codified at Title 93, chapter 1001, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3, RCM (1947). See Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, pp. 631-32; Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcripts, March 7, 1972, p. 1670. We thus have construed Article II, Section 9, as creating \"a constitutional presumption that every document within the possession of public officials is subject to inspection.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 The Bill of Rights Committee cautioned, however, that the right to know is not absolute. Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 632 (\"The committee intends by this provision that the right to know\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be absolute.\"). Recognizing that they were defining a constitutional right and not drafting a statute, the Chair of the Bill of Rights Committee, Wade Joseph Dahood, explained to the other delegates that Article II, Section 9, is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   stated in a broad principle form. It's the type of constitutional right that must necessarily be expressed in general terms; the specific guidelines that perhaps some of the critics would like cannot be stated within that particular section if it's to fall within the framework of a true constitutional principle. It's a principle that must endure for the decades and the ages. ... [T]he court shall interpret within this particular doctrine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, p. 2489. Though largely focused on balancing with the individual right to privacy protected by Article II, Section 10-\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 632; Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1670; Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, p. 2484-the Framers understood that the right to know would be subject to interpretation and considered together with other constitutional rights and existing laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1679 (noting that \"all rights have to be balanced against a police power\" in accord with \"that doctrine\" of the U.S. Supreme Court in response to Delegate McDonough's question as to whether Article II, Section 9, would afford criminal defendants a\n   broader right to\n   examine confidential criminal justice information). The Framers recognized that, like other fundamental rights protected in the federal and state constitutions, the parameters of the right to know would be interpreted over time in the context of particular factual situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Importantly, during debate on Article II, Section 9, the delegates acknowledged instances, unrelated to individual privacy concerns, in which the right to know would not apply: when \"necessary for the integrity of government.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1678. For example, the delegates acknowledged the then-existing open meeting laws and existing exceptions to open meetings. Multiple delegates expressed the intention that Article II, Section 9, did not abrogate those laws; no delegate spoke to the opposite conclusion. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1677-78. Further, the delegates discussed multiple other instances in which they did not intend for Article II, Section 9, to change current law and practice. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, pp. 2494-2500. Of singular import here, convention deliberations clearly indicate that the Framers did not intend for Article II, Section 9, to abolish, supersede, or alter preexisting legal privileges applicable to government proceedings and documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 For example, opposing a motion to revise the language of Article II, Section 9, to allow the Legislature to define privacy exceptions to the public's right to know as advocated by press interests, the Chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   How about the\n   <em>\n    confidential relationships\n   </em>\n   that are\n   <em>\n    set by statute\n   </em>\n   that are zealously guarded? Should they not be protected? Should not communication with respect to a private matter that deals with some governmental concern between attorney and client not be protected? Perhaps there's some disclosure between priest and penitent, doctor and patient, the sacred relationships that are so important in a free society; should they not be paramount? Should they not be supreme?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 5, 1972, pp. 1673-74 (emphasis added). In response to concerns that the broad language of Article II, Section 9, would upset preexisting privileges protecting the integrity of government operations, the Chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee advised the Committee that it would not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   DELEGATE SKARI: Mr. Dahood, in Section 82-3402, Revised Codes of Montana, in Section 4, they say that one of the\n   exceptions is \"the purchasing of public property, the investing of public funds, or other matters involving competition or bargaining which, if made public, may adversely affect the public security or financial interest of the state or any political subdivision or agency of the state.\" Does your Bill of Rights Section 9 cover that sort of thing?

When I think of a public body deliberating, I think first of a jury ... I think also of grand juries. ... Those deliberations ought not to be open. ... For that reason I think we should strike the words \"bodies or,\" because ... that terminology ... is clearly broad enough to include the deliberations of a ... jury. Similarly, ... take the deliberations of the Supreme Court. That's a public body. Is it to be understood that Mr. Davis, or Mr. Dahood, or myself, if we're on opposite sides of the case, having finished the argument, may then go into chambers with the court and observe their deliberations in the judgment of the case we just argued? ... Now I want to see all agencies, in particular, opened up to the public. I want their documents examined; I want their deliberations open. I am particularly interested in the operations of the city councils and boards of county commissioners, as well as all other agencies and commissions and forms of government. ...

In response, Nelson simply presented a blanket challenge, insisting that no documents could be withheld on privilege grounds consistent with Article II, Section 9. The case thus does not require us to determine under what circumstances the City's and MMIA's claimed privileges could yield to the right to know, and we decline to speculate. The District Court appropriately recognized that Nelson's position that the government cannot withhold privileged documents would be \"antithetical to\" the public interests the privileges serve and would \"render [ ] the attorney client privilege [and attorney-work-product privilege] meaningless.\" Nelson was free to object to MMIA's and the City's claims of privilege on the legal grounds that the privileges should not apply to protect particular documents. But he did not do so. Based on the record before it, the District Court correctly determined that documents protected by the attorney-client and attorney-work-product privileges were not subject to release under Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b638 The District Court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   DIRK M.

The Court's reasoning contains inconsistent statements and rules of law, distorted interpretations of the 1972 Convention proceedings, and is inundated\n   with unnecessary dicta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court states that the attorney-client privilege is not absolute, Opinion, \u00b6 31, the Court confuses narrowly interpreting the privilege, Opinion, \u00b6 34, with its creation of an impenetrable exception to a citizen's constitutional right to inspect documents of public bodies. Thus, regardless of the information contained within the document and the need of citizens to inspect its contents in order to effectuate the right to know and monitor a particular activity of their government, the documents are automatically beyond the purview of a court and citizens whenever the document is created out of the government's relationship with its counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   An impenetrable judicially created exception to the public's constitutional right to know is not only unsupported by our precedent and Montana's Constitution, but is an unwise impediment to a citizen's ability to monitor the functioning of its government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The interests of\n   the government in protecting the confidentiality of particular documents and the constitutional presumption of a citizen's right to inspect those documents should be balanced by a court; a court is both neutral and in the best position to consider the circumstances of any particular case and claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b640 This Court has long recognized that the right to know is not absolute and must be balanced against other constitutional interests. I would not jettison decades of precedent, as the Court implicitly does, to reach a distorted conclusion that documents prepared by a public entity in relation to its business of governance are not presumptively \"documents of public bodies.\" Opinion, \u00b6 30. Despite this Court's apparent desire to simplify right-to-know disputes by placing governance and litigation upon which it becomes embroiled beyond public examination, it is the job of the courts to protect constitutional rights as they are expressly written and to consider them in the context of other weighty and compelling interests. Indeed, balancing of competing interests by the third branch of government, a court, was envisioned by the Delegates, not just within the parameters of Article II, Section 9, itself, but as a mechanism to consider the constitutional provision within the circumstances of a particular case. Our courts routinely balance these interests and have well-developed precedent to guide them. Nonetheless, the Court, for the first time in our history interpreting this constitutional provision, applies a statutory privilege available generally to any litigant to keep public documents confidential. The Court does so without proper regard for the constitutional right to know or adequate consideration that the litigant here is not just any litigant, but a\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b641 It is my opinion that the Court errs, first, by concluding that documents created out of the government's relationship with counsel are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   documents of public bodies subject to disclosure under Article II, Section 9. Opinion, \u00b6 30. Second, the Court errs when it unconditionally subjugates an express constitutional right to a statutory privilege, thus excepting from judicial scrutiny any consideration of the public's right to know and\n   monitor a particular activity of governance. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 36. Finally, the Court's analysis categorically adopts general principles of a statutory privilege to circumscribe a constitutional right-without regard to the public nature of the client. The Court's \"back door\" approach of defining a constitutional right by a statutory privilege is unsound and compromises fundamental principles underlying the right to know. Such an approach will prove difficult when citizens have a need, for example, to learn of government practices that can only be ascertained\n   by examining documents created in the context of the government's relationship with counsel. Under the Court's approach, the statutory privilege takes priority over the constitutional right, thus directing the inquiry and precluding any judicial review of the public's constitutional right to know the contents of the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b642 The starting point for any right-to-know analysis is the constitutional provision itself. The Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 9, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   There is no dispute that MMIA and the City are government entities subject to the disclosure requirements of Article II, Section 9. Further, this Court has recognized that the Delegates' adoption of Article II, Section 9, created a \"constitutional presumption that every document within the possession of public officials is subject to inspection.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39. If the issue could be resolved completely within the confines of Article II, Section 9, then Nelson would be entitled to the documents in MMIA and the City's possession because the privacy protection included in the latter section of Article II, Section 9, does not pertain to non-human entities, such as MMIA and the City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tribune III\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 36-37. However, Nelson's claim made pursuant to his presumptive right to inspect the documents is only the starting point for the inquiry. The analysis must thereafter consider the government's potentially countervailing confidentiality privileges, which are substantial and exist outside the parameters of Article II, Section 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b643 However, the Court completely excludes the documents from disclosure under Article II, Section 9, by finding that documents protected by the attorney-client and attorney-work-product privileges are not documents of public bodies. Opinion, \u00b6 30. To support its finding that the privileged documents are not subject to Article II, Section 9, scrutiny, the Court considers the historical roots of the privileges, the 1972 Convention proceedings, and the Constitution's Transition Schedule. Opinion, \u00b6 30. While recognizing that Article II, Section 9, contains \"broad, clear, and unambiguous language\" requiring disclosure of all public documents, the Court maintains that the privileges were \"essential components\" of the legal system prior to 1972 and thus privileged documents are not subject to disclosure under Article II, Section 9. Opinion, \u00b6 30. I disagree with the Court's reasoning that privileged documents are not documents of public\n   bodies due, almost exclusively, to the fact that the privileges predated the 1972 Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b644 I take particular issue with the way in which the Court relies upon portions of the Constitutional Convention Transcripts. The Court first recognizes, based on the Transcripts, that \"the Framers understood that the right to know would be subject to interpretation and considered together with other constitutional rights and existing laws\" and that \"like other fundamental rights protected in the federal and state constitutions, the parameters of the right to know would be interpreted over time in the context of particular factual situations.\" Opinion, \u00b6 19. I agree that the right to know is subject to our interpretation and should be\n   <em>\n    considered together\n   </em>\n   with other constitutional rights and existing laws. Further, I see this case as an opportunity to consider how the right to know may limit certain evidentiary privileges. However, the Court completely removes documents protected by the attorney-work-product and attorney-client privileges from constitutional scrutiny under Article II, Section 9, based, in large part, upon the Delegates' purported intent as ascertained from the Constitutional Convention Transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b645 I find the Court's analysis of the Transcripts inconsistent with the context of the Delegates' discussions. For example, in Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, the Court extensively quotes and cites from the Delegates' discussion on March 7, 1972, Verbatim Transcript pages 1673-78, in support of its conclusion that the Delegates did not intend for the right to know to affect the existing privileges. However, that debate was solely focused on whether the right to know should contain an explicit exception for cases in which the demands of individual privacy exceeded the merits of public disclosure. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1672. Some Delegates were concerned that the individual privacy exception was too subjective and that public bodies would be able to cover up \"vital public matters\" by hiding information within the exception. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1672. Proponents of the exception went on to explain that the exception was necessary because certain documents, such as an individual's welfare application containing personal and sensitive information, should not be available for public inspection. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1673.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b646 It was within that conversation, focused on the right to know's exception for individual privacy, that the Chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee stated that confidential relationships set by statute\n   should be \"zealously guarded.\" Opinion, \u00b6 21 (quoting Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1673-74). The Charmain opined that the attorney-client relationship should protect communication between attorney and client \"with respect to a private matter that deals with some governmental concern.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1673. The Chairman was not contemplating a situation where the government is the client and commenting on whether the right to know applies to that attorney-client relationship; instead, he was commenting on instances in which the demand of an individual's privacy, which is undisputedly not at issue here, may exceed the merits of public disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b647 Similarly, the Court's quoted material regarding protecting the integrity of government operations, Opinion, \u00b6 21, was also pulled from the Delegates' debate over the individual privacy exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, pp. 1677-78. Further, that conversation was focused on open meetings and the Delegates were specifically discussing whether the right to know would alter or limit existing statutes as they relate to open meetings. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1677. The Court's conclusion that the Delegates intended all statutes to remain in full effect, despite the new right to know provision, is inconsistent with the Delegates' actual conversation, which was simply a discussion regarding different Delegates' opinions on how the right to know, as drafted with an exception for individual privacy, would limit or otherwise affect existing open meeting laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b648 Further, the Court cites the Transcript pages 2494-2500 for the proposition that \"the delegates discussed multiple other instances in which they did not intend for Article II, Section 9, to change current law and practice.\" Opinion, \u00b6 20. However, during those debates, the Delegates were considering whether the right to know's exception for individual privacy should be amended to add language that \"\n   <em>\n    the Legislature, subject to court interpretation, shall have determined that\n   </em>\n   the demands of individual privacy exceed the merits of public disclosure.\" Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, pp. 2484-99 (emphasis added). Thus, that conversation was, again, focused on the individual privacy exception to the right to know. One Delegate also proposed amending Section 9 to rephrase \"public bodies or agencies\" to \"public agencies,\" based on concerns for individual privacy. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, pp. 2499-2500 (focusing, still, on the\n   privacy exception, as evidenced by Delegate Berg stating, \"I would call your attention to the last portion which reads that: 'unless the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure.' \"). The amendment ultimately failed, but it was\n   sought to clarify that certain deliberations, including those of juries, grand juries, and the Supreme Court, were not subject to public viewing under the right to know. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 16, 1972, p. 2501. The Court inappropriately takes bits-and-pieces of specific Delegates' opinions, as stated during Convention debate, and asserts those opinions as the intent of all of the Delegates. In doing so, the Court takes the Delegates' statements out of the contexts in which they were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b649 The Court states that it \"is not reasonable to conclude that the Framers intended to eliminate these privileges for public bodies in Montana,\" Opinion, \u00b6 28, and I agree that the privileges, as applied to public bodies, surely survived enactment of the 1972 Constitution. In my opinion, however, the Court's decision today neglects the fact that the 1972 Constitution contains a right-to-know provision requiring disclosure of documents of public bodies. The Bill of Rights Committee presented the right to know to the rest of the Convention as creating a general constitutional presumption that government documents and operations would be open to the public. Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 631. The Committee intended the provision to be \"a long step forward\" in assuring government openness to increase the public's confidence in government operations. Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 22, 1972, p. 632. The Court's decision goes against the Committee's stated interests by completely excluding privileged documents of public bodies from Article II, Section 9, scrutiny. As the Court recognizes, \"a constitution assumes the existence of a well understood system of law which is still to remain in force and to be administered,\n   <em>\n    but under constitutional limitation\n   </em>\n   .\" Opinion, \u00b6 15 (quoting Grossman,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2470671\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/209/427/#p451\">\n    209 Mont. at 451-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2470671\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/209/427/#p451\">\n    682 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1332 ) (emphasis added). The Court further relies on the Constitution's Transition Schedule, which states, in part, that laws and rules in existence prior to the Constitution's enactment \"remain in force,\n   <em>\n    until they ... shall be altered or repealed pursuant to this Constitution.\n   </em>\n   \" Opinion, \u00b6 22 (quoting Mont. Const. Transition Schedule \u00a7 6(1) ) (emphasis added). Accordingly, while I agree that enactment of the right-to-know provision in 1972 did not eliminate public bodies' privileges, I believe that we must determine whether documents protected by the privileges are subject to Article II, Section 9, scrutiny,\n   and, if subject to the right to know, how the privileges are now limited or altered by the constitutional right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b650 Nonetheless, the Court, once again, distorts precedent by relying on\n   <em>\n    Chilinski\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a privilege existing at common law may withstand the clear and express language of a subsequently adopted constitutional provision. Opinion, \u00b6 30. In\n   <em>\n    Chilinski\n   </em>\n   , this Court recognized that the right to a jury trial was adopted as part of the 1889 Constitution and was recodified in the 1972 Constitution. Based upon recodification of the right, this Court held that a jury trial was guaranteed in the class of cases where the right was enjoyed when the constitution was adopted in 1889. The 1972 constitutional provision for a jury trial did not alter, repeal, or limit the 1889 constitutional provision; rather it adopted in full force the provision as it existed in 1889.\n   <em>\n    Chilinski\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. In contrast, here, the express language of Article II, Section 9, which was\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   to the 1972 Constitution, constitutionally limits any preexisting rules and laws inconsistent with the right to know.

Specifically, the attorney-work-product privilege protects \"documents and tangible things that are prepared in\n   anticipation of litigation or for trial\" unless those materials are \"otherwise discoverable under [M. R. Civ. P.] 26(b)(1)\" or if \"the party shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.\" M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(i)-(ii). Thus, a party cannot hide relevant facts by asserting attorney-work-product privilege, because parties may access information within the privilege that is not otherwise discoverable. The attorney-work-product privilege is unique, as an attorney must be able to \"assemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, [and] prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference\" in order to adequately represent his client.\n   <em>\n    Hickman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158152\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/495/#p510\">\n    329 U.S. at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158152\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/495/#p510\">\n    67 S.Ct. at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b653 The attorney-work-product privilege is focused on the documents an attorney herself produces as she represents a client. The work-product is particular to that attorney and is privileged from disclosure to protect the client's interests. An attorney, in working through a case, creates her own documents, makes her own notations, and organizes her own files in a particular manner consistent with her strategies specific to that case. The work-product is not a document of a public body, as the attorney, not the client, created the work-product. Accordingly, the attorney's work-product cannot be subject to disclosure under the right to know, as the work-product is not a document of a public body or agency. Thus, I agree with the Court that documents appropriately protected under the attorney-work-product privilege are not documents of public bodies subject to disclosure under Article II, Section 9. Opinion, \u00b6 30. If the documents are not documents of public bodies, then Article II, Section 9, is not applicable and Nelson has no constitutional right to know their contents. Because attorney-work-product is not subject to disclosure under Article II, Section 9, no further constitutional analysis is needed, as the right to know does not apply to documents that are not those of public bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b654 I disagree, however, with the Court's conclusion that documents protected under the attorney-client privilege are not documents of public bodies and therefore never subject to disclosure under Article II, Section 9. Opinion, \u00b6 30. The attorney-client privilege protects \"any communication made by the client to the attorney or the advice given to the client in the course of professional employment.\" Section 26-1-803(1), MCA. The attorney-client privilege promotes and protects the attorney-client relationship by encouraging clients to fully inform their attorneys and encouraging attorneys to provide candid legal advice to their clients.\n   <em>\n    Am. Zurich Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9, 24. The privilege is\n   necessarily narrow, protecting only \"disclosures-necessary to obtain informed legal advice-which might not have been made absent the privilege.\" Opinion, \u00b6 31 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Am. Zurich Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10 ). Documents relating to such communications and advice are protected under the attorney-client privilege, but also may be considered \"documents of public bodies\" when the client is a public body, based on the \"constitutional presumption that every document within the possession of public officials is subject to inspection.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b655 I do not believe, however, that the documents, as documents of public bodies, are always discoverable pursuant to Article II, Section 9, as Nelson contends. As the Court recognizes, the right to know is not absolute. Opinion, \u00b6 13. Article II, Section 9, does not unequivocally require disclosure of public documents where the sought-after information is elsewhere protected from disclosure by statute or the federal or state constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Tribune III\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39. While there exists a \"constitutional presumption that all documents of every kind in the hands of public officials are amenable to inspection, regardless of legislation, special exceptions [are] made to accommodate the exercise of constitutional police power and other competing constitutional interests, such as due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Associated Press, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 85 (Nelson, J., specially concurring) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Belth v.

Instead of recognizing that the attorney-client privilege may now be limited by the right to know, the Court completely excludes the privileged, public documents from Article II, Section 9, scrutiny. Opinion, \u00b6 30. The Court's blanket exclusion of all privileged documents from Article II, Section 9, analysis is unwarranted, as there are some instances where the merits of public disclosure may indeed exceed the asserted privilege. To use a current national event as an example, it was recently revealed that Stormy Daniels (Stephanie Clifford) was paid $130,000 in the fall of 2016 to keep quiet about an alleged on-again, off-again affair between herself and Donald Trump.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Daniels received the payment from a shell company in Delaware; a company set up by Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the sole purpose of passing the payment to Daniels. Cohen, in a recent statement, indicated that he used personal funds to\n   <em>\n    facilitate\n   </em>\n   the payment, but it is still unclear who actually paid Daniels the $130,000. It is also unclear whether and to what extent Trump himself was personally involved in any negotiation discussion or payment. Because Cohen is Trump's attorney, the attorney-client privilege likely protects most of the information regarding Trump's potential involvement. Under the Court's decision, if a similar matter was at issue in Montana, the public would be excluded from requesting any information regarding the monetary exchange pursuant to Article II, Section 9, if the information is protected by the attorney-client privilege. However, it is my view that the public should be able to utilize its right to know and ask for privileged information if the public's interest in the information is sufficiently weighty or compelling. Accordingly, in situations where attorney-client privileged documents are requested pursuant to Article II, Section 9, I believe the appropriate approach is to balance the public's right to know with the weighty and compelling attorney-client privilege to determine whether, in that case, the merits of public disclosure exceed the privilege's protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b657 Such an analysis is consistent with our Article II, Section 9, precedent. Significant to our discussion here, the right to know \"can be properly circumscribed when the right or interest against which it competes is weighty or compelling.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525131\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/201/376/#p383\">\n    201 Mont. at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525131\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/201/376/#p383\">\n    654 P.2d at 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We considered the competing rights and decided that the public may be excluded from an otherwise public hearing \"only if dissemination of information acquired at the hearing would create a clear and present danger to the fairness of defendant's trial and no reasonable\n   alternative means can be utilized to\n   avoid the prejudicial effect of such information.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525131\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/201/376/#p383\">\n    201 Mont. at 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525131\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/201/376/#p383\">\n    654 P.2d at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those other rights and interests, however, must be weighty or compelling enough to justify nondisclosure of otherwise public information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b659 In determining whether a right or interest is weighty or compelling enough to overcome the public's right to know, we must balance various factors while looking at the totality of the circumstances. The relevant factors to balance will depend on the specifics of each case. In the same way we balance \"the competing constitutional interests in the context of the facts of each case, to determine whether the demands of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure,\"\n   <em>\n    Associated Press, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24 (internal quotations, citations, and emphasis omitted), we should also balance other competing interests to determine whether, based on the facts of each case, a right or interest is weighty or compelling enough to exceed the merits of public disclosure. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Associated Press, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered factors such as \"the type of taxpayer involved ..., the source of the information provided by the taxpayer, and the public's interest in the information\" to determine \"whether a taxpayer's right of privacy outweighs the public's right to know.\"\n   <em>\n    Associated Press, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b660 Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Worden\n   </em>\n   , we balanced an inmate's right of privacy in his parole file with the public's right to know.\n   <em>\n    Worden\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. We held that \"each document in an Inmate's file must be examined to determine whether all or part of it is subject to the privacy exception of the right to know.\"\n   <em>\n    Worden\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29. We acknowledged the fluidity and case-specific nature of such an inquiry, pointing out that \"an Inmate has a strong privacy interest in his or her own parole file,\" and that a third person's request to examine the file requires a different analysis than the inmate's request to examine his own file.\n   <em>\n    Worden\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30. Thus, we decided that we must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an inmate or a third party has a privacy interest in each \"document that outweighs the requesting party's right to know.\"\n   <em>\n    Worden\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30. In the same way, we should require a case-specific balancing of the right to know with the other rights or interests being asserted to determine whether a right or interest is weighty or compelling enough to exceed the merits of public disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b661 In these proceedings, I would clarify that documents appropriately\n   protected by the attorney-work-product privilege are not documents of public bodies and thus not subject to Article II, Section 9, analysis. I would then reaffirm that the right to know, like all constitutional rights, is not absolute, as there could be instances where the public has the right to know information which is also protected by the statutory attorney-client privilege. Under such circumstances, the statutory privilege should not automatically preclude a court's consideration of a litigant's constitutional right to know. Rather, as our well-established jurisprudence recognizes, we should balance the statutory attorney-client privilege asserted by MMIA and the City to determine whether the privilege constitutes an interest weighty or compelling enough to overcome the constitutional presumption of the public's right to inspect the documents. Here, Nelson presented a blanket challenge to MMIA and the City's claims of privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the record, I would affirm the District Court's determination that the documents are protected by the attorney-work-product and attorney-client privileges. I would further hold that any documents covered only by the attorney-client privilege were properly withheld by MMIA and the City because, in this case, the parties' interest in protecting the documents under the attorney-client privilege is weighty and compelling enough to exceed the merits of public disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b662 Accordingly, I disagree with the Court's analysis and maintain that it is unsound and unsupported by the Montana Constitution\n   and this Court's precedent.
