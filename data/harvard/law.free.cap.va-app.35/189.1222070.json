On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in allowing a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) to (1) give expert testimony regarding the cause of the victim\u2019s injuries and (2) testify regarding the ultimate fact in issue and (3) in finding the evidence was sufficient to prove his guilt. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to that evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>678 (1997). So viewed, the evidence established that on March 18, 1997, A.L., the fifteen-year-old victim, went to appellant\u2019s house to retrieve a book she had lent to appellant\u2019s wife. Appellant told A.L. to sit down and attempted to kiss her. A.L. told appellant, \u201cno,\u201d and said she needed to leave. A struggle ensued, and A.L. and appellant fell to the floor with appellant on top of A.L. Appellant pulled A.L.\u2019s pants and underwear down to her knees as A.L. continued to tell appellant, \u201cno,\u201d and tried to get up from the floor. Appellant also pulled his pants down to his knees. While appellant was on top of A.L. with his waist \u201cbetween [A.L.\u2019s] knees\u201d and head \u201cover top of [her] stomach,\u201d A.L. felt a sharp pain \u201cinside of [her] vagina area.\u201d Appellant\u2019s \u201cbottom half\u2019 was \u201c[m]aking an up and down movement\u201d when she felt the pain in her vagina, and his hands were on the floor on either side of her. Appellant admitted he touched and put his fingers in her. After five minutes of struggling with A.L., appellant became \u201cirritated\u201d and stood up. A.L. dressed and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Later that evening, A.L. told her mother what happened. Her mother took her to Fairfax Hospital where she was examined by Barbara Patt (Patt), a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE). Patt was allowed to testify, over appellant\u2019s objection, as an \u201cexpert in the diagnosis of a sexual assault.\u201d She testified that in her opinion the physical findings she made regarding A.L.\u2019s injuries were \u201cinconsistent with consensual intercourse.\u201d Appellant objected to Patt\u2019s testimony regarding causation of the injuries and on the ground that Patt\u2019s testimony concerned the \u201cultimate fact in issue.\u201d The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection, and he was found guilty of rape by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II. Expert Witness Designation and Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Appellant first contends the trial court erred in allowing Patt, a SANE nurse, to testify as an expert witness regarding the cause of the victim\u2019s injuries. Appellant argues that Patt lacked the expertise required to allow her to state \u201can expert medical opinion regarding the cause of the alleged victim\u2019s injury.\u201d Appellant also contends Patt\u2019s testimony that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201calleged victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with non-consensual intercourse and inconsistent with consensual intercourse\u201d was improper testimony on the ultimate issue. We address these issues seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">A. Patt\u2019s Qualifications as an Expert Witness</p>\n<p id=\"ArU\">\u201cThe issue whether a witness is qualified to render an expert opinion is a question submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Combs v. Norfolk and Western Ry. Co., </em>256 Va. 490, 496, 507 S.E.2d 355, 358 (1998) (citations omitted). However, \u201c[t]he record must show that the proffered expert witness has sufficient knowledge, skill, or experience to render [her] competent to testify as an expert on the subject matter of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">A witness qualifies as an expert if \u201cbecause of his skill, training, or experience^], he is better able to form a more accurate opinion as to the matter under consideration than is an ordinary person.\u201d ... [Specialized formal training [i]s unnecessary, ... [and] experience alone [can] qualify one as an expert,.... [A]s long as the testimony is based upon information of the \u201ctype reasonably relied upon by experts in the field,\u201d it would be proper to admit it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>Utz v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 411, 424, 505 S.E.2d 380, 386 (1998) (citation omitted). An expert is qualified as long as he or she possesses specialized knowledge that will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence presented or to determine a fact in issue. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThe fact that a witness is an expert in one field does not make him an expert in another field, even though the two fields are closely related.\u201d <em>Combs, </em>256 Va. at 496, 507 S.E.2d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In the instant case, Patt became a nurse following a \u201cthree year 33 month\u201d diploma program at Mercy Hospital. She was a registered nurse for twenty-six years, had sixteen years of emergency nursing experience and three and one-half years of neurosurgical nursing experience. In 1991, she took a specialized course at Cabrio College to become a sexual assault nurse examiner. The course required forty hours of classroom education and forty hours of hands-on clinical in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>struction. She received additional training in crisis intervention, physical assessment, injury recognition, documentation, evidence collection, photography and injury assessment. Patt was taught to compare and contrast normal and abnormal findings in a physical examination as part of her training in injury assessment. This training also included clinical work.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Patt worked as a SANE nurse for six and one-half years before becoming the clinical coordinator and nursing supervisor at Fair Oaks Hospital. While working as a SANE nurse, Patt performed approximately 350 adult examinations and 150 examinations of children. She also witnessed or \u201cchaperoned\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thousands of pelvic examinations done by physicians and discussed their findings. Patt also participated with other SANE nurses in peer review of their examinations, using tapes, photographs and reports. She had previously been qualified to give expert testimony by many courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">After reviewing her training and qualifications, the trial judge qualified her to testify as \u201can expert in the diagnosis of a sexual assault.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that based upon Patt\u2019s training and experience she had knowledge concerning matters beyond a lay person\u2019s common knowledge and would assist the jury in understanding the evidence. <em>See Utz, </em>28 Va.App. at 423, 505 S.E.2d at 386. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Patt to testify as \u201can expert in the diagnosis of a sexual assault.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>B. Patt\u2019s Testimony Regarding the Cause of the Victim\u2019s Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The issue of whether a SANE nurse can testify as an expert regarding the cause of trauma in a sexual assault is a case of first impression for this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, a recent case decided by the Court of Appeals of Georgia addressed the issue of whether a SANE nurse was properly qualified as an expert in \u201cthe field of examination of sexual assault victims.\u201d <em>Griffin v. State, </em>248 Ga.App. 282, 531 S.E.2d 175, 180 (2000) (reconsideration denied March 30, 2000; <em>cert, denied, </em>September 8, 2000). The SANE nurse in question had worked in women\u2019s health since 1971 and as an obstetrical nurse with gynecological experience for twenty-three years. She had specialized training in the examination of victims of sexual assaults and in the collection of evidence from sexual assaults. As a SANE nurse, she performed approximately 100 examinations at a rape crisis center. Looking at her qualifications, the Court of Appeals of Georgia held that the trial court properly qualified the SANE nurse as an expert in \u201cthe field of examination of sexual assault victims.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Kent v. State, </em>245 Ga.App. 531, 538 S.E.2d 185, 188 (2000) (SANE nurse testified as an expert that \u201cthe multiple tearing she observed in the victim\u2019s vaginal area was consistent with the use of force and not with normal sexual intercourse\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Appellant relies on <em>Combs, </em>256 Va. 490, 507 S.E.2d 355, for the proposition that no expert witness can give an opinion regarding causation unless the person is also a licensed medical doctor. We find that interpretation unsupported by an analysis of the case. In <em>Combs, </em>a witness was qualified as an \u201cexpert witness on the subject of biomechanical engineering.\u201d <em>Combs, </em>256 Va. at 494, 507 S.E.2d at 357. The witness had a \u201cbachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering, a master\u2019s degree in medical science, and a Ph.D. in fluid, thermal and aerospace sciences, with a specialization in biomedical engineering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHe is a professor of engineering, science, and mechanics and is the director of the biomedical engineering program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the witness \u201chad completed all the academic work required for a medical degree, [he] had not completed a medical internship or residency and was not licensed to practice medicine.\u201d <em>Id. Combs </em>held that an expert in \u201cthe field of biomechanical engineering\u201d could not testify as to medical causation even though he had completed the \u201cacademic work required for a medical degree\u201d because \u201c[t]he fact that a witness is an expert in one field does not make him an expert in another field, even though the two fields are closely related.\u201d <em>Combs, </em>256 Va. at 496, 507 S.E.2d at 358. Thus, the Court held that an expert in \u201cthe field of biomechanical engineering\u201d was not an expert in \u201cmedical causation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In the instant case, Patt was trained as a medical nurse with specialized training as a sexual assault nurse examiner in injury recognition and treatment of sexual assault victims. She was qualified as \u201can expert in the diagnosis of a sexual assault,\u201d and her expertise clearly encompassed the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>about which she testified. She personally observed the victim and the tests she administered showed A.L.\u2019s injuries to be a \u201crecent injury\u201d with \u201cno lubrication,\u201d indicating an absence of the human sexual response. She concluded her descriptive testimony by stating that in her opinion her findings were \u201cinconsistent with consensual intercourse\u201d because the injuries A.L. had are \u201cconsistent with non-consensual intercourse.\u201d As \u201can expert in the diagnosis of a sexual assault,\u201d she possessed sufficient knowledge, skill, training and experience in the diagnosis of sexual assaults to qualify as an expert in the field. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing her to testify regarding her observations and her conclusions based upon those observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">C. Patt\u2019s Testimony on an Ultimate Issue of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"ABA\">Appellant further contends Patt impermissibly testified on the ultimate issue of fact when she stated that her findings were \u201cinconsistent with consensual intercourse\u201d because A.L.\u2019s injuries were \u201cconsistent with non-consensual intercourse.\u201d \u201cExpert opinion on an ultimate fact in issue is inadmissible in a criminal case because it \u2018invade[s] the province of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 333, 336, 492 S.E.2d 131, 132 (1997) (quoting <em>Llamera v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 264, 414 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1992)). This case is factually similar to <em>Hussen v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 93, 511 S.E.2d 106 (1999), where a sexual assault nurse examiner testified that the injuries of the victim \u201care not consistent with a virgin having sex for the first time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 511 S.E.2d at 108. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">Brown\u2019s testimony was not an opinion that the sexual intercourse between the defendant and the victim was against her will. Rather, Brown\u2019s testimony, which must be viewed as a whole, reflects her opinion that the unique nature of the victim\u2019s laceration, particularly the location of the injury, was not <em>consistent </em>with consensual, first time intercourse. Such an opinion by this expert witness is not a comment on one of the ultimate issues of fact to be determined by the jury, that is, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>was against the victim\u2019s will. <em>See Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 728, 731-32, 406 S.E.2d 922, 923-24 (1991) (detective\u2019s testimony that a certain quantity of drugs was not consistent with personal use did not constitute an opinion that the defendant intended to distribute marijuana and, thus, did not invade the province of the jury).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><em>Hussen, </em>257 Va. at 99, 511 S.E.2d at 109 (emphasis in original). Patt\u2019s testimony in the instant case is virtually identical to Brown\u2019s testimony in <em>Hussen. </em>Patt testified that, \u201cI have an opinion that [the physical findings are] <em>inconsistent </em>with consensual intercourse\u201d and the basis for that opinion was \u201c[b]ecause she [sic] injuries she had are <em>consistent </em>with non-consensual intercourse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Patt\u2019s testimony is \u201cnot a comment on one of the ultimate issues of fact to be determined by the jury, that is, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was against the victim\u2019s will.\u201d As in <em>Hussen, </em>Patt\u2019s testimony only dealt with consistencies and inconsistencies. Patt did not testify that, in her opinion, appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with A.L. against A.L.\u2019s will, the ultimate issue in the case. She merely described A.L.\u2019s injuries as \u201cinconsistent\u201d with consensual intercourse. Accordingly we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing her testimony over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">III. Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Lastly, appellant contends the prosecution\u2019s evidence \u201cdoes not prove penetration,\u201d a necessary element of rape. \u2018\u201cRape is defined as \u201csexual intercourse against the victim\u2019s will by force, threat, or intimidation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 654, 681, 529 S.E.2d 769, 785 (2000) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 95, 100, 452 S.E.2d 669, 673, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 841, 116 S.Ct. 127, 133 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995) (quoting <em>Hoke v. Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 303, 310, 377 S.E.2d 595, 599, <em>cert. denied, </em>491 U.S. 910, 109 S.Ct. 3201, 105 L.Ed.2d 709 (1989))); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-61. \u201c \u2018 \u201cPenetration by a penis of a vagina is an essential element of the crime of rape; proof of penetration, however slight the entry may be, is sufficient.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>259 Va. at 682, 529 S.E.2d at 785 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(quoting <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 184, 186, 491 S.E.2d 739, 740 (1997) (quoting <em>Elam v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 113, 115, 326 S.E.2d 685, 686 (1985))). \u201c \u2018Penetration maybe prove[n] by circumstantial evidence and is not dependent on direct testimony from the victim that penetration occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jett v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 190, 194, 510 S.E.2d 747, 748 (1999) (quoting <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 300, 301, 391 S.E.2d 612, 612 (1990)). When convincing, circumstantial evidence may be more compelling and persuasive than direct evidence and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 194, 510 S.E.2d at 748-49. Evidence concerning the condition, position, and proximity of the parties can provide sufficient evidence of penetration. <em>Morrison, </em>10 Va.App. at 301, 391 S.E.2d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">A.L. testified that when she and appellant fell to the floor, appellant was on top of her. He pulled her pants and underwear down to her knees and did the same to his pants and underwear. A.L. testified that she \u201cfelt a sharp pain inside of [her] vagina area\u201d when appellant\u2019s head was on the top of her stomach, his waist was between her knees and <em>his hands were \u201con the floor laying flat beside my hips.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The pain continued for \u201cfive minutes\u201d as appellant\u2019s \u201cbottom half\u2019 was \u201c[m]aking an up and down movement.\u201d This evidence concerning the relative positions of the parties and the victim\u2019s testimony of concurrent pain was sufficient for the jury to find appellant penetrated A.L. Furthermore, Patt testified that A.L. had recent injuries, including lacerations in the vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore </em>is misplaced. Unlike the instant case, the inconsistencies in <em>Moore </em>were developed in the prosecution\u2019s presentation of evidence during the victim\u2019s direct examination. <em>Moore, </em>254 Va. at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 741-42. Furthermore, the <em>Moore </em>Court emphasized the unique situation presented in the case by stating that \u201cwhere inconsistencies have been developed during cross-examination of the victim or .. . where there has been other evidence contradicting the testimony of the victim ... those types of credibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ty issues are for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 491 S.E.2d at 742. Thus, A.L.\u2019s admission on cross-examination that appellant used his hands on her and appellant\u2019s own testimony that he only used his hands on A.L. do not negate the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The inconsistencies presented an issue of credibility for the jury. Furthermore, AL.\u2019s testimony on direct was corroborated by Patt\u2019s testimony and conclusions. A.L.\u2019s testimony on direct that during at least part of the time she felt the \u201csharp pain inside of [her] vagina area\u201d both of appellant\u2019s hands were on the floor is sufficient to allow the jury to find that appellant penetrated A.L. with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing Patt to testify as an expert witness and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. Hospital policy required a female chaperon to be present with the physician on duty at all times during any pelvic examination in the emergency room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\">. In his brief, appellant alleges that Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2900, 54.1-2903 and 54.1-3000 do not allow SANE nurses to provide a medical diagnosis. However, appellant did not raise this issue before the trial court and, therefore, appellant cannot raise it for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\">. Appellant did not argue before the trial court or on appeal that the science underlying Patt's testimony is not \"one reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.\u201d Therefore, we do not address the issue of whether the science underlying Patt\u2019s testimony is reliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. The Virginia Supreme Court held that a SANE nurse\u2019s testimony that a victim's injury was not consistent with consensual, first time intercourse was not testimony regarding the ultimate issue of fact. <em>See Hussen v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 93, 99, 511 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999). However, in <em>Hussen, </em>the appellant did not argue that the SANE nurse lacked the requisite expertise to testify regarding causation. Thus, the issue of whether a SANE nurse can testify regarding causation of injury remains a case of first impression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">. <em>See also Chevez v.
