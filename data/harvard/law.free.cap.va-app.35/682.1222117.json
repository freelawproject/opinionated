Green, Sr., access to his daughter\u2019s medical, hospital, and other records pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-124.6. On appeal, Green argues that the trial judge erred in finding that the Richmond Department of Social Services established good cause to deny him access to his daughter\u2019s records. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">Green has been incarcerated in prison since 1995 and is serving an eighteen-year sentence for several convictions, including marital sexual assault. Green\u2019s daughter was born in 1984 and has been in the custody of the Department since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>August 1998, pursuant to a court order relieving her mother of custody. Prior to entry of the order transferring custody of Green\u2019s daughter to the Department, Green\u2019s daughter had severe conflicts with her mother, used drugs, affiliated with gangs, and exhibited a number of other behavioral difficulties. Since August 1998, she has lived in six homes or treatment facilities, including a foster home, a group home, a treatment center for children, and several hospitals and treatment facilities. The evidence proved that the daughter\u2019s \u201coppositionally defiant\u201d attitude and physical aggression toward staff and peers were the primary reasons for most of her transfers to different treatment facilities. She has been participating in various counseling programs while in the Department\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Green, who testified that he will be eligible for parole in 2004, first requested copies of his daughter\u2019s records in July 1999. Although a foster care worker sent Green a consent form, Green did not receive any records because of errors on the consent form. In December 1999, when Green again requested access to his daughter\u2019s records, the Department filed a motion in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court opposing his request. A judge found good cause to deny Green access to his daughter\u2019s medical, hospital, and other health records, except to the extent authorized by his daughter\u2019s treating physician. Green appealed that decision to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">At the evidentiary hearing in the circuit court, William Seay, the daughter\u2019s foster care worker, testified that the daughter was then in a residential treatment unit that specializes in providing serious psychiatric treatment for adolescent females. Seay testified that the daughter\u2019s behavioral problems include physical aggression, defiance to adult authority, mood swings, and combativeness toward others. Seay also testified that various psychiatric evaluations attributed her aggressive and self-destructive behavior to past domestic violence in her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Kimberly Boone, the daughter\u2019s therapist, testified that the daughter has bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and conduct disorder. Her treatment includes medication for mood stabilization and participation in group and individual psychotherapy. Boone also testified that the daughter needs help resolving past abuse issues, was \u201cstarting to trust [Boone] and open up more and more,\u201d and has made advances in controlling her anger. Boone further testified that the daughter extensively discusses her relationship with Green in her therapy sessions and that, in Boone\u2019s opinion, the daughter\u2019s relationship with Green was \u201cabusive.\u201d Boone testified, however, that Green\u2019s past physical abuse had been directed toward the daughter\u2019s mother. Although Boone admitted she had not discussed this issue with the daughter, Boone opined that Green\u2019s access to his daughter\u2019s records would impair the daughter\u2019s therapy because it would affect her trust in Boone. She believed the daughter would \u201cprobably always be worried\u201d that her father would learn from her records what she discussed in therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The daughter\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>represented to the trial judge that the daughter believed Green\u2019s access to her records would violate her privacy and did not wish for Green to have access to her records. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>also said the daughter \u201chad a lot of difficulties\u201d relating to her mother and father and that she is \u201ctrying to work through these issues.\u201d In addition, the record contains a letter from the daughter\u2019s psychiatrist stating, \u201cit is of the utmost importance that [the daughter] has no contact with her family ... as this may be quite counterproductive at this time.\u201d A treatment plan signed by the daughter\u2019s psychiatrist reports that Green \u201cwould tell [the daughter] how he was going to physically and sexually abuse the mother and would make her watch.\u201d The plan also notes that Green is \u201cnot allowed any contact with [the daughter].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Green testified he had exchanged written correspondence with his daughter \u201calmost every week\u201d from the time he was imprisoned in 1995 until February 5, 2000, when the correspondence stopped. Green also testified that his daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>wrote him about events that occurred in her life after she was placed in foster care. Green\u2019s reasons for wanting access to his daughter\u2019s records include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">[He] wanted to access the records in order to better participate in [her] well being [and] ... to understand what she was going through, what her needs were, and ... to explain some things to her, as far as how her family was, what we were really going through ... as a dysfunctional family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">To make an assessment of all that she has gone through because all the things that she explained to me that had occurred to her since we had separated. You know I wanted to see if she was getting counseling about that. What was being handled the best way, you know, was she being truthful with me, you know, what I could do to investigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Green testified that he wanted to take an active role in facilitating his daughter\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The trial judge found that Green\u2019s access to his daughter\u2019s records would be harmful to her and was not in her best interests. He also found that Green\u2019s access to the records would interfere with his daughter\u2019s disclosures to her therapist and that Green\u2019s desire for access was \u201cnot to help [the daughter].\u201d Upon these findings, the judge denied Green access to her medical, hospital, and other health records.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Code \u00a7 20-124.6 provides that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, neither parent, regardless of whether such parent has custody, shall be denied access to the academic, medical, hospital or other health records of that parent\u2019s minor child unless otherwise ordered by the court for good cause shown.\u201d Applying former Code \u00a7 20-107.2, which contained protections similar to this statute, we have held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision, when based upon an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d \u201cCertainly it is true that the legal rights of the parent should be respected ... but the welfare of the child is to be regarded more highly than the technical legal rights of the parent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><em>L.C.S. v. S.A.S., </em>19 Va.App. 709, 724, 453 S.E.2d 580, 588 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Green contends the trial judge impermissibly relied only on Boone\u2019s opinion testimony that Green\u2019s access to the records would affect his daughter\u2019s trust in Boone as her therapist. He also argues that Boone\u2019s testimony did not support the trial judge\u2019s finding of good cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In <em>L.C.S., </em>we affirmed a trial judge\u2019s decision to deny a father access to his child\u2019s medical records where the child believed that \u201c \u2018he was sexually abused and hurt by his father,\u2019 \u201d and was frightened that his father might later harm him. 19 Va.App. at 723, 453 S.E.2d at 588. In that case, the trial judge relied on the testimony of the child\u2019s therapist, who testified that \u201cdisclosure of the child\u2019s psychological records would adversely affect [the child\u2019s] recovery because [the therapist] would feel compelled to tell him of the required disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 453 S.E.2d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Boone\u2019s testimony, which the trial judge found persuasive, provided a substantial basis to support the finding that Green\u2019s access to 'the records would impair treatment of his daughter. In addition to Boone\u2019s testimony, however, the record in this case \u201cis replete with evidence of \u2018good cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The daughter\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem </em>represented to the trial judge that the daughter, a sixteen year old, was trying to resolve difficult issues regarding her relationship with her parents and viewed Green\u2019s access to her medical files as an invasion of her privacy. Although the daughter\u2019s wishes are not controlling, the trial judge properly gave weight to them because she had reached the age of discretion. <em>See Hall v. Hall, </em>210 Va. 668, 672, 173 S.E.2d 865, 868 (1970) (noting that the wishes of children 13, 12, and 11 years of age are to be considered in a child custody case). Furthermore, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>contains evidence that the daughter suffers from psychological disorders as a result of her exposure to past domestic abuse in her family. The record proved that the daughter had not communicated with Green since February 5, 2000, and that the juvenile court judge had entered an order limiting the daughter\u2019s contact with both parents upon the recommendation of the daughter\u2019s treating professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">As the trial judge ruled, no evidence proved that Green has any specialized training or education in child development or counseling that would provide him with the ability to help his daughter by reviewing her medical records. In other words, nothing in the record showed that Green has greater insight than his daughter\u2019s therapist concerning what is in her best interest as she undergoes treatment. The testimony of the therapist and the report of the psychiatrist are unrebutted by' any evidence explaining how Green\u2019s daughter, who needs psychological treatment, would benefit or progress in resolving her psychological issues if Green had access to her medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In his ruling, the trial judge specifically and permissibly relied on both the past histories of Green and his daughter and on the opinion of the expert witness in determining what is in the best interest of Green\u2019s daughter. <em>See Hughes v. Gentry, </em>18 Va.App. 318, 325, 443 S.E.2d 448, 452 (1994). The trial judge was well suited to ascertain the expert witness\u2019 credibility, to determine the weight to be given to her testimony, and to exercise discretion in accepting or rejecting the witness\u2019 testimony. <em>Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>Based on our review of this record, we hold that the trial judge did not err in finding good cause to deny Green access to his daughter\u2019s medical, hospital and other health records pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-124.6. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
