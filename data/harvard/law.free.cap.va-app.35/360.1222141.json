On appeal, grandfather contends the circuit court erred by finding that, as a joint legal custodian of his grandchild, he owes that child a duty of support despite the fact that the parents retain residual parental rights and are capable of providing support for their child. For the reasons that follow, we agree with grandfather and reverse the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">On April 6, 1999, the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court entered a consent order granting joint legal custody of Alexandra Russell, then eight years old, to her paternal grandparents. Grandfather and grandmother have been divorced since 1993. The consent order delineates, in detail, the visitation schedule that Alexandra\u2019s grandparents and parents must follow. The order clearly provides that mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights are still in force and their consent is specifically required before certain major decisions may be made concerning Alexandra. However, the order does not mention the issue of Alexandra\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On April 9, 1999, grandmother filed a petition for child support against grandfather. Grandmother did not name Alexandra\u2019s parents in the suit. Grandfather filed a demurrer and moved to join Teri Espinosa (mother) and Wyott Russell (father). The juvenile court overruled grandfather\u2019s demurrer, joined mother and father to the suit, and ordered grandfather, mother and father to pay support to grandmother, with whom Alexandra lives. Grandfather noted his appeal to the circuit court and again filed a demurrer. The circuit court overruled the demurrer, finding that grandfather, as a legal custodian, was financially responsible for supporting Alexandra, citing Code \u00a7 16.1-228. On May 5, 2000, the court entered an order finding that grandfather, grandmother, father, and mother all owe a duty of support and applied the guidelines for determining child support set forth in Code \u00a7 20-108.2 by adding the gross incomes of all four parties and then allocating the support amount due from each party in proportion to his or her income.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Grandfather and grandmother were granted joint legal custody of Alexandra pursuant to a consent order. Grandmother has physical custody. \u201cLegal custody\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aup\">(i) a legal status created by court order which vests in a custodian the right to have physical custody of the child, to determine and redetermine where and with whom he shall live, the right and duty to protect, train and discipline him and to provide him with food, shelter, education and ordinary medical care, all subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities or (ii) the legal status created by court order of joint custody as defined in \u00a7 20-107.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228. Grandfather\u2019s rights and duties with regard to Alexandra are \u201call subject to any residual parental rights and responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cResidual parental rights and responsibilities\u201d are defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">all rights and responsibilities remaining with the parent after the transfer of legal custody or guardianship of the person, including but not limited to the right of visitation, consent to adoption, the right to determine religious affiliation and the responsibility for support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>Id. </em>Because they retain their residual parental rights, mother and father have a clear duty to provide support for Alexandra. <em>See id.; </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.2. \u201cIt is well settled that both parents owe a duty of support to their child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Chamberlain, </em>31 Va.App. 533, 538, 525 S.E.2d 19, 20-21 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Code \u00a7 20-124.2 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he court may order that support be paid for any child of the parties.\u201d The term \u201cparties\u201d in this section refers back to Code \u00a7 20-107.2, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">Upon entry of a decree providing (i) for the dissolution of a marriage, (ii) for a divorce, whether from the bond of matrimony or from bed and board, (iii) that neither party is entitled to a divorce, or (iv) for separate maintenance, the court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning the custody or visitation and support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of the minor children of the parties as provided in Chapter 6.1 (\u00a7 20-124.1 et seq.) of Title 20, including an order that either party provide health care coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Grandfather is not a \u201cparty\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-107.2. The circuit court did not have the authority to require support payments from grandfather to grandmother. We have held that a former stepparent has no duty to support his or her former spouse\u2019s child absent a clear agreement to do so or the formal adoption of the child. <em>See NPA v. WBA, </em>8 Va.App. 246, 249, 380 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1989). Grandfather did not contractually obligate himself to support Alexandra, and he has not adopted her. Instead, mother and father, because they retain their residual parental rights, are the sole parties who have a duty of support and in the instant case, the financial ability to support Alexandra. Under Code \u00a7 16.1-228, grandmother and grandfather, as legal custodians, have the duty to provide Alexandra \u201cwith food, shelter, education and ordinary medical care,\u201d but no more. Grandfather must provide these necessities for Alexandra during the periods of the year that she stays with him, but he is not similarly responsible for Alexandra while she is staying with grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is reversed and the case remanded to determine the support obligations of mother and father pursuant to the support guidelines of Code \u00a7 20-108.2. In <em>Reid v. Reid, </em>245 Va. 409, 429 S.E.2d 208 (1993), the Supreme Court announced that under Code \u00a7 20-107.1, a trial court does not have the authority to order restitution of amounts paid pursuant to a spousal support order when that order has been reversed on appeal. By contrast, in this case, the trial court did not have the authority to order grandfather to make child support payments. Consequently, the support obligations of mother and father shall be applied retroactively to the date of filing of grandmother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>petition, and grandfather shall be reimbursed for any support payments he made under the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. The trial court found the monthly incomes of the parties to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">Grandmother - $3,083.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvA\">Grandfather - $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsV\">Father - $6,760.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">Mother - $ 867.00</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
