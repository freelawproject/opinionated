Although appellant\u2019s youngest daughter is entitled to support under New York law, he contends she is over the age of eighteen and not otherwise entitled to support under Code \u00a7 20-124.2 and, therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the support order. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The facts of this case are uncontroverted. Albert and Maureen Robdau have three children, James Robdau, born July 2, 1975, Nicole Robdau, born August 16, 1979, and Jacqueline Robdau, born July 10, 1981. James and Nicole are both over twenty-one years of age. Jacqueline, who is nineteen years old, is not emancipated and, thus, is a child eligible for support under New York law until she reaches age twenty-one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jacqueline graduated from high school on or before June 30,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">On September 15, 1999, a New York court entered an order that established appellant\u2019s child support arrearage at $15,017.20 as of May 28, 1999 and required him to pay $110 per week in current support and $10 per week toward the arrearage. The New York court entered a judgment in the amount of the arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Because appellant lives in Virginia, the State of New York, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-88.32 <em>et seq., </em>the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), requested that the Division of Child Support Enforcement for the Commonwealth enforce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the New York child support order. The Division requested registration of the New York order for enforcement in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court for the City of Chesapeake. The juvenile court established the child support arrearage and confirmed the registration of the New York order. Appellant appealed the order to the Circuit Court for the City of Chesapeake. Appellant filed a motion for partial summary judgment challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The only issue before the trial court and this Court on appeal is whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the child support arrearage that accrued after appellant\u2019s youngest daughter reached age eighteen or graduated from high school because Virginia law imposes no duty of support under these circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court held that, under UIFSA, it had jurisdiction to enforce the current support obligation and the entire child support arrearage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Appellant contends Virginia courts cannot enforce another state\u2019s support order for payments beyond the time when the child support obligation would terminate under Virginia law. Appellant relies upon <em>Cutshaw v. Cutshaw, </em>220 Va. 688, 261 S.E.2d 52 (1979), to support his position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\"><em>Cutshaw </em>was not a UIFSA case but involved the issue of whether the trial court retained jurisdiction, after the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>attained majority, to enforce an order entered during the child\u2019s infancy modifying a child support agreement incorporated into the final decree of divorce. 220 Va. at 639, 261 S.E.2d at 53. In <em>Cutshaw, </em>the parties\u2019 agreement provided for child support in the amount of $25 per week until the children left the mother\u2019s home or completed their undergraduate education. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 261 S.E.2d at 53. During the infancy of the youngest child, the court increased the amount to $35 per week. <em>Id. </em>at 640, 261 S.E.2d at 53. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, which found an arrearage based on $35 per week for each week the father failed to pay after the youngest child reached majority. In finding no jurisdiction to enforce the modified order, the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">A parent has the legal obligation to support his children only during their minority. Va.Code \u00a7 20-61. Of course, this obligation does not preclude the parent from contracting to support the children after their minority. However, where such contracts are incorporated into support decrees by a divorce court, they can only be modified by that court to the extent of its jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">The jurisdiction of a court to provide for child support pursuant to a divorce is purely statutory. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>211 Va. 718, 719, 180 S.E.2d 500 (1971). The relevant statutes only deal with the court\u2019s power to provide for support and maintenance of minor children. <em>See </em>Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-103 through -109.1. Once the child reaches majority, the jurisdiction of the divorce court to provide for his support and maintenance terminates unless otherwise provided by agreement incorporated into the divorce decree. <em>See Eaton v. Eaton, </em>215 Va. 824, 213 S.E.2d 789 (1975); <em>Paul v. Paul, </em>214 Va. 651, 203 S.E.2d 123 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 641, 261 S.E.2d at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The following analysis demonstrates that <em>Cutshaw </em>is inapplicable to the enforcement of foreign state support orders under UIFSA. Code \u00a7 20-88.69(A), a provision of UIFSA, states, \u201c[t]he law of the issuing state governs the nature, extent, amount, and duration of current payments and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>obligations of support and the payment of arrearages under the order.\u201d UIFSA further recognizes the Commonwealth may be called upon to enforce another state\u2019s order for support of an individual over the age of majority. Code \u00a7 20-88.32 states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">\u201cChild\u201d means an individual, whether over or under the age of majority, who is or is alleged to be owed a duty of support by the individual\u2019s parent or who is or is alleged to be the beneficiary of a support order directed to the parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cChild support order\u201d means a support order for a child, including a child who has attained the age of majority under the law of the issuing state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The statutory language is clear, and we must give the words their plain meaning. \u201cWhere a statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning is to be accepted without resort to the rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Med., </em>14 Va.App. 906, 910, 421 S.E.2d 201, 205 (1992) (citing <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus. v. Westmoreland Coal Co., </em>233 Va. 97, 99, 353 S.E.2d 758, 760 (1987)). \u201cThe manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">To accept appellant\u2019s contention would encourage parents obligated to pay support to avoid one state\u2019s child support order by moving to another state that has a lower age requirement for support. Through such \u201cforum shopping,\u201d the parent would be able to control the duration of child support. Such a result undermines the very purpose of UIFSA. <em>See Commonwealth v. Chamberlain, </em>31 Va.App. 533, 536-37, 525 S.E.2d 19, 21 (2000) (\u201cThe UIFSA is a model uniform law that has been enacted in all fifty states. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-88.32 <em>et seq. </em>[The UIFSA] provides a comprehensive statutory scheme to establish and enforce support obligations in proceedings involving two or more states.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"ArR\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\">. New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240(1-b)(b)(2) (2000 McKinney) states, \" 'Child support' shall mean a sum to be paid pursuant to court order or decree by either or both parents or pursuant to a valid agreement between the parties for care, maintenance and education of any unemancipated child under the age of twenty-one years.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">. Code \u00a7 20-124.2(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\">. Appellant does not contest the proper registration of the New York order, the amount of the arrearage, or that New York law obligates a parent to pay child support until a child who is not emancipated reaches age twenty-one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\">. Appellant also submitted an unpublished opinion from this Court, <em>Parks v. Parks, </em>Record No. 1892-97-4, 1998 WL 49070 (February 10, 1998), in support of his position. \"Unpublished memorandum opinions of this Court are not to he cited or relied upon as precedent except for the purpose of establishing res judicata, estoppel or the law of the case.\u201d <em>Grajales v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 1, 2 n. 1, 353 S.E.2d 789, 790 n. 1 (1987). Accordingly, we will not consider the holding in resolving the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
