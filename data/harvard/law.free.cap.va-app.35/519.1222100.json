He was sentenced to serve a total of eleven years for these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Sapp contends on appeal the trial court erred when it permitted the prior recorded preliminary hearing testimony of the victim and an eyewitness to be admitted into evidence where both witnesses were present at trial but refused to testify. Finding no error by the trial court, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On Sunday, April 4, 1999, Sean McClellan (McClellan) dropped Billy Perkins (Perkins) off near his home after a shopping trip. As Perkins began walking toward his home, two cars pulled up next to him. Sapp and four other men jumped out of the vehicles and surrounded Perkins. Sapp asked Perkins, \u201cwhere\u2019s my brother\u2019s shit,\u201d which Perkins understood as a reference to cocaine. When Perkins denied that he had any cocaine, Sapp ran over to his car, pulled out a Tech 9 gun and returned to Perkins. Pointing the gun at Perkins\u2019 face, Sapp grabbed the gold chain hanging on Perkins\u2019 neck and pulled it off. As Perkins backed up so that he was seated on one of the cars, the group of men repeatedly punched him and rifled through his pockets, stealing his pager. Perkins heard someone say, \u201cslit his wrist, slit his wrist.\u201d Perkins managed to get to his feet and flee. He was later treated at a hospital where wounds to his hand and lip were stitched.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">McClellan witnessed the crimes from his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">On August 24, 1999, both Perkins and McClellan testified at length in the preliminary hearing and were cross-examined extensively by two defense counsel. Sapp changed counsel between the preliminary hearing and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">At trial on December 21, 1999, both Perkins and McClellan were sworn as witnesses but refused to testify, each telling the trial judge he was afraid for his life. Perkins testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atr\">I\u2019m too scared, you know, to say anything, testify, for the simple fact I\u2019d be jeopardizing my life.... I know what happened, but I\u2019m too scared, you know, to say....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Similarly, McClellan testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>I don\u2019t want to testify. I don\u2019t want to testify.... I don\u2019t feel safe testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">McClellan also testified that he \u201cforgot a lot of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Perkins and McClellan both stated in open court that they were refusing to testify. Upon examination by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, both Perkins and McClellan affirmed that they remembered their appearance at the preliminary hearing and that the testimony given at the preliminary hearing had been truthful. Neither could identify specific threats from Sapp or persons acting for Sapp, but both had heard \u201ctalk on the street\u201d threatening their personal safety if they testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The Commonwealth moved to have Perkins\u2019 and McClellan\u2019s testimony from the preliminary hearing entered into the record, on the basis that each witness \u201cis declaring himself unavailable.\u201d In its motion, the Commonwealth cited our decision in <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 46, 467 S.E.2d 841 (1996), as recognizing a hearsay exception for prior testimony of an unavailable witness. Sapp\u2019s trial counsel timely objected to the introduction of the preliminary hearing testimony and asked the trial court to use its contempt power to compel Perkins and McClellan to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The trial judge conducted a colloquy with each witness to verify he knew the refusal to testify meant his prior testimony would be read into the trial record. The trial judge opined that he could not use the contempt power in this setting. The judge, citing <em>Jones, </em>then denied Sapp\u2019s motion and admitted into the record the preliminary hearing testimony of Perkins and McClellan. Sapp was convicted and later sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">On appeal, Sapp alleges several grounds for his contention that the trial court erred when admitting the prior testimony. All of Sapp\u2019s arguments are tied to his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. (U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8). Citing <em>Longshore v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>260 Va. 3, 530 S.E.2d 146 (2000), Sapp argues the case law requirements for introducing prior testimony were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In <em>Longshore, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia reiterated the general standards under which prior testimony of an unavailable witness may be admitted at a later proceeding as an exception to the rules of evidence regarding hearsay.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ7\">[T]he preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who is absent at a subsequent criminal trial may be admitted into evidence if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) that the witness is presently unavailable; (2) that the prior testimony of the witness was given under oath (or in a form of affirmation that is legally sufficient); (3) that the prior testimony was accurately recorded or that the person who seeks to relate the testimony of the unavailable witness can state the subject matter of the unavailable -witness\u2019s testimony with clarity and in detail; and (4) that the party against whom the prior testimony is offered was present, and represented by counsel, at the preliminary hearing and was afforded the opportunity of cross-examination when the witness testified at the preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 530 S.E.2d at 146-47 (citations omitted). Essentially, Sapp alleges conditions one and four were not met in this case. No error is alleged as to the second and third requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">As to the \u201cunavailability\u201d of the witnesses, Sapp argues his case is distinguishable from our ruling in <em>Jones </em>because the reluctant witness there was \u201cunavailable\u201d due to real or feigned memory loss. Because Perkins and McClellan claimed fear, not memory loss, as their reason not to testify, Sapp argues <em>Jones </em>should not apply. Sapp also avers that the witnesses could have been made \u201cavailable\u201d had the trial court threatened them with contempt, which the court refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">As to the last condition in <em>Longshore, </em>Sapp argues that because trial counsel, as opposed to his counsel at the preliminary hearing, could not cross-examine Perkins and McClellan, he was denied his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>I. The Unavailable Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Both the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Virginia have long recognized the admissibility in a criminal trial of prior recorded testimony of an unavailable witness under certain circumstances. <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895); <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 808, 232 S.E.2d 798 (1977). The preliminary condition which must be met is that the declarant, whose former testimony is to be admitted into evidence as a hearsay exception, must be \u201cunavailable.\u201d <em>Doan v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 87, 100, 422 S.E.2d 398, 405 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u201cThe party offering the hearsay testimony has the burden of establishing the witness\u2019 \u2018unavailability.\u2019 Determining whether the offering party has met its burden and, thus, whether the declarant is \u2018unavailable,\u2019 is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>22 Va.App. at 50, 467 S.E.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">While we have recognized a number of factors which may satisfy the foundational requirement of \u201cunavailability\u201d of a \"witness (i.e., the witness dies), it is clear there is no exclusive list. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 467 S.E.2d at 843; <em>see also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-9 (4th ed.1993). To the contrary, the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s long-standing rule is \u201cthat a sufficient reason is shown why the original witness is not produced.\u201d <em>Wise Terminal Co. v. McCormick, </em>107 Va. 376, 379, 58 S.E. 584, 585 (1907); <em>accord Burton v. Oldfield, </em>195 Va. 544, 550, 79 S.E.2d 660, 664 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Based on this precedent, we held in <em>Jones </em>that the prior testimony of Brown was admissible because Brown\u2019s testimony was unavailable even though he was present in court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiy\">[T]he trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Brown\u2019s memory loss at trial, <em>whether real or feigned, </em>rendered him unavailable. Brown\u2019s testimony at trial was not forthcoming, despite the Commonwealth\u2019s repeated questions, its attempt to refresh his memory, and its grant of immunity. <em>Brown admitted that he simply did not want to testify and ultimately could not be compelled to \u201cremem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>her.\u201d </em>Thus, although Brown appeared in court and testified to his present lack of memory, he was \u201cunavailable\u201d for purposes of the exception. In such cases, the focus of the inquiry is not the unavailability of the witness but the unavailability of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">22 Va.App. at 52, 467 S.E.2d at 844 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We see no meaningful distinction between the unavailable witness testimony by reason of memory loss in <em>Jones </em>and the unavailable witness testimony of Perkins and McClellan by reason of fear. The unavailable testimony of a fearful witness is as unavailable as if the witness had forgotten the events or become incapacitated. The testimony is simply not available, and no means is extant to make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Contrary to Sapp\u2019s contention that <em>Jones </em>only refers to witnesses with failed memory, the reluctant witness there \u201csimply did not want to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Perkins\u2019 and McClellan\u2019s refusals here are not mere recalcitrance, but were based on a real fear of retribution or retaliation if they testified. The testimony of Perkins and McClellan was uncontradicted as to the fear for their safety should they testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The trier of fact was uniquely and appropriately situated to observe the demeanor of both witnesses and ascertain whether or not their testimony of fear-induced silence was real or feigned. Witness credibility, the weight accorded the testimony and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder, and the trial court\u2019s judgment will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly -wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>see also Long v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">An exception to the hearsay rule on unavailability of the declarant due to the witness\u2019 refusal to testify based on fear appears to be a question of first impression in Virginia. Other states and the federal courts have dealt with such a refusal to testify, have found the fearful witness \u201cpractically unavailable,\u201d and have ruled that the witness\u2019 prior testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>admissible as a valid hearsay exception and not violative of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">In <em>Geraci v. Senkowski, </em>211 F.3d 6 (2d Cir.2000), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, applying New York state law in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, ruled that where a witness refuses to testify out of fear, and the prosecutor demonstrates that the witness has been threatened, the witness is \u201cpractically unavailable\u201d for purposes of the hearsay exception for prior testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Geraci </em>an eyewitness to a stabbing testified before a state grand jury that he saw the defendant stab the victim. It was later discovered that the grand jury minutes were missing, and, just prior to trial, the witness quit his well-paying job without notice and fled from his home. When he subsequently was located in Florida, the witness stated that he had been approached by a person who showed him the grand jury minutes describing his testimony and that both he and his family were threatened. In addition, he had been offered and received substantial sums of money for staying away from New York until after the trial. None of these events, though, could be personally connected to Geraci, the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Prior to testifying at trial, the witness indicated to prosecutors that he would change the story he had given under oath before the grand jury. The witness followed through with his plan and testified that he had not seen the stabbing. He explained the discrepancy between this testimony and his testimony before the grand jury on the ground that when he first testified he was unsure of the facts because the club had been dark and he had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The state trial court determined that the witness was \u201cmarkedly evasive\u201d in this testimony. The trial court also found that the prosecution had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that someone acting on Geraci\u2019s behalf threatened the witness and that if required to testify, the witness would do so falsely. As a result, the trial court found the witness \u201cpractically unavailable\u201d and permitted the use of his grand jury testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case. Geraci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>was convicted, and the appellate courts of New York affirmed. The Second Circuit held, \u201c \u2018a witness who is so fearful that he will not testify\u2019 or will testify falsely, \u2018is just as unavailable as a witness who is dead or cannot be found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We find no merit in Sapp\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by not using the contempt power to compel Perkins and McClellan to testify. As at trial, Sapp cites no authority for this argument. The use of the court\u2019s contempt power is discretionary, not mandatory, and cannot be applied in all situations. Code \u00a7 18.2-456; <em>see also Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 291, 142 S.E.2d 746 (1965). The record does not reflect the trial judge acted improperly or abused his discretion in this regard. To the contrary, the trial judge pointed out to each witness that his preliminary hearing testimony would be used against Sapp if the witness continued to refuse to testify. Thus, the trial judge clearly informed each witness he could not escape the use of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We conclude the first condition of <em>Longshore </em>was satisfied. The witnesses, Perkins and McClellan, were unavailable because they refused to testify based on uncontradicted evidence of their fear for their personal safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">II. Opportunity of Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Sapp argues that the last prong of <em>Longshore </em>was violated in this case because his <em>trial </em>attorney did not cross-examine Perkins and McClellan at the preliminary hearing. Accordingly, Sapp avers his Confrontation Clause right was thwarted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\"><em>Longshore </em>and prior case law are manifestly clear that it is the \u201copportunity of cross-examination\u201d which must be available at the prior proceeding. <em>Longshore, </em>260 Va. at 4, 530 S.E.2d at 147 (citations omitted). There is no support for Sapp\u2019s argument that this \u201copportunity\u201d is provided only if trial counsel is the person afforded that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The record plainly reflects Perkins and McClellan were subject to extensive cross-examination at the preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>hearing by two attorneys. Between the preliminary hearing and trial, Sapp changed counsel. Without question, Sapp received and exercised the opportunity of cross-examination. We find no merit to his contention that such opportunity should apply only to his last counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold Sapp\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights were met. The witnesses\u2019 preliminary hearing testimony was properly admitted at trial because they were effectively unavailable and Sapp had been adequately afforded the opportunity of cross-examination at the prior proceeding. Accordingly, all of Sapp\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b567-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A2K\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The Sixth Amendment provides, in part, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has held that this right of confrontation is fundamental and is made obligatory on the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). While the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rules have similar aims, their prohibitions are not equivalent. <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638. \u201cThe Confrontation Clause ... bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to satisfy the Confrontation Clause, the prosecution must establish that use of the prior testimony is necessary because the declarant is unavailable and the evidence bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d such as where it falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>at 814-15, 110 S.Ct. 3139.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">The rule is well established in Virginia concerning the admission of such evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. As a prerequisite to the admission into evidence of testimony given at a former hearing, the record must establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the \u201cunavailability\u201d of the witness. <em>Burton v. Oldfield, </em>195 Va. 544, 549-50, 79 S.E.2d 660, 664 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In this ease, the Commonwealth failed to satisfy the \u201cunavailability\u201d requirement necessary to conform to the strictures of both the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rule. The record clearly establishes that Sean McClellan and Billy Perkins were present in the courtroom and testified under oath. In no sense can we say either was \u201can absent -witness,\u201d which was the circumstance existing in <em>Longshore v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 3, 3, 530 S.E.2d 146, 146 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In addition, the testimony of each witness establishes that he was not \u201cunavailable.\u201d As we noted in <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 46, 467 S.E.2d 841 (1996), Virginia precedent has established a partial list of reasons why a declarant may be \u201cunavailable,\u201d including death, illness and the opposing party\u2019s causing the declarant\u2019s absence. 22 Va.App. at 50-51, 467 S.E.2d at 843. In <em>Jones, </em>we expressly decided as an issue of first impression in Virginia \u201c[wjhether a witness\u2019 <em>lack of memory </em>renders the witness \u2018unavailable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 467 S.E.2d at 843 (emphasis added). The record in that case established the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">At Jones\u2019 trial, the Commonwealth called both Johnson and Brown as witnesses. Both men testified that they did not remember either the incident or having spoken with the police. Brown further claimed that he did not know Jones and that he had no memory of the events leading to Watson\u2019s death. In response to the Commonwealth\u2019s questions, Brown asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. - The Commonwealth then granted immunity to Brown, but Brown claimed that he did not want to testify. Brown continued to maintain that he could not remember the crime. He also maintained that he could not remember his statement to the police, or testimony at the preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 49, 467 S.E.2d at 843. Under these circumstances, the trial judge \u201cconcluded that Brown\u2019s inability to remember his preliminary hearing testimony rendered him an \u2018unavailable\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 467 S.E.2d at 843. We affirmed the trial judge\u2019s decision to allow the use of the witness\u2019 prior testimony, and we held that \u201calthough [the witness] appeared in court and testified to his present lack of memory, he was \u2018unavailable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 467 S.E.2d at 844. We did not hold that mere unwillingness to testify was sufficient to make a witness \u201cunavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Citing <em>Geraci v. Senkowski, </em>211 F.3d 6, 8 (2d Cir.2000), the Commonwealth argues that general fear of testifying makes a witness unavailable. In <em>Geraei, </em>however, the record established the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">The trial court determined that Terranova had been \u201cmarkedly evasive\u201d in his testimony at the hearing. The trial court also found that the prosecution had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Terranova had been threatened by [the accused] or someone acting on [the accused\u2019s] behalf, and that if required to testify, he would do so falsely. As a result, the trial court found Terranova \u201cpractically unavailable\u201d and permitted the use of his grand jury testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Upon these findings, the court in <em>Geraei </em>held that the witness \u201cwas \u2018practically unavailable\u2019 because of threats against him and his family made on behalf of [the accused].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. In other words, <em>Geraei </em>merely restates the well established, unremarkable proposition that \u201c[an accused] who procures a witness\u2019s absence waives the right of confrontation for all purposes with regard to that witness, not just to the admission of sworn hearsay statements.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguiar, </em>975 F.2d 45, 47 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">I believe that we eviscerate the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rule by expanding the meaning of \u201cunavailability\u201d to include a generalized fear of harm. This unprecedented expansion unreasonably curtails an accused\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him or her any time a witness simply refuses to testify without identifying a specific, credible threat. The majority\u2019s position imposes a limitation that hinders the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>accused\u2019s right of confrontation and the fact finder\u2019s ability to determine the truth of a matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Furthermore, the Commonwealth has not borne its burden of proving that Sapp caused or contributed to the reluctance of these witnesses to testify. No evidence in this case tends to prove that Sapp or anyone acting on his behalf threatened or intimidated these witnesses. The evidence proves only that McClellan and Perkins were reluctant to testify and expressed only a general fear because of \u201chearing talk here and there in the streets.\u201d This evidence was not sufficient to prove the witnesses were unavailable and would not have testified under proper circumstances and safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">I would hold that the mere unwillingness of a witness to testify because of a generalized fear is insufficient to make the witness \u201cunavailable.\u201d Accordingly, I would hold that the trial judge erred by admitting into evidence at trial, as an exception to the hearsay rule and the commands of the Confrontation Clause, the witnesses\u2019 prior testimony given at a preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. The position taken by the majority and the trial judge is further undermined by the fact that the witnesses\u2019 preliminary hearing testimony was admitted despite the witnesses\u2019 fear that they would be harmed if they testified. In effect, these witnesses were allowed to control the presentation of their testimony. Rather than acquiesce to these conditions, the trial judge should have explored every avenue that might have led them to testify, including use of the contempt power.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
