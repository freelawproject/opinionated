We conclude the evidence did not support the finding and reverse the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">On October 21, 1998, the employee received chemical burns to his feet, and the employer accepted the claim as compensable. In March 1999, the employee\u2019s treating physician referred him to a psychiatrist. The employee filed an application for payment of psychiatric services claiming the need for treatment arose out of his work injury. The deputy commissioner denied the application finding that the employee had not established the psychiatric treatment was \u201ccausally connected to his chemical burns of 1998.\u201d The full commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>reversed and awarded psychiatric benefits for as long as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The employee\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Steven L. Phillips, noted on February 8, 1999: \u201cI think he has more problems with anxiety and depression associated with this injury than he does have physical injury itself. I think the sympathetic response might be tied in with his emotional response to the entire affair and that he might benefit from treatment of anxiety and depression.\u201d The doctor prescribed an antidepressant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On February 7, 1999, Dr. Phillips assessed the employee\u2019s condition: \u201cBilateral burns to feet with persisting symptoms with some perpetuation probably resulting from anxiety and depression related to the injury.\u201d On February 25, 1999, the assessment was similar: \u201cBilateral foot burns with prolonged symptoms possibly contributed to by amdety/depression related to the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On March 31, 1999, Dr. Phillips referred the employee to Dr. Jeffrey K. Lightner, a psychiatrist. Dr. Phillips explained that he referred the employee \u201cfor a psychiatric evaluation in order to properly define his condition and also to help determine how much of it is related to his work injury. I realize that this latter task may be difficult but may be very important to the patient as well as his employer.\u201d In the letter, Dr. Phillips noted, \u201cThere may be an element of sympathetically maintained pain involved here.... \u201d He concluded, \u201cI felt it wise to have him see a professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment if needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Dr. Lightner diagnosed the employee on April 1, 1999 with bipolar paranoid reaction. He never made a narrative report of his diagnosis. The employee\u2019s counsel solicited Dr. Lightner\u2019s opinion on the causal relation in a one-question letter: \u201cIs it your opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the treatment you are providing Michael Adams is reasonable, necessary, and causally related to his work injury of October 21, 1998?\u201d The letter provided spaces to check either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Dr. Lightner did not mark one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>two indicated answers. Instead, he interlined, \u201cto some degree, but I don\u2019t know patient\u2019s mental state prior to the injury,\u201d and drew an arrow to the space for indicating the \u201cyes\u201d response.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Dr. Phillips\u2019s notes and letter show that he had not reached a decision about the cause of the employee\u2019s psychiatric condition. Perplexed by the employee\u2019s condition, he referred the employee to a psychiatrist and deferred to that specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Phillips\u2019s note of May 3, 1999, made after Dr. Lightner\u2019s diagnosis, stated the disorder was not related to the injury. The employee\u2019s \u201caffective disorder itself is not a work related illness[,] however his work injury may have had some effect on it.\u201d In his final response to counsel\u2019s inquiry, he could only say that the referral itself was \u201cpossibly\u201d related to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The parties argue opposing interpretations of Dr. Lightner\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s questionnaire. We need not choose between them because either would be insufficiently based. Dr. Lightner qualified his response \u201cbut I don\u2019t know patient\u2019s mental state prior to the injury.\u201d The response made clear the doctor could not answer the question without the patient\u2019s history for the last ten years. He could not answer the question in the format in which it was posed because he did not have sufficient medical history upon which to base an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Dr. Phillips\u2019s note of May 3, 1999 also noted that the lack of adequate history prevented him from giving an opinion on causation: \u201cI explained to [the employee] that I would be unable to say how much effect that the work accident had since I have no knowledge of his status prior to three months following the injury.\u201d In their concluding opinions, both doctors indicated they needed additional medical history before rendering an opinion on the relation of the psychiatric condition to the injury. The commission erred in finding the medical evidence credible when it lacked a sufficient base.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\"><em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. </em>Bowman, 229 Va. 249, 252, 329 S.E.2d 15, 16 (1985), held the commission erred in attributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>weight to medical evidence based upon a faulty premise. The Court reversed the commission\u2019s finding that the doctor was credible because the doctor\u2019s opinion was based on erroneous information supplied by the claimant. \u201cIn Dr. Mcllwain\u2019s first report,he <em>assumed </em>that the condition he discovered resulted from the 1978 accident. The basis for this assumption was the incomplete information furnished by Bowman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251-52, 329 S.E.2d at 16 (emphasis in original). \u201cWhenever a physician\u2019s diagnosis flows from an assumption that rests upon a faulty premise, such as misinformation provided by a claimant, the commission may refuse, and often will be required to refuse, to attribute any weight to that opinion.\u201d <em>Sneed v. Morengo, Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 199, 205, 450 S.E.2d 167, 171 (1994) (citation omitted). Drs. Phillips\u2019s and Lightner\u2019s reports were insufficient to establish a causal connection between the employee\u2019s work injury and his psychiatric condition beyond mere conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The employee testified that ten years before the accident he began to drink heavily after his six-month-old son died. He admitted himself to a 30-day in-patient alcohol treatment program, but he had not had any problems requiring psychiatric treatment since then. He had not been diagnosed with either bipolar disorder or paranoia before Dr. Lightner\u2019s diagnosis. An employee\u2019s testimony may be considered in determining causation, particularly where the medical evidence is inconclusive. <em>Russell Stover Candies v. Alexander, </em>30 Va.App. 812, 826, 520 S.E.2d 404, 411 (1999). However, the employee\u2019s statement that he did not receive psychiatric treatment for ten years does not constitute evidence that his current condition was causally related to his work injury. Causation is a factual question that must be supported by credible evidence. <em>McPeek v. P.W. &amp; W. Coal Co., </em>210 Va. 185, 188, 169 S.E.2d 443, 445 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We conclude that neither the medical evidence nor the employee\u2019s testimony is sufficient to prove causation. \u201cIf the expert medical witnesses cannot testify that it is at least more probable than not that the disease arose out of and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>course of employment, compensation must and should be denied, not because the law requires more of medicine than it can produce, but because the law requires more than simply proof that the disease \u2018might\u2019 have been caused by a particular result.\u201d <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. 217, 224, 372 S.E.2d 411, 416 (1988). Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
