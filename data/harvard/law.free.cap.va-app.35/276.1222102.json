On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a \u201cstrip search\u201d of his person, in violation of his statutory and Fourth Amendment rights. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">On October 5, 1999, Norfolk Police Officers Christopher Hatman and T.L. Sterling were on duty in an unmarked police car in the area of Virginia Beach Boulevard and Ballentine Boulevard in Norfolk. At approximately 6:15 a.m., the officers were traveling on Virginia Beach Boulevard near its intersection with Ballentine Boulevard. The officers testified appellant ran a red light when turning right onto Virginia Beach Boulevard from Ballentine Boulevard. When appellant made the right turn, he pulled out in front of the police car, which was driven by Hatman. Appellant also was exceeding the speed limit by ten miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The police officers followed appellant\u2019s vehicle and ran a license plate check. The check revealed that the vehicle was stolen. The officers were in an unmarked police car that did not have emergency lights, so they followed appellant\u2019s vehicle and directed marked police units to assist. Before the marked units arrived, appellant turned down a side street, parked and exited his vehicle. The officers exited their vehicle and approached appellant. After identifying themselves, the officers arrested appellant for possessing a stolen vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">After arresting appellant, Officer Hatman began to search appellant\u2019s person pursuant to the arrest. During the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>pat-down, he heard \u201ccrinkling material\u201d in the area of appellant\u2019s \u201ccrotch.\u201d The officer testified that from his past experience, he knew it was common for those carrying illegal substances to keep contraband in their groin area or buttocks. Once the officer heard the \u201cplastic rustling,\u201d he \u201cpulled [appellant\u2019s] belt line back and observed the plastic baggies in the groin area.\u201d Hatman reached in \u201ctwo inches\u201d and pulled the plastic bag out of the front of appellant\u2019s underwear. Although the officer pulled back appellant\u2019s underwear in the front, he did not see appellant\u2019s genitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Hatman continued his search of appellant\u2019s person. In appellant\u2019s jacket pocket, he found a small plastic bag that contained \u201cassorted [narcotics] packaging material,\u201d consistent with the packaging material used to package the cocaine retrieved from appellant\u2019s underwear. Hatman also found $140 in U.S. currency in appellant\u2019s wallet. The officers testified that no one was in the area at the time of the search of appellant\u2019s person. \u201c[A]fter everything was over,\u201d a woman came outside and told the officers that she knew appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Appellant disagreed with the officers\u2019 version of the search. He testified the police spread his body across the car with his chest on the hood and his legs apart. He maintained that his pants were hanging down to his mid-thigh. He also stated that Hatman pulled his \u201cboxers\u201d away from his body and looked inside his underwear using a flashlight. Appellant testified that Hatman \u201cstarted feeling underneath [his] genitals,\u201d \u201cfelt something in [his] buttocks,\u201d and then pulled the plastic bag out of his buttocks. According to appellant, during the search, people were present on the street and the \u201cbottom part\u201d of his body was naked. Appellant stated that his pubic hair was showing and his boxers were barely covering his \u201cprivate area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">At the suppression hearing, appellant argued that the search was a warrantless \u201cstrip search,\u201d which violated Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1 and the Fourth Amendment. The trial court, in denying the motion to suppress, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The Court will first say that it seems to me perfectly clear that the stop and arrest were perfectly appropriate. The officers had information that they validated the dispatcher of the stolen vehicle and certainly gave them the probable cause to make the arrest and so the Court finds that the arrest was appropriate based on the information that was available to the officers and certainly had the right to do that. And having made the arrest, certainly had the right to, for their own safety and within reasonable grounds for contraband, pat down the defendant in the way they did and to conduct reasonable search of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">In this case, the Court finds there was no invasion of any bodily cavities in any way. The Court finds that this was not a strip search. The baggies\u2019 packaging was discovered on pat down and the Court accepts the testimony that the defendant\u2019s pants were pulled back in the front, that the officer only had to reach in a short distance, two inches, I think was the testimony, to get the top of the baggies and get that out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">The Court finds from the evidence that the search itself given the valid and proper arrest was appropriate, and did not result in any \u2014 result in any depravation of any constitutional rights, statutory rights of the defendant and, therefore, would overrule the motion to suppress both as to arrest and as to the search that was conducted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">On appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the Commonwealth all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from it. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). The findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>See Mier v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 827, 828, 407 S.E.2d 342, 343 (1991). When reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, \u201c[t]he burden is upon [the defendant] to show that th[e] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWP\"><em>Debroux v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 364, 370-71, 528 S.E.2d 151, 154, <em>aff'd, </em>34 Va.App. 72, 537 S.E.2d 630 (2000) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion to the particular facts of the case. <em>See Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996); <em>see also Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1659.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Hayes v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 647, 652, 514 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In this case, the threshold issue is whether the police conducted a \u201cstrip search.\u201d Appellant contends the search violated Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1. We disagree. By its own terms, Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1 does not apply to felony offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>lant was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle, a felony under Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Appellant relies on the definition of \u201cstrip search\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1(F)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to conclude that the police conducted a \u201cstrip search\u201d of him. However, the definition applies only \u201c[f]or purposes of this section.\u201d Therefore, it is clear from the plain language of the statute that the legislature did not intend to have the definition apply outside of the scope of Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1. Further, we conclude that the definition of \u201cstrip search\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1 is much more expansive than the traditional definition of such a search because the statute is restricted to non-jailable offenses and offenses punishable by no more than thirty days in jail. We have found no cases, nor has appellant cited any, that include \u201carranging\u201d of the suspect\u2019s clothing in a definition of \u201cstrip search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 447, 524 S.E.2d 155 (2000) <em>(en banc), </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">A search of the person may range from a Terry-type pat-down to a generalized search of the person to the more intrusive strip search or body cavity search. \u201cA strip search generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual, without any scrutiny of his body cavities. A visual body cavity search extends to a visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 403, 708 N.E.2d 669, 672 n. 4 (1999). \u201cA \u2018manual body cavity search\u2019 includes some degree of touching or probing of body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>cavities.\u201d <em>Cookish v. Powell, </em>945 F.2d 441, 444-45 n. 5 (1st Cir.1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 455, 524 S.E.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Hughes was forced to disrobe and the police inspected his underwear. We characterized that activity as a \u201cstrip search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 219, 516 S.E.2d 246 (1999), we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of Moss\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that the officers\u2019 discovery of crack cocaine in Moss\u2019 buttocks constituted a \u201cstrip search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 638, 507 S.E.2d 661 (1998), we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of Taylor\u2019s motion to suppress, finding Taylor was subjected to an illegal \u201cstrip search\u201d when officers forced him to remove his clothing, including his underwear, item by item.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Gilmore, </em>27 Va.App. 320, 498 S.E.2d 464 (1998), Gilmore was forced to remove all her clothing in preparation for a \u201cstrip search.\u201d The police then conducted a body cavity search. In finding Gilmore\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated, we concluded that \u201cthe authority of the police under the Fourth Amendment to conduct a \u2018full search\u2019 of an arrestee\u2019s person without a warrant is only skin deep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 498 S.E.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Further, in a review of a number of federal appellate decisions, we found no cases that characterize a strip search as other than partial or total disrobement. <em>See Amaechi v. West, </em>237 F.3d 356 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Swain v. Spinney, </em>117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997); <em>Justice v. City of Peachtree City, </em>961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992); <em>Masters v. Crouch, </em>872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989); <em>Weber v. Dell, </em>804 F.2d 796 (2nd Cir.1986); <em>Salinas v. Breier, </em>695 F.2d 1073 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">In this case, in accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, we find appellant was not subjected to a strip search. Unlike in <em>Hughes, Moss, Taylor, </em>and <em>Gilmore, </em>appellant\u2019s clothing was not removed, and his genital area was not exposed. The officers made no visual inspection of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>genitals nor did the officers touch appellant\u2019s genitals. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">. Once appellant was transported to the police station, the officers learned that the owner of the vehicle had reported the vehicle as stolen, \"but [was] now saying he loaned it to the guy for a quantity of crack cocaine.\u201d No warrant was issued against appellant for possession of stolen property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. Section 19.2-59.1(A) slates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">No person in custodial arrest for a traffic infraction, Class 3 or Class 4 misdemeanor, or a violation of a city, county, or town ordinance, which is punishable by no more than thirty days in jail shall be strip searched unless there is reasonable cause to believe on the part of a law-enforcement officer authorizing the search that the individual is concealing a weapon. All strip searches conducted under this section shall be performed by persons of the same sex as the person arrested and on premises where the search cannot be observed by persons not physically conducting the search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">In <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 638, 641, 507 S.E.2d 661, 663 (1998), we held, \"[T]he fact that a search violates a legislative mandate without violating the Constitution does not provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>exclusion of such evidence.\u201d Therefore, even if we found that the officers violated Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1, the proper analysis is whether appellant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\">. Section 19.2-59.1(F) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">For purposes of this section, \"strip search\u201d shall mean having an arrested person remove or arrange some or all of his clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus, female breasts, or undergarments of such person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b322-6\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AY3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201c[I]n the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). The permissible purposes for the \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest rests ... on the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody ... [and] on the need to preserve evidence on his person for later use at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 94 S.Ct. 467. Nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment requires that we \u201caccept as axiomatic the principle that people harbor a reasonable expectation of privacy in their \u2018private parts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Justice v. City of Peachtree City, </em>961 F.2d 188, 191 (11th Cir.1992). <em>See also Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757, 767, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1834, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966) (holding that \u201c[t]he overriding function of the Fourth Amendment is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">For purposes of deciding this case, I assume the Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1(F) definition of \u201cstrip search\u201d applies. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has recognized, \u201cVirginia\u2019s definition of strip search ... is similar to that of most states.\u201d <em>Amaechi v. West, </em>237 F.3d 356, 365 (4th Cir.2001) (footnote omitted). Although federal law determines what constitutes a strip search for Fourth Amendment purposes, \u201cbecause states define strip search in a uniform fashion, ... state law [is] persuasive on our interpretation of what constitutes a strip search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365 n. 15 (citations omitted). The tenor of Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1 \u201cis in accordance with federal law governing limitations on the manner and scope of strip searches\u201d; thus, it provides a basis to determine whether a \u201csearch ... was reasonable or fell within a ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tionable area of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365 (footnote omitted). The statute\u2019s proviso, \u201c[f]or purposes of this section,\u201d does not alter the meaning of the term \u201cstrip search\u201d for federal constitutional purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In addition, I believe that <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 447, 455, 524 S.E.2d 155, 159 (2000), does not provide a viable alternative definition of \u201cstrip search\u201d; it seeks only to define that term by implication. The decision in <em>Hughes </em>concerned whether a defendant had consented to a search and did not have as its principal issue the definition of \u201cstrip search.\u201d We merely stated that the term \u201cgenerally refers\u201d to a given set of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 524 S.E.2d at 159. For these reasons, I would apply the statutory definition in this case and hold that the search of McCloud did not constitute a \u201cstrip search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Resolving the discrepancy between the officer\u2019s testimony and McCloud\u2019s testimony, the trial judge found that \u201cthe baggies\u2019 packaging was discovered on pat down ... [,] that [McCloud\u2019s] pants were pulled back in the front, [and] that the officer only had to reach in a short distance, two inches ... to get the top of the baggies and get that out.\u201d We are bound by the trial judge\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 477, 331 S.E.2d 422, 429 (1985). Thus, the issue we must decide is whether the officer conducted a strip search when he reached between McCloud\u2019s skin and his underwear to retrieve the package of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The officer testified that he did not disturb McCloud\u2019s clothing to make a \u201cvisual inspection of [McCloud\u2019s] genitals ... or undergarments.\u201d He pulled McCloud\u2019s pants and undergarment away from McCloud\u2019s skin to permit the seizure of the bag that was concealed two inches from the top of those garments. He did not see McCloud\u2019s private parts and did not seek to inspect them. He merely moved McCloud\u2019s clothing a few inches to permit a sufficient space to retrieve the bag. In making this minimal intrusion, the officer did not expose McCloud\u2019s body or underwear in any manner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>violated his personal privacy. I would hold, therefore, that this was a reasonable search incident to the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">For these reasons, I concur in the judgment affirming the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
