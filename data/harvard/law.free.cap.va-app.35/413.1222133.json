Cloutier (mother) contends the trial court erred in its decision denying her request to relocate. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">In accordance with familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See Brown v. Brown, </em>30 Va.App. 532, 534, 518 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1999). Mother and Thomas W. Queen (father) were married December 10, 1988 and have two minor children. The parties separated July 1, 1998 and reached an agreement providing for joint legal custody of their children. The agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>a. The parties shall have joint legal custody of their minor children, ZACHARY QUEEN, born August 11, 1992, and ALISON QUEEN, born August 28, 1994, who shall reside with the parties as set forth below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">b. Except as provided in subparagraph c, below, the Husband shall have residential time with the children on the following four-week rotation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">Week One: From Thursday at or before 5:30 through Sunday at 5:30 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Week Two: From Thursday at or before 5:30 through Saturday at 9:30 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Week Three: From Thursday at or before 5:30 through Monday at 9:30 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">Week Four: From Thursday at or before 5:30 through Saturday at 9:30 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">c. On Fridays, the children shall reside with the Wife from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., unless the Husband is off work that day due to emergency weather conditions, in which case the children shall remain with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">d. At all times not otherwise specified above, the children shall reside with the Wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">The agreement also provided for vacation and holiday time with both parents. A final decree of divorce was entered October 8,1999 that incorporated the joint custody agreement. At the time of divorce, both parties lived in Fairfax County, where they had lived for most of their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Mother married Scott Livingston (Livingston) on November 20, 1999. Livingston, an attorney, lives and works in Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania. On January 18, 2000, mother filed a \u201cMotion for Relocation and to Modify Custodial Access\u201d so she could move with her children to Livingston\u2019s residence in Pennsylvania. Father filed a cross-motion requesting that the trial court deny mother\u2019s request to relocate and grant him primary residential custody of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">On May 9 and 10, 2000, the trial court held a hearing on the relocation request and the request to change primary custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of the children. At the conclusion of the hearing, the chancellor found that \u201cit is in the best interests of these children to grant [mother\u2019s] motion to allow her to move\u201d to Mount Lebanon. On May 26, 2000, father filed a motion to reconsider the court\u2019s ruling. On June 28, 2000, via telephone conference call, the chancellor denied father\u2019s motion to reconsider. On June 30, 2000, the chancellor entered an order disposing of all pending issues and granted mother\u2019s request to relocate. On July 5, 2000, the chancellor vacated the decree of June 30, 2000 and scheduled a July 7, 2000 hearing to reconsider the matter. On July 6, 2000, mother, at the court\u2019s request, filed a memorandum in opposition to father\u2019s motion to reconsider. On July 7, 2000, the trial court, after further hearing and argument, reversed its prior ruling, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">When I ruled in May, I said it was because I found that it was in the best interest of these children to be allowed to move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">But as I have given that more thought than I would like to share with the parties since then, I believe that I wrongly equated what was in Ms. Cloutier\u2019s best interest with what\u2019s in the children\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">And I have no doubt that it\u2019s in her best interest for the children to be allowed to move, but I also have no doubt that it\u2019s in the best interest of the children to remain here under a parenting arrangement that is akin to that which the parties have established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Thus, the trial court ordered that the <em>status quo </em>remain unchanged and denied both the mother\u2019s motion to relocate and the father\u2019s motion to transfer primary residential custody to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">On July 18, 2000, mother filed a motion to reconsider this ruling. The trial court denied mother\u2019s motion on July 24, 2000 and entered a final order on August 11, 2000, which rescinded and vacated the court\u2019s initial decision to grant mother\u2019s motion for relocation, granted father\u2019s motion to reconsider and ultimately denied mother\u2019s motion for relocation. Mother appeals from the trial court\u2019s August 11, 2000 decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>II. TRIAL COURT\u2019S VACATION AND RECONSIDERATION OF THE JUNE 30, 2000 DECREE</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Mother contends that the chancellor erred by vacating the initial June 30, 2000 decree and entering a later final order reversing his original decision. She argues that the chancellor lacked authority to modify the initial June 30, 2000 decree absent a finding of \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Rule 1:1 provides that, \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the control of the trial court and <em>subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) If the trial court does not enter an order suspending or vacating the final order within twenty-one days, the trial court thereafter is divested of jurisdiction over the matter. <em>See Vokes v. Vokes, </em>28 Va.App. 349, 357-58, 504 S.E.2d 865, 869 (1998). Rule 1:1 allows the trial court to correct or change an order within the twenty-one-day window whenever circumstances require it. This is not a new custodial proceeding, requiring a threshold showing of a material change in circumstances, but rather it is a continuation of the underlying hearing and disposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>18 Va.App. 427, 432, 444 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1994) (which required no change of circumstances to modify a final decree if done within the twenty-one-day period allowed by Rule 1:1). To hold otherwise would as stated by the chancellor require \u201can abdication of what I think I\u2019m charged with doing as a judge.\u201d The chancellor must have the ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>to enter a timely order embodying a correct resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In the instant case, the chancellor\u2019s original decree was entered June 30, 2000 and vacated July 5, 2000. Therefore, the chancellor timely vacated the decree in accordance with Rule 1:1. The decision whether to reconsider the decree within the twenty-one-day time period lies within the sound discretion of the chancellor. <em>See Howe v. Howe, </em>30 Va.App. 207, 213, 516 S.E.2d 240, 243 (1999). Thus, the chancellor, after reflection, determined that his initial decision was erroneous and timely corrected it in the same proceeding. Therefore, we hold that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in vacating the June 30, 2000 decree that allowed wife\u2019s relocation with the parties\u2019 children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">III. DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"AqK9\">A. \u201cLOCAL RULES\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Mother next contends she was denied due process when the trial court reconsidered its original ruling without giving her an opportunity to respond to father\u2019s motion to reconsider, thus violating \u201clocal rules\u201d set out in The Fairfax Circuit Court Manual. The cited sections of the \u201clocal rules\u201d provide that <em>\u201c[n]o response </em>to the Motion for Reconsideration should be filed by the original prevailing party <em>unless </em>and <em>until </em>a response is requested by the Judge,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the Judge may reconsider the original ruling, the Judge will request a response to solely the issue or issues the Judge may reconsider.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">As a preliminary matter, Code \u00a7 8.01-4 provides that \u201clocal rules\u201d are limited to \u201cthose rules necessary to promote proper order and decorum and the efficient and safe use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>courthouse facilities and the clerks\u2019 offices.\u201d \u201cLocal rules\u201d cannot affect the substantive rights of the litigants. In line with these strictures, the Foreword to the Fairfax Circuit Court Manual specifically states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQE\">the procedures set out herein are not Rules and cannot provide a basis for the imposition of sanctions, nor are they intended to create additional pitfalls for unwary practitioners, especially those who do not often practice before our Court. Thus, the judges will retain discretion not to enforce a procedure strictly if the judge believes it would be unjust to do so under the circumstances of that specific case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3C\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">[They are] not Rules of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Furthermore, on July 6, 2000, mother filed a response to father\u2019s motion to reconsider, and the chancellor acknowledged that appellant \u201cfiled an opposition to [the] motion to reconsider, which I received and have reviewed.\u201d Appellant was also given an opportunity to make oral argument to the trial court concerning the reconsideration. Thus, we find no lack of due process in mother\u2019s ability to present and argue her case. She was provided with and took advantage of the opportunity to respond to the motion for reconsideration, and the suggested procedures set out in the Fairfax Circuit Court Manual impaired no substantive or procedural due process right.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">B. REMEDY NOT REQUESTED BY THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Next, mother argues that the trial court erred by \u201cimpos[ing] a custody schedule on the parties that neither party\u201d requested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, father, in his response to mother\u2019s motion, \u201cpray[ed] that the [motion] be denied\u201d and moth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>er, in her answer and opposition to father\u2019s cross-motion, requested that the trial court \u201cdeny the Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion to transfer primary custody of the children to the Defendant.\u201d Thus, each party was aware and on notice that the other party had requested that the court deny their respective motions. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 20-108 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN7\">[t]he court may, from time to time <em>after </em>decreeing as provided in \u00a7 20-107.2, on petition of either of the parents, <em>or on its own motion </em>or upon petition of any probation officer or superintendent of public welfare, which petition shall set forth the reasons for the relief sought, revise and alter such decree concerning the care, custody, and maintenance of the children and make a new decree concerning the same, as <em>the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">(Emphasis added.) \u201cThe burden is on the moving party to show a right to the relief sought.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Gentry, </em>18 Va.App. 318, 326, 443 S.E.2d 448, 453 (1994) (citing <em>Holmes v. Holmes, </em>7 Va.App. 472, 482, 375 S.E.2d 387, 393 (1988)). If the moving party fails to meet his or her burden of proof, the trial court maintains the discretion to deny a motion to modify custody. <em>See Bostick v. Bostick-Bennett, </em>23 Va.App. 527, 478 S.E.2d 319 (1996); <em>Hughes, </em>18 Va.App. 318, 443 S.E.2d 448. The moving party must establish that modification of custody is in the best interests of the child. <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323. In determining child custody issues, including relocation, the trial court\u2019s paramount concern and the determinative factor must remain the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d regardless of what the parents desire. <em>See Stockdale v. Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. 179, 183, 532 S.E.2d 332, 335 (2000); <em>see also Brown, </em>30 Va.App. 532, 518 S.E.2d 336; <em>Piatt v. Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. 426, 499 S.E.2d 567 (1998); <em>Simmons v. Simmons, </em>1 Va.App. 358, 361, 339 S.E.2d 198, 199 (1986). If the trial court finds that relocation is not in the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d the trial court must deny the relocation request. <em>See Wilson v. Wilson, </em>12 Va.App. 1251, 1255, 408 S.E.2d 576, 579 (1991); <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, 2 </em>Va.App. 571, 573, 347 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986). If maintaining the <em>status quo </em>is in the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d the court shall deny any requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>to change custody and order that the <em>status quo </em>be maintained. <em>See Brown, </em>30 Va.App. at 538, 518 S.E.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In the instant case, the chancellor determined that neither mother\u2019s request to remove the children from their current environment nor father\u2019s proposal to grant him primary physical custody was in the best interest of the children. The chancellor was required to fashion an appropriate remedy that comported with the best interest of the children, even if not specifically requested by the mother or father. Thus, once the issue of the appropriate custody or visitation plan for the children was before the court, the court was not required to adopt either parent\u2019s suggested remedy. The need to fashion complete justice on the facts presented is the role of the chancellor. A chancellor is required to make a custody determination based solely upon the best interests of the children. To limit a chancellor\u2019s remedy to only the custody arrangement requested by one of the parents would unduly restrict his or her options and allow a parent to circumvent the statutory obligation of the chancellor to determine custody based only upon the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">IV. DENIAL OF MOTION TO RELOCATE CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Mother next contends she met her burden of proof and the trial court erred in denying her motion to relocate to Pennsylvania with her children. When the court hears evidence at an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, its decision \u201c \u2018is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed [on appeal] unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. at 432, 499 S.E.2d at 570 (quoting <em>Venable v. Venable, </em>2 Va.App. 178, 186, 342 S.E.2d 646, 651 (1986)). On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See Brown, </em>30 Va.App. at 534, 518 S.E.2d at 337. Therefore, the issue to be addressed is whether the evidence supports the chancellor\u2019s August 11, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">A. CHANCELLOR\u2019S FAILURE TO REFER TO THE STATUTORY FACTORS IN THE ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Mother alleges that the trial court failed to consider the statutory factors, as required by Code \u00a7 20-124.3, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>in reconsidering the case the chancellor \u201cdid not even mention, let alone consider, the required statutory factors.\u201d Therefore, mother alleges that the trial court erred. The record clearly establishes that the chancellor considered all the evidence presented by the parties and witnesses, appropriately analyzed the statutory requirements, and referred to his consideration of them during the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The trial court must \u201cgive primary consideration to the best interests of the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B). Custody determinations must be based upon the child\u2019s best interest as viewed under the circumstances existing at the time of the decision. <em>See Wilson, </em>12 Va.App. at 1255, 408 S.E.2d at 579. Failure to consider all the factors set out in Code \u00a7 20-124.3 is reversible error. <em>See Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. at 434, 499 S.E.2d at 571. However \u201c[a]s long as the trial court <em>examines </em>the factors, it is not \u2018required to quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u2019\u201d <em>Sargent v. Sargent, </em>20 Va.App. 694, 702, 460 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1995) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Woolley v. Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. 337, 345, 349 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In the instant case, the trial court stated in its original ruling on May 10, \u201cI have fully considered all of the factors contained in section 20-124.3 of the Code of Virginia, particularly focusing on paragraphs 1 through 6 and paragraph 9, which is the any other factors paragraph. I don\u2019t think 7 and 8 are applicable.\u201d During his further review of the case, he re-evaluated the relationship of the evidence to the factors. On July 7, 2000, after hearing arguments to reconsider, the chancellor stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">[i]t will come as no surprise to any of you that this checkered chronology [of the case] stems from the fact that I have wrestled with my decision in this case from that May date as I have wrestled with no other case that I can remember for quite a while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>I think I\u2019m able to distinguish between the consternation that arises when, on the one hand, I have to make a difficult decision that\u2019s significantly going to affect people\u2019s families. The tough calls, as Mr. Shadyac calls them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">And on the other hand, when I make a decision that, on continued reflection, I become convinced was the wrong one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">And having reconsidered this matter, I find that it is not in the best interest of these children to be allowed to move from McLean to Mount Pleasant [sic], Pennsylvania, and I grant Mr. Queen\u2019s motion to reconsider and I deny Ms. Cloutier\u2019s motion for leave to move them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">I am convinced that it is in the best interest of these children to maintain the nature and extent of a relationship with both of their parents. That can only be achieved through the physical proximity that the parties went to great lengths to establish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">And contrary to my earlier ruling, I do not believe that Mr. Queen and his children can maintain the type and the quality of a relationship that I think is in the best interests of these children if that move took place, that what they would gain from the move would be outweighed by what they would lose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">When I ruled in May, I said it was because I found that it was in the best interest of these children to be allowed to move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">But as I have given that more thought than I would like to share with the parties since then, I believe that I wrongly equated what was in Ms. Cloutier\u2019s best interest with what\u2019s in the children\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">And I have no doubt that it\u2019s in her best interest for the children to be allowed to move, but I also have no doubt that it\u2019s in the best interest of the children to remain here under a parenting arrangement that is akin to that which the parties have established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>... [F]or me not to [deny the request to relocate] would be an abdication of what I think I\u2019m charged with doing as a judge, and that\u2019s determining the best interest of these children and ruling accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In reviewing the record as a whole, it is clear that the chancellor conscientiously considered the required factors during the course of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">B. BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9c\">Mother further argues the trial court erred in failing to find that the best interests of the children would be served by permitting her to move them to Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The party requesting permission to remove the child from the state bears the burden of proof. <em>See Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323. \u201cIt is well settled in Virginia that the best interests of the children controls the issue of a change of custody or the issue of a custodial parent moving the children to another state.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>1 Va.App. at 362, 339 S.E.2d at 200; <em>see also Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323. In reaching a decision on the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d the court is guided by Code \u00a7 20-124.3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. at 181-82, 532 S.E.2d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Mother presented evidence showing positive results from her anticipated move to Pennsylvania. Her children would have the advantage of a new nuclear family, including Livingston and his children. She testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that the children wanted to move and live with Livingston, she had been and continues to be their \u201cprimary caregiver,\u201d and her retirement after relocating would allow her to attend to her children all day. She also testified that she would support father\u2019s visitation and offered to transport the children to him. Mother produced evidence that Mount Lebanon was a good community and provided excellent schools. This evidence supports her desire to relocate; however, on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See Brown, </em>30 Va.App. at 534, 518 S.E.2d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Thus, while these were factors to be weighed and considered by the court, the record also disclosed other evidence relevant to the issue before the chancellor. The evidence established that the joint custody arrangement currently in effect had worked well. Father was involved with the children and their activities. He attended school, extracurricular and sports functions, helped the children with their homework and met their needs when he was their caretaker. The children expressed a desire to spend more time with him. They were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>doing well socially and academically. Mother testified that their teachers commented that the children \u201cdon\u2019t seem like they\u2019re from a divorced family. They\u2019re happy. They\u2019re well-adjusted.\u201d In sum, the evidence established that father was also an active participant in the children\u2019s lives on a daily basis and their current environment was a positive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">If relocated, the children would move to Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, approximately a four-hour drive from father. The trial court determined that both mother and father were \u201cvery good parents.\u201d \u201cI have a mother and a father who are sharing time and commitments in a way that should be applauded and that has worked.\u201d The chancellor further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">I find that it is not in the best interest of these children to be allowed to move from McLean to Mount Pleasant [sic], Pennsylvania, and I grant Mr. Queen\u2019s motion to reconsider and I deny Ms. Cloutier\u2019s motion for leave to move them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">I am convinced that it is in the best interest of these children to maintain the nature and extent of a relationship with both of their natural parents. That can only be achieved through the physical proximity and through the sort of custodial arrangement that the parties went to great lengths to establish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">And contrary to my earlier ruling, I do not believe that Mr. Queen and his children can maintain the type and the quality of a relationship that I think is in the best interests of these children if that move took place, that what they could gain from the move would be outweighed by. what they would lose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">I also have no doubt that it\u2019s in the best interest of the children to remain here under a parenting arrangement that is akin to that which the parties have established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The chancellor also stated that mother\u2019s arguments, that the children like Livingston and Livingston\u2019s children, were not relevant to his determination of the best interest of mother and father\u2019s children. Thus, the chancellor concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>father\u2019s relationship with the children would be \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d by allowing mother to move them to Pennsylvania. <em>See Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. at 184, 532 S.E.2d at 335; <em>Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. at 575, 347 S.E.2d at 151. After viewing all the evidence and weighing the factors, the trial court concluded that mother failed to meet her burden to prove that the best interest of the children would be served by moving them to Pennsylvania. Based upon the record before us, we hold that the chancellor\u2019s ruling is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Lastly, mother contends the trial court erred by not considering the interests of the mother, the custodial parent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in determining whether to grant the relocation request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mother relies upon New Jersey case law for a \u201cunity of interests\u201d analysis which mother urges this Court to adopt. She argues that as a matter of law the interests of the children cannot be divorced from those of their primary caregiver and, therefore, whatever benefits mother will also benefit the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In Virginia, the law is clear that the \u201cbest interests of the children controls the issue of a change of custody or the issue of a custodial parent moving the children to another state.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>1 Va.App. at 362, 339 S.E.2d at 200; <em>see also Stockdale, </em>33 Va.App. at 183, 532 S.E.2d at 335; <em>Bostick, </em>23 Va.App. at 535, 478 S.E.2d at 323. The court may consider a benefit to the parent from relocation only if the move independently benefits the children. We decline to adopt a \u201cunity of interests\u201d approach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. Appellant cites a number of federal cases which require the court to find a material change of circumstances prior to granting a motion to reconsider. However, there is no federal equivalent to Rule 1:1 and, therefore, federal cases on reconsideration are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Appellant also relies on <em>Baxter v. Baxter, </em>No. 0258-00-4, 2000 WL 1339505 (Va.Ct.App. Sept.19, 2000). We note that <em>Baxter v. Baxter </em>and the cases it cites are not on point. Furthermore, an unpublished opinion of this Court is not \u201cto be cited or relied upon as precedent except for the purpose of establishing res judicata, estoppel or the law of the case.\u201d <em>Grajales v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 1, 2 n. 2, 353 S.E.2d 789, 790 n. 2 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\">. Because we find that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in vacating his June 30, 2000 decree, our review is limited to whether the evidence supports his ultimate decision that the mother failed to meet her burden of proof that the move would be in the best interest of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\">. Mother relies upon <em>Potts v. Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 181 S.E. 521 (1935), for this proposition. However, unlike the instant case, <em>Potts </em>was a case at law not a case in equity. <em>Potts </em>holds only that a party cannot request one remedy in his or her pleadings and then at trial request a different remedy based upon a claim that was not set forth in the pleadings. Thus, <em>Potts </em>is inapplicable in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\">. Mother also contends that the trial court erred in its factual findings regarding Livingston's ability to move to Virginia and mother\u2019s ability to be a stay at home mom in Virginia. However the chancellor \"didn\u2019t find [mother\u2019s testimony] persuasive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">. Code \u00a7 20-124.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">In determining best interests of a child for purposes of determining custody ... the court shall consider the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">1.

The needs of the child, giving due consideration to other important relationships of the child, including but not limited to siblings, peers and extended family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">5.

Such other factors as the court deems necessary and proper to the determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The judge shall communicate to the parties the basis of the decision either orally or in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3 has been amended since the May 9-10, 2000 hearing. The amendments make no substantive changes relevant to this present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. Although mother delineates herself the \"custodial parent,\u201d both mother and father share joint custody of the children. This is not a case involving a custodial parent and a non-custodial parent with visitation rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\">. We note that prior to the expiration of the twenty-one days, mother put her home on the market and changed her work status in reliance on the earlier decision. Although this created a substantial hardship, which the trial judge acknowledged, his final decision was based on the best interests of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">. Mother also alleges that the trial court punished her by relying solely upon her statement that if her motion to relocate was denied she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>stay in Virginia. As previously noted, the trial court's decision to deny mother\u2019s motion was based upon the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not in the best interest of the children to move from their current environment where they were flourishing. Furthermore, the chancellor\u2019s reference to mother\u2019s statement that she would remain in Virginia, if not allowed to relocate, was not a part of his ruling. Only after the judge announced his ruling did mother\u2019s attorney inquire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">MR SHADYAC: [ ] just so I understand the Court\u2019s ruling, there\u2019s no change in custody, there\u2019s no change in custodial access. What you\u2019re contemplating is a continuation of what existed prior\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what Ms. Cloutier said. She wasn\u2019t going to move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">MR. SHADYAC: There was a cross petition also, your Honor, for him to have custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-16\">THE COURT: I\u2019m denying his cross petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">Thus, the record does not establish that the trial court relied solely upon mother\u2019s statement that she would not relocate if her motion was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
