Wayne D. Smoot [(claimant)] or his counsel to reimburse [employer\u2019s] lien\u201d on certain monies paid claimant in settlement of a third-party tort action. Finding the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) does not invest the commission with jurisdiction to afford employer the requested relief, we affirm the disputed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The substantive facts and procedural history are not in dispute. On March 6, 1995, claimant was injured in an automobile accident, and employer accepted the resulting claim as compensable under the Act. Accordingly, the commission awarded claimant temporary total disability of $280.73 per week, together with related medical benefits, pursuant to a memorandum of agreement executed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In addition to relief under the Act, claimant pursued a third-party tort claim, retaining counsel in both Virginia and Maryland and filing suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Maryland. Once aware of the pending tort action, employer advised claimant\u2019s counsel of \u201cthe workers\u2019 compensation claim and [employer\u2019s] statutory assignment and subrogation interest in the third-party recovery.\u201d Employer, however, did not intervene in the Maryland proceedings and continued to provide compensation benefits to claimant pursuant to the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The parties stipulated that, \u201c[o]n or about June 22, 1998, ... claimant ... voluntarily settled his third-party action ... for the sum of $500,000,\u201d received a net recovery of $336,672.49, released the alleged tort-feasors from further liability, and dismissed the civil suit, \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d all without notice to or approval of employer. Learning of the settlement, employer terminated benefits to claimant on September 20, 1998, after paying a total of $162,587.57 in wage and medical benefits. Employer thereafter filed an \u201cApplication for Hearing\u201d with the commission, seeking \u201cTermination/Suspension of the outstanding award,\u201d a related \u201ccredit\u201d and an \u201corder to claimant or claimant\u2019s counsel to pay statutory subrogation interest to carrier.\u201d By agreement, the parties submitted the issues to the commission upon a written stipulation, several affidavits and related documentation and memoranda of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">On November 10, 1999, Deputy Commissioner Colville granted employer\u2019s application to terminate the award, effective September 20, 1998. The deputy, however, determined \u201cthe [cjommission [did] not have jurisdiction to order the claimant to reimburse the carrier for the disability and medical benefits paid through September 20, 1998.\u201d On appeal by employer, the full commission affirmed both termination of claimant\u2019s \u201cright to future benefits under the Act,\u201d as a result of \u201chis acceptance of the settlement without the consent of the workers\u2019 compensation carrier,\u201d and the related finding that the commission lacked \u201cauthority to order the repayment requested by [employer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Employer appeals to this Court, contending the \u201ccommission has jurisdiction to decide issues arising under the [Act],\u201d including \u201cjurisdiction to adjudicate matters concerning liens as they affect the claimant\u2019s rights.\u201d Claimant counters that, \u201csince ... [his] ... compensation ... award has been terminated\u201d and \u201cbenefits past, present or future\u201d are no longer in issue, \u201cthe rights of the claimant\u201d contemplated by the Act \u201care not at stake\u201d and employer has received \u201cthe sole remedy\u201d available from the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u201cWe construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below,\u201d claimant in this instance. <em>Tomlin v. Vance Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>22 Va.App. 448, 452, 470 S.E.2d 599, 601 (1996). \u201cThe commission\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal if supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, \u201c \u2018[t]he construction afforded a statute by the public officials charged with its administration and enforcement is entitled to be given great weight by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynch v. Lee, </em>19 Va.App. 230, 232, 450 S.E.2d 391, 392 (1994) (citation omitted). However, we are not bound by legal determinations made by the commission, and, therefore, \u201c\u2018must inquire to determine if the correct legal conclusion has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Harper, </em>26 Va.App. 522, 529, 495 S.E.2d 540, 543 (1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-309 and -310 of the Act underpin employer\u2019s claim to reimbursement from claimant and the attendant assertion that the commission has jurisdiction to grant the requested relief. Absent such \u201cstatutory provisions, neither employer nor [its] carrier would have any right of action against a third party or the right to share in the proceeds of any recovery claimant might obtain.\u201d <em>Overhead Door Co. of Norfolk v. Lewis, </em>22 Va.App. 240, 243, 468 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-309 provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">[a] claim against an employer under [the Act] for injury or death benefits shall operate as an assignment to the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>er of any right to recover damages which the injured employee ... may have against any other party for such injury or death, and such employer shall be subrogated to any such right and may enforce, in his own name or in the name of the injured employee, ... the legal liability of such other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-812.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Should \u201csuch employer\u201d elect to pursue the \u201clegal liability\u201d of another, \u201c[a]ny amount collected ... in excess of the amount paid by employer or for which he is liable [under the Act] shall be held by employer for the benefit of the injured employee, ... less a proportionate share ... for reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees----\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-309(B). However, \u201c[n]o compromise settlement shall be made by the employer in the exercise of such right to subrogation without the approval of the Commission and the injured employee____\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-309(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">In addition to the protection assured employer by Code \u00a7 65.2-309, Code \u00a7 65.2-310 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASk\">[i]n any action by an employee ... against any person other than the employer, the court shall, on petition or motion of the employer at any time prior to verdict, ascertain the amount of compensation paid and expenses ... incurred by the employer under the provisions of this title and deduct therefrom a proportionate share of such amounts as are paid by [employee] for reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees as provided in \u00a7 65.2-311; and, in event of judgment against such person other than the employer, the court shall in its order require that the judgment debtor pay such compensation and expenses of the employer, less said share of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees, so ascertained by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>out of the amount of the judgment, ... and the balance, if any, to [employee].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-310.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, an employer may safeguard a statutory claim for benefits paid or anticipated under the Act by \u201cpetitioning] the court for a hen against the third-party judgment in the amount of compensation and other benefits employer has paid.\u201d <em>Overhead Door, </em>29 Va.App. at 58, 509 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">It is well established that the Act also \u201cpermits an injured employee the right to recover from a negligent third party full damages for injuries inflicted on him by such party.\u201d <em>Sheris v. Sheris, </em>212 Va. 825, 834, 188 S.E.2d 367, 373 (1972). While Code \u00a7 65.2-309(C) expressly precludes settlement of a third-party claim by an employer absent approval of both the commission and the employee, \u201c[a]n employee ... is not expressly prohibited from initiating and settling [such] claim without the consent of employer and its insurer.\u201d <em>Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Van Hoy, </em>225 Va. 64, 70, 300 S.E.2d 750, 754 (1983). However, a third-party settlement by an employee, undertaken without the \u201cknowledge and consent of employer and its insurer,\u201d wrongfully \u201cimpair[s]\u201d the rights of subrogation provided employer by the Act and, therefore, the employee \u201c \u2018forfeits any right to future compensation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>Green v. Warwick Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>5 Va.App. 409, 412, 364 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In <em>Safety-Kleen, </em>the employee, Van Hoy, like claimant, also successfully pursued a third-party action for injuries then subject of an award by the commission, and unilaterally released the tort-feasor. Upon learning of the settlement, INA, the carrier for employer Safety-Kleen, terminated benefits and applied for a hearing before the commission \u201con a change in condition.\u201d <em>Safety-Kleen, </em>225 Va. at 66-67, 300 S.E.2d at 751. In response, Van Hoy filed a motion to reinstate the award. The commission \u201callowed INA credit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the net amount of the settlement by [suspending] payments under the award ... until further payments that may be due thereunder exceeded]\u201d the net settlement. <em>Id. </em>However, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed, reasoning that Van Hoy\u2019s conduct sufficiently prejudiced INA to justify termination of benefits. The Court recognized \u201cVan Hoy might thereby enjoy in part of a double recovery, ... retaining] the payments already made by INA in addition to ... the third-party settlement,\u201d but \u201cexpressed] no opinion upon this aspect of the case, for we are granting the relief which Safety-Kleen and INA have sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 300 S.E.2d at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Here, employer specifically requested the commission to award the additional relief presaged by the Court in <em>SafetyKleen, </em>reimbursement from the employee, a remedy neither expressly set forth in the Act nor heretofore judicially sanctioned. Asserting the interests in such recovery created by the Act and the commission\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction to determine all questions arising under \u2018the [Act]\u2019 \u201d recognized in <em>Bogle Dev. Co., Inc. v. Buie, </em>250 Va. 431, 434, 463 S.E.2d 467, 468 (1995) <em>rev\u2019g </em>19 Va.App. 370, 451 S.E.2d 682 (1994), employer invokes the \u201cimplied power\u201d of the commission \u201cto do full and complete justice\u201d between employer and employee. <em>Harris v. Diamond Constr. Co., </em>184 Va. 711, 720, 36 S.E.2d 573, 577 (1946). The commission, however, guided by a prior opinion, <em>Sicilia v. Inner View, Ltd., </em>1999 WL 1442124 at-2 (VWC File No. 175-51-95 (Dec. 2, 1999)), declined to act, noting that \u201cnothing in the Code ... provides [it] with the authority to order the repayment requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In <em>Sicilia, </em>the commission confronted a fact pattern substantially similar to the instant record, an employer seeking both termination of benefits and reimbursement from an employee\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>settlement of a third-party claim. Rejecting the employer\u2019s request, the commission concluded \u201cthat [it] does not have jurisdiction to compel disbursements of proceeds of recovery from a third-party action. This question must be addressed to a court of law....\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>As employer correctly reminds us, <em>Buie </em>construed \u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-700<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [to] vest[ ] the Commission with jurisdiction to determine all questions \u2018arising under\u2019 the ... Act. This grant of subject matter jurisdiction includes the authority ... to enforce its orders and to resolve coverage and payment disputes.\u201d <em>Buie, </em>250 Va. at 434, 463 S.E.2d at 468. However, <em>Buie </em>also instructed that, \u201cjurisdiction is not unlimited.... \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">Generally, the Commission's jurisdiction is limited to those issues which are directly or necessarily related to the right of an employee to compensation for a work-related injury. In many states, including Virginia, when the rights of the employee in a pending claim are not at stake, the commissions disavow jurisdiction and send the parties to the courts for relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Tucker, </em>3 Va.App. 116, 120, 348 S.E.2d 416, 419 (1986); <em>see also Buie, </em>250 Va. at 434, 463 S.E.2d at 468 (\u201cwhen the rights of the claimant are not at stake, the Act clearly leaves the litigants to their common law remedies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Thus, the commission is empowered to decide matters between the employer and employee affecting <em>compensation rights </em>and directly related interests of the employee that spring from the Act. Here, however, neither a compensation right in claimant nor a reimbursement right in employer, which arises from the Act, is at issue. Claimant\u2019s benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>have been properly paid and terminated, without objection, and any unresolved residual rights of employer against him are not specifically embraced by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Employer mistakenly relies upon the \u201cimplied power\u201d of the commission to do \u201cfull and complete justice\u201d by ordering reimbursement, at once avoiding double recovery by claimant and safeguarding employer\u2019s interests. While the commission is implicitly empowered \u201cto protect itself and its awards from fraud, imposition or mistake,\u201d such circumstances are neither present nor alleged on the instant record. <em>Harris, </em>184 Va. at 720, 36 S.E.2d at 577; <em>Collins v. Dep\u2019t of Alcoholic Beverage Control, </em>21 Va.App. 671, 680-81, 467 S.E.2d 279, 283, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 625, 472 S.E.2d 287 (1996). \u2018We are unaware of any Virginia appellate cases applying [this] doctrine ... to permit the commission to exercise jurisdiction or ... grant ... relief never authorized by the Act, and we are unwilling to give the doctrine such an interpretation under the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Overhead Door, </em>29 Va.App. at 61, 509 S.E.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Accordingly, the commission correctly determined that the requested order of reimbursement was beyond its jurisdiction, express or implied, and employer must look to the judiciary for relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\">. When any employer is insured against liability for compensation with an insurance carrier, and such carrier shall have paid any compensation for which the employer is liable or shall have assumed the liability of the employer therefor, it shall be subrogated to all the rights and duties of the employer and may enforce any such rights in its own name or in the name of the injured employee....</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Code \u00a7 65.2-812.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">.

The \"application of particular phases of ... [workers\u2019 compensation] law in the different states depends upon the peculiar wording of the pertinent statutes.\u201d <em>Feitig v. Chalkley, </em>185 Va. 96, 98, 38 S.E.2d 73, 74 (1946). In contrast to the Virginia Act, workers\u2019 compensation statutes of several states specifically recognize a right of <em>reimbursement </em>in employers from employees for a statutory share of third-party recoveries. <em>See, e.g., </em>820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 30 5/5(b); Indiana Code \u00a7 22-3-2-13; Maine Statutes \u00a7 827; N.C. General Statutes \u00a7 97-10.2; N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 52-5-17; R.I. Gen.

During pendency of the instant proceedings, employer instituted a civil action against claimant in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, also seeking recovery of the subject benefits.
