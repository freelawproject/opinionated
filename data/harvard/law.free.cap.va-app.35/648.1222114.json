(father) appeals from the dismissal of his challenge to the adoption of his son, J.B., by the child\u2019s maternal grandmother, G.F.M. (grandmother). The trial court granted grandmother\u2019s demurrer on the ground that the challenge was untimely under Code \u00a7 63.1-237, which requires that such challenges be made within six months following entry of the final order of adoption, even if fraud or lack of notice to or personal jurisdiction over any person is shown.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, father contends (1) application of the statute\u2019s six-month limitation period violated his due process and equal protection rights under the facts of this case, which include his allegations that grandmother committed extrinsic and intrinsic fraud such that father never received notice of the proceedings and the court never obtained personal jurisdiction over father; and (2) the circuit court erroneously failed to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>and to consider the issue of visitation. A panel of this Court, with one judge dissenting, held the statute unconstitutional as applied in this case and reversed the ruling of the trial court. <em>See </em>32 Va.App. 846, 531 S.E.2d 50 (2000). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>granted grandmother\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">On rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we hold that application of the time limitation imposed in Code \u00a7 63.1-237 was unconstitutional under the facts alleged in father\u2019s petition and, therefore, that the circuit court erroneously granted grandmother\u2019s demurrer. We also hold the trial court did not err in refusing to act on father\u2019s request for visitation and appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for J.B. because, unless and until the adoption order is set aside, father lacks standing to make such requests. We reverse the ruling of the trial court granting the demurrer, vacate its order of dismissal, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Because this case involves the granting of a demurrer, we accept as true, for purposes of reviewing this motion only, all facts alleged in the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-273; <em>Runion v. Helvestine, </em>256 Va. 1, 7, 501 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1998). \u201cA demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. Under this rule, the facts admitted are those expressly alleged, those which fairly can be viewed as impliedly alleged, and those which may be fairly and justly inferred from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Rosillo v. Winters, </em>235 Va. 268, 270, 367 S.E.2d 717, 717 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">In late September 1995, father, his approximately fourteen-month-old son, J.B., and the child\u2019s biological mother, C.B., were involved in an automobile accident in which C.B. was killed and J.B. was seriously injured. For ten months prior to the accident, father, C.B. and J.B. resided together. J.B. had \u201cspent the majority of his life in [the] home\u201d shared by father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>and C.B. That \u201chousehold did not include [grandmother G.F.M.],\u201d C.B.\u2019s mother. The record does not reveal where J.B. and C.B. resided for the first four months of J.B.\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Following the accident, J.B. was hospitalized, and father \u201cstayed at his side ... for several weeks.\u201d It was father\u2019s understanding that J.B. would require constant medical care following his release from the hospital, and father and grandmother agreed that grandmother would care for J.B. in her home following his release from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">At the time of the accident, father, a native Spanish speaker, could not read English. After C.B.\u2019s death, father relied on grandmother for assistance in completing paperwork. On October 12, 1995, at grandmother\u2019s request, father signed a \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d form by which he purported to consent to grandmother\u2019s adopting J.B. The caption on the form read \u201cIn the matter of an adoption of a child known as [J.B.] ... by [G.F.M., grandmother].\u201d Father signed the consent in grandmother\u2019s lawyer\u2019s office, in the presence of a notary but without counsel or an interpreter. Father was not aware of the content of the form he signed and relied on grandmother\u2019s representations that his execution of the form \u201cwas merely to allow [grandmother] to have access to medical information and accompany [J.B.] to appointments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">After father signed the \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d form, grandmother petitioned the circuit court to adopt her grandson, J.B., including with her petition the form executed by father. In her petition, she falsely represented that J.B. had lived in her home \u201ccontinuously for his whole life\u201d and that J.B.\u2019s mother, C.B., also had resided with grandmother until the time of her death. The court ruled that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-223(E), it was \u201cproper to proceed without the investigations and report required by Section 63.1-223,\u201d and by order entered October 24, 1995, it decreed J.B. the adopted child of grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Other than father\u2019s execution of the consent to adoption form, which he could not read, father received no notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>adoption. He was not served with a copy of the petition or the final order. The order was entered against his wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Following C.B.\u2019s death and J.B.\u2019s release from the hospital, J.B. resided primarily with grandmother, but both before and after entry of the adoption order, father \u201c[saw] and care[d] for [J.B.] several times per week, including overnight visits in [father\u2019s] home on weekends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In February 1997, father married in a ceremony held in grandmother\u2019s home. Father and his new wife \u201ccontinued the established pattern of frequent and prolonged visitation with [J.B.] in their home and [grandmother\u2019s] home. Some of these visits lasted for two weeks or more, and at least one included a trip out of state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In February 1998, father and his new wife informed grandmother that they wished to have J.B. live in their household. At that time, grandmother informed father that she had adopted J.B. in October 1995. Grandmother has prevented father from having any additional contact with J.B. since that time and has served father and his wife with trespassing notices to prevent them from coming to her home to see J.B.</p>\n<p id=\"APz\">On September 24, 1998, father filed a petition to set aside the adoption order, claiming grandmother committed extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, and that application of the six-month statute of limitation to prevent a challenge \u201cbased on lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of notice, duress, and fraud\u201d violated his due process and equal protection rights. He sought to have the statute declared unconstitutional as applied to him, to have the adoption order declared void, and to be awarded regular visitation with his son until his parental rights were restored. He also sought appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Grandmother filed a demurrer, asserting that the statute was constitutional and barred father from seeking relief. She also contended that father lacked standing to request visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The trial court held that the petition and consent for adoption provided it with jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 63.1-220.3(C)(6) to enter the final adoption order. With the passage of more than six months time following that entry, the court held that Code \u00a7 63.1-237 prevented father from attacking the order. It stated expressly, \u201cThe court does not see the need to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute,\u201d and it did not do so, despite father\u2019s repeated requests for consideration of this issue. It also said, \u201cI see nothing ... preventing the birth father and his wife [from] fil[ing] a petition for the adoption of his birth-son who is now legally the child of the grandparents. It may well be that the best interests of the child would govern the outcome of that action which may or may not be the same outcome that now exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Father filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CODE \u00a7 63.1-237 AS APPLIED TO FATHER<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Extrinsic fraud is fraud which occurs outside the judicial process and \u201cconsists of \u2018conduct which prevents a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>submission of the controversy to the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peet v. Peet, </em>16 Va.App. 323, 327, 429 S.E.2d 487, 490 (1993) (quoting <em>Jones v. Willard, </em>224 Va. 602, 607, 299 S.E.2d 504, 508 (1983)). It includes \u201c \u2018purposely keeping [the unsuccessful party] in ignorance of the suit.... In all such instances the unsuccessful party is really prevented, by the fraudulent contrivance of his adversary, from having a trial....\u2019\u201d <em>McClung v. Folks, </em>126 Va. 259, 270, 101 S.E. 345, 348 (1919) (quoting <em>Pico v.

Cole, </em>194 Va. 50, 57, 72 S.E.2d 382, 386 (1952) (holding sufficient to state claim of extrinsic fraud allegations in complaint that father made false statements to daughter to persuade her not to contest judicial transfer of her property to him). Under these circumstances, \u201c[a] collateral challenge to a judgment ... is allowed because such fraud perverts the judicial processes and prevents the court or non-defrauding party from discovering the fraud through the regular adversarial process.\u201d <em>Peet, </em>16 Va.App. at 327, 429 S.E.2d at 490. Extrinsic fraud, therefore, is \u201c \u2018fraud that ... deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hagy v. Pruitt, </em>339 S.C. 425, 529 S.E.2d 714, 717 (2000) (quoting <em>Hilton Head Center of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>294 S.C. 9, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Code \u00a7 63.1-237 purports to restrict a party\u2019s ability to bring a collateral action asserting extrinsic fraud in order to set aside an adoption. Code \u00a7 63.1-237 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>After the expiration of six months from the date of entry of any final order of adoption from which no appeal has been taken to the Court of Appeals, the validity thereof shall not be subject to attack in any proceedings, collateral or direct, for any reason, including but not limited to fraud, duress, failure to give any required notice, failure of any procedural requirement, or lack of jurisdiction over any person, and such order shall be final for all purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIc\">This statute roughly tracks the language of the Revised Uniform Adoption Act, except that the Uniform Act provides for a one-year limitation period. <em>See </em>Revised Unif. Adoption Act (RUAA) \u00a7 15(b) (amended 1971), 9 U.L.A. 203 (1999); <em>see also </em>Uniform Adoption Act \u00a7 3-707(d) (1994), 9 U.L.A. 97-98 (providing that, without exception, a decree of adoption \u201cis not subject to a challenge begun more than six months after the decree or order is issued\u201d). The commentary accompanying the RUAA \u201cexplains that it is designed to impose a very short statute of limitation\u201d because \u201c \u2018[t]he policy of stability in a family relationship, particularly when a young minor is involved, outweighs the possible loss to a person whose rights are cut off through fraud and ignorance.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney v. Ivey, </em>287 Ark. 300, 698 S.W.2d 506, 507 (1985) (quoting 9 U.L.A. 48 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Father concedes that literal application of the statute would bar his petition to set aside the adoption. The adoption was effected by order entered October 24, 1995; his petition to set aside was filed on September 24, 1998, well outside the six-month limitation period. He contends, however, that application of Code \u00a7 63.1-237\u2019s limitation period to bar his challenge to the validity of the adoption violated his due process and equal protection rights. We agree that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ave\">The due process clauses of the Federal and Virginia Constitutions provide that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">All actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional. Thus, courts will declare an enactment un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>constitutional only when it clearly is repugnant to some provision of either the state or federal constitution. The party challenging the enactment has the burden of proving its unconstitutionality, and if a reasonable doubt exists as to its constitutionality, the doubt must be resolved in favor of its validity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">Generally, due process is satisfied if an enactment has a \u201creasonable relation to a proper purpose and [is] neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.\u201d Thus, under the general rule, a statute is not violative of due process if it withstands a \u201crational basis\u201d test. When, however, a statute affects a fundamental right or a suspect classification, its constitutionality will be judged by the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\"><em>Hess v. Snyder Hunt Corp., </em>240 Va. 49, 52-53, 392 S.E.2d 817, 820 (1990) (citations omitted). When a statute \u201csignificantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, it cannot be upheld unless it is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.\u201d <em>Zablocki v.

Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 256-58, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2990-91, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">In the vast majority of cases, state law determines the final outcome.... In some cases, however, this Court has held that the Federal Constitution supersedes state law and provides even greater protection for certain <em>formal </em>family relationships.... In these cases the court has found that the relationship of love and duty in a recognized family unit is an interest in liberty entitled to constitutional protection. \u201c[S]tate intervention to terminate [such a] relationship ... must be accomplished by procedures meeting the requisites of the Due Process Clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 256-58, 103 S.Ct. at 2991 (quoting <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982)) (emphasis added) (other citations omitted). \u201c \u2018[T]he interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of parents in their relationship with their children is <em>sufficiently fundamental </em>to come within the finite class of liberty interests protected by [the Due Process Clause of] the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>M.L.B. v.

The Court has drawn a clear distinction between \u201ca mere biological relationship and an actual relationship of parental responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 103 S.Ct. at 2992.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">The difference between the developed parent-child relationship ... and the potential relationship ... is both clear and significant. When an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by \u201ccom[ing] forward to participate in the rearing of his child,\u201d his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the Due Process Clause. At that point it may be said that he \u201cact[s] as a father toward his children.\u201d ...

Therefore, a biological parent who participates in the rearing of his or her child has a fundamental right to continue to participate in that relationship unless the relationship is altered or terminated by due process of law. <em>See id.; see also McKinney, </em>698 S.W.2d at 508; <em>Wade v.

The statute \u201csignificantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right,\u201d and \u201cit cannot be upheld unless it is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.\u201d <em>Zablocki, </em>434 U.S. at 388, 98 S.Ct. at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We agree that the state has a compelling interest in \u201c \u2018[preserving] stability in a family relationship, particularly when a young minor is involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney, </em>698 S.W.2d at 507. We disagree, however, that application of the six-month statute of limitation under the facts of this case is sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of stability while simultaneously preserving father\u2019s fundamental right to continue the pre-existing relationship with his biological child. The facts alleged in father\u2019s petition to set aside the adoption, if taken as true, confirm the existence of this relationship. The petition alleges that the child resided with his mother and father for ten months prior to being injured in a car accident at fourteen months of age. Father remained at his child\u2019s bedside throughout the course of his hospitalization. Although father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and grandmother agreed that grandmother would take care of the child upon his release from the hospital because he would require constant attention due to his injuries, father did not abandon his relationship with his son. To the contrary, the child routinely resided with father overnight on the weekends, and father \u201c[saw] and care[d] for\u201d the child during the week, as well. When father married about one and one-half years later, he and his new wife \u201ccontinued the established pattern of frequent and prolonged visitation with [J.B.] in their home and [grandmother\u2019s] home. Some of these visits lasted for two weeks or more, and at least one included a trip out of state.\u201d Under the facts alleged, father was no stranger to his child. Therefore, allowing father to attack the order of adoption more than six months after its entry based on grandmother\u2019s alleged extrinsic'fraud would not have jeopardized the state\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining the stability of the family relationship. Grandmother\u2019s refusal to allow father any contact with the child likely has been more disruptive than an order setting aside the adoption would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Furthermore, the facts alleged, if taken as true, also establish that grandmother\u2019s extrinsic fraud resulted in a lack of notice to and personal jurisdiction over father. Although the court may have believed it acquired personal jurisdiction based on father\u2019s execution of the Consent to Adoption form, the acquisition of personal jurisdiction is based on the receipt of notice which complies with the Due Process Clause. <em>See Price v. Price, </em>17 Va.App. 105, 112, 435 S.E.2d 652, 657 (1993) (citing <em>Kulko v. Superior Ct., </em>436 U.S. 84, 91, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978)).

He was unable to read English and reasonably relied on grandmother\u2019s fraudulent representations that the purpose of the \u201cConsent to Adoption\u201d form was merely to allow grandmother access to the child\u2019s medical records since she would be assuming primary responsibility for the child\u2019s medical care. Until grandmother told father of the adoption over two years later, father had no reason to know that his parental rights had been terminated. <em>See, e.g., STB Marketing Corp. v. Zolfaghari, </em>240 Va. 140, 145, 393 S.E.2d 394, 397 (1990) (construing due diligence standard as the \u201c \u2018measure of prudence ... expected from ... a reasonable and prudent man <em>under the particular circumstances ... depending on the relative facts of the special case\u2019 \u201d) </em>(quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>411 (5th ed.1979)) (emphasis added). Father and grandmother both continued to care for the child as they had agreed to do prior to the adoption, and no substantive changes occurred in the relationship. <em>Cf. Drummond, </em>945 P.2d at 462. Grandmother\u2019s fraud in misrepresenting to father the effect of the Consent to Adoption form and in misrepresenting to the court the parties\u2019 living arrangements prior to the adoption constituted extrinsic fraud sufficient to require the denial of grandmother\u2019s demurrer. <em>See Hagy, </em>529 S.E.2d at 717 (holding that statute of limitation cannot be constitutionally construed to prevent court from setting aside a judgment for extrinsic fraud because doing so amounts to an impermissible legislative restriction \u201con the judicial branch\u2019s exercise of its inherent authority\u201d). <em>But see Phariss, </em>946 P.2d at 1162-63 (rejecting similar separation-of-powers argument where adoptive parents allegedly failed to use reasonable diligence to serve natural father with notice of adoption pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>eeedings but ultimately setting aside adoption based on due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">We reject grandmother\u2019s argument that the statute is subject to two interpretations, one which is constitutional and another which is not, and should be construed to impose a discovery requirement, thereby barring father\u2019s claim of fraud because he did not file his petition to set aside until more than six months after he admitted learning of the fraud. Although a statute containing a discovery trigger likely would be sufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster, nothing in Code \u00a7 63.1-237 implies that the statute of limitation is to begin running on the date on which the fraud was or should have been discovered. Rather, the statute expressly refers to the \u201cexpiration of six months from the date of entry of any final order of adoption from which no appeal has been taken.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-237. The General Assembly was free to create a discovery rule when it drafted the statute, but it did not do so. <em>See Stewart v. Rouse, </em>469 S.W.2d 615, 616 (Tex.Civ.App.1971), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>475 S.W.2d 574, 574-75 (Tex.1972) (noting legislature acted in wake of <em>Armstrong </em>to protect \u201cintegrity and stability in the adoption process\u201d by creating discovery rule barring petition to vacate adoption decree based on lack of notice \u201c \u2018if more than one year has elapsed since [natural parent] discovered or should have discovered the adoption was decreed\u2019\u201d). Absent such language in the statute, father lacked even constructive notice that such a limitation might be applied once he became aware of the fraud. Thus, without express statutory language imposing a discovery trigger, such an interpretation is not available to save the statute from unconstitutional application here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that some limitation must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>apply, <em>but see Parrish v.

Under either approach, a lapse of seven months from the date of discoyery, under the facts of this case as alleged in the petition, is insufficient to bar the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In summary, we hold, in regard only to grandmother\u2019s demurrer, that application of the six-month statute of limitation to father was unconstitutional and that the adoption decree was void <em>ab initio </em>based on grandmother\u2019s alleged fraud and the resulting lack of notice to and personal jurisdiction over father. Therefore, the trial court erroneously granted grandmother\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">VISITATION AND APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN <em>AD LITEM</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Father also contests the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant him visitation and to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>We hold, however, that father lacked standing to make such a request as long as the order of adoption remains in effect; thus, we hold the trial court did not err in failing to grant visitation. Code \u00a7 20-124.1 provides that only a person \u201cwith a legitimate interest\u201d has standing to request custody or visitation and that \u201c[a] party with a legitimate interest ... shall not include any person ... whose parental rights have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>been terminated by court order, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\u201d <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-233 (providing that final order of adoption divests birth parents of right to petition for visitation). Therefore, father will not have standing to request visitation unless or until the trial court rules in his favor on the merits by setting aside the adoption order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For these same reasons, the court had no duty to act on father\u2019s request for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the decision of the trial court, vacate its order dismissing father\u2019s petition, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">\n<em>Reversed, vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\">.

Although Code \u00a7 8.01-235 provides that a statute of limitation defense \"cannot be set up by demurrer\u201d and may be raised only as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading, father did not oppose the demurrer on that ground, either in the trial court or on appeal. Thus, Rule 5A:18 prevents our consideration of this claimed error as a basis for reversal on appeal absent a showing of \"good cause\u201d or to \"attain the ends of justice.\u201d If the statute was unconstitutionally applied, avoiding the constitutional issue will not \"attain the ends of justice,\" and any attempt to apply this exception simply begs the constitutional question. Further, the \" 'good cause\u2019 [exception] relates to the reason why an objection was not stated at the time of the ruling,\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 988, 996, 421 S.E.2d 652, 656 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc) (Barrow, J., concurring), and, thus, it is not applicable under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Even if one of these exceptions might properly be applied to avoid a constitutional issue, avoidance of the constitutional issue in the instant appeal would be an exercise in procedural futility. The trial court has already ruled that the statute of limitation bars father's action to set aside the adoption, despite its duty to view the facts on the demurrer in the light most favorable to father. Thus, the only reasonable conclusion is that, if we were to reverse the dismissal based solely on grandmother\u2019s failure to raise the statute of limitation in the proper pleading, grandmother would plead the statute as an affirmative defense in her responsive pleading and the trial court would rule in grandmother\u2019s favor without hearing evidence, based on the trial court\u2019s already demonstrated belief that the statute of limitation applies to bar father\u2019s petition under any version of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Thus, our passing on the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 63.1-237 as applied to father in this case is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. The dissent concludes that the dispute between father and grandmother is over <em>custody </em>of the child and that ''[n]othing in this record suggests that the adoptive mother [grandmother] has custody based on a decree that would put the father at a disadvantage----\u201d This misstates the effect of the order of adoption under Virginia law. Pursuant to the statutory scheme applicable to these proceedings, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-233 (Repl.Vol.1995) (repealed and recodified as amended at \u00a7 63.1-219.22), the final order of adoption, in fact, \u201cdivested [father] of all legal rights and obligations in respect to the child\u201d because father was not \"the husband or wife of ...

Code \u00a7 63.1-220.3, subsections (A) to (C), outline the general hearing, notice and consent requirements for adoption. Code \u00a7 63.1-220.3(C)(6) provides that in certain intra-familial adoptions, including those in which the prospective adoptive parent is the child\u2019s grandparent, consent may be written and acknowledged and no hearing to confirm consent is required, but it does not specifically state whether the petition for adoption must be served on a parent who has already executed consent. <em>Compare In re Andersen, </em>99 Idaho 805, 589 P.2d 957, 959 (1978) (noting legislature has provided that execution of consent to adopt also serves as general appearance in court where adoption petition is filed), <em>overruled on other grounds, In re Steve B.D., </em>111 Idaho 285, 723 P.2d 829, 834 (1986), <em>and In re Adoption of Minor Child, </em>109 R.I. 443, 287 A.2d 115, 122 &amp; n. 5 (1972) (construing absence of statutory notice requirement to mean that parent who executes consent to adoption is not entitled to additional notice of adoption proceedings), <em>with McCulley v.

The dissent mischaracterizes this passage as containing our assumption that the consent executed by father \"constituted an appearance before the court\u201d and contends that we \"forget[] that personal jurisdiction <em>... is acquired </em>by appearance and [that] service of process is not necessary if the party appears voluntarily.\u201d Contrary to the dissenters\u2019 representations, however, we assume only that the court was entitled <em>initially </em>to infer that father made an appearance based on grandmother\u2019s submission of the consent form. Father's filing of the petition to set aside the adoption due to grandmother's alleged extrinsic fraud imposed upon the court a duty to determine whether father\u2019s appearance via the consent form was, in fact, a <em>voluntary </em>appearance sufficient to allow the court to obtain personal jurisdiction over father. Under our analysis, the dissenters\u2019 statement that service of process is not necessary if the party appears voluntarily merely begs the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Further, the dissenters\u2019 claim that our decision \"subjects <em>any existing adoption </em>grounded on consent but entered without service of process upon the consenting party to perpetual [jurisdictional] challenge\u201d is incorrect. (Emphasis added). Our holding is expressly limited to the facts alleged in this case, in which (1) the biological father had an established relationship with his child; (2) the nature of the father\u2019s relationship with the child did not change until after the statute of limitation had run; <em>and </em>(3) the father had no understanding of the content of the consent to adoption form due to a language barrier and relied on the representations of grandmother that the consent form was merely to facilitate her oversight of the child\u2019s medical care. The goal of protecting the finality of adoptions, though admirable, does not justify the wholesale disregard of a parent\u2019s constitutional right to due process under these limited circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b707-5\">. The interpretation grandmother urges is not simply a permissible narrowing of a statute which otherwise would be unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>See Va. Soc. for Human Life, Inc. v.

Here, by the time father became aware of grandmother\u2019s alleged fraud, the statute\u2019s express limitation period had already expired, and the statute may not reasonably be interpreted to alert father to a new statute of limitation expiring six months from the date of his discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b709-11\">.

I would also hold, however, that the former Adoption Act required notice to the father and that the adoption order is void because the proceeding was conducted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>either notice to the father or a waiver of notice.

Nevertheless, the father later signed a \u201cconsent\u201d for adoption. Neither of those Code sections, however, described or specified the requirements that were deemed sufficient to constitute a valid consent. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>place in the Act that addressed the contents of the consent was Code \u00a7 63.1\u2014220.3(C)(1)(b), where the following was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\"><em>Such consent </em>shall be executed after the birth of the child, <em>shall advise the birth father of his opportunity for legal representation, </em>and shall be presented to the court for acceptance. <em>The consent may waive further notice of the adoption proceedings and shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the birth father\u2019s legal counsel or an acknowledgement that he was informed of his opportunity to be represented by legal counsel and declined such representation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">By explicitly providing that \u201c[t]he consent may waive further notice of the adoption proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Act implicitly draws a distinction between consent and waiver of notice of the adoption proceeding. The clear import of the Act is that consent and waiver are not the same concepts. Moreover, nowhere does the Act indicate, even implicitly, that notice to the father of institution of the adoption proceeding is not required. Indeed, by providing that the judge may accept a consent that \u201cwaive[s] further notice of the adoption proceedings,\u201d the Act implicitly recognizes the due process requirement that notice be given of the adoption proceeding. <em>See D.H. Overmyer Co. v.

For example, the Act makes consent revocable under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">D. Consent shall be revocable as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">1. By either consenting birth parent for any reason for up to fifteen days from its execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>a. Such revocation shall be in writing, signed by the revoking party or counsel of record for the revoking party and shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the petition was filed during the business day of the court, within the time period specified in this section. If the revocation period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or any day on which the clerk\u2019s office is closed as authorized by statute, the revocation period shall be extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or other day on which the clerk\u2019s office is closed as authorized by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">b. Upon the filing of a valid revocation within the time period set out in this section, the court shall order that any consent given for the purpose of such placement is void and, if necessary, the court shall determine custody of the child as between the birth parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">2. By any party prior to the final order of adoption ... upon proof of fraud or duress....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Code \u00a7 63.1-220.3(D). In a similar vein, the Act also provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">Parental consent to an adoption executed pursuant to this section shall be revocable prior to the final order of adoption ... upon proof of fraud or duress....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Code \u00a7 63.1-225(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">These provisions would be rendered meaningless if notice of the adoption proceeding is not given to a consenting parent. For the statutory right to revoke a consent to have any meaning, the parent who has consented must have notice of the institution of proceedings in order to revoke consent before the adoption takes place. Other courts have reached the same conclusion within a similar statutory framework. <em>See McCulley v. Bone, </em>160 Or.App. 24, 979 P.2d 779, 791-92 (1999) (ruling that a parent\u2019s right to notice in an adoption proceeding is implicit because it \u201cis sufficiently basic to be constitutionally protected under the Due Process Clause\u201d). Thus, I believe the Act\u2019s revocation scheme constitutes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>implicit recognition by the legislature that a consenting parent should receive notification of the adoption proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In addition, the Act also contains express requirements of notice under the circumstances identified in Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.1-220.3(C)(1)(a), 63.1-220.3(C)(2) and 63.1-220.3(C)(4). These requirements, which relate to circumstances where a consent is not given, clearly manifest the legislature\u2019s awareness of the necessity to satisfy due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The majority \u201cassume[s] without deciding that father\u2019s execution of the Consent to Adoption form ... constituted an appearance before the court sufficient to permit the court to infer father\u2019s receipt of notice and submission to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d I would not make such an assumption. The father did not sign the \u201cconsent\u201d in court. Moreover, the record reflects that the \u201cconsent\u201d the father signed did not contain a waiver of notice. The \u201cConsent\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF5X\">I, [the father], over the age of eighteen years, parent of [the child], an infant under the age of fourteen years do hereby consent that said infant be adopted by [the grandmother] and that [the grandmother] be vested with all the rights, powers and privileges with reference to said child as are provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The form does not purport to waive notice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Without either notice to the father or a waiver of notice, the adoption proceeding was not binding on him. He was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to challenge it because an order of adoption is void when \u201cpersonal jurisdiction over [the natural parent] was lacking at the time of the entry of the final order of adoption.\u201d <em>Carlton v. Paxton, </em>14 Va.App. 105, 114, 415 S.E.2d 600, 605 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">For these reasons, I would read the Act to require either notice to the parent or a consent (or other document) that waives notice. Therefore, I would hold that the Act implicitly requires notice to the father in the absence of a waiver of notice. Because the father was not given notice and did not waive notice, the adoption is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The United States Supreme Court has been \u201cunanimously of the view that \u2018the interest of parents in their relationship with their children is sufficiently fundamental to come within the finite class of liberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019 ... [and] also ... unanimously of the] view that \u2018[f]ew consequences of judicial action are so grave as the severance of natural family ties.\u2019 \u201d <em>M.L.B. v. S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 119, 117 S.Ct. 555, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996) (citations omitted). Noting that \u201cthe relationship of love and duty in a recognized family unit is an interest in liberty entitled to constitutional protection,\u201d the Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018state intervention to terminate [such a] relationship ... must be accomplished by procedures meeting the requisites of the Due Process Clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>258, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983) (citations omitted). Moreover, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201c[w]hen an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by \u2018com[ing] forward to participate in the rearing of his child,\u2019 his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 103 S.Ct. 2985 (citation omitted). When it comes to severing such a protected interest, \u201c[t]he due process concern homes in on the essential fairness of the state-ordered proceedings.\u201d M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 120, 117 S.Ct. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Applying these principles, I would hold that former Code \u00a7 63.1-237 could not validly preclude the father\u2019s challenge to the order because legislation may not abrogate basic due process rights to notice of the institution of proceedings. To read the Act. to allow an adoption to proceed either upon a lack of notice to a parent or on a consent by a parent that does not waive notice is to give the Act a sweep that contravenes constitutional rights. These fundamental principles have their genesis in well-settled law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">It is clear that failure to give the petitioner notice of the pending adoption proceedings violated the most rudimentary demands of due process of law. \u201cMany controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d \u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Questions frequently arise as to the adequacy of a particular form of notice in a particular case. But as to the basic requirement of notice itself there can be no doubt, where, as here, the result of the judicial proceeding was permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>to deprive a legitimate parent of all that parenthood implies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 550, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Long before <em>Armstrong, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia applied these same due process principles and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">The \u201cdue process\u201d clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions require notice and an opportunity to be heard, but the litigants have rights which they may waive, if they choose, and if waived in a case in which they have the right to waive, the judgment will be held valid. In this class of cases, the question of the jurisdiction of the court usually resolves itself into one of whether or not there has been \u201cdue process,\u201d whether the process has been served in the time and manner required by law, or service has been waived. Of course, the defendant must be properly brought before the court, else there will be no jurisdiction over him and a judgment against him will be void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\"><em>Shelton v. Sydnor, </em>126 Va. 625, 630, 102 S.E. 83, 85 (1920). Simply put, \u201c \u2018 \u201cOne of the essentials of due process is notice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Walt Robbins, Inc. v. Damon Corp., </em>232 Va. 43, 47, 348 S.E.2d 223, 226 (1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">For these reasons, I would also hold that the adoption order is void.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\">. The Uniform Adoption Act of 1994 provides that \"[u]nless consent is not required or is dispensed with ... in a direct placement of a minor for adoption by a parent ..., a petition to adopt the minor may be granted only if consent to the adoption has been executed by ... the man ... who ... has received the minor into his home and openly held out the minor as his child.\" \u00a7 2-401(a)(1)(iv). Significantly, the Act requires that \"[a] consent <em>must </em>state: ... that the individual who is consenting waives further notice unless the adoption is contested, appealed, or denied.\u201d \u00a7 2-406(d)(7) (emphasis added). Furthermore, although \"[a] person entitled to receive notice under this [Act] may waive the notice ... in a consent ... or other document signed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>person,\u201d \u00a7 3-405(a), the Act expressly provides that \"[u]nless notice has been waived, notice of a proceeding for adoption of a minor must be served ... upon an individual whose consent to the adoption is required,\u201d \u00a7 3-401(a)(1), and served upon \"an individual whom the petitioner knows is claiming to be or who is named as the father or possible father of the minor adoptee and whose paternity of the minor has not been judicially determined,\u201d \u00a7 3-401(a)(3). Only when a consent is executed in substantial compliance with the Act does the parent waive \"any right to notice of the proceeding for adoption.\u201d \u00a7 2-407(a)(3). In the absence of a waiver, \"[pjersonal service of the notice [of a proceeding for adoption of a minor] must be made in a manner appropriate under [the rules of civil procedure for the service of process in a civil action in this State] unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d \u00a7 3-403(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b717-9\">BUMGARDNER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASl\">with whom FRANK, HUMPHREYS and AGEE, JJ., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">I dissent because the majority unnecessarily decides this appeal too broadly and on constitutional grounds. The implications of this decision will enfeeble adoptions once confidently accepted as final and unassailable. The result counters the established policy of encouraging adoptions and protecting their validity. This appeal does not require the decisional approach of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">In this matter, the father simply appeals the sustaining of a demurrer. He brought his petition under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(D), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>which preserves the common law \u201cindependent action\u201d for obtaining equitable relief from a judgment. <em>See </em>Kent Sinclair <em>&amp; </em>Leigh B. Middleditch, Jr., <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7 11.4, at 479 (3d ed.1998). The elements of that action are well defined and include \u201c \u2018the absence of fault or negligence on the part of the [petitioner].\u2019 \u201d <em>Charles v. Precision Tune, Inc., </em>243 Va. 313, 318, 414 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1992) (citation omitted). The father\u2019s fault or negligence in signing a document he could not read is apparent from his pleading. Thus, the petition fails to plead sufficient facts to permit father\u2019s action, <em>see id., </em>and a demurrer would be proper because the petition stated no action upon which the father was entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">However, that need not be the basis for a decision in this matter. The trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer based on the statute of limitations of Code \u00a7 63.1-237. \u201c[T]he defense that the statutory limitation period has expired cannot be set up by demurrer.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-235. While the father did not raise that objection, preferring his broad constitutional attack, reversal on this narrow basis is preferable to the expansive, constitutional ruling of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Nonetheless, the majority holds \u201cthe adoption decree was void <em>ab initio </em>based on grandmother\u2019s alleged fraud and the resulting lack of notice to and personal jurisdiction over the father.\u201d It declares the statute of limitations for adoptions unconstitutional as it applied to this father. In reaching this decision, the majority assumes the consent executed by F.E. \u201cconstituted an appearance before the court,\u201d but yet it concludes the trial court had no personal jurisdiction over him. The majority forgets that personal jurisdiction over a person <em>is acquired </em>by appearance and service of process is not necessary if the party appears voluntarily. W. Hamilton Bryson, <em>Bryson on Virginia Civil Procedure </em>107 (3d ed.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Instead, the majority permits extrinsic fraud to nullify the appearance. By concluding misrepresentations prevented personal jurisdiction, the majority makes service of process, the other means of obtaining personal jurisdiction over a party, a requirement. The majority acknowledges appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>by consent but requires service of process. This additional procedural mandate has not been the practice or the requirement. The General Assembly has consistently provided abridged procedures to simplify adoptions involving the consent of unwed fathers. Before <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972), their consent was not required. <em>See Szemler v. Clements, </em>214 Va. 639, 202 S.E.2d 880 (1974). After the Supreme Court of the United States extended constitutional protections to unwed fathers\u2019 parental rights in <em>Stanley, </em>the General Assembly revised the requirements regarding parental consent. Acts of Assembly 1993 cc. 338, 553. Yet, the General Assembly still incorporated exceptions regarding unwed fathers. They are not required to give their consent in open court, but may consent before a notary upon their sworn statement. Code \u00a7 63.1-220.3(C)1.a.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">For these reasons, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision sustaining a demurrer based on the statute of limitations. On remand, the father could amend any defect in his pleading, and the facts surrounding the consent and the three-year delay could be properly addressed in a formal evidentiary hearing. Most importantly, the trial court could address the real issue in this case, the desire of the natural father for custody of his child. The trial court could decide whether it is in the best interests of the child to live with the natural father or the adoptive mother, natural grandmother.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no need, at this point, to declare the adoption by the grandmother invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">To decide otherwise subjects any existing adoption grounded on consent, but entered without service of process upon the consenting party, to perpetual challenge as to whether the court may have lacked jurisdiction to grant the adoption.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. Nothing in this record suggests that the adoptive mother has custody based on a decree that would put the father at a disadvantage such as recognized in <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
