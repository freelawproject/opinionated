Williams was convicted in a bench trial of possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a copy of the certificate of analysis issued by the state forensic laboratory. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">On March 7, 1999, at 1:00 a.m., Police Officer Jeffrey Stokes was on routine patrol in the City of Portsmouth when he observed Williams riding a bicycle. Stokes asked to speak with Williams for a moment and Williams stopped. After a brief discussion, Williams consented to a search of his person. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Incident to that search, Stokes found a substance he suspected was crack cocaine in Williams\u2019s identification badge holder. The substance was sent to the Commonwealth\u2019s Division of Forensic Science\u2019s Tidewater Laboratory in Norfolk for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth moved to introduce into evidence a properly attested certificate of analysis from the Tidewater Laboratory indicating that the tested substance was cocaine. The certificate the Commonwealth sought to have admitted, however, was a photocopy of the original certificate of analysis. Attached to the certificate was a cover sheet on Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Criminal Justice Services, Division of Forensic Science, Tidewater Laboratory letterhead reading, \u201cI certify that [the attached certificate of analysis] is a true and accurate copy in accordance with \u00a7 8.01-390 and 391 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d The certification was signed by \u201cK. C. Hux, Custodian of Records, Tidewater Laboratory,\u201d and \u201cRobert J. Campbell, Director, Tidewater Laboratory.\u201d Both signatures were dated November 24,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"Aup-\">Williams, asserting that the Commonwealth\u2019s request for admission of a copy of the certificate of analysis, rather than the original, created a \u201cbest evidence situation,\u201d objected to the introduction of the copy of the certificate of analysis on the ground that it lacked proper authentication. The certification attached to the copy did not, Williams argued, comply with Code \u00a7 8.01-390(A) and Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The trial court, finding the copy of the certificate of analysis admissible because it had been properly authenticated under Code \u00a7 8 .01-390(A), overruled Williams\u2019s objection and admitted the copy and attached certification as Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 2. Having determined the copy was admissible under Code \u00a7 8.01-390(A), the court concluded that it was unnecessary to consider whether the copy had also been properly authenticated under Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On appeal, Williams contends the trial court erred in admitting the copy of the certificate of analysis into evidence because the copy was not properly authenticated under Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-390(A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.01-391(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Incorporated into this argument is Williams\u2019s assertion that the trial court improperly admitted the copy of the certificate of analysis into evidence solely because it found that the copy had been authenticated in compliance with Code \u00a7 8.01-390(A). He maintains that, because he objected to the admission of the copy on the basis of both Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-390(A) and 8 .01-391(B), the trial court should not have admitted the copy of the certificate of analysis without first determining that it had been properly authenticated under both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The document whose admissibility is at issue here is a photocopy of the original certificate of analysis. Had the original certificate of analysis been offered by the Commonwealth for admission into evidence, it would have been admissible over a hearsay objection under Code \u00a7 19.2-187.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>statute establishes an exception to the hearsay rule for the contents of certain certificates of analysis that have been properly attested and filed pursuant to the requirements of that statute. <em>See Myrick v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 333, 337, 412 S.E.2d 176, 178 (1991). However, as we noted in addressing the admissibility of a copy of a certificate of analysis in <em>Proctor v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 937, 419 S.E.2d 867 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187 addresses the problem of hearsay, and compliance with its requirements merely exonerates an otherwise hearsay document from the application of the hearsay rule. The issue in this case is not hearsay, but authentication. Although the original certificate, if filed in compliance with Code \u00a7 19.2-187, would have been admissible in evidence over a hearsay objection, a copy of that certificate, to be admissible, must be shown to be genuine and adequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 938-39, 419 S.E.2d at 868. In other words, to be admissible, the copy of the certificate of analysis must be properly authenticated. <em>See id. </em>at 938, 419 S.E.2d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Here, the copy of the certificate of analysis was accompanied by a document certifying that the attached copy was \u201ca true and accurate copy in accordance with \u00a7 8.01-390 and 391 of the Code of Virginia.\u201d That certification, the Commonwealth contends, serves to authenticate the copy of the certificate of analysis under the referenced statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Code \u00a7 8.01-390 codifies the \u201cofficial written documents exception\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the hearsay rule and sets forth the method of authentication that allows copies of certain official records of governmental entities to be admitted as <em>prima facie </em>evidence under that exception. <em>Ingram v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 335, 340, 338 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1986). \u201cUnder [the official written documents] exception, \u2018records and reports prepared by public officials pursuant to a duty imposed by statute, or required by the nature of their office, are admissible as proof of the facts stated therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., </em>224 Va. 562, 565, 299 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1983) (quoting <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 45, 46, 189 S.E.2d 378, 379 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Conversely, \u201cCode \u00a7 8.01-391, which concerns copies of originals as evidence, is a statutory exception to the best evidence rule.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 599, 601, 413 S.E.2d 662, 664 (1992); <em>see also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 16-4(c) (5th ed.1999). Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) provides that, when properly authenticated pursuant to the requirements set forth in that section, copies made of their official records by governmental entities \u201cacting pursuant to the law of the respective jurisdiction or other proper authority\u201d are as admissible as the original records, whether the original records are \u201cin existence or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Clearly, in this case, the original certificate of analysis of which the instant copy was made was an official record of a governmental entity. The question, then, is which statute, Code \u00a7 8 .01-390(A) or Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B), controls the issue of the proper authentication of the copy of the certificate of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Here, the issue is not hearsay. <em>See Myrick, </em>13 Va.App. at 338, 412 S.E.2d at 178-79. The original certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>analysis was properly attested pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-187 by the forensic scientist who performed the analysis and prepared the certificate. That attestation, which appears on the copy offered by the Commonwealth, \u201cobviates the hearsay problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 412 S.E.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Rather, Williams\u2019s objection to the admission of the copy of the certificate of analysis raises a best evidence question, which is whether a copy of the certificate of analysis can be admitted into evidence in lieu of the original. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, Williams\u2019s attorney noted in objecting at trial to the admission of the copy that the Commonwealth\u2019s request to have a copy rather than the original certificate admitted gave rise to a \u201cbest evidence situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Thus, we conclude that Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B), which codifies an exception to the best evidence rule, is the controlling statute in this case on the issue of authentication and that Code \u00a7 8.01-390(A), which codifies an exception to the hearsay rule, is not applicable here. Hence, the trial court erred in admitting the copy of the certificate on the basis of the copy\u2019s compliance with the authentication requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-390(A) and in concluding that compliance with the authentication requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We have held, however, that, \u201cas long as the correct reason, along with a factual basis to support it, is raised in the trial court, \u2018[a]n appellate court may affirm the judgment of a trial court when it has reached the right result for the wrong reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 325, 332, 533 S.E.2d 18, 21 (2000) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Driscoll v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 449, 452, 417 S.E.2d 312, 313-14 (1992)). Accordingly, we will consider whether the trial court reached the correct result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cThe best evidence rule requires that, to prove the contents of a document, the \u2018original must be produced unless it be shown that the original is unavailable, in which case secondary evidence may be introduced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mostyn v. Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 920, 923, 420 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1992) (quoting <em>Myrick, </em>13 Va.App. at 339, 412 S.E.2d at 179). However, under the version of Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) applicable to this case, a copy of an official record is admissible without regard to the availability of the original if the copy \u201cis authenticated as a true copy both by the custodian of said record and the person to whom said custodian reports and is accompanied by a certificate that such officer does in fact have the custody.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Ingram, </em>in considering the authentication requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-390(A), we construed the requirement that a copy of an official document be authenticated by both the record\u2019s custodian and the person to whom the custodian reports. We held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">[T]o comply with the statute double authentication is necessary to prove genuineness as a prerequisite to admission of a copy. Proper authentication under this statute requires not only certification of the copy as a true copy by the custodian of the record and the person to whom he reports, but also a showing that the persons certifying are indeed the custodian and the person to whom he reports. The latter requirement is crucial to admission into evidence of those documents governed by Code \u00a7 8.01-390. The statute addresses the admission of all nonjudicial records as evidence; without double authentication, a\u2019 court presented with a document from a source with which it is unfamiliar would have no means of judging its genuineness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">1 Va.App. at 340, 338 S.E.2d at 659-60 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">For the policy reasons mentioned in <em>Ingram </em>and quoted above, we will apply the same construction to the essentially identical authentication requirement in the version of Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) applicable to this case. Accordingly, to comply with the requirement of Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>copy be authenticated by both the custodian of the original record and the person to whom the custodian reports, the record must show that the persons certifying the copy of the certificate of analysis are indeed the custodian and the person to whom the custodian reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We also construe Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B)\u2019s second authentication requirement \u2014 that the copy be \u201caccompanied by a certificate that such officer does in fact have the custody\u201d \u2014 to mean that there must be a certification accompanying the copy showing that the custodian did in fact have custody of the original document when the copy of it was made or when the copy was authenticated by the custodian, rather than when the copy was offered for admission into evidence. We reach this conclusion to alleviate the statute\u2019s ambiguity and to give meaning to that portion of Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) that provides that the copy, if properly authenticated, \u201cshall be as admissible into evidence as the original, whether the original is in existence or not.\u201d <em>See Broadnax v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 808, 814, 485 S.E.2d 666, 668 (1997) (noting that, in construing a statute, the intention of the legislature must be gathered from the words used unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity). To construe the terms \u201cdoes in fact have custody\u201d literally as written, that is, in the present tense relative to the admission of the copy into evidence, would divest the phrase \u201cwhether the original is in existence or not,\u201d clearly referring to the time of admission, of its import. While the words and phrases used in a statute should generally be given their \u201cordinary and usually accepted meaning,\u201d here \u201ca different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The certification accompanying the instant copy of the certificate of analysis was signed by \u201cK. C. Hux\u201d as \u201cCustodian of Records, Tidewater Laboratory\u201d and \u201cRobert J. Campbell\u201d as \u201cDirector, Tidewater Laboratory.\u201d No other evidence was offered regarding the positions of Hux or Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Williams argues that the certification does not constitute a proper authentication because it fails to establish that Campbell was, in fact, the person to whom Hux reported and it does not constitute a certification that the custodian, in fact, had custody of the original, as mandated by Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B). We may not presume, he contends, based solely on Hux\u2019s signature as \u201cCustodian of Records\u201d and Campbell\u2019s signature as \u201cDirector,\u201d that Campbell was the person to whom Hux reported and that Hux had custody of the original certificate of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Williams relies on <em>Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., </em>224 Va. 562, 299 S.E.2d 340, to support his argument that the certification is insufficient to show that Hux reported to Campbell. In that case, the Supreme Court held that a Coast Guard \u201cBoiler Inspection Book\u201d was not admissible because it had not been properly authenticated by both the custodian and the person to whom the custodian reported. In reaching its decision, the Court noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Although each page of the proffered exhibit bore a stamp with the signature of a Coast Guard lieutenant certifying that the page was a \u201cTrue Copy,\u201d nothing in the exhibit or the papers attached showed that this officer was the custodian of the disputed records. And, while the exhibit was accompanied by a letter of transmittal signed by \u201cT. Wood[,] Captain, U.S. Coast Guard[,] Officer in Charge!,] Marine Inspection,\u201d nothing even suggested that Captain Wood was the person to whom the custodian reported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 565, 299 S.E.2d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">We are mindful, in considering these issues, that \u201c[a]uthentieation is the \u2018providing of an evidentiary basis sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that the writing came from the source claimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 1, 6, 502 S.E.2d 113, 115 (1998) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Walters v. Littleton, </em>223 Va. 446, 451, 290 S.E.2d 839, 842 (1982)). \u2018Writings may be authenticated by circumstantial evidence. The amount of evidence sufficient to establish authenticity will vary according to the type of writing, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>circumstances attending its admission, but generally proof of any circumstances which will support a finding that the writing is genuine will suffice.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>223 Va. at 451, 290 S.E.2d at 842 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Our review of the record in this case convinces us that the certification attached to the copy of the certificate of analysis was sufficient, unlike the certification in <em>Taylor, </em>to show that the purported custodian, in fact, reported to the purported director and that the purported custodian, in fact, had custody of the original document. Here, both the certificate of analysis offered for admission by the Commonwealth and the attached certification were from the Division of Forensic Science\u2019s Tidewater Laboratory. The certification plainly shows that Hux and Campbell were both associated with the Tidewater Laboratory, Hux as its custodian of records and Campbell as its director. A \u201ccustodian\u201d is \u201cone entrusted officially with guarding and keeping (as property, artifacts, records).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>559 (1993). A \u201cdirector\u201d is \u201cone that directs: as ... the head or chief of an organized occupational group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The trial court, we believe, could, therefore, logically infer from the signatures and designations on the certification that (1) Hux, as the custodian of records at the Tidewater Laboratory, was the custodian of the original certificate of analysis of which the subject copy was made and (2) Campbell, as the director of the laboratory, was the person to whom all employees of the laboratory, including Hux, ultimately reported. Accordingly, we conclude that these circumstances are sufficient to prove that the copy of the certificate of analysis is genuine. To conclude otherwise \u201cwould be technical in the extreme.\u201d <em>Hurley v. Charles, </em>112 Va. 706, 710, 72 S.E. 689, 690-91 (1911) (finding, based on circumstantial evidence in the record, that a will had been properly certified even though the certificate accompanying the will contained only the deputy clerk\u2019s name and his abbreviated title designation).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>This case is factually distinguishable from <em>Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp. </em>Unlike in our case, there was nothing in the proffered documents in <em>Taylor </em>that either directly or indirectly supported a finding that the person who certified them was the custodian of the records. Moreover, no link was drawn in <em>Taylor </em>between the alleged custodian and the person to whom the custodian allegedly reported. Even though the captain was designated in the proffered documents as the \u201cOfficer in Charge[,] Marine Inspection,\u201d there was no evidence to permit the inference that he and the lieutenant were in the same unit or that the captain was otherwise in the lieutenant\u2019s chain of command. Conversely, in the present case, the certification established both Hux\u2019s custodianship and the appropriate connection between Hux and Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We hold, therefore, that the copy of the certificate of analysis was properly authenticated under Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B) and that the copy was thus admissible into evidence over Williams\u2019s best evidence objection under the best evidence rule exception codified in that section. Hence, the trial court reached the correct conclusion, albeit for the' wrong reason. For these reasons, we affirm Williams\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">.

The mere fact that a person\u2019s job title or job category description appears below the signature line of the certifying person does not prove the statutorily required fact. <em>See Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., </em>224 Va. 562, 565, 299 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1983) (applying similar language of Code \u00a7 8.01-390). The authentication in this case is not significantly different than the authentication offered and rejected in <em>Taylor. See </em>224 Va. at 565-66, 299 S.E.2d at 342. The phrase, \u201cOfficer in Charge,\u201d is riot less clear than the word \u201cDirector.\u201d If anything, the former phrase better fulfills the statutory requirement because it implies that the signer is \u201cin charge of\u2019 the alleged custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the statute\u2019s second authentication requirement means the custodian must have custody of the document when the copy is made. No evidence tends to prove, however, that the copy of the certificate that was admitted into evidence was \u201caccompanied by a certificate that [Hux] does in fact have the custody.\u201d Nothing on the certificate indicates that fact. Although Hux\u2019s job title, \u201ccustodian of records,\u201d is more descriptive than the title of the alleged custodian in <em>Taylor, see </em>224 Va. at 565, 299 S.E.2d at 342, the job title itself does not establish that Hux had the original certificate in his possession when he certified the proffered copy to be a true copy. Being a generic \u201ccustodian of records\u201d does not prove custody of a particular document and certainly does not prove custody of the document when the copy was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">While demanding compliance with these requirements may appear to be elevating form over substance, the legislature has mandated these requirements for authenticating a record. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>proponent of evidence must prove these necessary facts before the copy can be considered \u201cauthenticated.\u201d <em>Untiedt v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 836, 839, 447 S.E.2d 537, 539 (1994). Absent any evidence to prove these facts, the trial judge could only have speculated that the statutory requirement had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that the record fails to establish that the Commonwealth satisfied the requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-391(B). Thus, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
