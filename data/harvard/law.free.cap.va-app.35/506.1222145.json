The issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred by allowing the Commonwealth to cross-examine appellant about his refusal to take the required breath or blood test. Finding that evidence of appellant\u2019s refusal to take the required test constituted improper rebuttal of appellant\u2019s testimony, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Appellant stopped at a sobriety checkpoint in Fairfax County. Officer D.C. Decoster approached appellant\u2019s vehicle and smelled alcohol emanating from appellant. Decoster noticed appellant had bloodshot eyes, \u201cdisarranged\u201d clothing, and slurred speech. Appellant fumbled with his wallet and could not produce a driver\u2019s license. Appellant did not respond to Decoster\u2019s inquiries about where appellant had been and whether he had consumed any alcohol. Decoster asked appellant to exit his vehicle and perform some field sobriety tests. Appellant failed to perform the tests to Decoster\u2019s satisfaction. Decoster arrested appellant for driving while intoxicated, and appellant refused to submit to a blood or breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Prior to trial, appellant made a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent the Commonwealth from presenting evidence of appellant\u2019s refusal to take the blood or breath test. The trial court granted the motion and limited the Commonwealth\u2019s use of evidence of appellant\u2019s refusal to \u201crebuttal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">At trial, appellant testified in his own behalf. Appellant stated he had consumed one-half a glass of wine with dinner that evening, eight hours before the stop. The trial court then allowed the Commonwealth to cross-examine appellant about his refusal to take the blood or breath test, stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>appellant\u2019s assertion that he was not intoxicated \u201copened the door\u201d to evidence of his refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, a litigant is entitled to introduce all competent, material, and relevant evidence tending to prove or disprove any material issue raised, unless the evidence violates a specific rule of admissibility.\u201d \u201cEvidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material,\u201d and it is inadmissible if it fails to satisfy either of these criteria. \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d \u201cEvidence is material if it relates to a matter <em>properly </em>at issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"><em>Peeples v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 360, 365, 504 S.E.2d 870, 873 (1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.10 addresses the admissibility of evidence pertaining to a person\u2019s refusal to take a blood or breath test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">The failure of an accused to permit a blood or breath sample to be taken to determine the alcohol or drug content of his blood is not evidence and shall not be subject to comment by the Commonwealth at the trial of the case, except in rebuttal; nor shall the fact that a blood or breath test had been offered the accused be evidence or the subject of comment by the Commonwealth, except in rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">This section makes such evidence immaterial, or not a proper issue, in a driving under the influence prosecution, except in the case where a defendant raises the issue. In such an instance, evidence of a refusal to take a test becomes material for rebuttal. However, evidence of the refusal must be relevant to the material issue raised by the defendant\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">\u201c[A] request to take the [mandatory] breath test ... proves nothing about appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Hammond v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 565, 568, 439 S.E.2d 877, 879 (1994). It follows that the refusal to take the test also has no probative value as to guilt or innocence. \u201cTherefore, the evidence is not relevant[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>or material, except in rebuttal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>when the defendant raises an issue pertaining to the offer of, or failure to take, the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Here, appellant stated he consumed one-half a glass of wine eight hours before the stop. He also testified he was not intoxicated. Therefore, the only material issue raised by appellant was the amount of alcohol consumed and whether he was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Rebuttal evidence is \u201c[e]vidence offered to disprove or contradict the evidence presented by an opposing party.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>579 (7th ed.1999). Evidence that appellant refused to take the test does not disprove or contradict his testimony that he was not intoxicated. Nor does such evidence prove he consumed a greater amount of alcohol. Accordingly, evidence of appellant\u2019s refusal to take the test was not relevant to the material issue raised by his testimony. Only evidence that bears on the facts asserted in appellant\u2019s testimony would rebut that testimony. Such evidence might have included evidence of his performance on field sobriety tests and the officer\u2019s common observations of appellant\u2019s speech and physical appearance. The refusal itself, however, did not rebut or disprove appellant\u2019s testimony, and, therefore, was not admissible. Merely testifying in one\u2019s own behalf does not \u201copen the door\u201d to evidence of a refusal to take the mandatory breath or blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">For the above stated reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings should the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
