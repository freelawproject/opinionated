Cairns was sentenced to a total of 155 years imprisonment, with ninety-five years suspended. On appeal, Cairns alleges the trial court erred in admitting his codefendant\u2019s statement against him in their joint trial because: (1) the admission of the statement violated the marital privilege under Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2; (2) the statement constituted inadmissible hearsay; and (3) the admission of the statement .violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Because we find the admission of the statement violated Cairns\u2019 rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, and that this error was not harmless, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Winckler v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 836, 844, 531 S.E.2d 45, 49 (2000). In 1998, WW, age fourteen, and NC, age eleven, both female, were living with their parents, Cairns and his wife and codefendant, Alice Cairns.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> WW testified about a variety of episodes of sexual activity to which her parents subjected her. WW reported that the first incident occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>on February 16, 1998, when \u201c[she] had to give [her] mom and dad both oral sex, and they gave [her] oral sex.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also testified that her father \u201cgot on top\u201d of her and \u201ctried to have sex\u201d with her, but she told him to stop \u201cbecause it hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Near the end of August, WW and NC \u201chad to play a card game\u201d with their parents. The children had been \u201cgrounded,\u201d and Cairns agreed they could reduce the amount of time they were grounded if they played \u201ctruth or dare,\u201d or cards \u201cor something like that.\u201d In response, the girls agreed to make a movie, play two card games, and play two games of \u201ctruth or dare\u201d in order to reduce their punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">That evening, WW, NC, Cairns, and Cairns\u2019 wife, Alice, made a movie.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The two girls were in their parents\u2019 bedroom. Cairns and the two girls were on the bed, and Mrs. Cairns operated the video camera. At some point, the two children were naked. WW had \u201coral sex\u201d with Cairns, who then had \u201coral sex\u201d with her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NC also had \u201coral sex\u201d with Cairns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> NC explained, \u201cwe had to suck [Cairns\u2019] dick and do stuff to each other and my mom.\u201d At one point, when she was not operating the camera, Mrs. Cairns put her tongue inside NC\u2019s vagina. At another time, Cairns got on top of WW and asked her to allow him to engage in sexual intercourse with her, but she refused. He asked her to do it for the sake of the camera, but she continued to refuse. He said, \u201cfine,\u201d got off her and had NC give him \u201coral sex\u201d a second time. WW gave him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201coral sex\u201d again and NC complained that she was getting tired. As a result, she traded places with her mother and operated the camera. Mrs. Cairns then had \u201coral sex\u201d with Cairns. The videotaping lasted about an hour. At a later time, Cairns played the tape in front of his two daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">A second movie was made, which WW did not recall. NC, however, described the taping as very similar in nature to the first tape. She explained that Cairns \u201cmade us suck his penis and lick my mom and each other and touch each other\u2019s boobs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mrs. Cairns ultimately assisted Cairns in ejaculating at the end of the taping session.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In early September, WW played \u201cstrip poker\u201d with her mother and father. When WW ran out of clothing to remove, she was issued some imaginary clothes. When she ran out of those, she was left with \u201cdoing favors.\u201d Cairns told her to \u201cget on [her] back,\u201d and he \u201chad sex with [her],\u201d putting his penis inside her vagina.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cairns then \u201chad sex\u201d with his wife on the other side of the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">WW did not immediately report the incidents. She feared she and her siblings<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would be removed from the home and placed in a foster home. She also explained that Cairns would threaten to \u201cground\u201d her if she refused to participate in the sexual conduct. NC did not report the events because she feared Cairns\u2019 \u201cbad temper\u201d and she feared being grounded. She testified that she was forced to participate in the reported activities \u201c[m]ost of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Both Cairns and his wife were interviewed by police, at the police station, prior to their arrests. In his statement, Cairns denied participating in any sexual conduct with the girls. Although Mrs. Cairns initially denied having any knowledge of the alleged activities, after the interviewing officer reminded her that she had a criminal record and told her, \u201cthe best thing you can do is be honest with us to help yourself out,\u201d she confirmed some of her daughters\u2019 allegations. Mrs. Cairns confirmed that her husband had sex with WW and that NC had performed oral sex on Cairns but did not specify the dates on which the conduct occurred. Mrs. Cairns stated that she had videotaped her husband on the bed \u201ctouching\u201d the girls but denied that he had engaged in any sexual conduct with the girls during the filming, contrary to the testimony of WW and NC. She also denied having participated in any of the activities during the videotaping. She denied knowing where the videotapes were located, stating, \u201c[Cairns] always did somethin\u2019 with 'em.\u201d Mrs. Cairns stated she disapproved of what her husband was doing with the daughters. When asked why she did not stop him, she replied, \u201cthere ain\u2019t a lot I can do about it, simply because he\u2019s quite a bit stronger than I am. He can overpower me.... \u201d She denied performing oral sex on either of the girls but admitted she had kissed the \u201ctop part\u201d of WW\u2019s vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Cairns and his wife were tried together during a bench trial. The trial court overruled Cairns\u2019 pretrial motion to suppress his wife\u2019s statement. Detective Ruth Baker, who took Mrs. Cairns\u2019 statement, testified as to its content, and the statement was introduced into evidence. The prosecuting attorney relied, in part, on Mrs. Cairns\u2019 statement in her closing argument, and the trial court found Cairns guilty of six of the seven charges against him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\n<em>Marital Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Cairns alleges the admission of his codefendant\u2019s statement violated the marital privilege protection provided by Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2. This allegation is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 provides that \u201c[i]n criminal cases ... neither [husband nor wife] shall be compelled to be called as a witness against the other, except [in certain specified instances].\u201d The statute pertains specifically to testimony in criminal cases. The statement of Cairns\u2019 codefendant, his wife, was given to police prior to trial. Mrs. Cairns was not compelled to testify against Cairns, and, in fact, did not testify at their joint trial. Therefore, Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 does not apply in this case. <em>Livingston v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 621, 628, 466 S.E.2d 757, 760 (1996) (statute does not pertain to information given during pretrial investigations).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\n<em>Virginia\u2019s Statement Against Penal Interest Hearsay Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">Cairns also alleges that his wife\u2019s statement constituted inadmissible hearsay under Virginia law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">A statement made by an unavailable witness that is against the witness\u2019 penal interest is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if three requirements are met: (1) the declarant must be unavailable to testify at trial; (2) the statement must be against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it is made; and (3) the declarant must be aware at the time he or she makes the statement that the statement is against his or her interest. <em>Rankins v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 352, 361, 523 S.E.2d 524, 529 (2000). In addition, where the declarant \u201cseeks to limit [her] culpability by implicating oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ers,\u201d <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 558, 573, 499 S.E.2d 522, 533 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999), the reliability of the statement must be established by evidence other than the statement itself connecting the declarant to the crime. <em>Id.; Rankins, </em>31 Va.App. at 362, 523 S.E.2d at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Mrs. Cairns\u2019 statement as an exception to the hearsay rule. Under the Fifth Amendment, she could not have been compelled to testify; therefore, she was an unavailable witness. <em>Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 573, 499 S.E.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In her statement to the police, Mrs. Cairns admitted kissing the \u201ctop part\u201d of WW\u2019s vagina, and she admitted participating in the videotaping of her daughters while they were engaged in sexual conduct with Cairns. Therefore, because she implicated herself as a participant in at least one crime, her statement was clearly against her penal interest at the time it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The record also shows that Mrs. Cairns knew her statement was against her interest at the time she made it. Although she was not under arrest when she spoke with the police, she knew her daughters had made allegations concerning the events that had occurred. Furthermore, she initially denied having any knowledge of and denied participating in the alleged events. Only after the interviewing officer reminded her that she had \u201calready been convicted of some stuff in the past,\u201d and told her \u201c[t]he best thing you can do is cooperate with us and tell us the truth and the whole truth,\u201d Mrs. Cairns admitted her involvement. The evidence clearly establishes that Mrs. Cairns understood her statement was against her penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In her statement, she attempted to minimize her involvement, shifting some of the blame to Cairns. When initially asked about the videotaping, she replied, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you a whole lot, most of the time that anything that goes on in that house at night, I\u2019m at work.\u201d When she ultimately admitted having filmed her husband with the girls, she denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>knowing where the tapes were located, stating, \u201cif anything like that was made, [Cairns] always did somethin\u2019 with 'em.\u201d When asked if she ever participated in the activities on camera, she replied, \u201cNope. Sat there with the video camera.\u201d Mrs. Cairns told the police that her husband had sex with WW but said she left the room while the two were engaged in the conduct. Finally, she told police she disapproved of what her husband was doing with the daughters, but stated, \u201cthere ain\u2019t a lot I can do about it, simply because he\u2019s quite a bit stronger than I am. He can overpower me\u201d Although Mrs. Cairns attempted to shift the responsibility for the activities to her husband, her statement and her involvement in the alleged crimes were corroborated on many points by WW and NC, thus \u201csupporting the conclusion that the statement as a whole was reliable enough to be admitted.\u201d <em>Rankins, </em>31 Va.App. at 364, 523 S.E.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement as an exception to the Virginia hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\n<em>Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\n<em>1. Admissibility of the Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Cairns next alleges the admission into evidence of his codefendant\u2019s statement during their joint trial violated his Sixth Amendment rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution give a defendant in a state criminal trial the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI, amend. XIV. When the prosecution introduces the statement of a codefendant who invokes his or her Fifth Amendment right to not testify, the defendant is denied the right to confront or cross-examine the witness, thus implicating the Sixth Amendment. <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 541, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>A hearsay statement made by an unavailable witness may only be introduced if (1) the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception; or (2) the evidence contains particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). Although statements by a codefendant may fall under the Virginia \u201cstatement against interest\u201d hearsay exception, as discussed in the previous section, the United States Supreme Court has held that such statements are inherently unreliable, <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 541, 545, 106 S.Ct. at 2062, 2064, and, therefore, do not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception for Sixth Amendment purposes. <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 134, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 1899, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Therefore, a statement by a codefendant can only be introduced if the statement contains \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness such that the adversarial testing of the statement would be expected to add little, if anything, to the statement\u2019s reliability.\u201d <em>Dearing v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 117, 123, 524 S.E.2d 121, 124 (2000). In. determining whether a codefendant\u2019s statement contains such guarantees of trustworthiness, we must examine the statement itself and the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. <em>Rankins, </em>31 Va.App. at 369, 523 S.E.2d at 532. It is irrelevant that other evidence introduced at trial corroborates the codefendant\u2019s statement. <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 137-38, 119 S.Ct. at 1900-01 (such \u201cbootstrap[ping] on the trustworthiness of other evidence\u201d is not allowed).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, the fact that the statement was made voluntarily, following the reading of one\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, is also irrelevant in determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>trustworthiness of the statement. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 119 S.Ct. at 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u201cWhen evaluating circumstances surrounding the confession, a court should consider the extent to which the accomplice was \u2018free from any desire, motive, or impulse ... to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability by spreading the blame [to the defendant]....\u201d\u2019 <em>Rankins, </em>31 Va.App. at 368, 523 S.E.2d at 532 (quoting <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064). In determining whether the codefendant was free from a desire to mitigate her involvement, we must consider factors such as whether the codefendant made the statement to the police, while in custody, <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 139, 119 S.Ct. at 1887, whether the statement was given in response to questions from police officers who \u201cknew what they were looking for,\u201d <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2060; <em>see also Lilly, 527 </em>U.S. at 139, 119 S.Ct. at 1901; <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 373, 384, 523 S.E.2d 534, 539 (2000), whether the codefendant knew she had already been implicated in the alleged crimes, <em>id. </em>at 384, 523 S.E.2d at 539, whether there was any contemporaneous cross-examination conducted, <em>id., </em>and whether the codefendant attempted to shift blame to the defendant, <em>Lilly, 527 </em>U.S. at 137, 119 S.Ct. at 1900; <em>Rankins, </em>31 Va.App. at 370, 523 S.E.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In this case, Mrs. Cairns made the statement to police, while at the police station, alone in an interviewing room with two officers. Although she was not under arrest at the time she made the statement, and was so informed by the interviewing officer, she knew at the time of the interview that the children had made allegations concerning the conduct that had occurred in the house. In addition, the officer asked her specific, leading questions, and told her, \u201cwe\u2019re aware of ... a lot of stuff, so the best thing you can do is be honest with us.\u201d Finally, in her statement to the police, Mrs. Cairns attempted to mitigate her reported participation in the offenses and to shift blame to Cairns. She denied having knowledge of and being involved in most of the alleged criminal activities, stating, \u201c[m]ost of the time that anything that [sic] goes on in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>house at night, I\u2019m at work.\u201d She admitted holding the camera during the videotaping, but denied participating, and she stated that \u201cif anything like that [a videotape] was made, Robert [Cairns] always did somethin\u2019 with \u2018em. I never knew where they went.\u201d When asked how she felt about Cairns having sex with her daughter, and why she did not stop him, she replied, \u201cthere ain\u2019t a lot I can do about it, simply because he\u2019s quite a bit stronger than I am.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We find that because of the content of the statement and the circumstances under which the statement was given, the statement does not contain the requisite particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Therefore, the trial court erred when it admitted the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>2. Harmless Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Although we find the statement was inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment, constitutional error does not compel reversal if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 551, 523 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999). Such error cannot- be deemed harmless in cases where \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)). Factors which provide guidance to the resolution of the issue include: (1) whether the statement was cumulative of evidence already introduced; (2) whether the statement was corroborated or contradicted by other evidence in the case; (3) the importance of the statement to the Commonwealth\u2019s case; and (4) the overall strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 551, 523 S.E.2d at 209; <em>Dearing, </em>259 Va. at 123, 524 S.E.2d at 125; <em>see also Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 1728, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969) (where remaining evidence of guilt is \u201coverwhelming,\u201d error deemed harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">AVhile Mrs. Cairns\u2019 statement corroborated some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the allegations made by her daughters, WW and NC,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> her statement contradicted Cairns\u2019 admitted statement in which he denied participating in any sexual activity with his daughters. <em>Cf. Bass, </em>31 Va.App. at 390-91, 523 S.E.2d at 543 (fact that the codefendant\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s statements \u201cinterlocked\u201d contributed to harmlessness of error).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Moreover, the only other evidence pointing to Cairns\u2019 guilt raised issues of credibility and, for that reason cannot be considered \u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>See Lilly, </em>258 Va. at 552, 523 S.E.2d at 209. In <em>Lilly, </em>three defendants shot and killed a man. The only evidence that Lilly was the triggerman came from the testimony of one of his codefendants, Barker, and the statement given to police prior to trial by his other codefendant, his brother Mark. The United States Supreme Court held Mark\u2019s statement was inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment and remanded the case to the Virginia Supreme Court for a harmless error analysis. <em>Lilly, </em>527 U.S. at 139-40, 119 S.Ct. at 1901. On remand, the Virginia Supreme Court noted that, excluding Mark\u2019s inadmissible statement, Lilly\u2019s conviction rested on the credibility of codefendant Barker\u2019s testimony. It further considered the likely impact of Mark\u2019s statement, \u201ccoming as [it] did, from Lilly\u2019s brother[, it] undoubtedly carried weight with the jury.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>258 Va. at 553, 523 S.E.2d at 210. The Court found that the remaining evidence, other than Mark\u2019s statement, was not overwhelming. Given the nature of the other evidence in the case, resting as it did on the credibility of Barker\u2019s testimony, viewed together with the absence of physical evidence that Lilly was the triggerman and the absence of a confession by the defendant, <em>id. </em>at 552, 523 S.E.2d at 209-10, the Court concluded the admission of the statement was not harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 523 S.E.2d at 210; <em>see also Rankins, </em>31 Va.App. at 372-73, 523 S.E.2d at 534 (the erroneously admitted statement was the only direct evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt); <em>cf. Schneble v.

Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 692, 695-96, 539 S.E.2d 77, 79 (2000) (the defendant was apprehended at the scene shortly after the crime, and the defendant even admitted that he had attacked and struggled with the victim); <em>Dearing, </em>259 Va. at 124, 524 S.E.2d at 125 (the police apprehended the defendant, who matched the description given by the victim, shortly after the crime and found physical evidence on the defendant linking him to the crime); <em>Bass, </em>31 Va.App. at 391-92, 523 S.E.2d at 543 (in finding the remaining evidence to be overwhelming, we relied heavily on the defendant\u2019s own confession).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In the present case, Cairns not only did not confess to the alleged crimes, he denied the allegations. In addition, no physical evidence was introduced linking him to the crimes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Without Mrs. Cairns\u2019 statement, the Commonwealth\u2019s case rested solely on the credibility of the parties\u2019 two daughters.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Although their testimonies, even uncorroborated, may have been sufficient to support the convictions, <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, 228 </em>Va. 296, 299, 321 S.E.2d 202, 203-04 (1984), the test in a harmless constitutional error analysis is not whether the remaining evidence is sufficient, but \u201c \u2018whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 395, 399-400, 528 S.E.2d 166, 168-69 (2000) <em>(en banc </em>) (quoting <em>Thompson v. Leeke, </em>756 F.2d 314, 316 (4th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We find a reasonable possibility that the statement influenced the verdict in this case. Although Mrs. Cairns\u2019 statement did not corroborate all of the details of her daughters\u2019 testimonies, it cannot be said that the statement, coming as it did from her, the accused\u2019s wife, played no role in bolstering the girls\u2019 credibility and that it did not influence the court\u2019s determination of guilt. <em>Lilly, </em>258 Va. at 553, 523 S.E.2d at 210 (\u201cthose statements, coming as they did, from Lilly\u2019s brother undoubtedly carried weight with the jury\u201d). In <em>Lilly, </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">[T]he issue is not the credibility of the witness, but rather the potential for harm caused by the erroneous admission of evidence which tends to support the jury\u2019s credibility determination. In that context we must presume that such evidence had the potential to influence the jury into accepting the properly admitted evidence as more credible, and thus, to taint the jury\u2019s determination of the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\"><em>Lilly, </em>258 Va. at 553, 523 S.E.2d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Based on these reasons, we cannot say the error of introducing the codefendant\u2019s statement in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so disposed.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-11\">.
