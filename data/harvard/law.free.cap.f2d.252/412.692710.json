These taxes went unpaid and -became delinquent. In accordance with the involved and somewhat unique procedures established by the territorial legislature for the collection of delinquent taxes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the delinquent tax rolls were presented to the District Court for the District of Alaska, Third Division, for judgment and order of sale of the property. The cause was heard, judgment entered, and sale ordered. Appellee then filed motions to dismiss the judgment and set aside the order of sale. The cases were e consolidated for determination of the motions, arguments had, and an opinion granting appellee\u2019s motion filed on May 9, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">Three grounds were urged by appellee in support of its motion to dismiss:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">(1) The cooperative association is a governmental instrumentality and therefore not taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\">(2) The property of the association is located wholly within the Alaska Railroad Reserve, with title thereto in the federal government, and therefore is not taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">(3) The cooperative has been granted specific immunity from taxation by the Territorial Legislature. The District Court decided the case in appellee\u2019s favor on the third ground stated, that being determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\">Appellants challenge the holding of the District Court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949, was a codification of all taxing statutes, thereby granting, under \u00a7 6(b), an exemption from municipal and school district taxes to associations operating utilities under arrangement with the Rural Electrification Administration; and further, that Chapter 33, S.L.A. 1953, grants appellee an exemption from these taxes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>thus presented with the question whether, under the statutes now in force in the Territory of Alaska, the Chugach Electric Association, an association operating under arrangement with the Rural Electrification Administration, is exempt from taxes lawfully imposed by municipalities and independent school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Codification</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Under the Organic Act of 1912<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Congress of the United States authorized the levy of property taxes by the Territory of Alaska <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and by incorporated municipalities within the Territory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pursuant to the latter authority, a general tax for school and municipal purposes was enacted by the territorial legislature in 1913.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With certain revisions, here inapplicable, the power of municipalities and school districts to levy taxes remained substantially the same up to 1949.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The Territory of Alaska did not invoke its power to tax, given it in 1912, until 1949. In that year the legislature enacted the Alaska Property Tax Act, Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949. It is this Act which lies at the heart of the instant case. The pertinent parts thereof are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u201cChapter 10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"atk-dedup-0\">\u201cAn Act</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\u201cLevying a tax on property in Alaska; providing for collection thereof, and <em>allowing certain exemptions; </em>defining offenses and prescribing penalties; and declaring an emergency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">\u201cBe it enacted by the Legislature of the Territory of Alaska: ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">\u201cSection 3.

Admitting that codification may take place without specific reference to the statutes being codified and without a general statement that a codification is intended, we cannot agree with the conclusion that the Alaska Property Tax Act of 1949 constituted such a codification. \u201c[T]hose who seek an exemption from a tax must rest it on more than a doubt or ambiguity.\u201d United States v. Stewart, 1940, 311 U.S. 60, 71, 61 S.Ct. 102, 109, 85 L.Ed. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">Relying on the fact that the 1949 Act taxed <em>all </em>property within the Territory and that the tax collected pursuant thereto within municipalities or school districts was to be remitted to said municipalities or districts,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court below concluded that, \u201cit cannot be said that the legislature intended that the <em>1% </em>authorized by this act would be in addition to that authorized to the municipalities and independent school districts enumerated above.\u201d We cannot see why this is so, and do not agree. Congress, in the Organic Act of 1912, contemplated separate and cumulative taxation by the Territory and local units. Originally there was authorized a 2% tax by the latter, and a 1% tax by the former; this has now been increased to 3% and 2% respectively.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The increase was approved by Congress in 1948; thus at the time Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949, was enacted there could have been a maximum property tax of 5% of assessed value. Assuming taxes by local units were at their allowable maximum of 3%,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the total amount of taxes imposed would be well below the maximum decreed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-17\">School and municipal taxing statutes long ante-date the territorial tax.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such a statute existed at the date the Territorial Property Tax Act was passed, was amended at the same session of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>legislature which enacted the territorial tax,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and was amended, not re-enacted, by the same 1953 legislature which repealed the territorial property tax<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u201cWhen all the acts are viewed as a whole and construed together,\u201d the legislative intent is clearly not that of codification. It bespeaks of an additional tax imposed by the Territory for territorial purposes, one of which was use of the tax collected within municipalities and school districts by those respective units.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">It should be further noted that the exemptions authorized by \u00a7 6 of Chapter 10 are exemptions from the tax imposed \u201chereunder.\u201d The only tax \u201cimposed\u201d by Chapter 10 is the 1 <em>% </em>tax on all property within the Territory. \u00a7 4(c) of Chapter 10 allows local units to impose \u201can additional tax * * * not to exceed the amount allowed by law.\u201d It is logical to assume that in enacting the quoted portion of \u00a7 4(c) the legislature was aware of the various statutes authorizing local units to impose property taxes. (These have already been mentioned.) Thus it is apparent that the legislature itself contemplated the other taxes then in force and added a new 1% territorial property tax thereto, for which various exemptions were designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The net result of Chapter 10 was to impose a <em>1% </em>tax on all property within the Territory, exempting therefrom certain property as listed in \u00a7 6. Such property, wherever located, including the property of associations operating utilities under arrangement with the Rural Electrification Administration, \u00a7 6(b), was exempt from the <em>1% </em>tax, but was not exempt from whatever property taxes were imposed by local taxing units on property located therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Effect of Repeal and Present Exemptions</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Whatever may have been the scope of the tax imposed and exemptions allowed by Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949, that statute was not applicable to the taxes here in issue which were levied and assessed for the year 1954. Chapter 10 was repealed by Chapter 22, S.L.A.1953.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, there was enacted Chapter 33, S.L.A.1953, upon which appellee relies and which is here quoted in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">\u201cChapter 33</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayi-dedup-0\">\u201cAn Act</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">\u201cAuthorizing and empowering Cities, Municipalities, School Districts, Public Utility Districts and other taxing units to <em>classify </em>property for the purpose of taxation and authorizing the <em>granting of exemptions </em>to certain classes of property; making <em>exemptions granted and classifications made </em>under <em>Chapter 10, </em>Sessions Laws of Alaska, 1949, binding upon such taxing units ; and declaring an emergency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-16\">\u201cBe it enacted by the Legislature of the Territory of Alaska:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-17\">\u201cSection 1. All municipalities * * * and independent school districts * * * having power to tax real and personal property, are hereby authorized and empowered to <em>classify </em>property for the purpose of taxation and to <em>grant exemptions </em>therefrom for the periods herein prescribed to certain classes of property as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-19\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-20\">\u201cSection 3. All <em>exemptions granted </em>* * * and all <em>classifications heretofore made under the pro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>visions of Section 6, Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949, </em>shall remain in full force and effect <em>upon the terms and for the periods granted, </em>and shall be binding upon the Territory, and all * * * municipalities, school districts * * * in which the property which is the subject of classification or exemption is situated, and the exemptions granted and classifications so made shall apply to all taxes levied and assessed by the * * * municipality, school district * * * where the property is situated, as fully as though they had been granted under this Act. <em>The purpose </em>and intent of this section is to carry into practical effect all <em>classifications made amd exemptions granted </em>under the provisions of <em>Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska 1949.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cSection 4. It is declared to be the purpose and intent of this Act to encourage the establishment of new industry and the construction of new buildings and structures in the Territory which bring new payrolls, new settlers and, consequently, new wealth to the Territory, and which will eventually add to the amount of taxable property in Alaska; and it is enacted for the purpose of authorizing classification of property for taxation. * * *\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Before proceeding to a discussion of the effect of Chapter 33, S.L.A.1953, it is pertinent to note that subsequent to its passage the legislature amended the then existing statute empowering municipalities to tax for school and general purposes, increasing the authorized amount from 2% to <em>3%. </em>This amendment, Chapter 121, S.L.A.1953, however, did no more than that. It retained all the prior exemptions of similar statutes, but <em>not </em>an exemption for associations operating utilities under arrangement with the Rural Electrification Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The essence of appellee\u2019s contention is that the exemptions of the repealed \u00a7 6, Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949, were re-enacted, <em>in toto, </em>by Chapter 33, S.L.A. 1953. This conclusion is based on the reference to \u201cChapter 10\u201d in the introduction to Chapter 33, to \u201cSection 6\u201d Chapter 10, in the first sentence of \u00a7 3 of Chapter 33, and to Chapter 10 in the last or \u201cpurpose\u201d sentence of \u00a7 3 of Chapter 33.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> What appellee fails to recognize, and the error we find in the court below, is that the references to Chapter 10 and to \u00a7 6 thereof contained in Chapter 33 are references to \u201cclassifications made and exemptions granted\u201d under Chapter 10. The scope of exemptions provided by Chapter 33, S.L.A. 1953, is not as broad as appellee would have us find. The incorporation into Chapter 33 of exemptions allowed by Chapter 10 is limited to those arising from \u201cclassifications made and exemptions granted\u201d pursuant to the latter statute. Which exemptions of \u00a7 6, Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949, so qualify?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">\u00a7\u00a7 6(a) through 6(g) exempt certain properties by mandate of the legislature \u2014such property: \u201cshall be exempt hereunder.\u201d Only \u00a7 6(h), the industrial incentive clause of Chapter 10, makes reference to the <em>classifying </em>of property for taxation or to the <em>granting </em>of exemptions. Chapter 33, S.L.A.1953, is, by its \u00a7 4 express purpose clause, similar to \u00a7 6(h) of Chapter 10, an industrial incentive provision. It is not a taxing statute; rather it authorizes local taxing units <em>to classify </em>certain properties and <em>to grant </em>exemptions thereto. It is a discretionary enabling act, just as was \u00a7 6(h) of the repealed Alaska Property Tax Act. Thus we believe it quite clear that the references in Chapter 33 to the repealed Chapter 10 and Chapter 10, \u00a7 6 are not to <em>all </em>the provisions of \u00a7 6, but <em>only </em>to those classifying prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>erty and granting exemptions \u2014 i. e., those contained in \u00a7 6(h), Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949. Such a construction of Chapter 33 makes consonant the purpose and intent of the entire act as stated by the legislature in \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Finally, it is well to again point out that the same legislature which enacted Chapter 33 subsequently amended the taxing authority of municipalities, and thereby of school districts,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to raise the allowed rate from 2% to 3%. This statute, Chapter 121, S.L.A.1953, left unchanged the exemptions of the statute it amended.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Absent therefrom is any exemption which would pertain to the Chugach Electric Association. Chapter 121 is a specific school and municipal taxing statute. If Chapter 33 were interpreted to re-enact all the exemptions established by Chapter 10, S.L.A.1949, there would be both redundancy and inconsistency between the two pertinent 1953 statutes. Since Chapter 121 was passed within a few weeks of Chapter 33,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> by the same legislative body, we find such an intended inconsistency and redundancy highly unlikely. The rule of construction which establishes a presumption against surrender of the taxing power precludes imputation of such inaccuracy to the territorial legislature.<footnotemark>23a</footnotemark>\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Appellee does not claim to have established any new business nor to have constructed any new buildings, so as to qualify under the industrial incentive provisions of Chapter 33, S.L.A.1953. Rather, the Chugach Electric Association claims to be exempt from property taxation by the terms of a repealed statute which at first blush might appear to have been incorporated by reference into the statute now in force. Chapter 33, read in the light of its express terminology and stated purpose, cannot be so construed. Chapter 33 does no more than authorize taxing units of the Territory to grant industrial incentive exemptions and to classify property accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">We conclude, therefore, that there is no statutory authority exempting the property of appellee from taxation by the City of Anchorage and the Anchorage Independent School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">Appellee\u2019s Alternative Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">We find the alternative contentions of appellee equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">A. The Electric Association is not an agency of the United States Government simply by virtue of an \u201carrangement\u201d with the Rural Electrification Administration pursuant to 7 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901-915. The Rural Electrification Administration is the government agency. The associations to whom it provides funds and other assistance are not. By no concept or canon of construction can the recipient of federal aid in this situation be considered a \u201cgovernment instrumentality\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and therefore immune from local taxation under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, whereby the federal government protects the instrumentalities which it has constitutionally created.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\">B. The City of Anchorage includes within its corporate limits the Alaska Railroad Reserve.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is not shown that the Railroad Reserve is \u201cfederal property\u201d or under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. Therefore the doctrine that property lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>cated upon federally owned land is immune from local taxation <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth hereinabove, the decision of the District Court must be, and is Reversed, and the action remanded to the District Court for the District of Alaska for entry of an order reinstating the judgment and ordering the sale.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-11\">. 16-1-1 to 16-1-143, Alaska Compiled Laws Ann.1949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"aha-dedup-0\">. 37-3-41 to 37-3-55, A.C.L.A.1949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A0d\">.
