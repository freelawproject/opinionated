A simple case coming up on a small record, with no material facts in dispute, it presents the picture of an overtaking vessel, the Motor Vessel Fernside, coming up in a narrow channel dead astern of, and running into\u2019 and ramming, libellant\u2019s tug and tow.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">The libel, in addition to the usual formal averments and an allegation that the Tug-tow was overtaken and rammed from astern by the Vessel, charges the Vessel with negligence, in each particular as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-22\">\u201c14. (a) In that the Fernside failed to keep out of <em>the </em>way of the barge which was being overtaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-24\">\u201c(b) In that the Fernside was steered into the aft end of the barge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-25\">\u201c(e) In that the Fernside attempted to pass the barge without allowing sufficient clearance to prevent colliding therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u201c(d) In that the Fernside, after having seen the barge in ample time and after having stopped its engines, again started up its engines without having determined upon a prudent and safe maneuver to pass the said barge with necessary clearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201c(e) In that those in charge of the Fernside failed to keep the Vessel under immediate control while .attempting to pass the said barge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201c(f) In that those in command of \"the Fernside negligently under-estimated the distance between the barge and the Fernside when orders were given to start the Fernside ahead again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c(g) In that the Fernside was started ahead at an excessive and dangerous rate of speed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Answer, after admitting that the Vessel was the overtaking craft, charged \u25a0the Tug-tow with negligence, in failing to hold a proper course, in using the wrong side of the channel, in failing to hear the Vessel\u2019s signal, and in failing to change its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The district judge, stating, \u201cThere is but little conflict of evidence as to what occurred on the occasion of the collision\u201d, found that the Fernside \u201cwas the overtaking vessel, required by Art. 24 of the Inland Rules to keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel, the tug and barge\u201d. He found, however, that her actions were such as to excuse her failure to obey the rule and that the collision did not result from her failure but from the violation by the tug of at least three rules of navigation. As he stated them, these were: (1) By deliberately keeping on the port side of a narrow channel, she violated Art. 25; (2) By acceding to the Fern-side\u2019s proposal to pass her to port instead of blowing a danger signal, she violated Art. 18, Rule 8; and (3) By failing to post a man where he could hear whistle signals, she violated Art. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Libellant, emphasizing the importance and binding force of the universal rule of the sea, incorporated into statute law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the absolute duty it imposes upon an overtaking vessel to keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel, cites Warner Co. v. Independent Pier Co., 278 U.S. 85, 49 S.Ct. 45, 73 L.Ed. 195; The Percheron v. Alabama Transit Co., 5 Cir., 246 F.2d 135, and many similar decisions in support of his claim that the district judge misapprehended the force and effect of the evidence and, in finding and holding as he did, went contrary to the truth and right of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">We agree that this is so. Without setting out the evidence of Chastain, Captain of the George Bonney and of Karlsen, Captain, and Poulmot, Pilot, of the Fernside, it is sufficient to say that it establishes without dispute that there was nothing to prevent the Fernside from seeing and knowing all of the conditions and circumstances surrounding and attending her decision and her attempt to pass the Tug-tow. It also establishes that there was nothing to account for the collision except the wholly unwarranted, the inexcusable impatience and negligence of those on the Fernside, evidenced, (1) by their importunate and headstrong persistence in pressing for consent Ao pass on the tug\u2019s port side, and (2) by their attempting thereafter to force a passage, all, without giving sufficient consideration to the situation as a whole and particularly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the consequences of a failure to negotiate the passing, Cf. Seaboard Airline R. Co. v. Pan American Petroleum &amp; Transport Co., 5 Cir., 199 F.2d 761, and on the unauthorized assumption that the tow would, or should, move out of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The judgment is therefore reversed and, since the cost of the necessary repairs, $6,465, is not in dispute, here rendered in favor of libellant for that sum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\">. \u201cNot withstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel, overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel * * * and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall * * * relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally passed and clear.\u201d Navigation, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 209.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">\u201cEvery steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.\u201d Navigation, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 208.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">The correlative duty of the overtaken vessel is likewise plain: \u201cWhere, by any of these rules, one of the two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.\u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
