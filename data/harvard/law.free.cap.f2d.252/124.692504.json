Three additional counts, charged like offenses on March 31, 1956. James entered a plea of guilty to three counts as to one transaction whereupon the counts as to his alleged participation, in the other occurrence were dismissed.. Appellant went to trial, and this appeal follows his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">One Doris Johnson had lived where appellant made his abode until his father-invoked the aid of police to bring about, her ejectment. She testified that appellant had given her a Government check, upon which she had forged an endorsement in the name of the payee and that appellant waited outside a liquor store-while she and James entered the store and cashed the check. Thereafter having delivered the proceeds to appellant, she received $9 as her share.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-20\">One Kay Glenn testified that appellant had beaten her; she had seen appellant in possession of the check involved in the March 31, 1956, transactions; she and appellant waited outside a clothing store while James entered and purchased clothing with the forged check; James, upon his return, gave to the appellant money, a pair of trousers and two shirts. The Government also elicited from her that she had seen appellant with yet other checks, none of which was identified, and for all that appeared, they might not have been stolen or forged or uttered.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-21\">James, called as a defense witness, identified both cheeks, but denied appellant\u2019s alleged complicity, the alleged participation by Kay Glenn, and that appellant had received the proceeds from the cashing of either check. He insisted he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>would not give appellant \u201cno money from nothing\u201d for \u201cHe was going with my wife. I stopped playing with him.\u201d Confronted with a statement he had given to Government agents, James acknowledged he had signed it, observed that it referred to five checks, but repudiated the entire writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Appellant denied all participation whatever in the various occurrences. The Johnson woman, he said, had been in \u201csome kind of training school,\u201d and to avoid her mother\u2019s charges that he might be \u201charboring this girl\u201d he had his father send for the police to take her away. As to the Glenn woman, \u201cI couldn\u2019t marry her, see; I had a wife already, see. I couldn\u2019t marry her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Thus, the Government\u2019s case, developed through two alleged accomplices who had grounds for hostility, purported to demonstrate a pattern of conduct, a continuing scheme, or plan, directly denied by the appellant. Against that background, appellant on cross-examination was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201cAnd in this court, in Criminal No. 846-56, you were convicted of <em>the same offense </em>as you are being tried for today, <em>possession of a check knowing that it was stolen, forgery and uttering?\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Appellant had been convicted but had appealed. That case had nothing to do with the offenses charged in the instant case except that similar counts had been set forth which dovetailed with the \u201cscheme\u201d or \u201cpattern\u201d here said to have been followed. It must be conceded that the Government could not here seek conviction because of what had occurred in some prior case. Defense counsel urged that the Government might not properly \u201cuse a prior conviction and try to relate it to this one, to the one he is being tried for here.\u201d When the trial judge answered that the Government \u201cis not trying to do that,\u201d the prosecutor replied \u201cI am saying it is a similar offense.\u201d In the course of further colloquy the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201cThe Court: You see, what you are trying to get at, I think, is this: Even though you had not put character in evidence, the Government could show related offenses for the purpose of showing intent or scheme, or a plan, but you have now put character in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">\u201cThe Court: And which gives the Government the right to explore every angle of character and to bring out all the details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">After a recess the prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-13\">\u201cQ. I think you answered the last question about that conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">\u201cNow, in a case in this court in January, the case went to trial on the 23rd of January, 1957, which case I prosecuted against you, you were convicted of possession of a check, were you not, knowing that it was stolen, and you were also convicted of forgery and uttering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-15\">\u201cA. Your Honor, there is a decision pending in the Court of Appeals about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-16\">\u201cThe Court: Now, you answer the question, and then make your explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-17\">\u201cThe Witness: That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-18\">\u201cThe Court: Now, if you want to make some explanation, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-19\">\u201cThe Witness: There is an opinion in the Court of Appeals pertaining to this whole matter about the jurisdiction in this matter, see, and this is pending appeal now, and I just wanted the Court to protect my rights, and I just wanted to know whether the District Attorney was within his rights to ask that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-20\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you answer any questions that are asked you unless I rule on objection that they are not admissible, and then you can make whatever explanation you want to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-21\">\u201cThe Witness: Well, I just wanted to put it on the record, your Honor.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The colloquy only tends to emphasize the degree of involvement of this appellant in what the jury must have deemed, as did the trial judge himself, the Government\u2019s purpose to show appellant\u2019s continuing scheme or pattern in the instant case by his prior conviction for \u201cthe same offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">D.C.Code \u00a7 14-305 (1951), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\u201cNo person shall be incompetent to testify, in either civil or criminal proceedings, by reason of his having been convicted of crime, but such fact may be given in evidence to affect his credit as a witness, either upon the cross-examination of the witnesses or by evidence aliunde * * * &gt;&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Clearly it would be improper, for impeachment purposes, to show accusation, .arrest, or indictment as well against the accused in a criminal trial as against a witness in any case, civil or criminal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have pointed out in furtherance of this principle that where the time for appeal had not expired, evidence of a conviction is inadmissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the Beasley case, objection having been voiced, the trial judge immediately ruled that the .jury should not consider the question or answer. We concluded that the error had been cured by his prompt instruction that the jury disregard the episode. We .are satisfied that the intendment of our Code, supra, requires that there be a final conviction before \u201csuch fact may be given in evidence.\u201d It has seemed to us</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-15\">\u201cwholly illogical and unfair to permit a defendant to be interrogated about a previous conviction from which an appeal is pending. If the judgment of conviction is later reversed, the defendant has suffered, unjustly and irreparably, the prejudice, if any, caused by the disclosure of the former conviction. <em>We therefore hold that the pendency of an appeal prevents the prosecution from proving a previous conviction for impeachment purposes; </em>and that the District Court erred in admitting evidence concerning Campbell\u2019s conviction when his appeal therefrom had not been determined.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">It fairly should be noted that neither counsel called to the attention of the visiting judge the rule which we had announced in the Campbell case. Had he been so advised, he could have instructed the jury as had been done in the Beasley case. The appellant here had, and admitted, a \u201crecord\u201d of final convictions of petty larceny and the like, to be sure. It is possible the jury would have returned a guilty verdict in any event. However, we cannot escape the conclusion that the jury here might well have given far more than \u201ccursory consideration\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, framed as we have shown, against the background of the case as we have summarized it. Under all the circumstances we cannot here say as we did in the Campbell case that the error had slight, if any, effect. Rather, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>satisfied that the consequences of the error were sufficiently grave that a new trial must be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">.

Campbell v. United States, D.C.Cir. 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 135, 176 F.2d 45, 47. We are aware that other Courts of Appeals have taken a different view. See, e. g., Bloch v. United States, 9 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 185, 188, certiorari denied 350 U.S. 948, 76 S.Ct. 323, 100 L.Ed. 826, rehearing denied, 1956, 350 U.S. 977, 76 S.Ct. 432, 100 L.Ed. 847, but we do not understand their decisions to have been related to a statute comparable to our Code section, supra. The Government argues that there is no reversible error because appellant\u2019s conviction has since been affirmed. Fenwick v. United States, D.C.Cir. Oct. 3, 1957, 101 U.S.App.D.C. -, 249 F.2d 931. We regard this circumstance as immaterial in view of our holding in the Campbell case, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A02\">.

Though the erroneously admitted conviction was later affirmed, we cannot know that its admission in evidence was not prejudicial. Though that conviction may hereafter be admitted for the purpose of impeaching the defendant as a witness if he testifies at a new trial, we cannot know that there will be a new trial, or that the defendant will testify, or that a new trial will not result in an acquittal, a hung jury, or a conviction reversed on appeal. The possibility that there may be a valid conviction is not a good reason for affirming the present invalid one.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b179-7\">BASTIAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXN\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">I cannot agree that the conviction in this case should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">When Fenwick had completed his direct testimony, the Assistant United States Attorney commenced his cross-examination in the not unusual manner of showing convictions for prior offenses to affect Fenwick\u2019s credit as a witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fenwick admitted the following convictions :</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">1. Convicted of attempted burglary 3rd degree and possession of burglary instruments; June 27, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">2. Convicted of petty larceny; May 5, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">3. Convicted of petty larceny; May 21, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">4. Pleaded guilty to petty larceny; September 2, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">Thereupon he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-19\">\u201cAnd in this court, in Criminal No. 846-56, you were convicted of the same offense as you are being tried for today, possession of a check knowing that it was stolen, forgery and uttering?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">Upon objection being made to this question, a bench conference was held. To defense counsel\u2019s statement at this bench conference that \u201c [y] ou cannot use a prior conviction and try to relate it to this one, to the one he is being tried for here\u201d the trial judge responded by saying, correctly I think: \u201cHe is not trying to do that.\u201d However, in any event, the question was left unanswered; and, after a recess taken at this point, the following question was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-21\">\u201cNow, in a case in this court in January, the case went to trial on the 23rd of January, 1957, which case I prosecuted against you, you were convicted of possession of a check, were you not, knowing that it was stolen, and you were also convicted of forgery and uttering?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">After the colloquy and answer [which are set forth in the majority opinion and not necessary to be repeated here], the cross-examination continued as to matters other than impeachment. Thus it will be seen that appellant was <em>not </em>charged with having engaged in a general scheme and that there was no attempt on the part of the prosecutor to tie appellant in with any such general scheme. He was charged with several <em>separate, </em>specified offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tion, used by the majority as a basis for reversal, was introduced simply to affect appellant\u2019s credibility, as were the other convictions, and for no other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">I recognize, of course, that this court ruled, in Campbell v. United States, 1949, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 176 F.2d 45, 47, that it is \u201cwholly illogical and unfair to permit a defendant to be interrogated about a previous conviction from which an appeal is pending.\u201d However, in that case it was pointed out that reversal was not there required where such a question was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cMoreover, the jury knew the petit larceny conviction was pending on appeal, and heard the appellant\u2019s uncontradicted statement of allegedly newly-discovered evidence in the larceny case which would amount to a complete defense to that charge. It is our view, after studying the proof in its entirety, that no reasonable juror would have given more than the most cursory consideration to the larceny conviction, and that proof concerning it played no substantial part in bringing about the verdict.\u201d 85 U.S.App.D.C. at page 136, 176 F.2d at page 48.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">I feel that substantially the same can be said about the present case, and that the proof concerning the prior convictions \u201cplayed no substantial part in bringing about the verdict\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">There can be no doubt that the evidence of the conviction involved is not inadmissible simply because the crime involved was the same as that for which he was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">Further, it is to be borne in mind that the conviction referred to in the question involved was in fact affirmed. It might well be that had that conviction been reversed, the conviction in this case might likewise have to be reversed for error in admitting that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">I think it is a great mistake to reverse the conviction in this case and put upon the Government the necessity of a new trial when the same question may now be asked, particularly as it may not be possible to procure the witnesses who were available at the first trial. I therefore dissent</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-13\">. \u00a7 14-305 D.C.Code (1951 Ed.): \u201cNo person sliall be incompetent to testify, in either civil or criminal proceedings, by reason of his having been convicted of crime, but such fact may be given in evidence to affect his credit as a witness, either upon the cross-examination of the witness or by evidence aliunde. * * * &gt;&gt;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AQy\">. As a matter of fact, the court, in its charge, eliminated any possible question of a \u201ccontinuous scheme.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asd\">\u201cThis is a criminal charge, a six-count indictment charging this defendant, Mr. Fenwick, Joseph Frederick Fenwick, with having committed certain offenses with reference to two Government checks. All of those offenses are felonious and three of them have to do with the circumstances surrounding one check, three of them have to do with the circumstances surrounding the other check. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>is just as if you were trying two separate indictments against this man. The two instances are not connected in any way, but it is within the rules of the criminal jurisprudence of this country that these two charges may be tried at the same time. That is for the purpose of saving time and expense both to the Government and to the defendant, so as to make it more convenient, but you must bear in mind that there are two separate and distinct instances; three centering on one check and three centering on the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Again, in commenting on the fact that the testimony was largely that of accomplices, and that the testimony of accomplices is always to be received with great caution, the court carefully pointed out that the offenses were different and that no scheme was involved. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASp\">\u201cThe fact that there are two of those [accomplices] does not mean that one corroborates the other, as you will easily see when you consider that they are entirely different offenses. Doris Elaine Johnson didn\u2019t know anything about the check that was taken into the clothing store, and Kay Glenn didn\u2019t know anything about the check that was taken into the liquor store. Each one of them testified as to a certain check and therefore her testimony is uncorroborated. Doris Johnson\u2019s testimony about the liquor store check is uncorroborated. Kay Glenn\u2019s testimony about the clothing store check is uncorroborated.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
