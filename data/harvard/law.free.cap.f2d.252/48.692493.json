The judgment was rendered upon stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Earl Schott, Inc., was an automobile dealer, and at the time of the collision the Ohio certificate of title to the vehicle in question was in Schott\u2019s name. A sale of the car to Norman Stephen, Sr., had been negotiated, however, and Schott had delivered possession of it to him. Stephen had made a small down-payment toward the purchase price, and arrangements had been made for extension of credit on the balance. Stephen had signed a note and chattel <em>mortgage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\"><em>We </em>perceive no error in the judgment of the district court. It appears that under Ohio law \u201cownership\u201d of the automobile was in Earl Schott, Inc. Garlick v. McFarland, 1953, 159 Ohio St. 539, 113 N.E.2d 92; Mielke v. Leeberson, 1948, 150 Ohio St. 528, 83 N.E.2d 209, 7 A.L.R.2d 1342; cf. Workman v. Republic Mut. Ins. Co., 1944, 144 Ohio St. 37, 56 N.E.2d 190. It is clear, however, that at the time of the collision Norman Stephen, Jr., was not operating the automobile \u201cin connection with\u201d the business purpose of Earl Schott, Inc. The automobile dealer had not given Norman Stephen, Sr., possession of the car for the purpose of trying to sell it to him. The sale had already been fully agreed upon and all of its terms settled,</p>\n<p id=\"A7C\">The judgment is affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
