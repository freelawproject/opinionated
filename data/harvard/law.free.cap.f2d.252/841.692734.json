On the first appeal we reversed because, in saying that Szuecs was the first inventor, the District Court had applied the wrong standard of proof. United States v. Szuecs, 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 24, 240 F.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-20\">On remand, the trial court used the \u201cthorough conviction\u201d standard which we had prescribed instead of the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard previously employed, and again awarded priority to Szuecs.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-21\">On this appeal the Secretary of Agriculture urges that Szuecs\u2019 testimony concerning reduction to practice was not corroborated. We hold there was sufficient evidence in corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
