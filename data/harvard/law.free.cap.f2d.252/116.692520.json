The Act of Congress authorizing the construction and operation of the bridge, approved March 29, 1928, 45 Stat. 387, expressly reserved \u201cthe right to alter, amend, or repeal this Act.\u201d The Bridge was inundated as the result of construction of a dam pursuant to a treaty of February 3, 1944 between the United States and Mexico, 59 Stat. 1219. In a well reasoned opinion, District Judge Allred has expressed the view that there was an implied repeal of the Act granting the franchise as clear and effective as an express repeal would have been, and that the bridge company was not due compensation for the value of its franchise, United States v. 85,237 Acres of Land, More or Less, in Zapata County, Texas, D.C., 157 F.Supp. 150. After careful consideration, we agree with that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
