The Municipal Court of Appeals affirmed and we allowed a petition to bring the case here so that we could fully consider new and important questions which the parties urged relating to liability growing out of negligence which directly causes emotional reactions which in turn cause the physical injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-30\">Upon submission of the appeal, however, a fuller study of the record now discloses that such questions were not properly presented. We therefore dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
