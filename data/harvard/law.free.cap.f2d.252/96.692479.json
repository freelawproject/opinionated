The reason for this action by the Court below as stated in that order was that the verdict as rendered for $8,166.67 was manifestly a quotient verdict there being no items of special damage which could in any way support such a figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">Appeal from such an order is premature and cannot be maintained. The appeal must be based on a final judgment below. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292; Milprint, Inc., v. Donaldson Chocolate Co., 8 Cir., 222 F.2d 898, 902; Bass v. Baltimore &amp; O. Terminal R. Co., 7 Cir., 142 F.2d 779; 6 Moore, Federal Practice #59.09 [4], 59.15 [1] ; 7 Id. #73.09 [4]. There is no such judgment here. This is not a case in which a motion for new trial has been <em>denied </em>thus leaving intact the final judgment entered. See e.g., Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Underhill, 5 Cir., 234 F.2d 620; Ft. Worth &amp; Denver Ry. Co. v. Roach, 5 Cir., 219 F.2d 351. Instead, the judgment below has been vacated leaving no basis for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-23\">The review of the asserted error must await the second trial and appeal from that judgment. Finn v. American Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 5 Cir., 207 F.2d 113; Marshall\u2019s U. S. Auto Supply, Inc., v. Cashman, 10 Cir., 111 F.2d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-24\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
