Wiseman, D.C., 147 F.Supp. 156; and it further appearing that petitioner contends that such interest qualifies for the marital deduction without regard to whether the allowance vests or not, since Congress did not intend the terminable interest rule to be applicable to a widow\u2019s allowance; and it further appearing that the Tax Court has not passed upon these contentions of petitioner; and the court being duly advised,</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\">Now, therefore, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed That the case be and is hereby remanded to the Tax Court for its further consideration and for its decision on the issue whether such allowance constituted a terminable interest within the meaning of Section 812(e)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as amended, and whether the terminable interest rule is applicable to a widow\u2019s allowance, under the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
