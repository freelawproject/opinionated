Two errors at trial are. relied on for reversal. No issue is-raised by appellant as to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-24\">The first error urged by appellant is that the trial court erred in failing to grant an early adjournment for the day when requested by appellant\u2019s-, counsel on the grounds of his ill health. It is appellant\u2019s contention that this failure on the part of the trial court denied-her effective assistance of counsel in violation of Amendment 6 of the United States Constitution. (The pertinent colloquies betwen court and counsel are set. out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) We find no merit., in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The case of Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 465, 86 L.Ed. 680, upon which appellant principally relies, bases its holding as to \u201cAssistance of Counsel\u201d upon a showing that some prejudice resulted to the defendant by the appointment of one of his attorneys to represent one of his codefendants. It is from this basis that the Supreme Court in the Glasser case held that it was unnecessary for the defendant to show <em>exactly </em>wherein he was prejudiced and that any interference with the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel was sufficient to constitute a denial of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">There is no such showing in the case at bar. Examination of the record shows a careful and spirited defense overwhelmed by a great quantity of evidence tending to show the guilt of appellant. The defense in no way indicates that appellant\u2019s attorney was laboring under such an illness as to substantially impair his effectiveness. It has been held that without some showing in the record that the illness of counsel was of such a nature as to have affected the defense presented it will not be held to be a denial of assistance of counsel. Hagan v. United States, 10 Cir., 9 F.2d 562. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">Appellant\u2019s second claim of error is that the trial court erred in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for an early adjournment on the ground that more time was needed for counsel to prepare its defense. We do not agree. Though at one point, appellant\u2019s counsel did request such an adjournment, it will be noted from the colloquy set out in the margin that he indicated that 15 minutes would be adequate and the court did in fact grant such a 15-minute recess in response to the request of appellant\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">What we have noted characterizes appellant\u2019s case in its entirety. Though on various occasions, appellant\u2019s counsel indicated that he desired an adjournment until the following day, he always indicated that a shorter recess would be entirely adequate for his purposes. In each case the shorter recess was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">The judgment of the lower court should be and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-15\">. Shortly after resumption of trial following noon recess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aib-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Sch\u00fctz: My inquiry was not to the case in particular, but I am not aware of your Honor\u2019s wishes regarding adjournment, but I will state to the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>that I am not feeling as well as I might and if we could adjourn at any reasonably early hour I might be able to continue. I don\u2019t mean earlier than customary but I should like to get away so I can help myself a little bit. I am feeling very poorly and I will work through as long as your Honor directs me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">\u201cThe Court: Let me see how we get along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1P\">\u201cMr. Sch\u00fctz: I will do my best to get along. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASe\">After the prosecution rested its case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aft-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Sch\u00fctz: * * * I am now about to appeal to the court\u2019s indulgence.
