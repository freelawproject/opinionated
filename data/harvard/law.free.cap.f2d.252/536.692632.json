He claimed to have suffered injuries while working in an area near the vessel\u2019s ice box when he slipped on a terra-cotta floor. The charge was that the floor was slippery and that he was, therefore, given an unsafe place to work and further that the ship was unseaworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">The jury rendered a verdict for the defendant thus settling the many disputed questions of fact in its favor. The appellant\u2019s only basis for appeal is that the trial judge declined expert testimony from a witness on whether a \u201cwaxed\u201d floor was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\"> There is no error in refusing this testimony. A great deal of discretion is given to the trial judge on the subject of expert testimony. See Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence 561(1953); Overman v. Loesser, 9 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 521, 524; cf. Conry v. Baltimore &amp; O. R., 3 Cir., 1953, 209 F.2d 422, 425. That discretion was not abused in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
