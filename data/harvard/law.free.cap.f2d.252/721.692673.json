E. A. ACKERMAN, aka Ada Ackerman, dba The House of Charm Studios, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b773-7\">No. 13326.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b773-8\">United States Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b773-9\">Feb. 28, 1958.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b773-23\">Lawrence E. Broh-Kahn, Shaker Heights, Ohio, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b773-24\">Hugh McNamee, of Ganger &amp; Ganger, Cleveland, Ohio, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b773-25\">Before SIMONS, Chief Judge, MARTIN, Circuit Judge, and MATHES, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b773-26\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b773-27\">Upon this appeal from an order dismissing their diversity action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, appellants first urge that the district court should not have entertained appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss because made after answer filed. This contention overlooks the provisions of Rule 12(h) that \u201cwhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-28\">Two causes of action are asserted in appellants\u2019 complaint: the first for dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>age of \u201cnot less than $2,500\u201d arising from alleged breach of contract by appel-lee to furnish appellants\u2019 residence in an agreed manner; and the second for damage of \u201cnot less than $2,000\u201d for \u201cembarrassment and mental suffering\u201d resulting from failure to furnish the home in the manner agreed and, \u201cin addition thereto,\u201d for $2,000 by reason of \u201cdire threats\u201d allegedly made by appellee to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The damage demanded for claimed breach of contract is patently less than the jurisdictional minimum of \u201c$3,000 exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">As to the second cause of action, there being no allegation that the emotional distress was intentionally caused, the $4,000 sought for \u201cembarrassment and mental suffering\u201d and \u201cdire threats\u201d is not recoverable in whole or in part'under Ohio law where the alleged tortious acts are said to have occurred. Bartow v. Smith, 1948, 149 Ohio St. 301, 78 N.E.2d 735, 15 A.L.R.2d 94; cf. Grill v. Abele Funeral Home, 1940, 69 Ohio App. 51, 42 N.E.2d 788. And it is settled that, in ascertaining the amount in controversy for jurisdictional purposes, \u201cwhere the law gives the rule, the legal cause of action, and not the plaintiff\u2019s demand, must be regarded.\u201d McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 1936, 298 U.S. 178, 182-183, 56 S.Ct. 780, 782, 80 L.Ed. 1135; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. (No. 2), 1898, 170 U.S. 468, 481, 18 S.Ct. 645, 42 L.Ed. 1111; Hayward v. Nordberg Mfg. Co., 6 Cir., 1898, 85 F. 4; cf. Bell v. Preferred Life Society, 1943, 320 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 5, 88 L.Ed. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">If then the claims as asserted in the complaint be combined and considered as one (Baltimore &amp; O. S. W. R. Co. v. United States, 1911, 220 U.S. 94, 106, 31 S.Ct. 368, 371, 55 L.Ed. 384), \u201cit is apparent, to a legal certainty,\u201d from the face of the complaint, that appellants can recover no more than $2,500 on the facts alleged (St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 1938, 303 U.S. 283, 289, 58 S.Ct. 586, 590, 82 L.Ed. 845) ; and there has been no suggestion of any amendment (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Since the amount in controversy in the case does not equal the minimum requisite to federal jurisdiction, the order dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
