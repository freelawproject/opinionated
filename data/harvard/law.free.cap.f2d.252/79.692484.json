It is inconceivable how a trial judge could consistently say that the plaintiff's conduct was so extremely and decisively negligent as to require a ruling that there was gross contributory negligence as a matter of law, and yet as trier of the facts view them as permitting a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-25\">We therefore adhere to our holding affirming the judgment below, and the petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b131-26\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
