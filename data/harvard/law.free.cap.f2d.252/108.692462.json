Gipson and the Motor Vessel James E. Graham, resulting in damage to three barges and their respective cargoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-21\">This appeal has been taken from three separate interlocutory decrees finding the Guadalcanal solely at fault in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-22\">The appellant, American Barge Line Company, assailing the findings and decree of the district court as unwarranted, is here assigning three errors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">Completely mindful of its obligation to show that the findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous and of the difficulties in the way of doing so, appellant makes a valiant effort to discharge its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-24\">Challenging as erroneous the district judge\u2019s action in crediting the testimony of Captain Neff of Industrial Marine Service, Inc. and discrediting that of Captain Philpott of the American Barge Line, Inc. as to the facts of the collision, appellant places its main reliance on its claim that the Mississippi River at the point of collision is a narrow channel and that the Graham-Gipson flotilla violated the \u201cNarrow Channel Rule\u201d by shoving up into a narrow and dangerous bend instead of holding back below it.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-25\">The Industrial Marine Service, pointing to the specific and complete findings of the district court and the evidence in the record supporting them, insists that there is no basis in law or fact for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>claim that the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">We agree that this is so, and because the district judge in his opinion has fully and correctly found the facts and has fully and correctly canvassed and stated the applicable law, we will content ourselves with saying that we are in full agreement with his excellent opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and on its authority affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-15\">. (1) The Court erred in concluding that the Guadalcanal was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">(2) The Court erred in failing to conclude that the Graham-Gipson flotilla was solely at fault for the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-26\">(3) The Court erred in concluding that the Graham-Gipson flotilla did not violate the \u201cNarrow Channel Rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b161-23\">.
