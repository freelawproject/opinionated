Appellant and a co-defendant were convicted of possession of narcotics under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-26\">The conviction of appellant\u2019s co-defendant Collis was reversed by this court on direct appeal because a jury could not have escaped a reasonable doubt as to possession of the narcotics by Collis or his participation in a purchase thereof. See Collis v. United States, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 247 F.2d 566 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-27\">Appellant Upshaw now contends that the same evidence we held insufficient to go to the jury with respect to Collis is the only evidence against appellant and that his conviction must therefore, of necessity, be reversed. Apart from the fact that such an issue, namely the sufficiency of the evidence, is not properly raised by an application under Section 2255, we would hold that on this record the evidence with respect to this appellant, unlike the evidence-against Collis, is sufficient to sustain the conviction, were we to reach that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
