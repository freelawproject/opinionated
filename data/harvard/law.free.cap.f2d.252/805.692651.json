Its somewhat similar counterpart is found in the 1954 Code at 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">In an opinion by Judge Opper, reported at 28 T.C. 809 and reviewed by the Tax Court, it was unanimously held that the corporation in question, Edsol Realty, Inc., was properly treated as collapsible within the ambit of the section cited. With that opinion we are in full agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">However, now on review among their contentions the petitioners raise one, not dealt with in the Tax Court opinion, which relates to the meaning of the word \u201cprincipally\u201d as used in \u00a7 117(m) (2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">\u201c(A) For the purposes of this subsection, the term 'collapsible corporation\u2019 means a corporation formed or availed of principally for the manufacture, construction, or production of property, * * * or for the holding of stock in a corporation so formed or availed of, with a view to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">\u201c(i) the sale or exchange of stock * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">Petitioners argue that \u201cprincipally\u201d should be read as modifying \u201cwith a view to\u201d so that to be held collapsible a corporation must be \u201cformed or availed of\u201d \u201cprincipally\u201d with a \u201cview to\u201d collapse. With this artificial and restricted interpretation we do not agree. We read the word \u201cprincipally\u201d as modifying the phrase \u201cmanufacture, construction, or production of property * * Under this reading, the corporation may be treated as collapsible if \u201cmanufacture, construction, or production\u201d was a principal corporate activity even if the \u201cview to\u201d collapse was not the principal corporate objective when the corporation was \u201cformed or availed of * * This interpretation, we think, is more consonant with Congress\u2019 expressed purpose to \u201cplug\u201d a loophole in the tax structure with this section.
