It is a subsidiary to that association. It exists and is conducted in the interest of that association and of the members thereof through the increase of the fish population and of the locale and opportunities for sport fishing.\u201d In its opinion the court said: \u201cWhile the petitioner has no stock and distributes no profits, \u2014 in fact earns no profits, it was organized and exists primarily for the financial and commercial benefit and advantage of a group of fishing tackle manufacturers, \u2014 indirect, it is true, but still real and substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-17\">We need not consider whether the Institute is a \u201cscientific institution.\u201d Since it \u201cexists primarily for the financial and commercial benefit\u201d of a private group, it seems to us that the Tax Court was clearly wrong in concluding that it is \u201cnot conducted for private gain\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">The Tax Court cited District of Columbia v. Mt. Vernon Seminary, 69 App.D.C. 251, 253, 100 F.2d 116, 118. We think now, as we did then, that the Seminary was entitled to the exemption claimed. The Seminary had no commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>cial purposes. We said it was \u201cthe evident intention of the statute to exempt all institutions, educational in nature, which are not commercial in their purpose.\u201d As the Tax Court has pointed out, we also said: \u201cThe term \u2018private gain,\u2019 as used in the statute, has reference only to gain realized by any individual or stockholder who has a pecuniary interest in the corporation * * But this latter statement was not necessary to our decision. It can be considered correct only if the term \u201cpecuniary interest\u201d is interpreted very broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
