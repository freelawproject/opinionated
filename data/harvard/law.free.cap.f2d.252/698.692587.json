The case turns upon the indemnity provision of the subcontract which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">\u201cThe Sub-contractor shall protect and indemnify said Contractor against any loss or damage suffered by any one arising through the negligence of the Sub-contractor or those employed by him, or his agents or servants; he shall bear any expense which the Contractor may have by reason thereof, or on account of being charged therewith; and if there are any such injuries to persons or property unsettled for when the work herein provided for is finished, final settlement between the Contractor and Sub-contractor shall be deferred until such claims are adjusted or suitable special indemnity acceptable to the Contractor is provided by the Sub-contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">James R. Henderson, an employee of the subcontractor, B &amp; G, was injured on the job. He collected workmen\u2019s compensation from the insurer of B &amp; G, and thereafter brought a common law action for damages against the prime contractor, Bass, charging negligence on the part of Bass. Bass in turn implead-ed B &amp; G as a third party defendant under Rule 14(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., alleging that negligence on the part of B &amp; G was the sole proximate cause of Henderson\u2019s injury, and invoking the indemnity provision of the subcontract. B &amp; G denied the charge of negligence on its part and filed a counterclaim against Bass for a balance of $26,181.83 due under its subcontract. The amount of that balance was not denied except for the claimed liability of B &amp; G to indemnify Bass for the attorney\u2019s fee incurred in defending the action brought by Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">Henderson\u2019s action against Bass was tried separately to the court without a jury and resulted in a judgment for the defendant from which no appeal was prosecuted. The court found that Bass was \u201cguilty of no negligence of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">Thereafter, upon hearing the counterclaim of B &amp; G for the balance due it and the offsetting counterclaim of Bass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>for indemnity for the attorney\u2019s fee, the court awarded B &amp; G the balance due it less, however, the sum of $2,000.00 awarded to Bass as attorney\u2019s fee incurred in defending the tort action. The court found as a fact that the sole proximate cause of Henderson\u2019s injury was the negligence of the subcontractor B &amp; G.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Judgment was entered for B &amp; G in the reduced sum of $24,181.83.. B &amp; G had execution issued and Bass paid to B &amp; G that amount, the check reciting that it was \u201cin full settlement of judgment * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The appellee, Bass, insists that B &amp; G, having accepted the part of the judgment in its favor, cannot take and prosecute an appeal from the part of the judgment adverse to it. The answer to that insistence is that B &amp; G was entitled to that much of its demand in any event, irrespective of the outcome of the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Appellant B &amp; G presents four propositions :</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">1. Since Henderson\u2019s suit against Bass was based upon the theory that he was injured as the result of negligence on the part of Bass and not as the result of negligence on the part of B &amp; G, can B &amp; G be liable for indemnity for the attorney\u2019s fee incurred in defending that suit? As has been stated, the district court found that factually Bass was guilty of no negligence, and that the negligent act charged to Bass was committed by B <em>&amp; </em>G resulting in Henderson\u2019s injury. It follows that the negligence of the subcontractor B &amp; G caused Bass to incur the attorney\u2019s fee to defend Henderson\u2019s suit. The terms of the indemnity agreement are broad enough, we think, to cover expenses incurred by reason of the negligence of B &amp; G, even though the injured party erroneously ascribed such negligence to Bass.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">2. Appellant insists that, since the district court found in favor of Bass as: against Henderson, Bass needed no further protection. Bass had, however, incurred the expense of the attorney\u2019s fee to defend Henderson\u2019s action, which was based, in fact, upon a negligent act committed by B &amp; G. Bass needed to be protected or indemnified for that attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">3. The agreed statement of the case upon which , this appeal is submitted <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not show payment by Bass: of the attorney\u2019s fee. Is the contract one strictly for indemnity, upon which judgment can be awarded only after actual payment ?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">\u201cWhere the contract is strictly one of indemnity, that is, one against loss or damages, the indem-nitee cannot recover until he has made payment or otherwise suffered an actual loss or damage, against which the covenant runs; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>42 C.J.S. Indemnity \u00a7 14 c, p. 589. See also 27 Am.Jur. Indemnity, \u00a7 21, p. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">A careful reading of the indemnity provision of the contract shows that B &amp; G agreed both to \u201cprotect and indemnify\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bass \u201cagainst any loss or damage suffered by anyone arising through the negligence of * * * \u201d B &amp; G. There was no prerequisite that the \u201closs or damage\u201d should be sustained by the indemnitee, Bass, but the \u201closs or damage\u201d might be suffered \u201cby anyone\u201d, including Henderson. Further, B &amp; G agreed to \u201cbear any expense which the contractor may have by reason thereof, or on account of being charged therewith.\u201d \u201cBear any expense\u201d meant that B &amp; G was not only to pay but was permanently to sustain any expense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cAny expense\u201d includes, of course, attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no condition attached to the obligation to bear such expense. As to the words \u201cmay have,\u201d in ordinary usage a person \u201chas\u201d an expense when it is incurred. The phrases \u201cby reason thereof, or on account of being charged therewith\u201d refer back to \u201cany loss or damage suffered by any one arising through the negligence of * * * \u201d B <em>&amp; </em>G. Bass had the expense of the attorney\u2019s fee by reason of Henderson\u2019s injury which arose through the negligence of B &amp; G. Further, Bass had that expense on account of being charged with a negligent act in fact committed by B &amp; G which had resulted in Henderson\u2019s injury. We think that, both within the literal language of the indemnity provision and according to the intention of the parties, there was no requirement that the attorney\u2019s fee be actually paid before B &amp; G could be called on to carry out its contract. Compare Dickson v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 1928, 150 Miss. 864, 117 So. 245, 247-248.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">4. Finally, the appellant calls attention that, according to the written contract, the indemnitee was a <em>partnership </em>styled G. E. Bass &amp; Company, while judgment was rendered in favor of G. E. Bass &amp; Company, Inc. Appellee\u2019s counsel states that he is \u201cfrankly surprised.\u201d \u201cThis is our first knowledge or any intimation of error in the names of parties. The question was never raised in the trial court and never called to the trial court\u2019s attention.\u201d In response, the best that appellant\u2019s counsel can do is to quote from the points relied upon as expressed in the agreed statement of the case on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Those quotations do not pin point the discrepancy. There is no showing that either the district court or opposing counsel were fairly apprised upon the trial. If that had been done, it is probable that the discrepancy might have been removed by amendment or otherwise, for there was but one prime contractor whether a partnership or incorporated. Cf. Grandey v. Pacific Indemnity Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 217 F.2d 27. The question cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. United States v. Sinor, 5 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 271, 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">Even more conclusive is the fact that the agreed statement of the case on appeal refers to the contract as being \u201cbetween B &amp; G Electric Company and G. E. Bass &amp; Company, Inc.\u201d That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>stipulation precludes the appellant from making a contrary contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><em>We </em>find no reversible error in the record and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"aky-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">. \u201cThe Court further finds that the sole proximate cause of the injury in this case was the negligence of the B &amp; G Construction Company in removing the safety precautions which had been put there and knowingly, sending a man into a dangerous place to work.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ara\">\u201cGranting for the sake of argument, not actually of course, but just for the sake of argument, the contention that there was on Bass and McQuay (the owner) the duty to furnish a reasonably safe place to work, the Court holds that they complied with that duty when they erected this barrier as it has been referred to here, and put up signs, which everybody has testified in this case said made it a reasonably safe place to work, particularly for skilled electricians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">\u201cThe record shows that B and G Construction Company for their own purposes and nobody else\u2019s, .tore that barrier down, although there is some dispute as to when it was done. I think from the preponderance of the testimony it indicates that it was done very shortly before the accident happened, either the afternoon or morning before the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-17\">.
