The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, Kendrick v. United States, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 173, 238 F.2d 34 (1956). On motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, filed a year after the sentence, appellant raises for the first time the claim that he was denied the right to accompany the jury to view the premises where the crime took place. The District Court denied the motion after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Whatever may be the nature of the right of an accused to be personally present during a view,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the record discloses that appellant\u2019s absence from the view was the decision of his retained counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a matter of trial strategy, and that appellant made no effort at the trial or on the direct appeal to raise the point. Under the circumstances, we think that appellant was not entitled to relief under Section 2255. See Adams v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 222 F.2d 45 (1955); Martin v. United States, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 412, 248 F.2d 651 (1957); Moore v.
