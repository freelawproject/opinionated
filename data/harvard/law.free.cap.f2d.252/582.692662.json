C., for the Commissioner of Patents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b634-21\">Before JOHNSON, Chief Judge, and O\u2019CONNELL, WORLEY, and RICH, Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b634-22\">WORLEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A0p\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, 111 U.S.P.Q. 351, affirming the action of the examiner in finally refusing registration on the Supplemental Register of appellant\u2019s alleged trademark for potentiometers consisting of an elongated rectangular body provided with eyelets on two of its long sides and having a U-shaped channel member covering three of such sides except for narrow marginal portions. An adjusting screw head is located in one end.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-24\">Refusal to grant registration was on the ground that the subject matter is not capable of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-25\">In a companion appeal, 252 F.2d 579, decided of even date herewith, appellant seeks to obtain a design patent on the same device.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Section 23 of the Lanham Act (Trademark Act of 1946) 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1091, provides for registration on the Supplemental Register of any package or \u201cconfiguration of goods\u201d which is \u201ccapable of distinguishing the applicant\u2019s goods or services.\u201d It is contended in the brief on behalf of the Commissioner that \u201cconfiguration of goods,\u201d as used in section 23, \u201cmust be restricted to the configuration of a particular part or feature of the article and may not extend to the shape or design of the entire device.\u201d We find it unnecessary to rule on that contention, however, since we are of the opinion the alleged configuration of appellant\u2019s potentiometer is not capable of distinguishing it from the goods of others within the meaning of section 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The provision for the registration of \u201cconfiguration of goods\u201d appeared in the trademark laws for the first time in the Lanham Act and has not previously been adjudicated by this court. However, a somewhat similar question has been passed on with respect to packages, and it would seem the same principles would be fairly applicable in both cases. In fact, in some instances, such as perfumes or beverages sold in ornamental bottles designed to be used after the contents have been disposed of, the line of distinction between the package and configuration of the goods is quite vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The case of In re Burgess Battery Co., 112 F.2d 820, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1927, involved batteries having alternating black and white stripes \u201capplied entirely about the goods and packages.\u201d The record showed that customers generally recognized such batteries as the products of appellant and sometimes called for them as \u201cstriped batteries.\u201d In holding that the striped design did not constitute a trademark the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201c * * * The primary object of such design or ornamentation not being for the exclusive purpose of indicating origin or ownership in a trade-mark sense, the design or ornamentation cannot be considered as a valid trade-mark. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201cWe think it is apparent from the record that appellant\u2019s alleged trade-mark is a mere \u2018dress\u2019 which gives a distinctive external appearance to appellant\u2019s goods; that it is such distinctive appearance which is recognized by \u2018some\u2019 of the purchasing public as indicating appellant\u2019s goods; and that appellant\u2019s design is merely a colored label or dress of black and white alternating stripes, the office of which (design) is not to point out distinctly the origin or ownership of the articles to which the label is affixed. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">In the later case of In re Burgess Battery Company, 142 F.2d 466, 467, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1039, the court said with respect to the earlier case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u201cThe effect of our decision in that case is that stripes which are a mere dress of the goods can have no trademark significance, because they do not point out the origin of the article to which the label is affixed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUB\">Similarly in Campbell Soup Company v. Armour &amp; Co., 3 Cir., 175 F.2d 795, 799, it was held that the design of a package did not constitute a trademark unless it was \u201cdistinct and arbitrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnMO\">The first Burgess case was further discussed and distinguished in In re Swift &amp; Co., 223 F.2d 950, 953, 42 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1048, in which the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">\u201cWhile in the cited case the striped design was merely ornamental dress which was devoid of trademark significance, it does not thereby follow that a trade-mark device only incidentally ornamental, and in a sense decorative of the label upon which it appears, is not entitled to registration. * * * The Burgess Battery case, supra, stands for the proposition that that which is only the attractive dress of an article, although it be distinctive in its appearance and sometimes recognized by purchasers as an indication of origin, does not have, as its primary function, an origin-authenticating purpose, and is hence not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u00e1 trad\u00e9-mark entitled to federal registration under the statute. Since the line distinguishing between mere ornamentation and ornamentation which is merely an incidental quality of a trade-mark is not always clearly ascertainable, the application of legal principles to fit one situation or the other requires proper reflection upon the impression likely to govern the ordinary purchaser in the market place. For that reason, the merits of each case of the character here presented must be individually and accordingly adjudged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">While the cases above cited do not relate to the registration of marks on the Supplemental Register, they are pertinent here so far as they relate to whether the appearance of an article may constitute a trademark, and whether it indicates origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In our opinion the configuration of an article, like a package or the <em>dress </em>of the goods, cannot properly be registered as a trademark, even on the Supplemental Register, unless it is intended primarily to indicate origin of the goods and is of such a nature that the ordinary purchaser would be likely to consider that it indicated such origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">, In the instant case it seems clear that the alleged configuration of appellant\u2019s potentiometer results primarily from considerations of utility and secondarily from a desire to produce an attractive appearance. We agree with the Commissioner that there is nothing in the record which would support a finding that the subject matter is capable of distinguishing appellant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
