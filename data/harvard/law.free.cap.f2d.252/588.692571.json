We agree with Judge Huxman\u2019s opinion and the judgment is affirmed for the reasons stated therein. 158 F.Supp. 224. Since we hold appellant to have been a member of the military at the time of his offenses we need not consider any aspect of possible military jurisdiction over civilians.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
