Complaining first that the trial court commented, before the jury was sworn, and, apparently from reading the record, even before the jury was struck by the parties, about narcotics cases in such a way as would prejudice appellant, the accused fails to show that the court\u2019s criticized answer to his motion was made within the hearing of any person who was later chosen and sworn as a juror in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Seeking a reversal of the conviction on the second ground that evidence in the form of the marijuana was illegally obtained and should not, therefore, have been admitted, the appellant is met by the insuperable barrier of having failed either before or during the trial to move for the suppression of this evidence, Rule 41(e), F.R.Crim.P., 18 U. S.C.A., to object to its reception or request that the testimony as to it be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">The third ground, an alleged failure of the trial court to charge adequately as to the meaning of \u201cpossession,\u201d is equally unavailable because, though twice given the opportunity to request added instructions and to object to instructions given, appellant\u2019s trial counsel failed to take the required steps to enable the judge to consider the correctness of his charge. Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P.; Finley v. United States, 5 Cir., 246 F.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
