The employment contract provided that the Company employed him for five years as its General Manager, but could terminate his employment at any time upon making certain payments to him, and particularly, if the termination occurred after September 1, 1954, but prior to September 1, 1955, he should be paid nine months salary at $2,000.00 per month. He alleged that his employment was summarily terminated while he was in the proper performance of his duties during the period between said dates, to-wit: on July 6, 1955, and that the amount sued for then became due him under the contract and payment had been refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Defendants admitted the employment contract and the severance pay provision thereof and that the employment was terminated within the five year period, but denied breaching the contract and plead affirmatively that the contract became abrogated or terminated on January 14, 1955, when defendants and the United States District Director of Internal Revenue for Iowa, following the issuance of distraint warrant against defendants for delinquent taxes, entered into a certain Escrow Agreement, by which the supervision and control of the finances and operation of the Company\u2019s plant were vested in an Escrow Agent. The plaintiff was named as the Escrow Agent and signed the agreement as Escrow Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">Defendants alleged that the terms of the Escrow Agreement conflicted with and were inconsistent with the employment contract so that the employment contract became terminated, without any severance pay due the plaintiff, upon the execution of the agreement. The controversy was whether plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated at that time or on July 6, 1955. On the latter date the Escrow Agreement had been terminated by the Director and the taxpayers and Mr. Carver resumed control of the Company and ousted plaintiff from the Company premises, asserting that he had no contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">On the jury trial of the case, defendants moved for directed verdict at the close of all the evidence asserting that the evidence showed that the employment contract sued on had been superseded by the Escrow Agreement which terminated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">The court overruled the motion and submitted to the jury the question whether the employment contract had been abrogated or terminated on January 14, 1955, as claimed by defendants, or terminated by defendants on July 6, 1955, as claimed by plaintiff. The jury verdict was for the plaintiff against all defendants. Plaintiff had judgment thereon against all defendants for $18,000.00, interest and costs. Defendants\u2019 timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial was denied. The defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">They contend for reversal that the court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict made at the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>of all the evidence and their timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for new trial, because, as they claim, it was the inevitable effect of the Escrow Agreement to render the employment impossible of performance and the court should have determined from the text of the two contracts that it was the intention of the parties to abrogate the employment contract on January 14, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">It appears from the pleadings, pretrial and discovery proceedings and the evidence at the trial that defendants Roy Carver and his wife Lucille Carver had been associated in business at Muscatine, Iowa, manufacturing pumps and that the defendant, Carver Pump Company, succeeded to the business, Roy Carver owning fifty-one per cent and his wife, forty-nine per cent of the capital stock. All defendants had become indebted on account of unpaid Federal taxes assessed against them prior to August 28, 1955, the date on which the employment contract with the plaintiff was entered into. That contract provided that the Company would employ plaintiff for a period of five years as its General Manager at a salary of $2,000.00 per month (after he took up residence in Muscatine) so long as he continued to be employed by the Company. It also accorded plaintiff an option to buy stock in the Company and made detailed provision to preserve the relation of the stock to be sold him to the assets of the Company and the rights and privileges of other stockholders. The contract was executed in the name of the \"Carver Pump Company, by R. J. Carver, President\u201d and was signed by defendants, Roy Carver, Lucille Carver and by plaintiff, Robert Tanner.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The only obligations set forth in the contract which the plaintiff specifically undertook to perform were that he would \u201caccept the offices of Director, and Vice President and employment as General Manager for the term * * * stated and during such term will promote and manage the Company\u2019s business and will exclusively devote his full time and best efforts and abilities thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">After the plaintiff had served under the contract one year and four and one-half months and it still had three years, seven and one-half months to run and on January 14, 1955, the Escrow Agreement was entered into, and upon which the defendants rely to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. It followed upon long negotiation with the District Director of Internal Revenue for Iowa, concerning unpaid taxes assessed against all the defendants. The Director had caused warrant of distraint to be issued to enforce collection of the taxes and the agreement was entered into as declared in a \u201cWhereas\u201d recital \u201cin order to avoid the immediate necessity for seizure and sale of the business assets of the corporation\u201d' and because it was \u201cin the best interests-of the Government and of the Taxpayers-that the business of the corporation be continued.\u201d The agreement called for a mortgage to be given to the Government on the Company real and personal property other than inventory and the right and power to supervise and control the finances and operation of the Company was vested in the Escrow Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Defendant Roy Carver, the president of the Company, was to be retained and employed by the Escrow Agent to \u201cassist and advise\u201d at a salary of $2,000.00 per month. The Escrow Agent was to receive $2,000.00 a month out of the Company funds and was given the right to resign by giving 30 days written notice. The approval of the Director was required to incur expense out of the ordinary course of the business. Certain installments were to be paid on the taxes and also a proportion of the net profits. The agreement was terminable by consent of the Director and Taxpayers; or upon seizure by the Director; or by the Company\u2019s refusal to extend the period of the statute of limitations on request of the Director; or by payment of the taxes; or by resignation of the Escrow Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">In general the writing conformed to the conventional definition of an Escrow in that by the terms of it the defendants put the corporate assets under the control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of a third person in certain respects to be returned to them upon the performance of conditions but without any change of title. The Company remained the owner of its property. The plaintiff had no part in the negotiation of the Escrow Agreement. He was chosen to act as Escrow Agent on the recommendation of the taxpayers\u2019 attorney, who drafted the Escrow Agreement for \u201cthe purpose of eliminating the chance that someone else might be put into the position, necessitating payment of two salaries; one to the General Manager of the Company and one to the Escrow Agent.\u201d Defendant Roy Carver was in complete accord with the arrangement by which the Company\u2019s General Manager was selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">After the execution of the Escrow Agreement plaintiff remained General Manager, Vice President and Director of the Company and performed his work for the Company as he had been doing for the preceding sixteen months, since August 28, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">There was no change of duties on his part nor in the salary of $2,000.00 per month he received from the Company. He was not entitled to receive any compensation for the additional duties the Escrow imposed upon him. The Escrow Agreement was in existence a little less than six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Plaintiff worked in harmony with defendant Roy Carver for several months after the the execution of the Escrow Agreement. Thereafter, however, some disputes arose between them as to different proposals for the business. There was testimony that on one occasion plaintiff told certain employees not to accept orders from defendant Carver since \u201che [plaintiff] was supposed to be running the Company and could not do so with any degree of regularity and planning when [Mr. Carver] gave contrary orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendants take the position that although it was not expressly stated in the Escrow Agreement, it was the intention of the parties in executing the Escrow Agreement on January 15, 1955, to thereby terminate the five year employment contract which had been entered into in August of 1953. * * * The essential issue for your decision is as to whether or not the five year employment contract was terminated by the mutual intention of the parties on January 14, 1955, * * If you find it was the intention of the parties by the execution of the Escrow Agreement to terminate the five year employment contract, then there was no breach of that contract later on July 6, 1955, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">In the opinion and order accompanying denial of the motion notwithstanding the verdict, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">\u201c* * * at the very least a latent ambiguity was created by the two separate instruments which justified the submission to the jury of the extent to which the Escrow Agreement superceded or abrogated the entire Employment Contract or even its severance pay provision. For instance the Escrow Agreement did not by its express terms nor by necessary implication terminate the earlier employment contract. Had the parties intended a complete su-persedure it would have been a simple matter to so state in the Escrow Agreement. More over the plaintiff\u2019s status under his employment contract, as Vice President, General Manager and Director of the corporate defendant, continued into the escrow period until his discharge on July 6, 1955. Additionally, the two agreements were of different duration and scope and served different purposes. The ambiguity was properly resolved by the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">On this appeal the appellants make comparisons, paragraph by paragraph, between the employment contract and the Escrow Agreement and elaborate the contention that plaintiff\u2019s obligations under the Escrow Agreement were in conflict with and incompatible with his obligations under his employment contract; that the contracts could not subsist together; and that the employment con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tract was superseded by the later contract. We append the substance of both contracts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> omitting the details as to the option to purchase stock given in the employment contract. The comparisons and consideration of the extraneous evidence that was received without objection have not persuaded that the court erred in overruling defendants\u2019 motions. It appears that plaintiff was employed in the first place in full view of the liens of unpaid tax assessments then outstanding against the employers in favor of the Government and as General Manager of the Company he was never free to act in disregard of the Government\u2019s rights. The Escrow Agreement was entered into to preserve the status quo of ownership by the employers and to strengthen the lien of the Government and it accomplished those purposes. The plaintiff undertook some duties additional to his employment and acted as Escrow Agent at the instance of defendants without extra pay, but there was in fact no change of duties on his part. Defendants\u2019 claim of conflicts of the contracts rest on assumptions of conflicts of interest between the taxpayers and the Government. But there were none so far as the General Manager of the Company was concerned. He was obligated to \u201cexclusively devote his full time and best \u2022efforts and abilities to promote and manage the Company\u2019s business\u201d. The Company and the Government had the same common interest in having him fulfill that obligation. The first and fundamental provision of the Escrow Agreement was that, except as therein provided, the business of the Company should be carried on .and continued as in the usual course of business. That plainly meant that plaintiff should carry on as before as its \u25a0General Manager, which he did without \u2022encountering any conflict with his duty as Escrow Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The obligation of an Escrow Agent is by definition to exercise no discretion between the obligors and obligees in the escrow, but to follow strictly the terms of the agreement as it concerns them. No suggestion was ever made to plaintiff, when he undertook to act as Escrow Agent, that it would impair his employment contract and the district court was not required to conclude as a matter of law that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The court received the evidence extraneous to the contracts tending to throw light on the intention of the parties in respect to their adhering to or receding from the employment contract by entering into the Escrow Agreement. That agreement was a temporary expedient to avoid immediate necessity for seizure and as pointed out by the court, it did not contain express provisions defining the intentions of the parties in the situation that arose, or its termination by agreement between the taxpayers and the Director. We conclude that there was no prejudicial error to the defendants in submitting the issue to the jury. The appellants took no exception to the instructions by which the court submitted it to the jury and there is no injustice in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Appellants also contend that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury in respect to their claims, pleaded in their answer, that plaintiff was guilty of breaches of his employment duties and was discharged for justifiable causes. The record in respect to this contention shows that the accusations against the plaintiff were general charges of \u201cinability, incompetence and disloyalty\u201d. Plaintiff, in discovery proceedings, sought to learn the \u201cspecific conduct, act, omission or breach of condition\u201d relied upon by appellants as grounds for discharge for cause. Appellants\u2019 answer to these interrogatories stated in general terms that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s management of the enterprise was accompanied by continued loss for the period subsequent to his original employment, to-wit; August, 1953, down to and including January 14, 1955, * * * which [they] attributed to plaintiff\u2019s neglect, inefficiency and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>lack of skill\u201d. No charge of disloyalty was included among the general charges of incompetency and the trial court, in its memorandum and order, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">\u201cRule 33 [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.] expressly provides that answers to interrogatories may be used to the same extent as provided in Rule 26(d) for the use of the deposition of a party. Rule 26(d) (2) provides that answers made by an individual party or an officer or director of a corporation which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose. One purpose of Rule 33 is to narrow the issues and to enable the interrogating party to ascertain precisely what he will have to meet at the trial. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2nd Ed., Sec. 33.02, page 2259. The court is of the opinion that the defendants waived disloyalty as a cause for discharge by failing to mention it in their interrogatory answers. During the course of the trial, the defendants withdrew all issues as to discharge for cause prior to January 14, 1955, and withdrew entirely the issue of incompetency. The only ground for discharge which they urge upon the jury was disloyalty, but this they had waived or were estopped to assert. There was no cause for discharge issue to submit to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cyou are not to consider any issue as to discharge of the plaintiff for inability, for incompetence or for disloyalty. Those issues have been withdrawn from the case.\u201d The appellants took no exception to that instruction and they are in no position to have a review of it here. Rule 51, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., Chicago Great Western Ry. Co. v. Casura, 8 Cir., 234 F.2d 441, 445; Mill Owners Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Kelly, 8 Cir., 141 F.2d 763, 765. They could not acquiesce in the court\u2019s declaration and then ask this court to dispute it. They argue that they had requested an instruction on the issue and that the court\u2019s refusal of the request was reversible error. Their request was denied however and appellants made no objection. We have concluded in any event that there was no substantial evidence to support a charge of just cause for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Appellants Roy Carver and Lucille Carver contend that they should not have been held individually liable to the plaintiff on the judgment. They strongly urge that the contract reads that the Company employs plaintiff and the Company agrees to pay the severance amounts, but the contract contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">\u201cNow, Therefore, for and in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties hereto, which, in the case of the Principal Stockholders, are intended to impose joint and several obligations and to grant joint and several benefits, it is mutually covenanted and agreed as follows:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Roy and Lucille Carver signed the contract. Dealing with a wholly owned corporation the plaintiff undoubtedly wanted the owners obligated on the contract and on the trial of the case no point was raised that the liability of all defendants was not joint and several. No exception was taken to the form of verdict submitted to the jury. It included all defendants in a verdict if it was for plaintiff and as the trial court observed, \u201cNo instruction on this point was requested by the defendants nor did they ask the court to submit to the jury either a special verdict or written interrogatories; but the court, in any event, is of the opinion that under the employment contract the individual defendants were jointly and severally liable with the corporate defendant for the severance pay owing to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">We are not convinced that the judgment against the individual defendants is so clearly erroneous or unjust as to justify this Court in reversing on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Finding no error in the proceedings or judgment, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Afj\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The Employment Contract, in pertinent part, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cAgreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201cThis Agreement made this .... day of August, 1953, by and between Carver Pump Company, a Delaware corporation, herein called \u2018the Company,\u2019 Roy Carver and Lucille Carver, his wife, herein called \u2018the Principal Stockholders,\u2019 and Robert Tanner, herein Called \u2018Tanner,\u2019 Wit-nesseth: that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cWhereas, the Company and the Principal Stockholders are desirous that Tanner should accept employment by the Company, as Vice President and General Manager of the Company and Tanner is desirous of accepting such employment, all on the terms and conditions herein stated: and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201cWhereas, the Principal Stockholders are the owners of 1,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, which is all of the capital stock of the Company now issued and outstanding; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">\u201cWhereas, in connection with his employment by the Company, Tanner is desirous of presently acquiring four shares of its capital stock and the right to acquire during the term of his employment an additional 246 shares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">\u201cNow, Therefore, for and in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements of the parties hereto, which, in the case of the Principal Stockholders are intended to impose joint and several obligations and to grant joint and several benefits, it is mutually covenanted and agreed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">\u201c1.
