Beneath the escutcheon a small horizontal space is provided on each label wherein the contents of the can are described. What was actually shown to the Patent Office as an alleged trademark use was a white-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>paper sticker about <em>1% </em>x <em>2y2 </em>inches printed in blue ink and bearing a line drawing of a clown at the left adjacent printing on the right reading \u201cSee Nutsy the Clown on TV and in your grocery stores.\u201d This sticker was stuck on the can in such a position that one looking at it could not see the Circus label and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">One exhibit entitled \u201cCircus Foods Tells Why TV Gets Lion\u2019s Share of Advertising Dollar,\u201d from \u201cSales Management\u201d for August 1952, is most revealing .as to the entire situation. Circus Foods, under the guidance of its advertising agency, developed an extensive and integrated promotion scheme with a \u201ccircus theme.\u201d The can design was intended to tie in with it. Several TV programs were evolved, one of which was a children\u2019s show called \u201cPeanut Circus.\u201d Nutsy the Clown was one of the stars of this show, another Cashew, a monkey (apparently a real one). \u201cCircus nuts are mentioned every few moments in one way or another and the package is constantly in view.\u201d Twice the article refers to \u201c \u2018Peanuts,\u2019 the Circus elephant jumping through a hoop\u201d as being \u201cthe trademark.\u201d Local newspaper promotion of the \u201cPeanut Circus\u201d show featured Nutsy the Clown as a performer while avoiding direct mention of his sponsor and playing up his appearances at hospitals, orphanages, boys\u2019 clubs and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"> We are in agreement with the Patent Office tribunals that appellant has not shown a trademark use of the words and picture here sought to be registered on the goods named in its application. The so-called mark, as used, is nothing more than an advertisement of the television and personal appearances of the character known as \u201cNutsy the Clown.\u201d It is true that those appearances are made for the purpose of advertising appellant\u2019s products and that the public may, in a general way, associate the clown with those products. But that is not, in itself, sufficient to show a trademark use. In re Burgess Battery Co., 112 F.2d 820, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1297. There is nothing in the manner in which the \u201cmark\u201d is used to suggest that it is intended to indicate the origin of the product on which it appears, or to serve any other purpose than to direct attention to the appearances of Nutsy the Clown.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">As above indicated, the clown \u201cmark\u201d was added to labels which had previously been used and considered as complete and sufficiently indicating origin of the goods, without that added \u201cmark.\u201d Before that addition the product would obviously have been identified as to origin by the word \u201cCircus,\u201d and such identification evidently continued after the clown design was added to the containers, since there are a number of advertisements of record referring to appellant\u2019s products as \u201cCircus Nuts\u201d or \u201cCircus Peanuts,\u201d even when the advertisements also refer to the clown. There is nothing of record showing that the product itself has been designated by the word \u201cClown\u201d or \u201cNut-sy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Appellant relies on the decisions of the Assistant Commissioner in Salem Commodities v. Miami, 106 USPQ 411 and Ex parte L. M. Eddy Manufacturing Co., Inc., 111 USPQ 285. The former decision which was reversed by this court, Salem Commodities, Inc., v. Miami Margarine Co., 244 F.2d 729, 44 C.C.P.A., Patents, 932, involved the mark \u201cNu Maid\u201d and the use of advertising campaigns featuring a person representing \u201cMiss Nu Maid.\u201d The Assistant Commissioner held that these features created \u201ca single commercial impression.\u201d However, the issue in that case was confusing similarity, and not whether there had been use as a trademark. Moreover, there was no indication in that litigation that the mark on the involved goods had served the purpose of advertising appearances of \u201cMiss Nu Maid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">In the Eddy case it was held that the words \u201cMade by Sgt. Eddy\u201d appearing on a container constituted a trademark use of \u201cSgt. Eddy.\u201d Obviously, in that instance the words \u201cSgt. Eddy\u201d referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to the origin of the goods and not to a television or personal appearance. The Eddy case, therefore, is clearly distinguishable from the instant one.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">For the reasons given we hold that appellant has not shown a trademark use of the alleged mark here involved and that it was therefore properly refused a registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Assistant Commissioner also refused registration on the further ground that the evidence presented in Frank Herfort Canning Co., Inc. v. Circus Foods, Inc., 110 USPQ 498, and Circus Foods, Inc. v. Frank Herfort Canning Co., Inc., 110 USPQ 501, showed that appellant's only business was packing and selling nuts and accordingly that the representations made in the oath in the application involved in this appeal, indicating that appellant has used its alleged trademark on other goods, \u201care false.\u201d Since we are of the opinion that appellant has not shown a trademark use, it is unnecessary to pass upon the question whether the evidence hereinbefore described was properly considered in the instant case, or whether it supports the conclusion reached by the Assistant Commissioner. It may be noted, however* that it seems questionable that a mere discrepancy between the testimony in the cited case, and the oath in the instant application would, alone, constitute such falsity as would justify the refusal of registration without affording the applicant an opportunity to explain the inconsistency or to amend his application to. eliminate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">For the reasons given, the decision of the Assistant Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
