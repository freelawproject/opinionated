Rule 12(d) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-22\">The petition here shows upon its face that the District Court has not decided the question of its jurisdiction. A writ of prohibition founded upon absence of jurisdiction should not issue where the question is before the District Court and has not been decided. Talbot v. McCar-rey, 9 Cir., 1955, 218 F.2d 565, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">Mandamus and prohibition against judges are drastic and extraordinary remedies. Ordinarily their use will not be permitted as substitutes for an appeal.
