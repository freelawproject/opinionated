A declaratory judgment and injunctive relief were sought. The-District Court sustained the appellees and dismissed the complaint. Hawkins v. State Agriculture, etc. Committee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>D. C., 149 F.Supp. 681. From the order of dismissal an appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">We are not in agreement as to whether Congress has precluded a judicial review of acreage apportionment among counties. Cf. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1363-1367. We do, however, agree that the action of the appellees was within the power and discretion granted to them, that the procedural requirements were observed, and that no abuse of discretion was shown. Therefore the order of the District Court dismissing the complaint was properly entered and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
