Meanwhile the said sheriff had received a <em>copias </em>from the District Court of B. county for the arrest of W. to answer a different charge there pending, and without setting W. at large, arrested and detained him by virtue of the <em>copias </em>until the sheriff of B. county conveyed him to the jail of that county, and he subsequently escaped therefrom. At the next term of the District Court of L. county, to which the venue had been changed, W. failed to appear, and judgment <em>nisi </em>was entered against him and his sureties on the bond; and in defense to the <em>scire facias, </em>the sureties pleaded that the bond had never become operative or binding, because their principal had not been set at liberty or placed in their custody, but was continuously detained by the State until he made his escape. But <em>held, </em>that the plea sets up no defense. Inasmuch as the bail bond took effect from its delivery and acceptance, and W. was not thereafter detained by virtue of the <em>mittimus </em>from C. county, but by virtue of the <em>copias </em>from B. county, and inasmuch as he was not in custody at all when he forfeited his bond, his arrest and detention by virtue of the <em>copias </em>had no effect on the validity of the bond or the liability of the sureties. The case would be different if, notwithstanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>allowance of bail and acceptance of the bond, W. had been held in custody under the <em>mittimus </em>from O. county, or if, at the time the bond was forfeited, the State prevented his appearance by detaining him on any charge, or if the sureties had surrendered him, as they could have done notwithstanding his detention on the <em>copias.</em></syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">Error from the District Court of Liberty.

Edwin Hobby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">A clear statement of all the material facts of this important, interesting and well-contested case will be found in the opinion of the court. The case of which the present is an offshoot had its origin in the assassination of Green Butler, in Galveston county, May 19,1872. Andrew J. Walker, Amos Walker and Jeff. Black were jointly indicted for the murder, and, Amos Walker effecting his escape, the others were twice jointly tried and convicted in Galveston county; but, on their appeals to the Supreme Court, the convictions were set aside and new trials awarded. See 37 Texas, 366, and 42 Texas, 360. A change of venue was then had from Galveston to Chambers county, and there, in 1875, a severance was had, and Black was convicted. On his appeal to this court that conviction was set aside for reasons disclosed in 1 Texas Ct. App. 368. In 1878, Walker and Black applied to the Hon. H. C. Pedigo, district judge, for the privilege of bail, and from his order overruling their application they appealed to this court, and by its order Walker was admitted to bail in the sum of $15,000, and Black in the sum of $10,000. 3 Texas Ct. App. 668. E. E. Stafford and S. E. Allen, the plaintiffs in error in the present case, became sureties on the bond of Walker. By another change of venue, the case against Walker for the murder of Butler was removed from Chambers to Liberty county, and was pending in the latter county when Walker\u2019s bail bond was adjudged forfeited, and the proceedings ensued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>which resulted in the present appeal. Those proceedings are clearly disclosed in the opinion, and are therefore unnecessary here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">A motion for rehearing was pressed with great force, hut was overruled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>Willie &amp; Cleveland, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR\">When a bail bond is accepted and approved by the proper officer of the State, if the principal therein is not enlarged and set at liberty in pursuance of the bond, but is held in confinement in jail by such officer; or if, having been set at liberty in pursuance of such bail bond, whereby he is put into the custody of his sureties, they are thereafter deprived of the custody of the principal by the State acting through its proper officer, and by its authority the principal is arrested and held in jail, and he escapes therefrom, the bond, in either case, imposed no obligation on the makers, and is not subject to forfeiture for non-appearance of the principal.

And at the threshold of this question we are confronted with another, upon the correct solution of which will depend the answer to the one first stated, What is bail.? In the language of Chitty (1 Crim. Law, edition of 1836, p. 92), \u201cbail is a delivery or bailment of a person to his sureties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>upon their giving, together with himself, sufficient security for his appearance, he being supposed to continue in their friendly custody, instead of going to prison.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">Mr. Bishop, in his work on Criminal Procedure, sec. 248, gives this definition: \u201c The verb <em>to bail, </em>when applied to persons, is the delivery in legal form of one under arrest to another or others, who thereby become entitled to Ins custody, and, with him, responsible for his appearance in fulfillment of the purpose of the arrest. <em>The noun bail </em>may denote either the process of bailing, or the one or more persons who are thus made the custodians and sureties.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">Mr. Webster, in his Unabridged Dictionary, defines the <em>verb </em>to bail thus: \u201cTo set free, deliver or liberate from arrest and imprisonment, upon security given that the person bailed shall appear and answer in court.\u201d The <em>noun </em>bail, thus: \u201c The person or persons who procure the release of a prisoner from custody by becoming surety for his appearance in court.\u201d \u201cThe security given for the release of a prisoner from custody; as the man is out upon bail.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-8\">Prom these elementary definitions it results that when a bail bond is accepted and approved by the proper officer of the State, it is <em>in fieri, </em>ambulatory, and dependent for its legal effect upon a condition\u2014that of liberation by the State of the accused thereunder from imprisonment, to be performed by the voluntary act of the State, acting by its proper officer; and hence the provision in our Code of Criminal Procedure, which is to be construed according to the plain import of the language in which it is written. \u201cArt. 313. <em>In all cases, </em>when the accused <em>has given </em>the required bond, either to the magistrate or officer having him in custody, <em>he shall at once be set at liberty.\u201d </em>The signing of the bond in proper form, in proper amount, by the principal with proper sureties, are all acts to be performed upon the part of the obligors, and must neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>sarily precede the giving of the bond to the officer that he may judge of its sufficiency in these respects, and approve <em>before </em>the act of liberation, which is <em>the condition </em>which the law fixes upon the obligee, to be performed by the officer having the principal in his custody, and on which depends its validity, its force in law as an executed instrument. This condition\u2014the requirement of art. 313, before cited \u2014-complied with, then, and hot till then, it becomes an <em>executed </em>contract, binding and operative in law, according to its terms, upon the principal and sureties. The liberation from imprisonment by the officer acting for the State is what gives it vitality, because that is <em>the </em>consideration which must move <em>voluntarily </em>from the obligee, and which alone supports the bond as a contract valid in law. Without this, the bond is <em>nudum pactum </em>\u2014 though good in form, it lacks the substance \u2014 a consideration moving to the principal, to support it and make it a binding contract between the State and the \u2022obligors. As between the parties, there is no such thing as <em>contract </em>without a consideration, either good or valuable in law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-4\">In this case the <em>law </em>fixes the consideration\u2014not in money\u2014but what is even more <em>valuable in law </em>as well \u2022as fact\u2014liberty. And this liberty must be bestowed by the obligee, willingly by its own act, so that the accused when \u201cset at liberty \u201d shall not be a <em>fugitive </em>from the accusation made against him, but thereby put from the \u25a0prison cell into the \u201cfriendly custody\u201d of his sureties, whose custody is a continuation of the original imprisonment, and thus conferring upon them who become his jailors the same right of control over his person which before was exercised by the sheriff. Without this custody, which may be constructively given to the sureties by the voluntary act of the officer in setting the <em>accused at liberty </em>(for then they may actually take his person), the bond has not performed its function. Without this is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>done, the anomaly exists, if the bond is upheld, that a legal obligation may be created without consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">Chief Justice Savage, in delivering the opinion in the case of the <em>People </em>v. <em>Stager, </em>10 Wendell (N. Y.), 43, uses this language: \u201cOne object of the recognizance is to obtain the enlargement of the prisoner, <em>and if after the recognizance </em>is entered into, he should not be set at liberty, the recognizance ought not to be forfeited.\u201d This \u201csetting of the prisoner free \u201d by the willing act of the State, is of the substance\u2014the very essence of the bond\u2014its only legal support; its consideration; impeached by the pleas of the appellants under oath, and by the proof sustained. Can there be a bail bond or any other kind of bond, without a consideration <em>a quid, pro quo f </em>Can a case be found or an instance cited?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">This bail bond must be read in the light of art. 313 of the Code of Procedure, and interpreted by it. The liberation of the principal under it would not have been more incumbent upon the State, if it had been so expressly \u201cnominated in the bond\u201d as a <em>condition to its operation, </em>than it was made so by the express provision of the law as enacted in the Code; which furnished the <em>rule of action </em>for the officer who took the bail bond, viz.: \u201cIn all cases where the accused <em>has given </em>the required bond, either to the magistrate or officer, he shall at once set him at liberty.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">Ro matter whether the use which was made of the <em>copias </em>was rightful or wrongful, the stubborn fact remains that it did prevent the liberation of Walker from jail. The effect of the second arrest, and retention of Walker in Galveston jail, and his removal therefrom as a prisoner to Brazos county, and confinement in the county jail thereof (as is said by the court in the case of <em>Medlin et al. </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>11 Bush (Ky.), 606), \u201cwas to take from the appellants the right and power to exercise that supervision and control over his actions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>movements that they were entitled by law <em>to </em>have and exercise. It is not necessary to inquire whether the second arrest was or was not authorized by law. It is sufficient that the commonwealth, through its judicial and ministerial officers, disregarded the rights secured to King (Walker) and his sureties by the execution of the bail bond, and that <em>it </em>undertook to <em>hold the accused in custody. </em>Failing in this undertaking, it seems to us clear that it cannot now hold appellants <em>responsible for that </em>failureAnd to the same effect is the case of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>14 B. Monroe, 361.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-4\">Justice Beeves, in delivering the opinion in the case of <em>Peacock v. The State, </em>44 Texas, 13, said: \u201c So long as Miller (the accused) was left in the custody of his bail, or was under their control, they were bound for his appearance and liable for the penalty of the bond for his non-appear-once, according to the requirements of the bond. Any act done by the State or its officers under lawful authority that would <em>deprive </em>the securities of <em>control </em>over their <em>principal </em>would change their relation to the State, and would thereby release the securities of their obligation.\u201d If- this be true in a case where the sureties <em>had been </em>invested with the custody of the principal by virtue of their bond, and afterward were deprived by the State of that custody, how much more in a case where they had not been so invested with Ms custody by the State at anytime. Again'says Justice Beeves: \u201cThe issuance of the <em>copias </em>for the arrest of Miller (their principal) were acts <em>inconsistent </em>with any right in the bail to the <em>custody </em>of Miller, and when he was arrested and taken by the sheriff, the <em>authority </em>of the bail over him was at an end.\u201d To the same effect, in principle, is the case of <em>Cooper v. The State, </em>5 Texas Ct. App., M which Presiding Judge Ector quotes approvingly the case of <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>The State. </em>And be it here said that in both of these cases the sureties had been in the first instance invested with the custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>and control of their principal, who was, when the bail bond was given, \u2018i set at liberty, \u201d but afterward they were <em>deprived </em>by <em>second arrest </em>of that custody, and the fact of such deprivation, or the legal consequences flowing from it, is not made by the court, in either case quoted, <em>to depend </em>upon the circumstance that it was for the <em>same </em>or a <em>different </em>offense, nor could it be on principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">But, assuming for argument\u2019s sake, that the act of the State, by its agents, in causing the issuance of the <em>copias </em>from Brazos county and its lodgment with the sheriff of Galveston county would excuse in law, or render impossible, the performance of the condition on her part, to \u201c set the accused at liberty,\u201d upon what principle- of law or ethics can the State claim the forfeiture of a bond which was given, having for its object the performance of the act which by her own voluntary conduct she had made it impossible or illegal for the officer to do?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">It is an elementary principle of law that, where the performance of the condition upon which the obligation of a bond depends has been rendered impossible by the law or the obligee, such obligee can claim <em>no benefit </em>under it. Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, title \u201cCondition.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">In the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taintor, </em>16 Wallace, 370, the court held \u201cthat if the impossibility of liberating the accused be created by the State, then, <em>ipso facto, </em>any bond given will be <em>nudum pactum, </em>and of no binding force.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-9\">Did Walker escape from the State? Or, did he escape from his sureties? The State had him, and refused to deliver him to liberty or to his sureties, but retained him at all times till he got out of her jail, where she had confined him for safe-keeping, and whose officer alone was charged with the duty and responsibility of keeping him. Art. 280, Code Crim. Proc.: \u201cIt is the duty of every sheriff to keep safely a person committed to his custody.\u201d Are these appellants to be chargeable with the fault or negligence of the jailer of the State, or the insecurity, it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>be, of the locks or bolts, or walls of its prison? The obligation which they proposed to the State to take upon themselves by their bond was not that, but it was that, if he were set at liberty by the voluntary act of the State, and thus placed in their custody instead of that of the State\u2019s jailers, they would, in a penalty of $15,000, be bound for his appearance \u25a0 to answer to that accusation; and who will say that the principal would not so have done if the only boon which such bond could have conferred upon him had been bestowed\u2014that of freedom? If liberated, they were willing to trust his honor for that. But more than that, if they had doubted him at any time, as was said by Justice Swayne in the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taintor, </em>16 Wallace, 371, <em>they </em>would have \u201chad the right to seize him and deliver him up in their discharge; or, if that could not be done at once, <em>they </em>might imprison him until it could be done. If necessary, they might break and enter his house without process, for they would need none. This right is likened to the arrest by the sheriff of an escaping prisoner.\u201d Or, as was said by Justice Dillon in the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Fossen et al. </em>1 Dillon, 410, a case in which, upon the recognizance being taken, the principal was set at liberty, \u201cthe principal was delivered into, what Blackstone calls, \u2018the friendly custody \u2019 of his sureties, instead of being committed to prison. 4 Blackstone\u2019s Com. 301. They thenceforth became invested with full authority <em>over his person. </em>They might take him at <em>any time </em>or <em>place </em>in the State, or beyond. <em>They are </em>his jailers; or, as Justice Wheeler puts it in <em>Gay </em>v. <em>The State, </em>20 Texas, 507, they are his <em>\u2018manucaptors, </em>being his jailers, and he, constantly, in a state of commitment,\u2019 not to the county jail, but, as Blackstone says, to \u2018their friendly custody.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-4\">In every case cited by counsel for appellee, and we have examined all, the accused was set at- liberty upon the giving of the bond. No case has been cited, nor can be, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>support the doctrine that, upon the giving of a bail bond and its acceptance and approval by the officer, it becomes operative, and that, to give it effect, it is not necessary that the principal should be liberated at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">\u201cThe object of a recognizance is not to enrich the treasury (as was said by that great jurist, Chief Justice Marshall, in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Feely, </em>1 Brock. 255), but to coinbine the administration of criminal justice with the convenience of a person accused, but not found guilty.\u201d When guided by such a light, the judicial conscience cannot materially err.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-7\">These appellants are blameless, and if Andrew Walker was not content \u201cto he in cold obstruction and to rot \u201d in jail, from which the $15,000 bond of these appellants could not extricate him, then let him who would not have done: likewise cast a stone at him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-8\"><em>Thomas Ball, </em>Assistant Attorney General, <em>M.

Walker was indicted in Galveston county for the murder of Green Butler, at the May term, 1872, of the Criminal District Court of the county of Galveston. The case was transferred, first to the District Court of Chambers, and from that court to the District Court of Liberty county. While the cause was pending in the District Court of Chambers county, Walker applied for bail, and it being denied, he applied to the Court of Appeals, and, upon the hearing, tins court reversed the judgment of the district judge, and granted him bail in the sum of $15,000. On the seventh day of September, 1878, the District Court of Chambers county ordered that the said Walker be committed, for safe keeping, into the custody of 0. Jordan, sheriff of Galveston comity, which was accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Walker being in the custody of the sheriff of Galveston county, the mandate of the Court of Appeals was 'directed to him; and by tins mandate he was required, \u201cupon the presentation of a good and sufficient bail bond in the sum of 815,000, with good security, conditioned as the law requires, for the appearance of the said Andrew J. Walker at the proper court to answer the charge preferred against him by indictment for murder, to release the said Walker from custody.\u201d He (Jordan) was further instructed to be satisfied with the solvency and sufficiency of said bond, and to indorse his approval thereof thereon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and transmit it to the clerk of the District Court of Chambers county, to be there filed in the papers of the case, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The said Andrew J. Walker presented to Jordan a bond with the appellants as his sureties in the amount and in proper form; which was accepted, approved and forwarded to the clerk of the District Court of Chambers county, and by him filed with the papers in the case. Walker was in jail at the time the bond was accepted and approved by the sheriff, Jordan, and was not liberated in fact by him, for the reason that the sheriff, Jordan, had in his possession a <em>copias </em>for the arrest of Walker upon a charge of murder in Brazos county. Having accepted and approved the bond in this case, to wit: <em>The State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>charged with the murder of Green Butler, he, while Walker was yet in his custody, arrested him upon the <em>copias </em>from Brazos. The bond in the Butler case was delivered to the sheriff on the 14th day of November, 1818. The sheriff held Walker in his custody, in the jail at Galveston, until he was turned over to the sheriff of Brazos county, which occurred on the same day, to wit: the 14th day of November, 1818. From thence he was taken by the sheriff of Brazos, and placed in the jail of that county; from which he made his escape on the 11th day of May, 1819.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At the September term, 1819, of the District Court of Liberty county, the case of <em>The State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>charged with the murder of Green Butler, was regularly reached and called for trial. Walker not appearing, a judgment <em>nisi </em>was rendered against him and his sureties on the bond, for the amount of the penalty of the bond. At the March term, 1880, the appellants, Stafford and Allen, appeared, and for answer to the <em>scire facias </em>pleaded in substance and effect: \u201cThat the bond was inoperative and not binding, because the principal therein, Walker, had not been released thereunder from custody; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>that he had never been enlarged or set at liberty, nor placed in the custody of his sureties by virtue of said bond; that at the time of its delivery to, and approval by, the sheriff, he was held, and thereafter was continuously held in custody-\u2014\u2022 confined in jail\u2014and while so held by the State of Texas, acting by its proper officers, on the 11th day of May, 1819, he broke jail and made his escape; for which the appellants were not hable.\u201d At the September term, 1880, the District Court, upon the law and facts, gave judgment final against the appellants and overruled a motion for a new trial; from which judgment the appellants prosecute their writ of error to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">If the answer of appellants presented a good and valid defense to the action, the evidence fully sustaining the same, there was\" error in the court below in rendering judgment for the State. The learned counsel for appellants, in order to demonstrate the error of the court, formulates the issue into this proposition: \u2018e When a bail bond is accepted and approved by the proper officer of the State, if the principal therein is not <em>enlarged </em>and set at liberty in pursuance of the bond, but is held in confinement in jail by such officer,, or if, having been set at liberty in pursuance of such bail bond, whereby he is put into the custody of his sureties, they are thereafter deprived of the custody of the principal by the State, acting through its proper officers, and he escapes therefrom, the bond, in either case, imposes no obligation on the makers, and is not subject to forfeiture for non-appearance of the principal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">This is a very ingenious and plausible proposition. It stands, apparently, remarkably near the proposition made by the facts in this case; but upon a closer view it will be seen that there \"is quite a space between them. This proposition approaches very nearly the correct legal proposition. If in the first paragraph it had contained or alleged the fact that the principal was held <em>by virtue </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>copias </em>or <em>mittimus </em>under the <em>same charge, </em>or if it had , stated in the second clause that the principal was held by the State <em>at the time </em>of the forfeiture, we would not be disposed to question the conclusion that the liability of the sureties was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In this case, however, neither of these facts enter into its make-up. The bond was taken, approved and sent to the clerk of the proper court by the sheriff; and he states that he held the principal, not by virtue of the <em>mittimus, </em>but the <em>copias </em>from Brazos. At the time of the forfeiture the principal was not held by the State at all; he was perfectly free, and there was no obstacle in the way of his appearance, from any cause whatever. If the principal had been held in custody by virtue of the <em>mittimus </em>from Chambers county, or if released and arrested again on the <em>same charge </em>by the State or its authority, these acts would be inconsistent with and a repudiation of the bond. Again, if, at the time of the forfeiture, the principal was in the , custody of the State upon the same or any other charge, these facts would constitute a good answer to that forfeiture <em>thus </em>taken while the principal was <em>held by the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Counsel for appellant in argument concede that if there had been but a moment of actual liberty given to the principal before the second arrest, the sureties\u2019 liability would have attached. Upon what principle? One of consideration? Suppose the State had held the principal to within a day of the trial\u2014say six months \u2014 and discharged him from custody, if this is a question of consideration, should there not have been an apportionment ? The learned counsel for appellant concede in argument that the bond would have been operative if the principal had been liberated for the shortest space of time, though he were again arrested and deprived of his liberty by the State, on another charge, up to the time of his escape. If, then, the State could have legally, without discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of sureties, arrested the principal upon another charge, immediately after their liberating him, the principle must be nice indeed which operates a denial of the State the right to arrest without first liberating the principal. This distinction is so nice that to give it effect there should be a clear and satisfactory reason. The denial of this principle operates not the slightest injury to principal or sureties. The bond was accepted and approved by the proper officer, after having been presented for that purpose, or with the intention that it should be accepted by the officer; and, if the sureties were not willing for it to operate and be in force, they had the right to surrender their principal, though in custody, at any time <em>before the forfeiture.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Let us view this question from another standpoint. The position assumed by appellants is, that, as their principal was arrested by the officer before actual liberty was given under the bond, and the principal escaped, therefore they are not hable. JSTow suppose the second arrest had been made upon a charge of gaming, and an escape had occurred ? If correct, the principle contended for would apply; and the sureties in a murder case, when the principal was held in fact for the misdemeanor, would be released. If the escape was through the negligence of the officer, would he, under the Penal Code, be answerable for an escape in the felony or the misdemeanor ? The facts and circumstances attending the execution of this bond were calculated to lead to the belief that, as far as regards the Green Butler case, the execution of the bond was full and complete; hence the officer would not be held to that degree of care in the custody of Walker, in case of arrest for misdemeanor, as if no bond had been given. We therefore conclude that when the bond was presented by appellants to the sheriff, and accepted, approved and forwarded to the clerk of the proper District Court, it became operative, with full and complete bind<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ing effect, upon the sureties. Nor was it necessary, to give it effect, that the principal should have been liberated at all. All that was required to give it force and effect was, that the minds of the parties met on and agreed to its presentation to, and acceptance by, the officer, and that it <em>was </em>so presented to and accepted by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Having been thus presented and accepted, to release the sureties of liability the State must re-arrest the principal upon the same charge, thereby repudiating the bond,\u2014 the contract,\u2014 or the State must have the custody of the principal upon the same or any other charge, at the <em>time </em>the forfeiture was taken, or so near thereto as to prevent the attendance of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In this case it is not possible to perceive in what manner the State contributed to the failure to attend by the principal. At the time of the forfeiture their principal was at large with perfect freedom to attend and answer the charge, as he was required by his bond. Being at liberty to attend the trial, we are at a loss to understand how the failure to give him actual freedom could have the slightest tendency to prevent his attending.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We have examined with care and great interest the <em>very </em>able briefs of the appellant and the State, and in these will be found a clear and concise statement of the question at issue, with all the authorities that we have been able to find, after a most thorough investigation. These briefs contain such a clear presentation of the point in issue that we suggest that the student of law will derive more satisfaction and information from them than by reading this opinion. After having given the record a most careful examination, we can find no error for which the judgment should be reversed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
