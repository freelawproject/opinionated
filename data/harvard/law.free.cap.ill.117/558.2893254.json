On bill by the cestuis que trust against the trustees, seeking relief, all the trustees should be made parties, in order that, as each co-trustee is liable, complete justice may be done by adjusting the liabilities of the co-trustees, and thus obviate the necessity of ulterior proceedings and a multiplicity of suits.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-6\" pgmap=\"558\">2. There are exceptions to this rule, however, as, when one of the trustees has declined the office, or been discharged, he need not be made a party, and when the breach of trust is in the nature of a tort, for which there can be no contribution between the defaulting trustees, they need not be joined as .defendants in a bill for the breach.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-7\" pgmap=\"558\">3.

Afterward, on complainant\u2019s motion, the bill was dismissed as to the other trustee, without prejudice, and an appeal taken from the first order of dismissal: Held, that the defendant as to whom the court dismissed the bill for want of equity, might raise the objection of the want of necessary parties, on the appeal, he having had no opportunity for doing so before.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-8\" pgmap=\"558\">i.

Ayres, Maria Hutchinson and John V. Thomas, in the circuit court of Cook county, in which it is alleged that the complainants are the children and heirs at law and legatees of John P. Hutchinson, deceased, late of Dixon, in Lee county; that said John P. Hutchinson died about December 30,1872, and left a last will, which was duly probated in the county court of Lee county, January 2,1873; that orators are the beneficiaries in said will mentioned; that in his said will said Hutchinson bequeathed to each of his children the sum of $10,000, which defendants Maria Hutchinson and Jason C. Ayres, the trustees and executors therein named, were directed, as soon as each of orators should attain the age of eighteen years, to take out of the principal of his estate, and to hold for said orators; that the interest and income of said $10,000 should be paid to orators till they respectively attained the age of twenty-six years, when the principal should be delivered to them, and all the residue of said estate of the testator was devised to defendant Maria Hutchinson, for the .period of her life, the income and proceeds to be enjoyed by her during life, without waste or encroachment, however, on the principal, and upon her death the whole estate should be divided among orators, his children, in equal portions; that defendants Ayres and Hutchinson accepted the trusts imposed upon them by said will, and duly qualified as executors of said will, and letters testamentary were issued to them; that defendants reduced the personal estate to possession, and collected the income of realty and took charge of the estate; that Ayres acted as sole manager, and assumed control of the estate; that said Maria Hutchinson had but little knowledge of affairs, and trusted everything to said Ayres; that the inventory filed by said executors of the assets of said estate showed that they had-in their hands property to the value of about $58,000; that the entire debts of the estate amounted to only $800; that all of orators have long since attained the age of eighteen years, and are still under the age of twenty-six years, yet no sum has been set apart for them and no interest paid to them; avers that defendants have wasted and squandered the estate, so that only about $30,000 remains of the same, and that the great bulk of said estate was in good interest bearing securities; that although the will provides that no encroachment should be made on the principal of said estate, yet they have permitted over one-half of said estate to be wasted and spent; avers that certain accounts were, from time to time, presented by the executors to the county court of Lee county, and approved, but such accounts were approved without notice to them, and are not binding Vipon them, and that said accounts are not true and just accounts, but are incomplete, false and untrue; that said accounts credit said executors with moneys spent by defendant Maria Hutchinson out of her private estate, and with money paid out by her for her private use; that although the will provides that said Maria Hutchinson should only spend the income of said estate, yet said Ayres paid her large sums of money for her own use, when there was in fact no money applicable to the individual use of said Maria; that on October 6, 1876, Ayres presented his resignation as executor, and pretended to resign the trusts imposed upon him by said will, and his resignation as executor was accepted, but not as trustee; that thereupon said Maria Hutchinson became sole executrix, but orators aver that all the duties of said defendants as executors had been fulfilled and all the debts paid, and they held the estate as trustees, and the resignation of Ayres was void and of no effect; that on July 11,1877, said Ayres, who was a surety on the bond of Maria Hutchinson, well knowing that the estate was being wasted and squandered, withdrew from the bond of said Maria, and she was removed as executrix, and John V. Thomas was appointed by the county court administrator de bonis non of said estate; but they charge that the appointment of said Thomas was null and void, as there were no duties for said executor to perform, and the trustees having accepted, could only be relieved from duty in a court of equity; .that Thomas now has possession of the remainder of the estate; that said defendants Ayres and Thomas refuse to come to a just accounting with orators, but set up the approval of the accounts by the county court as an estopp\u00e9l on orators, but orators say that even if such accounts were final, orators were all minors when said accounts were approved, and could not be estopped; that by reason of the approval of the accounts of said executors and said administrator de bonis non, orators can not bring them to an account in the county court, and are without remedy, save in a court of equity, therefore pray that defendants may be summoned and to account, and that an accounting may.be had under the direction of a court of equity, and that Thomas may be decreed to pay to orators all the funds in his hands.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\" pgmap=\"561\">Summons was issued to the sheriff of Cook county, and served by him on the defendant Maria N. Hutchinson, and an alias summons was issued to the sheriff of Lee county, and served on the defendants Ayers and Thomas. Ayres answered, admitting that he was appointed executor jointly with Maria 1ST. Hutchinson, and that he qualified as such executor, and that he subsequently resigned as executor, but denying that he ever accepted the position .of trustee. He alleged that the bulk of the estate never was in his hands, and denied all the other material allegations of the bill. Answer was filed by Thomas, putting in issue the allegations of the bill as to him.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\" pgmap=\"561(21) 562(151)\">The court, on hearing, decreed that the bill of complainants be dismissed as to the defendant Ayres, for want of equity, and the defendant Maria N. Hutchinson was declared guilty of waste, and the cause was referred to the master in chancery to state an account as to her, and thereupon the complainants prayed an appeal to the Appellate Court for the First District. .And afterwards, on complainants\u2019 motion, it was ordered that the bill of complaint be dismissed as to John Y. Thomas and Maria N. Hutchinson, without prejudice, however, as to any suit at law complainants might be advised to bring, and vacated the decree theretofore entered as to Maria N. Hutchinson. At a subsequent day, a stipulation was entered into between counsel for the complainants and counsel for Maria N.

The co-trustees ought to be made parties, (although the equities between themselves can not be adjusted,) for the reason that the decree of relief to the cestuis que trust is the foundation of the relief to the co-trustees inter sese) and if any of the trustees are not parties to the first suit by the cestuis que trust, they will not be bound by the decree, and the whole subject matter will, of course, come under litigation for the second time.\u201d There are exceptions to this rule, as, where one of the trustees has disclaimed the office, or has been discharged, he may not be made a party; and so where a breach of trust is in the nature of a tort, for which there could be no contribution as between the defaulting trustees, they need not all be joined as defendants in a bill for the breach. (Ibid.) But none of the exceptions are pertinent here. Hill on Trustees, 813, *521..</p> <p id=\"b566-5\" pgmap=\"566\">Perry v. Knott, 4 Beav. 179, is almost \"identical with the present case, except that the question of the want of proper parties was there raised by plea, while here, by the action of' the complainants in first including all the parties, and then, after the hearing, dismissing as.to Mrs. Hutchinson, -the defendant has had no opportunity, until now, to. raise that question. The remarks of the Master of the Bolls there, in regard to the complainant and Mrs. Howell, are strictly applicable to the complainants and Mrs. Hutchinson here. He said, among other things: \u201cOne can not help seeing that in this case the child of Mrs. Howell, who, most probably, had the benefit of the breach of trust,, is, by this suit, seeking to call upon the co-trustees of Mrs. Howell, alone, for payment of the money, without giving them the opportunity of . recovering the amount from her estate, which received it. This does not appear to me to be just or equitable, and certainly is not in conformity with the decision of this court.\u201d See, also, Rooke v. Kensington, 39 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 76; Barbour on Parties, (2d ed.) 740, *530.</p> <p id=\"b567-4\" pgmap=\"567\">Mrs. Hutchinson being a necessary party, no appeal or writ of error lies upon the decree until there is a final decree as to her. International Bank v. Jenkins, 109 Ill. 219; Thompson v. Follansbee, 55 id. 427.</p> <p id=\"b567-5\" pgmap=\"567\">The case is not analogous to those wherein it has been held that a party may, by a voluntary dismisssal, cause a preliminary and interlocutory decision to become final. In those eases the bill seeks both temporary and permanent relief, and where the prayer for permanent relief is abandoned, the decree on the prayer for temporary relief becomes final. In such cases the decree in the prayer for temporary relief is precisely the same that it would be in the prayer for permanent relief; but here the order dismissing, on the complainants\u2019 motion, as to Mrs. Hutchinson, is, in its effect, directly the reverse of the effect of that indicated by the court in the interlocutory decree rendered before the dismissal. No final decree on the merits of the case is rendered against him, nor can there be, so long as this order remains in force, whatever may be the equitable rights between the parties. If it should be that, in the judgment of this court, Ayres is liable on account of the default of Mrs. Hutchinson, as the record now stands she will not be concluded by that opinion, and consequently will -not be concluded by any decree rendered pursuant thereto. Ayres can not be deprived in this way of the righkof insisting that his co-'trastee shall be a party with him, and concluded, as well as himself, by any decree that may be rendered in the case.</p> <p id=\"b567-6\" pgmap=\"567\">Inasmuch as no final decree has been rendered in the ease, the appeal to the Appellate Court was premature.</p> <p id=\"b567-7\" pgmap=\"567\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b567-8\" pgmap=\"567\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
