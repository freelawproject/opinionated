T. Baldwin, cashier of Manhattan Company Bank, for $8500, and in favor of Charles Glanz, for $1577.50, on notes dated November 28,1884, but which complainants charge were made November 29, 1884, and ante-dated; that said suits were commenced and judgments entered against Emanuel -and Nathan Kramer alone, when in truth' and in fact Samuel Loebstein. was at that time a member of said firm; that executions immediately issued upon said pretended judgments against the property of Emanuel and Nathan Kramer, and were on the evening of said 29th day of November, 1884, levied by the sheriff upon the stock of goods and merchandise, safe, office furniture; etc., of said firm of Kramer Bros. &amp; Co., of which firm Samuel Loebstein was then a member, and that the sheriff had advertised to sell the same December 11,1884, at eleven o\u2019clock A. M., to satisfy said executions; that said judgments were entered in the afternoon of the last day of the November term of the Superior Court, and execution given to the sheriff after court adjourned for the term; that the said banks have collateral security for their debts, to which complainants can not resort; that there is in the hands of the sheriff $40,000 to $50,000 wrorth of property of said -firm, which in equity should be applied to the payment of the partnership debts; that if the sheriff is allowed to sell the same under the said executions, the partnership property will be exhausted to satisfy the pretended individual debts of Emanuel and Nathan Kramer; that on December 1,1884, Samuel Boebstein pretended to sell his store in Beecher, Illinois, to one \u25a0 S. Myer, and also pretended to assign three mortgages owned by him and give a trust deed on another piece of real estate, thus attempting to place all his individual property beyond the reach of creditors; that defendant firm has no other property save said property levied upon by the sheriff, and complainants know of none owned by the members except the\" above mentioned property of Boebstein; that by reason of said fraudulent transactions complainants are in imminent danger of losing their demands, unless the sheriff be enjoined from proceeding with said sale, and said property be turned over to a receiver to protect the same for the benefit of the creditors of said firm; that if the sheriff is allowed to sell said stock, the same will he sacrificed, and sold at a great loss; that the debts of said firm largely exceed their .assets; that complainants would not have sold said goods to said firm but for their false and fraudulent representations, which at the time complainants believed; that said defendants knew.them to be false, and made them for the purpose of defrauding, and never intended to pay for said goods; that complainants had no knowledge of the fraud practiced upon them until the said pretended judgments were entered, executions issued, and the sheriff had made his levy, and that they file this bill on behalf of themselves and all other creditors of said firm; bill prays for an injunction, and receiver to take charge of all assets of said firm, and collect its debts for the benefit of the creditors of said firm; that the contracts made between said firm and complainants he declared void for fraud, and complainants be allowed to recover the value of their goods; that an accounting be had between said firm and all its creditors, and that the partnership property be first subjected to the payment of the partnership debts ; that said judgments against Emanuel and Nathan Kramer be postponed until after the partnership debts are paid, and that the conveyances made by Samuel Loebstein may be declared fraudulent and void as to creditors, and be set aside, etc. A preliminary injunction was granted, which, upon a hearing, the court, on motion, dissolved.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\" pgmap=\"180\">The defendants demurred to the bill for want of equity.

Bryant, 4 Scam. 97, cited by counsel for appellants, a bill to rescind a contract of sale and restore the property obtained under it. Under the facts alleged here, the property could not be restored, and the primary object of the bill is simply to recover a debt, first cancelling the contract of sale for fraud, and then obtaining a decree for the payment of the value of the goods. It is not contended that this could not be done at law, and it is clear that if the contract of sale was fraudulent, an action at law would lie for the value of the goods, and the fraudulent contract could not- be interposed to bar a recovery. Nor is it sought to restrain the disposition of property until there can be a trial at law. Not a single ground for .purely, equitable, as distinguishable from legal, cognizance, is perceived. The effect of maintaining the bill would be to deprive the defendants of a jury trial on a question'where, by the rules of the common law, they are entitled to such trial. The rule has been often repeated in this court, that a party can have no standing in a court of equity who has a plain and adequate remedy or \u25a0defence at law. Puterbaugh v. Elliott, 22 Ill. 157; Coughron v. Swift, 18 id. 414; City of Peoria v. Kidder, 26 id. 351; Bigelow v. Andress, 31 id. 322; Long v. Barker, 85 id. 431.</p> <p id=\"b182-10\" pgmap=\"182(21) 183(329)\">Nor is there anything in the situation of the assets of Kramer Bros, justifying a resort to equity before a judgment at law is- obtained. This is conclusively settled by Shufeldt v. Boehm, 96 Ill. 560, and Dormaeil et al. v. Ward et al. 108 id. 216, and cases therein recited. In the last named case, as in this, no judgment at law had been obtained. Numerous fraudulent acts were charged in the bill, and we said: \u201cIf a bill of this kind can be maintained at all on the ground that the debtor has been guilty of fraud, and is seeking to defeat the collection of an honest debt by covering up his property, or placing it beyond the reach- of his creditors with a fraudulent intent, enough is clearly shown to maintain this bill. * * * But it is clear, unless we' are prepared to overrule a long line of decisions extending back almost to the time of the organization of this court, a bill of this character can not be maintained upon the ground suggested, and this, of course, we can not consistently do, in face of the fact the rule adopted by this court is supported by the decided weight of authority. As was said in a recent ease, this is no longer an open question.\u201d It was contended that the facts brought that case within the recognized exceptions to the general rule, and in reply to that it was said: \u201cThese so-called exceptions, when properly understood, are rather nominal than real, for a bill of this character will not lie in any case where the claim, as it is here, is purely legal. In all cases where such a bill has been maintained, the claim of the complainant has had some i equitable element in it,\u2014such as a trust, or the like. But in the absence of some element \u201cof this character there is a want of jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the ease at all, and it is upon this fundamental doctrine the rule controlling this class of eases rests.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b183-7\" pgmap=\"183(67) 184(54)\">But counsel contend this bill may be maintained as a bill for the administration of the assets of an insolvent firm. But to enable the complainants to maintain a bill of this character, they must, in the first place, acquire an equitable lien by exhausting their legal remedy, or in some other way. A creditor at large has no standing in court upon such a question. (Crippen v. Hudson, 13 N. Y. 161.) And in Goembel v. Arnett et al. 100 Ill. 42, we held that a creditor of a firm, who had not obtained a judgment at law, could not maintain a bill in equity to set aside a sale on the ground of a fraudulent preference.</p> <p id=\"b184-5\" pgmap=\"184\">We find no cause for disturbing the judgment of the Appellate Court. It is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b184-6\" pgmap=\"184\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
