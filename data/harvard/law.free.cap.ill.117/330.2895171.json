Heyer, the defendant appeared, and filed a plea to the declaration. Hugo Mtiench, as assignee of Heyer, filed an interpleader, claiming the property attached, real and personal, as assignee. Lovingston, Marshall and Lubke interpleaded, claiming the property attached as their own, as trustees, and as purchasers from Muench, and claiming the proceeds of sale of the perishable articles, subject to the Donk attachment. The St. Louis' Syrup, Glucose and Grape Sugar Company filed their interpleader, claiming the real and personal property attached as their own. Issues were joined, and at a subsequent term all the issues were tided, and decided by the court in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment rendered in the sum of $902.56, and general and special executions awarded. 'The interpleaders and the defendant sued out a writ of error to the Appellate Court, where the judgment was affirmed, then sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court, where the judgment was likewise affirmed. Upon the final disposition of the case, Alexander &amp; Taussig caused an execution to be issued, and all the personal property not sold as perishable, and all the buildings and fixtures having first been before destroyed by fire, the sheriff, under said execution, sold the leasehold estate of said Heyer, then in possession of the St. Louis Glucose Company, to plaintiffs, for $700, March 5,1884, and the same was redeemed by said glucose company March 8, 1884, by payment'of $701.90 to the sheriff.

Then the court found, as matter of law, that the claim of the judgment of Alexander &amp; Taussig was preferred to .the claim of Donk Bros. &amp; Co., and entitled to preference in sharing the proceeds of the said sales, and to this finding Donk Bros. &amp; Co. and the St. Louis Syrup, Glucose and Grape,Sugar .Company at the time excepted, and then the said Donk Bros. &amp; Co. and the said company moved the court for a new trial or hearing of the motion, because the finding of the court wras contrary to law, but the court denied the motion, and the movers thereof excepted. The court ordered the sheriff to pay out of the proceeds of said sales the judgment of Alexander &amp; Taussig .in full, and the balance to the said company, and to this judgment the said company and the firm of Donk Bros. &amp; Co. excepted, and appealed to the Appellate Court for the Fourth District. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.

Thomas, for the appellants:</attorneys><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\" pgmap=\"335\">After the sale under the attachment of Donk Bros. &amp; Co., they assigned their judgment to Metcalf, who subsequently, and before, a sale under the judgment of Alexander &amp; Taussig, had fixed the amount to be credited on each judgment, and assigned the first named judgment to the St. Louis Syrup, Glucose and Grape Sugar Company. These assignments carried with them the right to participate in the proceeds of the sales.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-8\" pgmap=\"335\">The company never, became the owner of any lien upon the personalty because that was sold before it bought the Donk judgment.

The question here is, whether the company which has purchased real estate upon which' the judgment was a lien, waived its right to receive money due on the judgment arising from a former sale of personalty, by merely purchasing the judgment. This is a proceeding at law, and under the statute all the court could do was to distribute the funds pro rata to the several judgment creditors. If there are equities to be adjusted, they should be referred to the equity side of the court.</p><attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-5\" pgmap=\"336\">Mr. Chas. P.

Donk Bros, et al. v. St. Louis Glucose and Grape Sugar Co. 17 Bradw. 374.</p> <p id=\"b337-6\" pgmap=\"337(290) 338(266)\">But counsel for appellants contend that the fact that appellants did not purchase the perishable property sold under the Donk judgment, renders the reasoning in the opinion of the Appellate Court inapplicable to the case before the court. This seems to assume that the Donk attachment, and the sale of the perishable property under it, are independent of the Alexander &amp; Taussig attachment, and of the levy of both attachments upon other property which appellants did purchase, which is, very clearly, not admissible. The sale of the perishable property before judgment was obtained, was merely to prevent loss. (Attachment act, 1 Starr &amp; Curtiss, sec. 20, p. 318.) So far as any question involved here is concerned, the case may be considered just as if that and all the other property attached had remained in the hands of the sheriff until the -final sale by him of all the property attached, under both attachments, for since both attachments were returnable at the same term, they would share in the property attached pro rata, (see. 37, Attachment act, supra,) and this applies as well to the proceeds of the perishable property as to the other property. Neither attachment was entitled to priority over the other in respect to any of the property attached, and each was a lien upon all of the property attached, to the extent of the entire amount of the indebtedness for which it was issued. And hence, when the appellant company, after it became the owner, subject to these attachments, of .all the property attached except that which had been sold as perishable, purchased and became the assignee of the Donk judgment, it occupied, to the extent of the amount of that judgment, the position of both debtor and creditor, and in such cases there is a merger of the qualities of debtor and creditor, extinguishing both. Abbott, in his Law Dictionary, vol. 2, title, \u201cMerger, \u201d says: \u201cMerger is the equivalent of confusion in the Roman law,'and- (when used with reference to demands,) indicates that where the qualities of debtor and creditor become united in the same individual, there arises a confusion of rights which extinguishes both qualities; whence, also, merger is often called extinguishment. \u201d Bouvier, in his Dictionary, vol. 2, title, \u201cMerger, \u201d under the head of \u201cRights, \u201d says: \u201cRights are said to be merged when the same person who is bound to pay is also entitled to receive. This is-more properly called a confusion of rights, or extinguishment. When there is a confusion of rights, and the debtor and- creditor become the same person, there can be no right to put in execution.\u201d The same rule is recognized in Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, vol. 2, secs. 789, 790.. The extinguishment is complete at law, though in equity, under certain circumstances, a merger or extinguishment will be prevented. (Ibid.) The assignments of the judgment invested the assignees, in the order of the assignments, successively, with the right to receive the .amount to which the plaintiff in the judgment was before entitled, and a court of law recognizes and enforces the rights of such assignees. Chapman v. Shattuck, 3 Gilm. 49; Carr v. Waugh, 28 Ill. 418; Morris, Admr. et al. v. Cheney, 51 id. 451; Hodson et al. v. McConnel, 12 id. 170.</p> <p id=\"b338-7\" pgmap=\"338\">No right, therefore, recognized by a ,court of law, remained, in Donk Bros, after the assignment, and there was nothing to prevent \u00a1the legal merger or extinguishment.</p> <p id=\"b338-8\" pgmap=\"338\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b338-9\" pgmap=\"338\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
