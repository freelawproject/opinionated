Easement\u2014u'hen appurtenant to an estate\u2014of an alley way\u2014right of purchaser. Where the owner of two tenements, or of an entire estate, has so arranged and adapted them that one tenement or one portion of the estate derives a benefit and advantage from the other, of a permanent, open and visible character, and he sells a portion of the property, the purchaser will take the tenement or portion sold with all the benefits and burdens which so appear at the time of the sale to belong to it. It is not necessary, in such case, that the easement claimed by the grantee must be really necessary for the enjoyment of the estate granted. \u25a0 It is sufficient if it is highly convenient and beneficial therefor.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b644-3\" pgmap=\"644\">2. In this case, the agent of thev owner of three lots (19, 20 and 21,) lying parallel to each other and adjoining, for convenience in leasing, made a plat of lots 20 and 21, dividing them transversely into four lots, leaving an alley ten feet wide off the ends of such lots next to lot 19, which accommodated that lot as well as the other four of the subdivision, and was highly convenient and beneficial to lot 19. The agent, in negotiating for the sale of the half of lot '19 next to the alley, exhibited to the purchaser a plat showing such alley, acknowledged by the lot owner, and promised to have the same recorded, and the sale was closed by the purchaser on the assxirance and belief that such alley was an easement to his lot, and the owner, in making sales and conveyances of the other lots, sold with reference to such plat, and reserved off the end of each of the four lots ten feet next to lot 19, and finally put such plat on record, on which the alley was marked, \"reserved for private alley.\u201d Held, that such alley became and was an easement appurtenant to lot 19, which could not be destroyed by the owners of the other lots without the concurrence of the purchaser of lot 19. In such ease, the subsequent sale of lots by such plat, reserving the alley, implied knowledge by the owner of the same, and was evidence tending to show his adoption and confirmation of the subdivision.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b644-4\" pgmap=\"644\">3.

At that time the land was occupied by squatters, and Wilder employed one John Gunzenhauser, as his agent, to dispossess the occupants, and rent the property. Gunzenhauser removed the squatters, and subdivided the lots according to a private plat made by himself, as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\" pgmap=\"645\">[[Image here]]</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-32\" pgmap=\"645(130) 646(40)\">The east two lots (20 and 21) were subdivided into four lots, fronting on Jefferson street, and the west lot (19) on DeKoven street, he divided into two lots, on DeKoven street. Wilder afterwards sold all the lots to Henry G. Hubbard, of Middletown, Connecticut, who remained owner for eighteen or twenty years. About 1878, Henry G. Hubbard sold all of the lots to Mrs. B. K. Hubbard, (Anna J. Hubbard,) as lots 19, 20 and 21. Gunzenhauser sold the lots, as subdivided, for Mrs. B. K. Hubbard, the then owner. He acted as the real estate broker in the sale of all the lots which were sold to the plaintiff and defendants in error. He advertised them for sale, and the deeds and other papers were drawn in his office. With the exception of an interval of one or two years, Gunzenhauser was. the agent, having charge and control of the whole property, paying taxes, collecting rents, etc., from 1859 down to the time all the lots were sold.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-5\" pgmap=\"646(324) 647(12)\">In July, 1882, the plaintiff in error, Gihak, began his negotiations with Gunzenhauser for the purchase of the east half of lot 19. He employed one Kaspar, a real estate dealer, as his agent in the matter. Kaspar went to Gunzenhauser, told him he wished to purchase the lot on the alley for Gihak, and the other or west half for Mrs. Bain, tlpon examination of the abstract of title which had been given him for that purpose, Kaspar did not find any plat of record showing this alley. He and Gihak reported this fact to Gunzenhauser, who said, \u201cThat is all right\u2014I have a plat here, \u201d and he showed Kaspar the plat, saying it was going to be put on record. He further showed them that the plat was acknowledged, and said he was going to sell the other lots subject to this plat, and the alley as it was being platted out. At that time, Mrs. E. K. Hubbard owned the entire lots 19, 20 and 21, no pa-rt of them having been sold. Kaspar told Gunzenhauser that Gihak would not buy unless the plat was put on record, and Gunzenhauser promised to do that. Thereupon Gihak bought the east half of lot 19. He testified he would not have purchased the lot if there had been no alley along the east line, and if Gunzenhauser had not promised to record the plat. A warranty deed was made by the owner, Mrs. E. K. Hubbard, (Anna J. Hubbard,) and Elijah K. Hubbard, her husband, to the plaintiff in error, Frank Gihak, conveying the east half of said lot 19, in block 85, school section addition to Chicago, \u201ctogether with all and singular the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anywise appertaining. \u201d The deed was dated July 15, 1882, acknowledged August 30,1882, and not delivered until September 7, 1882.

Such was the condition at the time Cihak purchased, and he soon after moved the cottage to the rear of the lot, and on the front facing DeKoven street he erected a substantial three-story brick building, leaving a space of yard between the cottage and brick building: Both buildings</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-5\" pgmap=\"649\">stand on the line of the alley, and have windows facing it. The use of the alley always was and is necessary to afford means of ingress and egress to and from the yard. The occupant of the cottage is a milk dealer, and uses the yard for his horses and wagon. An instrument in writing, purporting to vacate the alley, was executed and acknowledged by four of .the defendants in error, the owners of lots 1, 2, 3 and 4, on February 12, 1884, and, acting thereon, they attempted and proceeded to move some buildings on the alley, and thereupon the present bill ivas filed.

We would have no doubt in the matter had Mrs. Hubbard, the grantor of Cihak, been the actor in the sale to him, and in the previous management of the entire property, instead of Gunzenhauser. The proof establishes, to our satisfaction, that in 1859 Gunzenhauser, as agent, took charge of the three lots, 19, 20 and 21, fronting on DeKoven street, to care for, lease them, and collect the rents; that for the more advantageous leasing of the lots and deriving the most rental, he subdivided them, making of lots 20 and 21 four lots, fronting on Jefferson street, and dividing lot 19 into two lots, fronting on DeKoven street. He made the four lots on Jefferson street ninety feet in depth, and an alley ten feet wide, the alley running from north to south along the entire east line of lot 19, and taking off the west ten feet of the east two lots, thus forming an alley between the east half of lot 19 on the west, and the four lots on the east; that he drove the stakes for the alley; that he made written leases of the lots, according to this subdivision, leasing the four lots as only ninety feet deep; that in 1859 he leased the east half of lot 19, and the tenant in that year put up a fence on the west line of the alley, and as the four lots east of the alley-were leased, the tenant would put a fence on the west end of his lot adjoining the alley, so that by about 1864 all the four lots east of the alley were leased and occupied, and there was either a fence or shed and barn along the entire east line of the alley, and from that time until 1882, with the alley thus open and defined, all the lots were under lease in the manner stated. This establishment of the alley was not only for the use and benefit of the lots from which it was taken, on the east of it, but it was as well for the use and benefit of the east half of lot 19, which adjoined it its whole length on the west. This alley w7as a manifest advantage to the east half of lot 19, and must have enhanced its rental value. There was a building on the east half of lot 19, fronting on DeKoven street, with its side on the line of the alley, with a window in it, and a door leading into the alley. The alley was actually being used for the delivery of coal and wood for the house, and was the only means of access to the house used for such purpose. If all this had been with the knowledge and procurement of the owner, and she had personally sold the east half of lot 19, the case would seem to be brought within the principle, that when the owner of .two tenements, or of an entire estate, has arranged and adapted these so that one tenement, or one portion of the estate, derives a benefit and advantage from the other, of a permanent, open and visible character, and he sells the same, a purchaser takes the tenement, or portion sold, with all the benefits and burdens which so appear at the time of the sale to belong to it.

J.) 439.</p> <p id=\"b653-5\" pgmap=\"653\">We do not concur in the view of counsel for defendants in error, that the easement to be claimed by the grantee in such a case must be really necessary for the enjoyment of the estate granted. Mr. Bennett, in his edition of Goddard on Easements, page 122, in speaking on this subject of grants of quasi easements, upon the conveyance of one of two lots, says: \u201cThe third class of cases is where the quasi easement claimed by the grantee is not really \u2018necessary\u2019 for the enjoyment of the estate granted, but is highly convenient and beneficial therefor; and here the modern rule in America is, that if such easement is \u2018continuous and apparent\u2019 at the time of the grant, it passes to the purchaser with his estate, otherwise not.\u201d And in Washburn on Easements, (3d ed.) 95, in the discussing of this question the author says: \u201cIt (the easement) must be reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of the part which claims it, and where that is not the ease, it requires descriptive words of grant or reservation in the deed, to create an easement in favor of one part of a heritage over another. \u201d There can be no doubt, here, that the alley was highly convenient and beneficial for the enjoyment of the estate granted to Cihak.</p> <p id=\"b653-7\" pgmap=\"653(20) 654(249)\">Gunzenhauser would appear to have made the subdivision he did, of his own motion. Wilder was the owner at the. time, and lived in Chicago. All that goes to connect him with the subdivision, is Gunzenhauser\u2019s statement that Wilder was on the ground several times; helped him to get off the squatters; \u201cmade no objections to my letting out the land in that way, and was perfectly satisfied.\u201d While Henry G. Hubbard owned the property, he lived in Connecticut, and is not shown to have had any personal knowledge of the subdivision; and the same with Mrs. E. K. Hubbard. We understand she, too, resided in Connecticut. E. K. Hubbard, her husband, testifies that he resided in Chicago from 1835 to 1885; that he had authority from his wife to act on her behalf; says, he thinks his wife had seen the lots; that he saw them after his wife became owner, perhaps once a month; that he did not recollect consulting with any one regarding the subdivision platted and recorded, except, perhaps, Gunzenhauser. And here the inquiry is suggested, why this plat of the subdivision which was made and recorded at the instance of E. K. Hub-hard, and, as Mrs. Hubbard acknowledges, by her direction, comes to correspond precisely with the subdivision which Gunzenhauser made in 1859', and has the same alley of just ten feet wide, exactly as Gunzenhauser staked it out in 1859. It implies knowledge by Mrs. Hubbard of the subdivision, and is evidence tending to show her adoption and confirmation of that subdivision, and of what was done under it.</p> <p id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654(123) 655(253)\">But without further pursuing this branch of the case, or expressing an opinion whether the circumstances of the arrangement and use of the alley for the accommodation of this lot of Cihak, and selling the lot-with the apparent appurtenance of the alley attached to it; were alone sufficient to give the grantee of the lot the use of the alley, we come to the conclusion that they were sufficient, when taken in connection with the subsequent sales being made subject to the alley. Defendants in error never bought or paid for the alley, or so -supposed. In the deeds for lots 1 and 2, the use of the west ten feet of the lots for a private alley was expressly reserved. And at the time the deed for lots 3 and 4 was made, there was, upon record, the plat of the subdivision, showing the alley upon it. True, it is named \u201cprivate alley, \u201d and it is insisted by counsel for defendants in error that this means private to the lots from which the alley was taken,\u2014 those on the east side of it,\u2014and that it was for their use only. Under other circumstances,\u2014of Mrs. Hubbard not being the owner of the ground on the west side of the alley,\u2014this might be so. But was it so under the circumstances here ? The alley had originally been laid out many years before, for the accommodation of Cihak\u2019s lot, as well as the other lots, and had ever afterward been used equally for the accommodation of Cihak\u2019s and the other lots. At the time Mrs. Hubbard put the designation \u201cprivate alley\u201d on the plat, the alley was being so used, and she was the owner of the ground on both sides of the alley, with a building standing on the west line of the alley, constructed with special adaptation for the use of the alley. The alley was important for the beneficial enjoyment of her lot on the west side of the alley, and must have enhanced its value. There was no apparent purpose why the alley should not be as much for the use of the owner\u2019s ground on the one side of the alley as on the other side.</p> <p id=\"b655-5\" pgmap=\"655(150) 656(218)\">Under such circumstances, we think the meaning of private was, that the alley was private to the owner\u2019s own ground; that the alley was for the use of the owner\u2019s lots only, but of her lots abutting on both sides of the alley, and not for the use, solely, of her lots on one side of the alley. We give no consideration to the manifestly incompetent testimony of E. K. Hubbard, that his wife\u2019s intention was to reserve the alley as a private alley for the use of lots 1, 2, 3 and 4. It was not competent for him to swear to his wife\u2019s, or any one\u2019s else, intention. All that he might do in such regard, would be to testify to acts and declarations, as showing intention. The question here is, what others had reason to believe was the intention from the circumstances, and the acts done. The alley was an important consideration with Cihak when he purchased. An inspection of the abstract of title did not show the alley of record. This defect was brought to the attention of Gunzenhauser, and to assure Cihak that he would get with his lot the use of the alley, the plat of the subdivision, with the alley appearing upon it, acknowledged by Mrs. Hubbard, was shown by Gunzenhauser to Cihak, the former stating that the plat was going to be put upon record. This satisfied Cihak that he would get the benefit of the alley. Gunzenhauser, who made the sale, Kaspar, who acted for Cihak, and Cihak, no doubt, all believed that the recording of the plat of the subdivision would secure for Cihak the use of the alley. It did not occur to either of them that the word \u201cprivate\u201d had any significance as excluding such use. To so construe that word would be to make it but a snare to entrap the one purchasing the lot on the west side of the all\u00e9y. It would be to give to defendants in error ground which they never purchased, and to rob plaintiff in error of an alley the use of which he had good reason to believe he purchased as an appurtenance to his lot.</p> <p id=\"b656-4\" pgmap=\"656\">We find enough in the facts of this case to have put the defendants on inquiry, so as to have affected them with notice of the circumstances upon which we rest the right of the complainant to the use of this alley.</p> <p id=\"b656-5\" pgmap=\"656\">\u2022 The judgment of the Appellate Court and the decree of the circuit court will be reversed, and the cause remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b656-6\" pgmap=\"656\">Judgment reversed.</p> <p id=\"b656-7\" pgmap=\"656\">Mr. Justice Scott : I do not concur in this opinion.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
