His family doctor testified that some weeks before his death the decedent manifested an \u201cauricular fibrillation,\u201d <em>i. </em>ean irregularity of the heart beat.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">The deputy commissioner dismissed the petition, holding that the burden of proving an accident resulting in death, which arose out of and in the course of the employment, had not been sustained. The Pleas, on appeal, affirmed. Application for <em>certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court Justice in the district was unsuccessful. <em>Allocatur </em>was refused. The application before us is to the court <em>en banc. </em>Thus two competent fact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>finding tribunals have held that the instant case was not in which, under the proofs, the petition could be sustained. A justice of this court has held in effect that no debatable question of law or fact was open in the case and review was denied by him. We are of the same mind. It does not appear that the decedent met his death by accident which arose out of and in the course of the employment. Nothing untoward or out of the ordinary was proved as having occurred at or just preceding the time when the decedent died. To conclude otherwise would be to indulge in sheer speculation. The decedent died while he was in the course of his employment. That is all that appears. Neither his employment nor the duties he performed therein were factors in his untimely death. Compare <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Ulster Iron Works, </em>9 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>239; <em>affirmed, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>267.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><em>Certiorari </em>is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
