The specification of determinations reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">\u201c1. The court erred in refusing to grant plaintiffs motion for a directed verdict and grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">\u201c2. The court erred in failing to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff, as matter of law, for the sum of forty-two dollars and seven cents ($42.07).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">As to the first specification, an examination of the record discloses no motion on behalf of plaintiff for a directed verdict and ho refusal of the trial court thereon. There is, therefore, no basis for this specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">As to the second specification of alleged error in failing to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $42.07 as a matter of law, this, too, seems to be defective. See <em>Press </em>v. <em>Klink, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>475.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">There being no question before the court for review, the appeal is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
