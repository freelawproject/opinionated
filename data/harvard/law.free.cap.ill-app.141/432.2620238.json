The transcript filed by her in this court March 11, 1908, was certified by the clerk of the Municipal Court to be a \u201ccomplete transcript of certain proceedings in a certain cause * * * lately pending in said court wherein\u201d appellant was plaintiff and appellees defendants.

If the transcript filed March 11th had been certified to be a complete copy of the record, and through mistake any part of the record was omitted from such transcript, then on suggestion of diminution this court would have the power to grant leave to supply the part of the record so omitted from the transcript. But the transcript filed March 11 is not certified to be a complete copy of the record, but only of \u201ccertain proceedings in the cause.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b467-9\" pgmap=\"467\">Whether this court had the power, within forty days from the date of the judgment, to extend the time to complete the transcript, is a question not before us, for no application was made for such extension within that time.</p> <p id=\"b467-10\" pgmap=\"467(8) 468(59)\">The words \u201cAuthenticated copies of records of judgments, \u2019 \u2019 in said section 22, means copies which are certified by the clerk to be complete copies of the record.
