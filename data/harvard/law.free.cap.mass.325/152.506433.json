He worked in the spinning room, where the temperature was eighty to ninety degrees Fahrenheit and the air was filled with particles of cotton. His hours were from 3:40 p.m. to 9:40 p.m., but frequently he and others who lacked passes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>to leave early, when their work was finished, went to the locker room at the end of the spinning room and waited there until a signal sounded at 9:40 p.m. This room, twenty-five by ten feet, contained steel lockers of usual size for workers\u2019 clothes. Through it passed steam pipes, and its temperature was about that of the spinning room. Its one window, of swivel type on a horizontal axis, ordinarily was opened by means of a chain by one standing on the floor. On January 5, 1948, the employee, after finishing work, was in the locker room awaiting the leaving signal. The room was very hot. Desiring fresh air and finding the chain broken, the employee climbed up and seated himself upon a locker and held the window open by means of a broom. While in this position conversing with other employees, he lost his balance, and the broom handle slipped or snapped and struck him in the eye, causing injury and incapacity until his return to work on March 29, 1948. These facts are from the decision of the reviewing board, which also found that the act of the employee was one reasonably incidental to his employment and justified in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The self insurer, which appealed from a decree of the Superior Court allowing compensation, contends that the employee, by climbing to the top of the locker, went outside the reasonable scope of his employment to incur \u201ca danger of his own choosing.\u201d It argues that the evidence shows that the window could be opened and kept open from the floor by holding the chain; that the only trouble was that the broken chain was not long enough to fasten to a hook on the wall; and that in January the time needed to admit fresh air would be very brief. It is also urged that, work being over, the employee\u2019s act was for his own comfort. The complete answer, however, is that the board\u2019s findings are not wholly without support in the evidence and a different finding was not required as matter of law. <em>Lazarz\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 538. <em>Demetre\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 95, 99. The court will sustain the general finding of the reviewing board if possible. <em>Bajdek\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>326. The risk of injury while waiting to leave was a hazard of the employment. <em>Milliman\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 451, 453. This included an injury while obtaining fresh air. <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, 223 </em>Mass. 56, 61. There have been many cases recently decided which deal with analogous situations with full citation of authorities. <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633. <em>Rogers\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 308. <em>Bradford\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 621. <em>Kubera\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 419. <em>Charon\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 694. <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705. See <em>Dillon\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Attack is also made on two statements in the board\u2019s decision, both of which are unfortunately prefaced, \u201cThere is ample evidence,\u201d and are perhaps equivocal as to whether intended merely as recitals of evidence or as findings of fact. The first, that the chain had been broken \u201cfor some time,\u201d if a finding, was well supported by evidence. The second, that the employee\u2019s foreman was present on the evening of the injury while the employee was on the locker, if a finding, is without support in the testimony, but is not important and may be disregarded. Enough appears to show that the reviewing board followed correct rules of law. <em>Demetre\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 95, 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Costs under G. L. (Ter.
