The defendant excepted to the denial of his motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">One of the plaintiffs testified that her attention was attracted by a noise, and that she went to the back window and witnessed the setting off of four explosions. The last explosion was the loudest of all, and when that occurred \u201cthe house shook and appeared to have come up in the back and down in front, and if she hadn\u2019t had her arms on the window sill she would have fallen right back on the floor.\u201d There was testimony that the boulder which was being blasted was about one hundred twenty-five to one hundred fifty feet from the rear of the plaintiffs\u2019 house, and that soon after the blasting various cracks were observed in the foundation walls of the cellar and in the ceilings and side walls of some of the rooms. A contractor who repaired the cellar wall was of the opinion that the damage was due to blasting. There was testimony introduced by the defendant that this damage could not have been caused by these blasts. In this conflict of testimony, the question whether there was a causal connection between the blasts and the damage was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Dris-coll </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>207 Mass. 102, 107. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Hanreddy, </em>212 Mass. 340, 342-343. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Lynn Sand &amp; Stone Co. </em>317 Mass. 737, 738-739.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The principal contention of the defendant is that the evidence is insufficient to establish any negligence on his part. The jury were not required to believe the testimony introduced by the defendant tending to show the various precautions alleged to have been taken by him. They could adopt as true the testimony of the defendant\u2019s expert that, \u201chad the dynamiting been done properly, it could not have caused any damage to the house.\u201d Where, as here, the plaintiffs are not contending that their property was damaged directly by stones or other debris being cast upon their premises but contend that the damage sustained was consequential in the sense that it was due to concussion or vibrations generated by the blasting, the burden was upon them to show that the damage resulted from the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>fendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Jenkins </em>v. A. <em>G. Tomasello &amp; Son, Inc. </em>286 Mass. 180, 186. <em>Dolham </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>297 Mass. 479, 482. Upon the testimony, that issue was for the jury. <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>West Roxbury Trap Rock Co. </em>229 Mass. 211. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>238 Mass. 487, 488-489. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>247 Mass. 492, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
