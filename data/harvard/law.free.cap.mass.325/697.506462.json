The plaintiff\u2019s intestate went there, and parked his truck in a parking area in the rear, which was provided by the defendants for the use of persons attending services at the funeral home, and which the defendants preferred to have visitors use instead of leaving their automobiles on the street. A driveway ran from the parking area under a porte-cochere to the street. From the driveway, under the porte-cochere, steps led up to a platform which gave access to the side door of the funeral home. A ramp or inclined plane led from the parking area up to the same platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">On January 3, 1948, snow on the top of the porte-coch\u00e9re, which had lain there unremoved for a considerable time, had melted and dripped upon the ramp, where it froze into a slippery coating of ice. Although the defendants had sand and salt available, the slippery part of the ramp was not sprinkled with sand or salt. The defendants knew that the ramp formed a direct route from the parking area to the side door, knew that the public generally used the ramp instead of the steps to reach the side door, and knew of the coating of ice on the ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">On the evening of January 3, 1948, the intestate, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>truck was in the parking area, left the funeral home by the side door and descended the ramp. He slipped and fell on the ice on the ramp, and sustained injury. He was helped into the funeral home, where the male defendant said that he had sand there to sprinkle the slippery places and did not understand why they had not been sanded. The judge found that the intestate was an invitee upon the ramp, that when he was hurt he was in the exercise of due care, and that he fell upon an accumulation of ice on the ramp of which the defendants had notice, but which they had negligently failed to remove. He found for the plaintiff, and the Appellate Division dismissed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The intestate warrantably was found to be a business invitee upon the ramp. He was undoubtedly an invitee to the funeral home, and the defendants knew that the ramp was in common use by such invitees. We think it was a question of fact whether the invitation extended to the use of the ramp. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Harvard Restaurant &amp; Liquor Co. Inc. </em>310 Mass. 491, 494. <em>Coates </em>v. <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>322 Mass. 563, 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">With the burden of proof of contributory negligence upon the defendants (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 231, \u00a7 85, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 386, \u00a7 1), the intestate could not be ruled to be guilty of contributory negligence, even if, as the report fails to show, he knew of the ice on the ramp. <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>305 Mass. 373. <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>314 Mass. 10, 15. <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Athol, ante, </em>41.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">It appeared that on January 8, 1948, the intestate mailed to the defendants a notice as follows: \u201c84 Pine Street, Swampscott, Mass. January 8, 1948. Thomas W. Rhodes, 67 Ocean Street, Lynn, Massachusetts. This is to notify you that on January 3, 1948, about 10:00 to 10:15 p.m., while attending your Funeral Home at 67 Ocean Street, I received a bad fall causing me considerable bodily injuries and am now in the care of my physician. This accident was caused by the condition of your premises at the time. Will you kindly let me hear from you at once. Very truly yours, [signed] Charles Watts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ArKk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 84,- \u00a7 21, provides that \u201cThe three preceding sections, so far as they relate to notices of injuries resulting from snow or ice, shall apply to actions against persons founded upon the defective condition of their premises . - . when caused by or consisting in part of snow or ice,\u201d and provides that notice within thirty days after the injury shall be sufficient. It is not disputed that the notice was seasonably received by the defendants. <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co. </em>304 Mass. 353. Turning back to \u00a7 18, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 114, \u00a7 1, which in terms requires notice to a municipality of injuries resulting from a defect consisting in part of snow or ice or both, that section provides that the notice must be \u201cof the name and place of residence of the person injured, and the time, place and cause of said injury or damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In this case the notice began with the place of residence of the person injured, and was signed by him. The time of the injury was sufficiently specified. <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>314 Mass. 10, 13. The \u201cplace\u201d of the injury was riot specified beyond the statement that it was at the funeral home, and we think there was .an omission to state the \u201cplace\u201d iri accordance with the statute. Considerable definiteness is required as to the place, so as to enable a defendant to identify: it and to .investigate the occurrence. <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>135 Mass. 110. <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Salem, </em>139 Mass. 91.The cause of the injury was stated merely in general terms, as \u201cthe condition of your premises at the time,\u201d and nothing was said about ice. But. as notice was required only in case of injury by reason of snow or ice, it may be that any such; notice pointed to snow or ice. <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>314 Mass. 10; 13, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The failure to state the place of the injury, and possibly the cause of the injury, constituted omissions, and not in-accuracies. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Winthrop, </em>275 Mass. 43, 46. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>284 Mass. 260, 262. <em>Marshall </em>v. Cambridge, 310 Mass. 822. Where the defect is an omission, and not. an inaccuracy, the defect is not curable by proof that there was no intention to mislead and that the party entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>notice was not misled, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 18, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 114, \u00a7 1. If the notice was one \u201creferring to the injuries sustained and claiming damages therefor,\u201d within G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 20, as amended by St. 1939, c. 147, a defendant cannot avail himself of such omissions unless he gives a counter notice to the person injured pointing out the insufficiency of the notice and requesting a new notice in compliance with law. In this case no such counter notice was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The only remaining question is whether the notice given by the intestate was one \u201cclaiming damages\u201d for the injury. No express claim of damages need be contained in a notice otherwise in accordance with the statute. <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Hickson, </em>322 Mass. 655, 659. <em>Laskowski </em>v. <em>Manning, ante, </em>393. A notice would be useless unless meant to establish a claim for damages. See <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>314 Mass. 10, 13, 14. The phrase in the notice, \u201cWill you kindly let me hear from you at once,\u201d is indicative of a claim upon the defendants. Fairly construed, the notice showed that it was \u201cintended as the foundation of that kind of a right of action to which a notice is a condition precedent.\u201d <em>Meniz </em>v. <em>Quissett Mill, </em>216 Mass. 552, 555. The case of <em>DePrizio </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>291 Mass. 143, is distinguishable. The notice in that case did not demand an answer. It asked only for help as a matter of charity. As was said in the opinion (page 149), \u201cReasonably interpreted, the letter [notice] makes no claim for damages for the injuries sustained. It goes no further than to express a hope or desire that .the defendant will make some contribution toward the medical expenses ensuing from the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
