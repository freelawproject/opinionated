By amendment a second count was added in which the husband of the plaintiff sought consequential damages. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 6A, as inserted by St. 1939, c. 372, \u00a7 1. Verdicts were returned for the plaintiff and her husband which were recorded under leave reserved. Thereafter the judge entered verdicts for the defendant subject to exceptions of the plaintiff and her husband. The correctness of this action presents the only question for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">These facts could have been found: The defendant operates a race track in Raynham where dog racing is conducted. On the evening of July 21, 1945, between eight thirty and nine o\u2019clock, the plaintiff and her husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>accompanied by their two children, after paying the admission price entered the defendant\u2019s premises through a turnstile. From there they proceeded \u201cover smooth level terrain\u201d to the vicinity of the bandstand, \u201cwhich is an area north of the general racing ground.\u201d The plaintiff then left her family and walked \u201cup a slight macadam incline\u201d east from the grandstand toward the ticket sellers\u2019 windows. These windows were located sixty to seventy-five feet east of the track. \u201cShe then proceeded thirty feet from the said sellers\u2019 windows on a slight smooth decline.\u201d As she walked toward the track \u201cthe crowd was very dense\u201d and she fell as she went through the crowd. The fall occurred about thirty feet from the ticket windows at a place where there was a \u201cbreak in the continuity of the slope.\u201d It was a \u201cdrop\u201d or step which was \u201cnot the conventional step that you see anywhere.\u201d The drop or step was \u201csixty feet long and six to eight inches in depth.\u201d There were no signs warning that the step was there. There were about twenty of these steps about three feet apart, and they were \u201ccurved like an amphitheater.\u201d The steps \u201cdescended from the spot where . . . [the plaintiff] fell, westerly to the race track.\u201d The ticket windows and the race track were seventy-five feet apart. The windows were lighted and there were lights around the track but between the races the track was not lighted. There were no lights within thirty feet of the place where the plaintiff fell. \u201cWith the dense crowd it was difficult to see in this area.\u201d When the plaintiff fell she was \u201cmilling into a dense crowd [which was] milling toward the track.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The bill of exceptions does not state that it contained all the evidence material to the question presented. This, of itself, is enough to justify overruling the exceptions but, as the result is unchanged, we consider the case on the merits. <em>McKin </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>256 Mass. 269. <em>Hall </em>v. Smith, 283 Mass. 166, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, an invitee, has been set forth in numerous decisions of this court and need not be restated. See <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Co. </em>269 Mass. 289, 291; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>288 Mass. 79; <em>Rynn </em>v. <em>Fox-New England Theatres, Inc. </em>299 Mass. 258, 259; <em>Coates </em>v. <em>First National Stores, Inc. </em>322 Mass. 563, 565. That duty was not violated here. \u201cIt is matter of common observation that in entering and leaving stores, halls, railway car stations and platforms, office buildings, and other buildings . . . adjoining surfaces are frequently at different levels, and the difference- in level has to be overcome by one or more steps of greater or less height or by some other device. . . . We cannot think that such a construction is of itself defective or negligent.\u201d <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Evangelical Baptist Benevolent &amp; Missionary Society of Boston, </em>181 Mass. 285, 286. One entering premises where a race track is maintained cannot reasonably expect - to find all parts of the premises at the same level or expect that there will not be steps or other devices between the levels. There was no evidence of any defect in the step itself at the place where the plaintiff fell, and we are of opinion that neither the placing of a step at that point nor the type of construction can be said to be negligent. The case is governed in principle by <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Evangelical Baptist Benevolent &amp; Missionary Society of Boston, </em>181 Mass. 285, 286, <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>200 Mass. 343, 345, <em>Pastrick </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>288 Mass. 194, <em>Rynn </em>v. <em>Fox-New England Theatres, Inc. </em>299 Mass. 258, and <em>Sterns </em>v. <em>Highland Hotel Co. </em>307 Mass. 90. See <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Sherer Dry Goods Co. </em>205 Mass. 1, 3. Compare <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Cherry &amp; Webb Co. Lowell, </em>267 Mass. 217; <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>315 Mass. 732. The count of the plaintiff\u2019s husband for consequential damages falls with the plaintiff\u2019s case. <em>Brazinskos </em>v. <em>A. S. Fawcett, Inc. </em>318 Mass. 263, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
