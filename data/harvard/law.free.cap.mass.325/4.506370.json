To this declaration the defendant demurred, alleging as cause therefor \u201c1. That the plaintiff cannot recover upon the count in contract for the reason that the declaration does not show a contractual relation between the defendant and the plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>2. That the plaintiff cannot recover upon a count of tort for the reason that the plaintiff\u2019s declaration does not show or set forth facts that the alleged defective article was inherently dangerous, nor that it was intended to be used for human consumption.\u201d The plaintiff has appealed from an order of a judge of the Superior Court sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We confine our consideration of the demurrer to the causes set forth in relation to a count in tort, as the declaration, which contains only one count, sounds in tort and not in contract. See <em>Damiano </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Liability Co. </em>316 Mass. 626, 630; <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>320 Mass. 528, 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Since the decision in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Yardley &amp; Co. Ltd. </em>319 Mass. 92, by which the instant case is governed, failure to allege that the hay was inherently dangerous is not ground for demurrer. As a result of the <em>Carter </em>case all dangerous things are brought into the same class as those termed \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d to which the principle of liability to persons not in privity of contract has commonly been applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Likewise it is not necessary to allege that the hay was intended for human consumption. The liability of the defendant for damage resulting from his negligence is not limited to personal injury. In <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Downer Kerosene Oil Co. </em>104 Mass. 64, where naphtha was sold as kerosene, the court found the defendant liable for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s home as well as to his person. See <em>French </em>v. <em>Vining, </em>102 Mass. 132; <em>Guinan </em>v. <em>Famous Players-Lasky Corp. </em>267 Mass. 501, 511; <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Edward E. Tower Co. </em>271 Mass. 230, 233. It is generally held in other jurisdictions that where the supplier of a chattel is liable for personal injury he is also hable for property damage. <em>United States Radiator Corp. </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>68 Fed. (2d) 87 (defective furnace). <em>E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Baridon, </em>73 Fed. (2d) 26 (disinfectant for gladiolus bulbs). <em>Kolberg </em>v. <em>SherwinWilliams Co. </em>93 Cal. App. 609 (spray for fruit trees). <em>Ebers </em>v. <em>General Chemical Co. </em>310 Mich. 261 (spray for fruit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>trees). <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Lindmark, </em>177 Minn. 390 (oil for poultry). <em>Genesee County Patrons Fire Relief Association </em>v. <em>L.

D. 421 (hog serum).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The order sustaining the demurrer is reversed and an order is to be entered overruling the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
