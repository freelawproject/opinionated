The defendants demurred. . From an interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer and from a final decree dismissing his bill, the plaintiff appealed. The demurrer sets up several grounds, but in the view we take of the case it is necessary to consider only one of them, namely, want of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-32\">The plaintiff had an option to purchase the property in question \u201cat any time during the term of this lease.\u201d Plainly, on the allegations in the bill, this option was exercised during the additional term provided for in the renewal clause and not within the original term of the lease. Since it does not affect the result, we assume, without deciding, that the option could be validly exercised during the additional term. See note, 37 A. L. R. 1245. We also assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>that the phrase in the option \u201cupon terms suitable to the lessor\u201d did not render it so indefinite as to be unenforceable. See <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Pictorial Paper Package Corp. </em>303 Mass. 123, 131; <em>Shayeb </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>321 Mass. 429, 432; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>16 Fed. (2d) 175 (C. A. D. C.). The pivotal question in the case is whether the averments of the bill show that the term of the lease had been extended, for unless it was, the option to purchase was not validly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The words \u201crenew\u201d and \u201crenewal\u201d in a lease have come to have a settled meaning in this Commonwealth. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Maykel, </em>203 Mass. 506, 509. <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>262 Mass. 463, 465, and cases cited. Concerning the word \u201crenew\u201d it has been said that it \u201cimports the giving a new lease like the old one, with the same terms and stipulations; at the same rent and with all the essential covenants.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>99 Mass. 248, 252. This statement has often been quoted and applied in our decisions. The option to renew in the lease under consideration gave the plaintiff the right to have a new lease for the additional term, but without a formal renewal or something equivalent to it the term was not extended through the additional period. <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Maykel, </em>203 Mass. 506, 509. <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>250 Mass. 107. <em>Wit </em>v. <em>Commercial Hotel Co. </em>253 Mass. 564, 570. <em>Linden Park Garage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capitol Laundry Co. </em>284 Mass. 454, 460. Compare <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>7 Gray, 550, 552. The authority of these decisions was not impaired by anything decided in <em>Mutual Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Hoague-Sprague Corp. </em>297 Mass. 294, 299, cited by the plaintiff. In construing an option to renew similar to that in the present lease, the court said in <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Maykel, </em>203 Mass. 506; \u201cUnder the language used in the . . . lease, it was necessary that there should be, either the making of a new lease for the additional term, or a formal extension of the existing lease, or something equivalent thereto,\u201d in order to bind both parties for the additional period (page 509). The quoted language recognizes the right of the parties to extend the existing lease instead of executing a new lease. To the same effect are <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illu </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>minating Co. </em>184 Mass. 523, and <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>262 Mass. 463, 466-467. But unless one or the other of these things is done, the term is not extended. The facts alleged in the bill do not show that either of these things was done. That the \u201clessor acknowledged receipt of the notice and continued to accept the rent as provided in said lease <em>\u201d </em>and recognized that it had been extended, did not amount to an allegation that the lease had been either renewed or extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It follows that the demurrer was rightly sustained and the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
