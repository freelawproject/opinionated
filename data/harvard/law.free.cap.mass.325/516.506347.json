The employee, an operator of a nickel plating machine, in December, 1947, suffered a dermatitis arising out of and in the course of his employment, but kept at work until March 29, 1948. Reversing the single member, the reviewing board found that there was no intervening cause between December, 1947, and March 29, 1948, and that Maryland Casualty Company, the insurer at the earlier date, was hable to pay compensation. There was total incapacity until April 26, 1948, and again from June 26, 1948, until September 13, 1948, and still again from December 30, 1948. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the Superior Court, a decree was entered declaring that the disability from March 29, 1948, to April 26, 1948, was due to an injury received in December, 1947; that Maryland Casualty Company was liable to pay compensation for that period; that the two later periods of disability \u201cresulted from a new, intervening cause\u201d; and that Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation, the insurer during those periods, was liable to pay compensation therefor. The decree ordered that the case be remanded to the board \u201cfor determination of order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>of payment to C. Robert Damiani, M. D. under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 9A [as appearing in St. \u00cd938, c. 381]; and for the determination of the order of costs under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 10, as amended by St. 1947, c. 546.\u201d The employee and Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Superior Court is not empowered to. make findings of fact. <em>DePietro\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 381, 384. <em>Filosa\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 592, 596. <em>Willand\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 677, 678. Accordingly, we deem the statement in the decree respecting <em>\u201ca </em>new, intervening cause\u201d to be a ruling of law supposedly required by the findings jof the reviewing board. The contrary finding by the board, however, was warranted. The employee testified that when he returned to work on the advice of a physician in April, 1948, he was not completely cured. When he again went to work on September 13, 1948, it was as a weaver in a textile mill on dry work with no exposure to acids. \u201cAt that time his hands were a little better, but they broke out off and on \u2014 the condition would get active all the time.\u201d Dr. Damiani testified on February 23, 1949, that the dermatitis was a, continuation of one process which started in December, 1947, and that the employee\u2019s sldn had never completely cleared. The effect of this testimony was not destroyed by his other testimony, such as that in April, 1948, the witness told the employee that he could go back to work Vif he was careful on the work he did,\u201d or that when the witness first saw him in July \u201cthe fact that he had gone back to the original work and had worked on nickel and other solutions had .caused\u201d an exacerbation of the dermatitis. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Only one insurer can be charged for the same disability, and where there are several successive insurers, chargea-bility for the whole compensation rests upon the one covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relation to the disability. <em>Sylvia\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 313, 314. The finding of the board means that the only injury causally related to the disability was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of December, 1947, and so Maryland Casualty Company is exclusively liable. The case falls within the authority of <em>Wentworth\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 479, <em>McCann\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 541, <em>Davis\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 530, and <em>Rasso\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 190. It is not governed by <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600, which recognizes that compensation would be awarded against the first insurer in a case like the present, where incapacity was due to the combined effect of the original injury and later injury or injuries, and no later injury was an independent intervening cause breaking the connection between the original cause and the subsequent incapacity (page 607).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The decree failed to determine costs in the Superior Court. That should now be done in that court. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended by St. 1949, c. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The decree is reversed and the case remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs in this court shall be allowed by the single iustice' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"AsUm\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-10\"> A finding of the reviewing board was \u201cthat as a result of his injury\u201d in December, 1947, the employee \u201cwas totally incapacitated for work from March 29 to April 26, 1948, from June 26, 1948, to September 13, 1948, and since December 30, 1948.\u201d \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
