L. pTer. EdJ c. 183, \u00a7 11) given by the defendant to the plaintiff and his wife under date of October 18, 1946, conveying premises in Lawrence upon which was a store. The trial judge found for the plaintiff, and the Appellate Division dismissed the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">The alleged encumbrance was embodied in a paper or \u201cmemorandum,\u201d previously given by the defendant to one Hornsey and reading as follows: \u201cThis is to certify that the rent at 294 Lawrence Street is $25.00 a month, and that immediate occupancy may be had by Mr. Hornsey, and rent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to begin December 1, 1945, and after a period of two years rent $35.00.\u201d At the time of the conveyance to the plaintiff, Hornsey was in possession of the store. The plaintiff insists that the memorandum was a lease for a term which extended beyond the date of the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"Al0\">It is an essential element in a lease for a term that there be a demise for a period definitely fixed or at least capable of definite ascertainment. Otherwise only a tenancy at will results. <em>Cheever </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>16 Pick. 266, 271. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Hazelton, </em>121 Mass. 494, 496. <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>263 Mass. 318. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Gamester, </em>271 Mass. 55, 56-57. Compare <em>Carlisle </em>v. <em>Weiscopf, </em>237 Mass. 183. The \u201cmemorandum\u201d fixed no time at which the \"term\u201d was to end, and therefore did not create a leasehold. The reference in it to two years was not, we think, sufficient to create a term even for that period. This reference does not appear to have been inserted as fixing the limit of the time of occupancy but had to do merely with the time when the rent should be increased, if occupancy continued. Somewhat similar references to time have been held in other cases insufficient to supply the date of termination necessary to a leasehold estate. In <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Cherrington, </em>99 Mass. 229, a provision that the owner might live in the house \u201cafter two years,\u201d the tenant to retain a specified portion of the house \u201cfor such a term as may be agreeable to us both,\u201d did not create a leasehold for two years but created only a tenancy at will. In <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Shaheen, </em>273 Mass. 343, a provision whereby the owner agreed to \u201cprotect the rights\u201d of the tenant for three years and until the land should be sold did not create a leasehold for three years. In <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Stimpson, </em>83 Conn. 407, a provision that premises were leased \u201cat the monthly rate of sixty dollars ($60) per month payable in advance until July 1, 1909, when the rate shall be $75.00 per mo. . . .\u201d did not create a leasehold until July 1, 1909. The.similarity between that case and the one before us is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-37\">The tenancy at will evidenced by the \u201cmemorandum\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>terminated with the conveyance of the land. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>5 Cush. 563, 583. <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>31Mass. 536, 537. <em>Michael Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Institution for Savings, </em>321 Mass. 215, 219. <em>Chester A. Baker Inc. </em>v. <em>Shea Dry Cleaners Inc. </em>322 Mass. 311, 313. Since the premises were not occupied for dwelling purposes, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 186, \u00a7 13, has no application. Neither, for the same reason, do the Federal rent control laws apply. Act of January 30, 1942, \u00a7 2 (b), 56 U. S. Sts. at Large, 25, as amended. We are of opinion that, at least in cases to which G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 186, \u00a7 13, does not apply, a tenancy at will which is terminated by the conveyance itself, leaving the tenant a mere tenant at sufferance without right in the land <em>(Pratt </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>10 Allen, 519; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Sussman, </em>239 Mass. 283, 285-286), is not an encumbrance against which the covenants implied in the statutory forms of deeds under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 183, \u00a7\u00a710 and 11, furnish protection. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Rockwood, </em>56 Vt. 647, 648-649. <em>Dinsmore </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>68 Maine, 191. Tiffany on Real Property (3d ed.) \u00a7 1002. See <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Traip, </em>14 Gray, 330; <em>King </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>222 Mass. 261, 263; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Steavens, </em>112 Kans. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-22\">It is immaterial whether the present action be treated strictly as one for breach of the covenant against encumbrances or as one for breach of the covenant of warranty \u201cagainst the lawful claims and demands of all persons claiming by, through or under the grantor.\u201d Hornsey did not claim lawfully by, through, or under the defendant. After the conveyance Hornsey had no \u201clawful\u201d claim to the premises. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Mass. 189, 192. <em>Mar-gosian </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>288 Mass. 197, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-31\">Since the \u201cmemorandum\u201d created only a tenancy at will, and since there was no evidence of any encumbrance other than that supposed to have had its origin in the \u201cmemorandum,\u201d no breach of covenant is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-32\">The order of the Appellate Division is reversed, and judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-33\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
