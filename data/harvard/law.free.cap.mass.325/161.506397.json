The property was contained in a shed occupied by the plaintiff and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Callahan. The plaintiff went to the shed on June 15, 1944, and found that the lock had been forced and both his property and Callahan\u2019s had been removed. The plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that she saw several men and trucks engaged in removing the property of the plaintiff and Callahan. The men were unknown to her and there was no name on the trucks. The conduct of the men was not connected with the defendant. We think that the verdict for the plaintiff was not warranted by any evidence, and that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was error. The evidence was much weaker than that in <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>R. E. Cunniff, Inc. </em>314 Mass. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
