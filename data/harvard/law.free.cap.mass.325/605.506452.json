The parties have agreed that all of the facts stated in the return of the respondents are correct, and that such facts are all of the material facts. At their request the judge reported the action to this court without decision. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 213, \u00a7 IB, as inserted by St. 1939, c. 257, \u00a7 1; G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 111. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Service, </em>324 Mass. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">The petitioners are all nonveteran members of the police and fire departments of the city of Boston or of the police department of the metropolitan district commission. It is agreed that they are all within the classified civil service. The petition involves the validity of a decision of the director of civil service under an amendment to Rule 21 of the rules of the civil service commission made by virtue of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 3, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 702.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ment, which was approved by the Governor and Council on August 30, 1949, effective November 10, 1949, now reads: \u201c1. Promotions in the Classified Official Service shall be on the basis of merit ascertained by examination and seniority of service. 2. In competitive examinations for promotion to any position in the Classified Official Service the Director shall add two points to the general average mark obtained by any veteran, as defined in General Laws, Chapter 31, Section 21, providing such veteran has first obtained a passing mark in said examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The petitioners respectively took certain examinations for promotion within their departments on different days, namely, June 4, 1949, June 11, 1949, July 22, 1949, and August 19, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The return of the respondents agrees with the allegations of the petitioners, \u201cThat each of the petitioners in their respective examinations received a passing mark, and that if two points are added to the general average mark of veterans taking the same examinations the petitioners will not then be as near the top of each eligible list respectively as they otherwise would be.\u201d On November 4, 1949, the petitioners, through counsel, requested in writing a decision from the director as to the effect of the amendment to Rule 21 on the eligible lists to be established as the result of examinations taken before the effective date of the amendment. On November 16,1949, the director made a decision, and so notified counsel, to the effect that by virtue of the amendment to Rule 21 he would add two points to marks of veterans passing the promotional examinations held before November 10, 1949, which the petitioners had taken, and that these two points would be added before the eligible lists were established. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From this decision the petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>duly appealed to the civil service commission, which on November 17, 1949, denied their appeal. It is this action of the commission which the petitioners seek to quash so that the decision of the director may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The petitioners contend that the amendment to Rule 21 should not apply to marks obtained as the result of examinations for promotion held before the effective date of the amendment. They admit that rules of the civil service commission have the force of law, but assert that all statutes and such rules have a prospective effect and in the absence of plain intent should not be applied retrospectively. For the purposes of this case we do not disagree with this assertion as matter of law, but the real issue here is whether in this instance the amendment was to be applied retrospectively. We do not believe that the decision of the director produces such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The power to define the eligibility of persons seeking public employment, with exceptions not here material, rests on the Legislature which may delegate its powers to subordinate agencies of the Commonwealth, such as the civil service commission, and, to the extent that the Legislature has delegated such powers to the commission, the latter may exercise such authority and may change its determination from time to time as it sees fit. <em>Timmins </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commissioners, </em>276 Mass. 142. And it has been held that, even after an applicant\u2019s name has been placed on an eligible list, he has no right to insist that it shall retain its place. The director may revise the list by placing ahead of his name the names of disabled veterans who had failed to claim, until after the list was established, the preference accorded them under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 23, as amended by St. 1939, c. 238, \u00a7 30. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Service, </em>324 Mass. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The petitioners lay stress on the introductory words of the amendment, \u201cIn competitive examinations for promotion,\u201d as indicating that the two point preference is chronologically a part of the examination itself. However, since the two points are to be added only to the marks of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>who pass the examination, it is clear that the two points cannot be added at the time of the examination, but must be added later when the results have been finally determined, and this may not be until some time after the examination papers have been originally marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The process of obtaining promotion in the classified civil service as prescribed by c. 31 and the rules of the commission, briefly summarized, is this: After an examination is ordered by the director (\u00a7 2A [e]), he posts public notice of such examination (\u00a7 8) and prepares it (\u00a7 10). Examination is then held open to all applicants who have filed (\u00a7\u00a7 8, 13). Those taking the examination are notified of results within sixty days (\u00a7 12). Within fourteen days of notice of results an applicant may file with the director a request for a review of the markings on his examination paper, setting forth specifically in what particulars the results of the examination are allegedly incorrect (\u00a7 12A). In such case the director, within six weeks after the filing of a request for review of the markings, shall cause such examination paper and the markings thereon to be reviewed, and transmit a copy of his decision to the applicant (\u00a7 12A). Within fourteen days after notice of such decision the applicant may appeal to the commission (\u00a7 12A). After the filing of such appeal the commission shall hold a hearing, render a decision, and transmit a copy of such decision to the applicant (\u00a7 12A). Not later than six months after such examination a list of persons eligible to any position shall be prepared or revised as soon as may be after their respective ratings or standings have been determined by the director by examination <em>or otherwise in accordance with the rules of the commission </em>(\u00a7 12). The director shall combine into one list all eligible lists for the same position in the order of ratings established in examinations <em>and in accordance with the laws relating to preference to veterans and disabled veterans </em>(\u00a7 12). From the eligible list thus established persons shall be appointed and promoted upon requisition by the appointing officer upon certification by the director.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Obviously in these circumstances the director has no occasion to add two points to marks of veterans who have passed until the final results of the examination have been determined, after all appeals have been disposed of. It would seem that commonly the appropriate time to add the two points is just before the eligible list is established for only then is it certain what the final marks are to be. If this came about after November 10, 1949, the amendment to Rule 21 was then effective and the director had no choice to decide otherwise than he did and his action was not retrospective. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The petitioners also contend, from the phraseology of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 20, as appearing in St. 1947, c. 354, \u00a7 1, in its first sentence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the Legislature reserved to itself the power to make regulations altering in any degree the competitive nature of examinations for appointment and promotion in police and fire forces of cities and towns and in the police force of the metropolitan district commission. They argue that, because the Legislature specifically provided by statute, c. 31, \u00a7 23, for preference in appointment of veterans, it reserved to itself the right to provide for preference in promotions, particularly in view of the use of the words in \u00a7 20 \u201cor in the rules of the commission relative to temporary or emergency appointments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We do not agree with this contention. The petitioners disregard the use of the words \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in this chapter,\u201d which must necessarily refer to the rule making power of the commission as provided in c. 31, \u00a7 3. We believe that the amendment to Rule 21 is within the provisions of the governing statute, c. 31, and complies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>with its terms. We believe that the commission had no choice other than to make the amendment to Rule 21 because of the language in <em>MacCarthy </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Service, </em>319 Mass. 124, 126, where it was said, \u201cThe present statute . . . requires rules giving preference to \u2018veterans\u2019 in both appointment and promotion . . See opinion of Attorney General in report for the year ending June, 1945, page 53. While it may appear that if \u00a7 3 (g) and \u00a7 20 were each to be construed separately there would be conflict between them, this is not true if they are construed together, as they must be. It has been said in <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>291 Mass. 258, 260, \u201cThe statute does not attempt to say how much weight shall be given\u201d to each. It is a general rule of statutory construction that all provisions must be so construed that they can operate harmoniously together. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 736, 744. In that same opinion when this proposed amendment to Rule 21 with another amendment to the.rules not here material was under consideration it was said, \u201cIt follows that the proposed amendments to the rules are within the authority of the civil service commission to make.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We believe that \u00a7 20 provides for the elimination of noncompetitive examinations for appointment and promotion in the fire and police forces and provides for competitive examinations only. An examination otherwise competitive does not cease to be such because two points are added to the marks of all veterans who pass, for there still remains competition among veterans who pass and even among such veterans and those nonveterans who may receive marks higher than veterans with the two points added. Rule 21 as amended provides for a preference but not an absolute \u2022 one.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">If the Legislature had intended that \u00a7 20 should control \u00a7 3, it could have plainly said so when it enacted \u00a7 3 (g) by St. 1945, c. 702, to require the commission to make rules relative to veterans\u2019 preference in appointment and promotion in the classified civil service. On the contrary it is significant that in St. 1945, c. 702, the words \u201cnot inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>with this chapter\u201d as they formerly appeared in \u00a7 3 (f), now \u00a7 3 (g), were omitted. This is strong indication that the Legislature must have had in mind the language in the first sentence of \u00a7 20, for it was then substantially in its present form, and intended to avoid any conflict with it because of the rule making power in \u00a7 3.
