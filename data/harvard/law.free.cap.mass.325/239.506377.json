L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. The first count further alleges that she worked \u201cunder insufficient and antiquated lighting system\u201d and \u201cpoor lighting conditions\u201d; the second that there was a failure \u201cto provide a proper and safe place of employment\u201d and \u201cto correct the improper and inadequate lighting conditions\u201d; and the third that \u201cthe lighting conditions in the office . . . deteriorated and became inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The defendant\u2019s answer alleges, in part, that the defendant was an insured person under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Upon motion of the defendant the plaintiff was ordered to file a replication. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 34. The replication denies all the allegations in the defendant\u2019s answer, and sets up that the injury is \u201cin the nature of an occupational disease which is not a compensable disease recoverable [sic] under the terms of the workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 235, \u00a7 1. The plaintiff appealed. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">As the declaration alleges that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment, the underlying question is whether the pleadings also disclose that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is barred under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. See <em>Adiletto </em>v. <em>Brockton Cut Sole Corp. </em>322 Mass. 110. The defendant had the duty to plead that it was an insured person under the act. <em>White </em>v. <em>E. T. Slattery Co. </em>236 Mass. 28, 32. <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Twin Tanners, Inc. </em>318 Mass. 13, 17. At the hearing on the motion the parties in substance stipulated that the replication, notwithstanding its literal denial of all the allegations of the answer, should be treated by reason of its other allegations as admitting the truth of the averment that the defendant was such an insured person. It then, if material, devolved upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>plaintiff to negative waiver on her part due to any failure to give notice in writing to the defendant that she reserved her right of action at common law in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 24, as amended by St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 6. This the plaintiff does not do in her replication, which alleges rather that her injuries were not compensable under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The question thus narrows to a determination whether it could be ruled on the pleadings that the injury was of a compensable class. If it could not be so ruled, the employee, notwithstanding her omission to reserve her common law rights, may recover from her employer at common law provided she can show a breach of duty. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565, 569. <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Twin Tanners, Inc. </em>318 Mass. 13, 17. \u201cAt common law the incurring of a disease or harm to health is such a personal wrong as to warrant a recovery if the other elements of liability for tort are present.\u201d <em>Hurle\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 223, 224, and cases cited. <em>Reidy </em>v. <em>Crompton &amp; Knowles Loom Works, </em>318 Mass. 135, 139. On the other hand, if the injury could be ruled to be of a compensable class, recovery is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Ihe allegation of the replication, that the injury is \u201cin the nature of an occupational disease,\u201d the plaintiff now asserts in her brief to be an inaccuracy. However that may be, it seems clear that the declaration alleges an injury which was due to her employment, and that that injury wa,s of a compensable class in the light of our decisions, wrhich have given a broad construction to the word \u201cinjury.\u201d \u201cOur act requires only a personal injury, not personal injury by accident.\u201d <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 516, 517. \u201cIt awards compensation for disease when it rightly may be described as a personal injury. A disease . . . must come from or be an injury, although that injury need not be a single definite act but may extend over a continuous period of time. Poisoning, blindness, pneumonia, or the giving way of heart muscle, all induced by the necessary exposure or exertion of the employment, fall within well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>recognized classes of personal injuries. . . . The disease must be, or be traceable directly to, a personal injury peculiar to the employment.\u201d <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61. In addition to the cases cited in <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 516, 517-518, see <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 351, 355; <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 164; <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531; <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397; <em>DeStefano </em>v. <em>Alpha Lunch Co. of Boston, </em>308 Mass. 38; <em>Mercier\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 238, 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The allegations of the declaration do not make out a case of bodily wear and tear. Compare <em>Spalla\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 416, 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend her declaration by adding a fourth count based upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 66, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9A, was denied. She renews the motion here. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 125. The motion is nugatory, and should not be allowed. Section 66, as amended, does not apply to actions for personal injuries received by employees of an insured person or of a self insurer. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 67, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 10. See <em>Zarba </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>322 Mass. 132, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
