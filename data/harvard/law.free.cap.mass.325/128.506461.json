Before he began work for this employer, he had been examined and found to be in good physical condition. He was found to be suffering from varicose veins in his left leg when, in February, 1948, he consulted his family physician, who thought that the heavy strain on his legs due to pushing the trucks probably gradually developed these veins, although a person not engaged in heavy work might suffer from varicose veins, which is a disease in the sense that it is a pathological condition. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>physician shortly after the examination reported to the employer that there was \u201cno disability\u201d and by that he meant that the employee was perfectly able to do heavy work if he wore an elastic stocking or bandage. When he examined the employee about two weeks prior to the hearing, which was held on November 3, 1948, he found that the veins were much more marked in the left leg than in the right one. The employer\u2019s first aid room record under date of March 18, 1948, contained the notation under work limitation, \u201cno lifting, no excessive walking or standing. Must wear artificial support.\u201d The employee testified that he had a sore leg which his family physician told him was due to varicose veins but he continued to work until he was discharged. He further testified that his leg was \u201cabout the same\u201d as it was in March, 1948, and that \u201cIt bothers him once in a while now.\u201d He was paid four weeks\u2019 termination pay when his employment ended, and he had been receiving $25 a week unemployment compensation, having filed an application in which he stated that he was able to He had not sought employment because his leg was bad and he did not desire to take any chances with it. He had stayed out of work \u201cuntil this case came up.\u201d The single member, whose findings were adopted by the reviewing board, found upon all the evidence that the varicose veins were due to gradual wear and tear and did not constitute a personal injury within the workmen\u2019s compensation act. He also found that the employee had not been incapacitated for work by reason of varicose veins.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">With certain exceptions not here material, an employee, in order to obtain an award of compensation, must show a diminution of his earning capacity which is due to an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. \u201cIncapacity for work resulting from the injury\u201d is the statutory basis upon which a claim must be based for total, permanent and total, or partial disability. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, 35, in their present forms. Compensation is awarded not for the injury as such but rather for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>impairment of earning capacity caused by the injury. An injury to be compensable must be one which lessens the employee\u2019s ability to work. <em>Federico\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 430, 432. <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 533. <em>Donahue\u2019s Case, </em>292 Mass. 329, 332. <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 436. <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397, 398. <em>Bajdek\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 325, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The finding, that the employee, although suffering from varicose veins, was not thereby rendered unable to continue with his work or, in other words, that he had not shown any lessening of his ability to work, is not lacking in evi-dentiary support, <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 75, 79; <em>Josi\u2019s Case, </em>324 Mass. 415, and is decisive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
