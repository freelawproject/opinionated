Laws R. I. cap. 508, of June 25, 1875. They come here on exceptions to the decision of the Court of Common Pleas overruling motions in arrest of judgment. They are considered together because they present the same or similar questions. The first complaint is a complaint for selling. The objection to it is that the allegation that the sale was without license is deficient in certainty. The complaint alleges that, at Providence, in the county of Providence, on a day duly dated, the defendant did unlawfully sell, &amp;c., \u201c without license first had and obtained,\u201d &amp;c. The defendant contends that the allegation does not necessarily import that he was without license <em>to </em>sell, <em>when </em>he sold, and that, to make this certain, the words should have been \u201c without having <em>then and there </em>any license therefor,\u201d or others of the same significance and precision. We think the words used mean exactly the same as the words suggested, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>are sufficiently certain. Wharton Criminal Law, \u00a7 260. The second complaint, which is also a complaint for selling, is objected to on two additional grounds, to wit, that the liquor is not alleged to have been sold for any <em>price </em>alleged, and that the <em>residence </em>and <em>occupation </em>of the purchaser are not stated. We think the complaint is good without these averments. The third complaint is for unlawfully keeping for sal\u00e9, and is objected to for uncertainty. It is, however, in the usual form, and, we think, has all the certainty which can be required, considering the character of the offence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b42-8\"><em>Samuel P. </em>Colt, Assistant Attorney General, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AaD\"><em>Charles E.
