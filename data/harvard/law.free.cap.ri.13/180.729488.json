November 25 the court was not in session, and the clerk\u2019s office was closed, whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had the writ and declaration and entry fee pushed under the door of the clerk\u2019s office. The clerk afterwards marked the entry fee as paid on the papers, and November 29, at the next session of the court for civil business, Donnelly\u2019s attorney asked the trial justice to enter the case and proceed in the usual course to dispose of it.
