Of these the following are noticed in the opinion of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-10\"><em>\u201cFirst. </em>The plaintiff must not only allege that the property was taken, attached, or detained in the town of Hopkinton; but he must also prove that such was the fact, else the defendant is entitled to a verdict; and upon this question the officer\u2019s return is not sufficient. There must be evidence outside of said return.\u201d Refused, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-11\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>Although one in possession of the property of another must surrender it on the demand of the owner, if he does not know the applicant to be the owner he has a right to reasonable proof of the fact.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-12\">Refused, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-13\">\u201c <em>Fourth. </em>If Tillinghast; while in the rightful possession of the mare, traded the same with Tanner, who received it in good faith, and afterwards sold the same to the defendant, who purchased in good faith, then this action cannot be maintained by the plaintiff without evidence of a demand and refusal, or of acts amounting to a conversion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-14\">Refused, on the ground that as a demand was made and there was no delivery, that amounted to a refusal. Exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-15\"><em>\u201cFifth. </em>That the officer\u2019s return that he found the property in the possession of the defendant, in the town of Hopkinton, in said county, is not conclusive evidence of the fact.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-16\">Refused, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cEighth. That the defendant had at least aright of redemption, and so a right to see the mortgage and to know how much was due upon it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">Refused, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\"><em>\u201cEleventh. </em>That the Rhode Island statute as to registering personal property mortgages differs from those of other States, in that it does not provide that leaving for record shall have the same effect as recording, but simply provides that if recorded it shall be valid, notwithstanding possession is not delivered, and so it is necessary under our statute that a mortgage of personal property which remains in the possession of the mortgagor should be actually recorded in order to be valid as a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser or a creditor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">Refused, and exception taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">Gen. Stat. R. I. cap. 165, \u00a7 9, provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">\u201cNo mortgage of personal property hereafter made shall be valid against any other person than the parties thereto, unless possession of the mortgaged property be delivered to and retained by the mortgagee ; or unless the said mortgage be recorded in the office of the clerk of the town where the mortgagor shall reside, if in this State, and if not, where the property is at the time of making the -same: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall affect any transfer of property under bottomry or respondentia bonds, or of any ship or goods at sea or abroad, if the mortgagee shall take possession thereof as soon as may be after the arrival of the same in this State.\u201d</summary>\n<court data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b390-10\">Providence,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AhH\"><em>July </em>12, 1881.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AyG\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ABm\">We think the writ without amendment is fatally defective for want of the allegations indicated in the third specification of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and in his motion in arrest of judgment. The first and last exceptions are therefore sustained. We think, however, that the plaintiff ought to have leave to amend, if he asks for it, on terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">We think an officer\u2019s return is evidence of facts stated in it in so far, and only in so far, as it is responsive to the precept. The return is not responsive to the precept in our opinion in its statement that the property replevied was found in the town of Hopkinton. The exceptions therefore for refusals to charge according to the first and fifth requests are sustained.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Samuel W. K. </em>Allen, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AgL\"><em>Peabody f </em>Grafts, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">However the rule may be in trover, where the gist of the action is tortious conversion, we think that in replevin the plaintiff, after demanding the property of the defendant, is not obliged to give the defendant opportunity to satisfy himself of the rightfulness of the demand before <em>suit; </em>but that, being entitled to immediate possession of the property, he may immediately replevy it, if the demand is not complied with. Exceptions for refusal to charge according to the second, fourth, and eighth requests are therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We think that a chattel mortgage is to be regarded as recorded within the meaning of Gen. Stat. R. I. cap. 165, \u00a7 9 (providing that the mortgage, without delivery of the mortgaged property, shall not be valid against any person but the parties to it unless the mortgage be recorded), when it is lodged for record with the proper recording officer at his office. 1 Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 542. The exception for refusal to charge according to the eleventh request is therefore overruled. We wish to add, however, that in our opinion such a mortgage cannot be deemed to be either recorded or lodged for record when it is merely left with the recording officer with instructions not to record it, or not to record it until notified to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The other exceptions are overruled. The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is set aside, and the case remanded for new trial or further proceeding. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
