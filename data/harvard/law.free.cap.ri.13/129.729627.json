Stat. R. I. cap. 59. The appellant asked the presiding justice in the Court of Common Pleas to quash the proceedings of the town council, because :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-10\">1. The record did not show, as by law it ought and must, that the town council appointed three suitable and indifferent men, not interested nor concerned in the land through which said highway was to pass, \u201c for the due marking out \u201d of said highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-11\">2.

Stat. R. I. cap. 5'9, \u00a7 2, to mark out the highway, having been petitioners for the highway, cannot be regarded as \u201cindifferent men,\u201d and therefore, for that reason alone, the other ground for quashing the- proceeding, even if valid at common law, being untenable under Pub. Laws R. I. cap. 681, \u00a7 2, of April 12, 1878, we overrule the exceptions and affirm the judgment of the court below, with costs. <em>Ex parte Hinckley, 8 </em>Me. 146; <em>State </em>v. <em>Delesdernier, </em>11 Me. 473; <em>Hazard </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>12 R.
