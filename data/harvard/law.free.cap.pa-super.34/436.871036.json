E. Robbins as the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">On March 28, 1906, upon affidavit of the plaintiff that a mistake had been made in the name of the defendant by describing it as a corporation, the court permitted the statement of claim to be amended by adding after the name \u201c Order of Americus,\u201d the following: \u201c An unincorporated, fraternal, beneficial society duly organized under the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and composed of Lee W. Squire, Edwin E. Robbins and others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">No alias summons was issued, and when the cause was tried on October 16, 1906, the defendant presented a point for charges as follows : \u201c That under the pleadings in this case no verdict can be had against the defendant, because the remedy, if any, is by a bill in equity, and not by an action of assumpsit,\u201d which was affirmed by the court, and a verdict directed for the defendant under authority of Fletcher v. Gawanese Tribe, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 393. The decision of this court in . that case controls us in this one and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-9\">Henderson, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
