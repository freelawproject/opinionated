Plaintiff had previously received from the Verona bank a forged letter advising it of this draft, and requesting plaintiff to cash it, and also had previously received a forged telegram purporting to come from Verona in confirmation of the letter. The telegraph company had no office at Verona. The plaintiff was not a correspondent of the Verona bank, and there was no legal duty upon it to pay the draft. Plaintiff had a bank directory, which, if examined, would have shown that the cashier\u2019s name signed to the letter and telegram, was wrongly spelled. The telegram if read without reference to the letter, was unintelligible. The man to whom the payment was made was not identified. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed error in not directing a verdict for the defendant.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b526-8\">Argued May 15, 1907.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkYB\">Appeal, No. 68, April T., 1907, by defendant, from judgment of C.

That is, negligence being a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, it is for the jury to consider all the surrounding circumstances and say whether the defendant\u2019s act or omission was or- was not violative of this obligation : McCully v.

It must not onl}r be a cause, but it must be the proximate cause; that is, the direct and immediate cause of the injury: Jones on Telegraph and Telephone Companies, sec. 195; Fairbanks v.

M., a letter purporting to have been mailed at Verona, Allegheny county, Pa., and on the stationery of the First National Bank of Verona, viz.:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u201cNo. 4877.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">R.

E. Armstrong. And he then took the paper and went to the desk and indorsed it and came back and asked me, if I didn\u2019t get a telegram from Mr. Barger at Verona, and I didn\u2019t answer him for a little while, and I said, \u2018yes, I had no evidence that you are C. E. Armstrong.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, Mr. Barger had informed him that he would send this telegram, that he wouldn\u2019t have any trouble in getting the money on it.\u2019 I noticed the draft was dated on the same day he was there and asked him \u2018 why he didn\u2019t get the money and bring it with him.\u2019 He said, for two reasons : He had got this draft after banking hours on Saturchay, and Mr. Barger told him all bank\u2019s business that they do after banking hours goes over to the next regular day for doing business, and he didn\u2019t care to carry the money.\u201d \u201c Q. You told him you didn\u2019t know him? A. Yes, sir. I didn\u2019t know him only by the telegram. Q. Did you ask him where he lived? A. No, I didn\u2019t. Q. Did you ask him what his business was ? A. I don\u2019t know that I asked him that. I asked him what he was doing in that neighborhood. He told me he was buying poultry and produce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The draft was paid by the plaintiff bank to the unidentified stranger, and soon thereafter it was learned that the letter, telegram and draft were forgeries, and that the defendant company did not have an office at Verona, Pa. The Wampum bank did not know of the bank at Verona, and never had any business transactions with it, but did have a directory giving its location and officials, which, on examination, showed that the cashier\u2019s name was spelled Bargar instead of Barger on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>letter and telegram. A proper notice was served on the defendant within sixty days, and this suit brought to recover damages sustained by reason of the defendant neglecting \u201c to exercise that degree of care and caution which the nature of its business demanded.\u201d The act of negligence charged against the defendant \u201c was in delivering, as genuine, a message authorizing and directing the paying of money by the person to whom it is addressed, purporting to have been sent from aplace where the company did not have an office, and from which place said company did not transmit the message,\u201d as stated and affirmed in the plaintiff\u2019s second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\">The transaction was out of the ordinary course of business, and, taking the case as of the moment when the draft was cashed, it must be conceded that the telegram, if read without reference to the letter, would be unintelligible, and if the letter had not been received the draft would not have been paid. Neither of these communications, taken separately, could be-said to be the inducing cause of the loss. As the draft was. directed to the Hanover Bank of New York there was no legal duty on the Wampum bank to honor and cash it, and, in so-doing, the latter bank volunteered to do a gratuitous act. It. was not a correspondent of the Verona bank; did not then know the name of its cashier, and hence could not know his. signature. The bank directory at hand was not consulted to-identify the name of the Verona bank\u2019s cashier, and when subsequent^ examined it showed a material difference in the-way the name was spelled. Further, the payment was made to an unidentified stranger on the faith of a letter which obviously bore an improbable date, and also on a telegram which, had been orally transmitted by telephone. On the trial there-was no dispute in regard to the facts, and after refusing-to enter a nonsuit, the court unqualifiedly affirmed the following points submitted by the defendant: \u201c Fourth, that if the-jury find that the plaintiff paid the draft in evidence, relying-both upon the letter and the telegram in evidence, the plaintiff is nob entitled to recover. Fifth, that even if the telegraph, company should be found to be in default in delivering the1 telegram in question, yet if its default was made mischievous, to the plaintiff by the operation of some other intervening-cause, to wit: the letter, the defendant company cannot be held. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>liable for the loss. Ninth, that if the jury find that in the payment of the draft the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence the plaintiff cannot recover,\u201d but refused the tenth, \u201c that under- all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">The law does not undertake to hold a person who is chargeable with a breach of duty towards another with all the possible consequences of his wrongful act. It, in general, takes cognizance only of those consequences which are the natural and probable result of the wrong complained of, and which in the language of Pollock, C. B., in Rigby v. Hewitt, 5 Exch. 240, may reasonably be expected to result, under ordinary circumstances, from the misconduct. Every injury is preceded by circumstances, if any one of which had been wanting the injury would not have happened.. In some sense, therefore, each is a cause of the injury, but to fasten legal responsibility for the injury -upon every person whose wrongful act, however remote therefrom, had contributed to bring about a situation or condition which made the injury possible, would be an impracticable rule, and one which if enforced would in most cases inflict a punishment wholly disproportionate to the wrong: Lowery v. Western Union Tel. Co., 60 N. Y. 198; s. c., 19 Am. Rep. 154. Although it may be clear that except for the wrong of the defendant the loss would not have happened, yet there must be a direct connection between the wrong complained of and the resulting injury; in the contemplation of law they must stand together as cause and effect so as to give a right of action against the wrongdoer and make him chargeable with the loss. It is not every breach of duty that will be a sufficient ground on which to base an action, for while it may be an inducing cause which brings about a loss or injury, yet it may not be the direct, natural or proximate cause of such injury. The proximate cause of the injury may be one of the results of the breach of the operator\u2019s duty, but this may be influenced by other intermediate causes which would affect the operators breach of duty, although being merely a remote or indirect cause of the injury, and which fact would relieve the company from liability: Jones on Telegraph &amp; Telephone Companies, sec. 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Where-the effect of the evidence is merely to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>there are two independent causes, either one of which may have been the proximate cause of the .injury, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show that the cause for which the defendant is responsible was the one which produced the injury : Ahern v. Melvin, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 462. And whe're there is an alleged proximate cause admittedly dependent upon another in producing the injury, and which other cause is in no way induced by the defendant, the evidence should be clear that the one relied upon by the plaintiff was the sole proximate cause. Such could not be urged in this case, inasmuch as the letter and telegram are necessarily joined'as inducing causes of the plaintiff\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Nor is it enough to say that the telegram materially contributed in producing the loss, and that without it the forged letter might not have caused it. How much or in what degree the cashier would have been influenced by the one forgery, supplemented by the blandishments of the forger, is purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">If the plaintiff, or party injured, by the exercise of ordinary care might have avoided the consequences of the company\u2019s negligence, but did not, the case is one of mutual fault and the law will neither cast all the consequences upon the company, nor will it attempt any apportionment thereof: Cooley on Torts, 674. The fact remains undisputed, that the cashier of the plaintiff ignored all business precaution, and volunteered without any inquiry, to deal with an unknown. He cannot admit his contributory negligence (the facts being undisputed the law so measures his conduct) and then recover when such negligence contributed to his loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">While it is true that contributory negligence cannot be treated as one of law, unless the facts and inferences to be drawn from them are free from doubt (Kuntz v. New York, etc., Railroad Co., 206 Pa. 162), yet where the facts are clearly established and the inferences of negligence from them manifest, the court should peremptorily so instruct the jury: Gramlich v. Wurst, 86 Pa. 74; Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. v. Greiner, 113 Pa. 600; Delaware, etc., Railroad Co. v. Cadow. 120 Pa. 559; Coolbroth v. Penna. R. R. Co., 209 Pa. 433; Cohen v. Phila. &amp; Reading R. R. Co., 211 Pa. 227; Bannon v. Penna. R. R. Co., 29 Pa. Superior Ct. 231. There is no question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>as to the credibility of witnesses \u2014 there is no controversy as to the facts they narrate. Is there any doubt as to the natural and reasonable inferences to be drawn from their undisputed testimony? Is there room for drawing inferences founded upon reason or common sense to justify such credulity in a transaction between a banker and a stranger, and particularly so when the banker is not under any duty to act at all? The undisputed testimony establishes facts and circumstances'which would reasonably and naturally arouse inquiry and suspicion in the mind of a person of ordinary prudence and intelligence in a like situation. The law requires that such warnings shall be heeded,1 and if ignored the sufferer is without remedy. Contributory negligence is matter of defense, and the onus probandi is on the defendant unless the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence sufficiently discloses the fact of contributory negligence. In that event the plaintiff cannot recover, and the defendant is relieved from the necessity of proving what has already been established by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence: Baker v. Gas Co., 157 Pa. 593; Sopherstein v. Bertels, 178 Pa. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">Taken in its most favorable light the plaintiff\u2019s loss was due to its own- disregard of care, and there were no facts nor inferences to be reasonably drawn from them to justify a jury in finding that the bank did not rely on both the letter and the telegram, or that the forged telegram was not made mischievous to the bank by the intervention of the letter.. Where a case is submitted to a jury upon clearly insufficient evidence, such as no court should sustain a verdict upon, it is our plain duty to reverse: Cauffman v. Long, 82 Pa. 72. The defendant\u2019s tenth, point \u2014 that under all the evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant, should have been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
