Such action is within the discretion of the court, and a very plain case of the abuse of its discretion ought to be exhibited by the record to warrant an appeal.

On March 26, 1907, the court on motion of counsel for the defendant quashed the constable\u2019s return and discharged the defendant, by an order indorsed on said motion to quash, which order is as follows : \u201c March 26, 1907, the constable\u2019s return is quashed and the defendant is discharged.

But, apart from that consideration, the appeal must be dismissed. Conceding the power of the quarter sessions, before indictment found, to is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sue process upon a constable\u2019s return to bring in the person charged with violation of the liquor laws, the court is not bound to award such process, or to hold the accused to bail, or, in default of bail, to commit him to prison, no matter how informal, ambiguous or lacking in certainty the return may be. The question of the formality and certainty that will be required in a constable\u2019s return, before proceeding in this summary way, is addressed in the first instance to the sound judgment and discretion of the quarter sessions, and awery plain case of abuse of its discretion ought to be exhibited by the record in order to warrant an appeal. We cannot say that such a case is presented by this record. And if the court in the exercise of a sound discretion could have refused the motion for process on the return, it was not reversible error to discharge the accused \u2014 no indictment having been found in the meantime \u2014 if upon more mature consideration it was the court\u2019s conclusion that the process ought not to have been awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">The appeal is quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
