L. 190.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-10\">The petitioners are here appealing to this court under a statutory proceeding, and it is a well-known principle of law that a statute must be strictly construed ; therefore, unless it can be shown that the executor has violated the authority given by the will or that he has mismanaged or is jeopardizing the estate, the petition of the legatees must be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-11\">In their petition they have alleged two grounds on which they ask this court to make the executor give security \u2014 first, that he has sold and conveyed to the Pennsylvania Coal Company a large and valuable tract of coal, being a large part of the value of the real estate belonging to the estate, without authority, and causing the coal to be mined and is using the proceeds thereof for his own purposes ; second, that for several years past, he has become intemperate in his habits and is using the personal property in his possession in a reckless and careless manner, and that the petitioners fear that at the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>piration of the period of time when the legacies become payable, not enough money belonging to the estate may be found to pay the legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">This proceeding, to a considerable extent, involves the construction of the will of the testator, from which it becomes necessary to give some pertinent extracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">By the will, the testator first bequeaths, by clause one, to his wife, all the furniture, chattels, effects, etc., in and about his dwelling house; and by clause two, bequeaths to his son William, all his right, title and interest in certain contracts made by the testator for the sale of various tracts of land in Dunmore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">He next directs by clause three, that, \u201c All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, real and personal, wheresoever the same may be, I give and devise unto my said wife Mary Jane, during her natural life.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">He then, by clause four, directs that, <em>\u201c </em>From and after the decease of my wife, I give and bequeath as follows: Unto my grand-daughter, Alice Vickers, I give and bequeath three thousand dollars, to be paid by my executor within three years from the death of my wife.

All of the personal property belonged, therefore, to the wife absolutely, if she cared to use it, during her natural life, as will appear from the following cases: Markley\u2019s Est., 132 Pa. 352; Gold\u2019s Estate, 133 Pa. 495; Heppenstail\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 259.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-8\">In 1897, after paying many of the expenses necessary and incidental to administering the estate, the executor had in his possession about $600 belonging to the estate. There was no income from the estate ; taxes, insurance and expenses of repairs had to met; the widow maintained; on January 20,1898, a legacy of $1,000 would be due the granddaughter, May; on April 6, 1900, a legacy of $1,000 would be due the granddaughter, Lois; on January 30, 1904, a legacy of $1,000 would be due the granddaughter, Mary Jane, and without money coming in that the executor could use, he proceeded under the clause in the will which authorized him to dispose of the real estate when needed to carry out the provisions of the will, .namely, clause seven, in which testator authorized his executor to sell any and all real estate \u201c whenever it shall be necessary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-9\">In the absence of proof of error or mistake or willful disregard of duty, the court will not interfere. with the exercise by executors, in their discretion, of a power to sell real estate: Castor\u2019s Estate, 16 Phila. 360.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-10\">The testator in naming Mark C.

L. 190, and should be required to give security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-8\">What has the executor done, not authorized by the will, and to sustain the allegations of mismanagement of the estate or the property under his charge? The mismanagement alleged is that the executor built a house and mingled his own funds with the funds of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-9\">The Pennsylvania Coal Company has paid the executor in royalties for 35,163 tons of coal mined, since the making of the lease in 1897, the sum of $13,900. The executor has made disbursements up to March 25, 1905, a date prior to the death of the widow, for maintenance of the widow; legacies amount-ins to $3,000; necessary charges of taxes, insurance and repairs ; built a new house at the cost of $4,300 on land belonging to the estate; and has a balance in the bank of $2,723.83.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-10\">Inasmuch as the new house was built in the j-ear 1900, during the lifetime of the widow, and a second partial account, taking credit for the payments for the new house, filed March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>25, 1905, and no exceptions thereto being taken, it cannot be contended that the building of, and the payment for, the new house is mismanagement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-4\">There is no testimony whatever of the application by the executor of the funds of the testator to the payment of his own debts, as in McKennau\u2019s Appeal, or that the moneys have been used in trade or business or gross dereliction of duty as in the estate of Williamson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">This proceeding was begun November 13, 1905, and the first hearing was on, and testimony taken December 11, 1905. On December 20, 1905, the executor deposited in the bank to the credit of the estate of G. W. Simpson the sum of $3,015. At the hearing on January 22,1906, the respondent testified \u201c that I had no money in the bank in the estate\u2019s account \u201d at the time of the former hearing, and that the money of the estate was included in his own account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">Among the first duties of an executor or other trustee is to separate the moneys of the trust from his own, and deposit the same not in his own individual name, but in his name as an executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">It was improper and an unlawful act for the executor to mix the trust funds to any extent Avith his own. However clear it may be that it Avas Avithout any dishonest intention of making gain to himself, such a practice ought never come before a court without being in some way marked with its disapprobation. The mingling of the estate\u2019s money with his own is an indefensible practice which has always been condemned by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">When the executor is authorized to sell the real estate at such time as he may deem necessary to carry out the provisions of the will and he does so, acting in good faith and under advice of counsel, and although depositing the money received from the royalties in his own personal account, does not use the same for his own purposes, and is always ready to make distribution when necessary and pay legacies Avhen due, we are not prepared to visit him with the penalty of compelling him to enter security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">The money deposited in the bank since the commencement of this proceeding is noAV money of the estate, but it was not such till after the death of the Avidow, in June, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The undisputed testimony shows the value of the real estate to be from $15,000 to $17,000, exclusive of the coal; that there remains to be mined, including the 17,000 tons in the pillars, from 29,000 to 30,000 tons of coal, and that is deposited in the bank to the credit of the estate about $2,700. The security is therefore ample for the legacies, amounting to $5,500, which are not yet due. The testimony fails to show any neglect or mismanagement of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">With regard to the testimony as to the alleged intemperate habits, one witness testified that he saw the respondent intoxicated about eight years ago, a second witness that he saw him intoxicated about fourteen months ago, and a third witness that shortly after the death of the respondent\u2019s wife in May, 1904, she saw him intoxicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">But with this insufficient testimony it is not shown that he is wasting or mismanaging the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">It is contrary to the spirit of the law to ask an executor, in whom the testator had confidence, to give security, unless he is wasting or mismanaging the estate. This is very clearly and distinctly set forth in Parsons\u2019 Estate, 82 Pa. 465, where the court, inter alia, saj\u2019s : \u201c It must clearly appear that the executor is wasting or mismanaging the property or estate under his charge, or that for any reason the estate or property is likely to be jeopardized by the continuance of such executor before the court can interfere.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">Now, April 7, 1906, the petition to show cause why Mark C.

By his will he made the following provisions for his widow who survived him, viz.: \u201cI give and bequeath to my wife Mary Jane Simpson, all the books, paintings, linen, china, household goods, furniture, chattels and effects (other than money or securities for money) which shall, at my death, be in and about my dwelling house at Dunmore, Pa.\u201d After giving to his son William the moneys due the testator on a number of contracts for the sale of real estate made in his lifetime, aggregating about $5,000, he further provides as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, wheresoever the same may be, I give and devise-unto my said wife, Mary Jane during her natural life.\u201d The testator then proceeded to bequeath to certain grandchildren, the appellants, specific money legacies payable at certain stated periods after the death of his wife, the earliest of these, in point of time, maturing three years after the date of that event. As the widow survived until June, 1905, no one of these legacies has yet become payable. In the aggregate they amount to $5,500, the first falling due in 1908, the last in 1910. The testator also bequeathed to each of three grandchildren, daughters of his son Mark, the appellee, the sum of $1,000, payable when each should reach the age of eighteen years. These three legacies matured in the lifetime of the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The testator finally provided as follows : \u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, I give, devise and bequeath unto my son Mark C. Simpson, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d He then appointed his son .Mark sole executor and gave to him \u201cfull power and authority' to grant, bargain and sell any and all real estate of which I may die possessed, etc., whenever it shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of my will,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">When, therefore, the legacies in favor of the appellee\u2019s children fell due, it became his duty to provide the necessary funds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>pay them. There was no personal estate from 'which the money could he raised because it had all been previously appropriated by the bequests to the son William and the widow. The latter, as the court below properly held under the authority of Marldey\u2019s Estate, 132 Pa. 352; Gold\u2019s Estate, 133 Pa. 495; Heppenstall\u2019s Estate, 144 Pa. 259, must be regarded as the first object of the testator\u2019s bounty. She was entitled to the possession of the entire personal estate, save the money given to William, and to consume it if she chose to do so. The executor, therefore, did nothing more than he was fully authorized to do, both by the letter and spirit of the will, when in 1897, he executed a lease of the coal underlying the land of which testator died seized. This lease was so drawn that tire mining of the coal therein authorized would extend over a period of years producing annual payments to the estate proportioned to the amount of coal mined.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In November, 1905, the appellants filed a petition in the orphans\u2019 court, under the Act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 190, praying for a decree requiring the executor to give security for the payment of their legacies as they would become due, and assigning as reasons therefor, (a) that the executor had made sale of said coal not for the purpose of carrying out the will of the testator, \u201c but for his own use, and is causing the coal to be mined and is using the proceeds thereof for his own uses and purposes; \u201d and (b) because \u201c for several years past the said respondent has become intemperate in his habits, and is using the personal property in his possession in a reckless and careless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The learned court below found the testimony offered in support of the latter allegation to be trivial and insufficient. He could not well have found otherwise. Indeed we do not understand that the appellants now press this as a ground for a reversal. As to the remaining averment in the petition of waste and mismanagement, based on an unnecessary sale or lease of the coal, the court finds that the executor had received in roj'alties down to the time of hearing, #13,900, and expended the same in large part as follows, viz.: \u201c The executor has made disbursements up to' March 25, 1905, a date prior to the death of the widow, for maintenance of the widow; legacies amounting to #3000 ; necessary charges of taxes, insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>and. repairs; built a new bouse, at a cost of $4,300, on land belonging to the estate; and lias a balance in bank of $2,723.83.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The answer of the respondent sets forth the detailed expenditures under each of the several heads generalized by the court and we do not understand the correctness of these figures to be assailed. The court further finds that \u201cthe undisputed testimony shows the value of the real estate to be from $15,000 to $17,000 exclusive of the coal; that there remains to be mined, including the 17,000 tons in the pillars, from 29,000 to 30,000 tons of coal; and that there is deposited in bank to the credit of the estate about $2,700.\u201d The testimony shows that the lessor not only reserved, from the operation of the lease, what is known as the \u201c upper vein,\u201d but that he also reserved one-third of the three lower veins included in the lease, so that, as the engineer testifies, \u201c they are bound to leave the one-third of the coal in.\u201d The conclusion therefore reached by the lower court, viz.: \u201cthe .security is ample for' the legacies, amounting to $5,500, which are not yet due; the testimony fails to show any neglect or mismanagement of the estate,\u201d is almost irresistible.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">It did appear in the testimony, although it was not averred in the petition, that at an earlier date, when there was but little money in his hands, the executor had failed to keep a separate bank account of the trust funds in his hands, thus permitting them to be mingled with his own. Inasmuch as the entire estate belonged to the executor in his own light as residuary legatee, subject only to a liability to pay the legacies of appellants when due; as the property yet undisposed of was ample to extinguish this liability and as the irregularity had been corrected by the opening of a proper account in which the trust funds were being regularly deposited, the learned court, whilst noting the impropriety of the past conduct of the appellee, did not feel warranted, under all the circumstances, in compelling the executor to give security. In this we see no abuse of the powers conferred by the statute. On every branch of the case the opinion filed so fully vindicates the decree entered that it ought to have convinced the appellants they had no substantial ground for complaint. The assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Decree affirmed at the costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
