He died November 1,1900, without having paid over this money. More than two years after Koering\u2019s death, his real estate was sold, and the proceeds became the fund for distribution in this proceeding. The commonwealth claimed out of the fund the escheat money due by the decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The auditing judge disallowed the claim, but on exceptions the fund was distributed to the commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">On motion a reargument was allowed, and Hawkins, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">The claim presented in this case should be rejected on these grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-11\">The commonwealth having been expressly named as one of the objects of litigation in the act of February 24, 1834, its claim is thereby taken out of the general rule of exemption from the running of the statute of limitation : State v. Crutcher, 2 Swan, 504. The 21st section of that act provides that, \u201c All debts owing by any person within this State,\u201d shall be paid in. \u00a1 a prescribed order, including \u201c debts due the Commonwealth,\u201d which are placed last; and these are necessarily the same \u201c debts \u201d whose lien is limited by the 24th section of the same act to five years, unless an action at law be commenced and duly prosecuted. The fact that debts due the commonwealth were ordered to be paid last was said in Mitchell\u2019s Estate, 2 Watts, 87, to manifest an.intention to abandon any supposed preference which the commonwealth might otherwise have had under the rule of common law. \u201c The maxim of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>law does not apply when from the whole Act a contrary intention can be collected.\u201d The whole scope and spirit of the act shows that it is intended to prevent heirs and purchasers from being surprised by claims against decedent himself not placed on the record in proper time: Cobaugh\u2019s Appeal, 24 Pa. 143. \u201c The great object of the Act,\u201d said the court in Oliver\u2019s Appeal, 101 Pa. 299, \u201c was to quiet the title of heirs and devisees, and purchasers from them, of lands derived from decedents. It was only necessary for the purchaser or mortgagee to resort to a single office, the prothonotary of the county, to ascertain whether or not any action had been brought or copy or statement of any judgment filed within the period of five years from decedent\u2019s death. If there was no mortgage or judgment at the time of his death and the office of the prothonotary was clear of any action or statement of demand, he might rest perfectly secured that his title was unincumbered by any debts or judgments against the estate of the decedent, whatever the nature of the judgment might be.\u201d Debts due the commonwealth were just as much within this purpose as those of its citizens. It was just as important to heirs, devisees and purchasers that the land should be freed from the lien of debts of this class as any other. They could not \u201c rest perfectly secure \u201d until debts of every nature had been satisfied. The right of the commonwealth to lien at all rises out of the system of statutory law of which this act is part, and it is as much bound by the rules prescribed for the administration of justice as any citizen- Attorney General v. Radloff, 10 Exch. 84, Pollock, C. B.; Mitchell\u2019s Estate, 2 Watts, 87. It is for this reason that the commonwealth is bound to present its claim on audit of the administrator\u2019s account: Mitchell\u2019s Estate, 2 Watts, 87; and there is just as much reason why it should bring an action to continue a lien which must otherwise cease to exist. An analogous case is found in that line of cases in which it has been held that the commonwealth gains no preference over other creditors when it fails to file the statement required by the act of 1827: Gladden v. Chapman, 188 Pa. 586. The policy of the law to facilitate the settlement of estates and unshackle titles and discourage secret liens is in the interest of public prosperity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">The commonwealth, having failed to bring action as prescribed by the act of 1834 and its supplements, has lost its lien.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AIcH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>October 7, 1907:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was disallowance of commonwealth\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-5\"><em>T.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The question involved is thus stated by appellant\u2019s counsel: Whether a debt due the commonwealth from a decedent is an indefinite lien upon real estate owned by him at his death, generally, or against heirs and devisees. It is settled by the decisions cited in their exhaustive brief that the legislature shall not be taken to have postponed a public right to that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>an individual, \u201cunless such an intent be manifested by explicit terms (as it has been in the order of paying a decedent\u2019s debts) or at least by a necessary and irresistible implication,\u201d and that this principle is applicable in the construction of statutes of limitation: Commonwealth v. Baldwin, 1 Watts, 54; McKeehan v. Commonwealth, 3 Pa. 151; Commonwealth v. Johnson, 6 Pa. 136. By the twenty-first section of the Act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 70, which prescribes the manner in which the debts of decedents shall be paid, it is provided that debts due to the commonwealth shall be paid last, and the twenty-fourth section provided that \u201c no debts of a decedent, except they be secured by mortgage or judgment, shall remain a lien on the real estate of such decedent longer than five years after the decease of such debtor,\u201d unless certain things were done by the creditor within that period. That the legislature had directly in mind, in this enactment relative to the estates of decedents, debts due to the commonwealth, expressly appears and does not depend upon mere inference. The two sections relate to the same general subject, namely, the debts of decedents, and should be construed together. Observing the generality of the words \u201c all debts,\u201d in the twenty-first section, and of the words \u201c no debts,\u201d in the twenty-fourth section, noticing that in the former section there is manifested an intention to abandon any supposed right of priority over debts due individuals which debts due the commonwealth might otherwise have had under the rule of the common law, observing further that in the latter section certain kinds of debts are excepted and that debts due the commonwealth are not mentioned in the exception, and bearing in mind that it is a statute of repose as well as of limitation and was intended to prevent devisees, heirs and purchasers from being surprised by claims against the decedent not placed on record in proper time, we conclude that the requirements of the common-law rule of construction were fully met and\u2019that the limitation of the twenty-fourth section applied to debts due the commonwealth as well as to debts due to individuals. In other words, there is \u201c a necessary and irresistible implication \u201d of a legislative intent that the limitation should apply to all of the debts that are expressly mentioned in the twenty-first section and are not excepted in the twenty-fourth section. This con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>elusion is so well supported by the opinion filed by the court below after reargument that it is unnecessary for us to discuss that proposition further.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The legislature having abolished the distinction as to debts of decedents between those due to the commonwealth and those due to individuals, so far as lien upon real estate is concerned, the question arises, whether this distinction was revived by the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 392. This is a very different question from that which would be presented if the act of 1893 were the first legislation upon the subject of the limitation of the lien of decedents\u2019 debts, or were to be construed entirely independently of the act of 1834, and must be answered in the negative. And if the distinction was not revived by that act, it certainly was not by the amendatory Act of June 14, 1901, P. L. 562. The first section of the act of 1893, is a literal transcript of the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1834, except in these particulars: the word \u201c two \u201d is substituted for the word \u201c five \u201d in the designation of the period of limitation; the words \u201cto judgment\u201d are added after the words \u201c duly prosecuted \u201d; and there is added at the end of the section a clause relative to the duty of the prothonotary, which has no bearing whatever on the question before us. Leaving this last clause out of view (as we are justified in doing) the section, so far as it relates to the subject now under consideration, is a re-enactment in identical terms of the provisions of the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1834, except that the period of limitation is reduced from five to two years. This being so, and there being nothing in the context to show a contrary intent, we are warranted in presuming that it was intended by the legislature that it should take the place of that section in the general system of laws relative to executors aud administrators and the estates of decedents of which it formed a part, and that no debts should be excluded from its operation that were not excluded from the operation of that section. The revival of the original law by the repeal of a repealing law resting, as it does, upon the presumption of legislative intent, does not occur in any case where the contrary intent appears, and we are of opinion that such contrary intent is apparent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
