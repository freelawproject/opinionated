Such relief is generally withheld unless the parties can be restored substantially to their position at the time the contract was made. If this cannot be done the court will relieve only where the clearest and strongest equity imperatively demands it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b571-13\">Mistake, to be available in equity, must not have arisen from negligence, where the means of knowledge were easily accessible.

The deed was executed and delivered June 19,1900, and was soon thereafter placed on record by the defendant. It is absolute on its face, contains covenants of general warranty, and is without any reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">At a meeting of the corporation held July 13, 1900, the plaintiff acted as the presiding officer when the following action in regard to this property was taken, as shown by the minutes, \u201cIn the matter of purchase of ground for mill site, it was moved and seconded, that the site offered by the Gailey Lumber Company (the plaintiff) and the conditions and terms as made by them, together with the full description and boundaries of same as fully set forth in deed be accepted. It was then moved and .seconded that the president and secretary be instructed to sign the necessary papers to complete the deal; on being put to vote same was carried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Following this, on July 14, the defendant company executed a mortgage on said land to the plaintiff, who on July 18 assigned the mortgage to Sarah A. Flinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The reason urged for the reformation of the deed was the mutual mistake of the parties in not including the reservation of the.right and privilege as set out in the bill, and that the deed, by reason thereof, \u201c does not express the agreement and intention of the parties, the omission having been accidentally overlooked by both parties.\u201d After the delivery of the deed the plaintiff, being a stockholder and director of the corporation, sold a large amount of the stock owned by him to different persons, without any mention of his claim to said reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The deed and the mortgage were prepared by a prominent member of the bar, who was selected by the plaintiff, and no mention was made of such a reservation or direction given in relation thereto. R. K. Aiken, Escp (who was also the attornej of Mrs. Flinn), testified, viz.: \u201c As attorney for Mrs. Flinn, who took the assignment of the mortgage, I was particularly careful with reference to the preparation of the deed and mortgage and feel satisfied would not have omitted anything that would prejudice Mrs. Flinn and her interests, so for that reason I tried to be careful, and have no recollection whatever of omitting anything, but protected everything that was spoken about.\u201d It is not suggested that any instructions were given to the counsel to insert any reservation, or that he made any mistake in discharging his duty. When the plaintiff was asked, \u201c How does it occur that such condition or reservation was not made a part of the deed?\u201d he replied, \u201c Well, just through neglect and carelessness, I suppose; \u201d and when asked how long prior to the taking of his testimony, he knew of the omission from the deed, he replied, \u201c Possibly a couple of years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The testimony clearly shows that there were conversations between certain of the parties prior to the incorporation of the defendant company, but none of the witnessess, except the plaintiff, are at all clear and positive in their recollection of the circumstances, and the claim of mutual mistake is specifically denied in the answer and in the defendant\u2019s proof. No further action was taken in regard thereto until this suit was instituted nearly six years thereafter, during which time the conditions have materially changed. New stockholders are now interested, and the business of the company is under a different control. The successful assertion of this claim would impair the defendant\u2019s property. The general manager testified as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201c Q. With the right of Mr. Gailey to use the siding over that property for running cars up to his property, in your opinion, would that lessen the value of the property? A. Well, it would simply put us out of business. Q. Well, would it lessen the value of the property in the market ? A. Surely it would for what it is used for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">Making his case as strong as his own testimony will allow, the plain facts remain against him, -that he had the deed prepared, executed and delivered it, either without reading it or after reading it, he ignored the omission of the reservation he now seeks to have inserted, and, after having sold of his holdings in the corporation to different persons without any notice of his present contention, he would seriously depreciate their interests. This he cannot be permitted to do under the facts as he has made them. Mistake, to be available in equity, must not have arisen from negligence, where the means of knowledge were easily accessible. The party complaining must have exercised at least the degree of diligence which may fairly be expected from a reasonable person: Kerr on Fraud and Mistake, 407; Grymes v. Sanders, 93 U. S. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">It is undoubtedly the law, that where an instrument is drawn and executed which professes, or is intended to carry into execution an agreement previously entered into, but which by mistake of \u2019the draftsman, either as to fact or law, does not fulfill that intention, or which violates it, equity will correct the mistake so as to produce a conformity with the instrument intended: Stines v. Hays, 36 N. J. Eq. 364. But there are no equitable elements sufficiently proved in this case, there was no mistake of scrivener, or grantee, the sole cause being as stated by the plaintiff, \u201c just through neglect and carelessness \u201d or \u201c an oversight and neglect \u201d on his own part.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">To bind the corporation, by a ratification of the preliminary agreement which is omitted by a mutual mistake, it is essential that the corporation have full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, and also that it was known that it would not be bound without ratification: Bell\u2019s Gap R. R. Co. v. Christy, 79 Pa. 54; Pittsburg &amp; Steubenville R. R. Co. v. Gazzam, 32 Pa. 340; Tift v. Quaker City National Bank, 141 Pa. 550 ; Curry v. Claysville Cemetery Association, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Such relief is generally withheld unless the parties can be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>restored substantially to tbeir position at the time the contract was made: 20 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 820. If this cannot be done, the court will relieve only where the clearest and strongest equity imperatively demands it: Grymes v. Sanders, 93 U. S. 55; 23 Law Co-op., ed. 798; Weller\u2019s Appeal, 103 Pa. 594; Moore v. Fire Ins. Co., 199 Pa. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In Graham v. Carnegie Steel Co., 217 Pa. 34, it is stated, and it has been repeatedly so held to be the rule, that: \u201c In order to reform a deed on the ground of mistake, it must clearly appear by the testimony of witnesses who distinctly remember the facts that a mistake was made, and that the writing does not express the agreement. The testimony must be clear, precise and indubitable, and of such weight and directness as to carry conviction to the mind.\u201d Vide also Edmonds\u2019s Appeal, 59 Pa. 220; Boyertown National Bank v. Hartman, 147 Pa. 558; Highlands v. Railroad Company, 209 Pa. 286; Youngstown Electric Light Company v. Butler County Poor District, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Measured by these standards, the testimony falls far short in quality and quantity to warrant the reformation of the deed as prayed for. The fifteenth assignment of error is sustained, the decree is reversed and the bill dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
