App. Ct. 802, 804-807 (1985), the defendant was again found guilty of murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reversing the defendant\u2019s first convictions, we considered issues likely to recur at any retrial and stated that it would be \u201cwise\u201d to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 809. Such an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>was requested and given at the retrial. On appeal, the defendant claims that the definitions of malice aforethought and wanton or reckless conduct given to the jury were so similar that they failed to provide the jury with a rational basis by which to distinguish between murder in the second degree and involuntary manslaughter. He further argues that it was error for the judge to refuse to allow the jury to consider the evidence of his intoxication on the question of his intent to do an act under circumstances which permit a jury to infer malice. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">I. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Because the evidence presented at the second trial on the charge of murder in the second degree was substantially similar to that offered at the first trial, we repeat the brief but sufficient recitation appearing in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sullivan, 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 803. \u201cAmong the patrons who had been ushering in the new, year, 1983, at the Stephen James House in Porter Square, Cambridge, were the victims and the defendant Sullivan. Their celebration had been characterized by ample drinking, particularly on the part of Sullivan. At about 1:45 a.m., Sullivan and his wife emerged from the restaurant arguing, Sullivan resorting to blows and shoves. Grimes and Kelly, who did not know the Sullivans, intervened in what they perceived as a wife-beating episode. There was a fight. Sullivan pulled a knife with which he stabbed Grimes fatally and Kelly much less severely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">At retrial, the defendant again admitted stabbing Grimes and Kelly and reasserted that \u201che acted in defense of himself and his wife.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>His testimony which supported an instruction on involuntary manslaughter was, essentially, that as he was being held to the ground and beaten, he reached into his back pocket, withdrew and opened his knife, and swung twice with the \u201cintent to get the guys off me so I could help my wife.\u201d He stated that he swung \u201cblindly\u201d and did not even realize that he had stabbed Grimes, who continued to hold him by the hair and hit him. He swung a second time, stabbing Grimes in the hand and sending him backwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>II. <em>The Instructions on Malice.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In setting out the elements of murder in the second degree, the judge explained \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d in language generally consistent with the cases. To cite but a few, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>138 Mass. 165, 178 (1884); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304, 315 (1926); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403, 408 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 427-429 (1981). That is to say, the judge instructed: \u201cMalice may be proven by an unexcused intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm or to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that either death or grievous harm would follow.\u201d He explained that the Commonwealth was not required to prove that the defendant had an actual intent to kill in order to prove malice aforethought. It was enough for the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had a \u201cgeneral intent,\u201d as he had earlier defined that term,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cto do an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>creating a plain and strong likelihood of death or grievous bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Turning to involuntary manslaughter, the judge adhered to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 398-399 (1944). He stated: \u201cIn order to determine the existence of wanton or reckless conduct, as distinguished from mere negligence, the Commonwealth must show that grave danger to others was apparent and the defendant chose to run the risk rather than alter his conduct so as to avoid the act or omission which caused the harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">III. <em>Murder or Manslaughter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">An unjustified or unexcused killing is either murder or manslaughter. The transformation turns upon the \u201cdegree of danger attending [the act],\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>138 Mass. at 178, the presence or the absence of malice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 304 (1850). A jury, therefore, must clearly be shown the \u201c \u2018malice\u2019 \u2014 \u2018no malice\u2019 fork in the road.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass. 659, 663 (1989). The defendant claims that use of the terms \u201cgrievous bodily harm\u201d in defining malice and \u201cgrave danger\u201d in explaining involuntary manslaughter put the jury on a straight road. He argues that any difference between the general intent to do an act creating a strong likelihood of death or grievous bodily harm and the general intent to do an act presenting a grave danger to another is too negligible to allow for a reasoned choice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parenti, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 701 (1982). Reading the instructions \u201cin their entirety to determine their probable impact on the jury\u2019s perception of the fact-finding function,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. 854, 865 (1990), we conclude that the judge gave the jury clear directions by which to distinguish between the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The judge began his instructions on the crimes comprehended within the indictment with an explanation of homicide. He proceeded from lawful homicide to self-defense to manslaughter and the use of excessive force. Next, he described murder in the first degree and removed that crime from the jury\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the outset of the instructions on murder in the second degree, the judge emphasized that an unlawful killing \u201cwithout the element of malice aforethought\u201d is manslaughter and that malice is an \u201cessential ingredient of murder.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>403 Mass, at 662 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In defining the term malice aforethought, the judge explained that those words did \u201cnot necessarily\u201d mean \u201cill-will.\u201d Rather, malice was \u201cmanifested,\u201d if at all, \u201cby the motive and circumstances which attend and surround the fatal blow.\u201d Put yet another way: \u201cIf there was an intention on the part of the defendant to inflict injury upon the deceased, which was not justified on any lawful ground, or palliated by the existence of any mitigating circumstances, that intention was malicious within the meaning of the law.\u201d There was more: where there is \u201cpurposeful, selfish, wrongful motive, as distinguished from the frailty of human nature,\u201d there is malice aforethought. A malicious act is one which indicates a \u201cheart devoid of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.\u201d Where the \u201ccircumstances disclose that the fatal blow is purposeful and wrongful and not the result of chance or frailty of humanity, there is malice aforethought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Having conveyed the legal concept of malice, the judge then turned to the three alternative forms of its proof and delivered the instruction of which the defendant complains: \u201cMalice may be inferred where a reasonable, prudent person in the circumstances known to the defendant would know according to common experience there was a probability of causing grievous bodily harm and a plain likelihood of death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>as a result of his actions.\u201d Reading the judge\u2019s instructions as to this \u201ctechnical expression in the law,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. at 309, we view his explanation of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d as a correct compilation of decisional law from 1884 <em>(Pierce, supra), </em>forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Our conclusion does not, however, resolve the defendant\u2019s claim. The instructions on malice aforethought must be reviewed with those on involuntary manslaughter. After again instructing on voluntary manslaughter (self-defense and excessive force), the judge briefly recalled the evidence which entitled the defendant to the jury\u2019s consideration of involuntary manslaughter. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that, in defining \u201cwanton or reckless conduct,\u201d the judge used language which essentially duplicated his formulation of malice aforethought. He argues that the phrase \u201cgrievous bodily harm\u201d is so substantially similar to \u201cgravity of the danger\u201d that the distinction between the two types of homicide was \u201cobliterated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parenti, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">If these terms were lifted from the instructions and given a common usage, it might be reasonable to worry whether they were alike in implication. In the context of the judge\u2019s instructions, however, the meaning and use of these technical expressions remained separate and distinct. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parenti, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 698, where the judge defined involuntary manslaughter as \u201cthe intentional doing of a wanton or reckless act absent an. intent to kill, but the act or acts are so dangerous, reckless and wanton that they are likely to cause death or grave bodily harm,\u201d and as \u201can unintentional killing which results from the doing of a wanton or reckless act that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury.\u201d In the present case, the judge remained faithful to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. at 398-399.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Just as the judge repeatedly told the jury that murder was the result of an act intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm, he also told them numerous times that involuntary manslaughter was the result of intentional conduct unintentionally causing death: \u201cWhat is intended is the defendant\u2019s conduct, not the resulting harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Viewing these instructions against the backdrop painted by the judge, \u201ca purposeful, selfish, wrongful motive\u201d as distinguished from the \u201cfrailty of human nature,\u201d we think the jury could see clearly the distinction between the crimes and the verdicts available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">We see no error in the judge\u2019s instructions on murder and involuntary manslaughter, and we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation that we overrule more than one hundred years of law by doing away with the \u201clargely but not . . . totally objective basis on which a jury may infer malice . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 472 n.4 (1987). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. at 428; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>407 Mass. 753, 758 n. 2 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">IV. <em>The Instructions on Intoxication.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In his second claim of error, the defendant argues that the judge was wrong in refusing to allow the jury to consider the evidence of his intoxication in respect to his intent \u201cto do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that either death or grievous harm would follow.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This argument has been rejected on numerous occasions, most recently in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>407 Mass. at 758 n.2: \u201c[Bjecause malice aforethought may be found in the absence of specific intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, murder in the second degree cannot be said to require specific intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 428 (1981).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-15\">The defendant was also found guilty of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. His appeal raises no issue with regard to that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">It is the Commonwealth\u2019s position that we need not consider the defendant\u2019s claim because his testimony shows any error to be harmless. First, the Commonwealth asserts that the defendant was not entitled to an instruction on involuntary manslaughter as he admitted that the stabbing was intentional. We think it enough to state that the Commonwealth misreads the defendant\u2019s testimony. He admitted to swinging the knife intentionally but blindly and with the intent to get the man atop him off, not to stab him.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Additionally, the Commonwealth claims that the jury\u2019s verdict shows that they rejected his testimony. Had they believed the defendant, they would have found him not guilty or guilty of manslaughter by reason of his use of excessive force in defending himself and his wife; therefore, the evi-dentiary basis for involuntary manslaughter was rejected by the jury. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zaccagnini, </em>383 Mass. 615 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 902, 903-904 (1987), cases involving claims of accident <em>while </em>acting in self-defense. In the present case, however, there is no implicit \u201clinkage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 903, in the defendant\u2019s testimony. The jury could have disbelieved the defendant\u2019s assertion of self-defense, and, based upon portions of the defendant\u2019s testimony and that of other witnesses, they could have found that he acted recklessly and wantonly when he withdrew and swung his knife blindly and heedlessly. We consider the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u201cGeneral intent is when we do things more or less unconsciously: it is a reflex action, like sitting down in a chair, walking upstairs. These are done with general intent. We do not do them unless our mind first resolves that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>we do them. But they don\u2019t require any concentration or focusing of the mind.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\">The defendant refers to this form of proof as \u201cthird-prong,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cgeneral,\u201d or \u201cinferred\u201d malice.
