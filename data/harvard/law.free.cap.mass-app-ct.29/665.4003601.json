Walsh, contains the following paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201cDuring the week of May 29, 1988, Sgt. Paul Regan and this officer met and had conversation with a confidential and reliable informer, hereinafter referred to for the purpose of this affidavit as CRI. CRI has provided reliable information to this officer and members of the Lawrence Drug Task Force in the past, which led to the arrests of Edwin S. Rivera, in Lawrence, MA, on 5-7-88 for Possession of Heroin with Intent to Distribute, the arrest of Heribito Rivera, in Lawrence, MA, on 5-11-88 for Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Distribute, and the arrest in Lawrence, MA, on 5-24-88 of Luis Gonzalez Pabon, for Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u201cCRI related the following information: That a Hispanic male known to CRI as Felix of 14 Mechanic Street, Lawrence, MA, first floor apartment, is dealing substantial amounts of cocaine to people in Lawrence. CRI has been in the 14 Mechanic Street, first floor apartment, on at least five occasions during the past week, and has observed Felix sell cocaine to numerous people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">\u201cDuring the past 24 hours Sgt. Regan and this officer met with CRI. CRI stated to these officers that within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the past 48 hours CRI was in the first floor apartment of 14 Mechanic Street, and CRI observed Felix to be in Possession of two ounces of cocaine, in plastic baggies of various size and weight. CRI stated that Felix stated to CRI that he (Felix) was expecting to get more cocaine and CRI could get as much as CRI wanted, as long as CRI paid Felix cash on delivery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\u201cUnder art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, a magistrate, before issuing a search warrant, must determine that probable cause exists.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 485 (1988). The Massachusetts test for determining probable cause in cases involving unnamed informers follows the established principles of <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363 (1985). The defendant asserts that the veracity requirement of that test is not met by Officer Walsh\u2019s affidavit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues that it does not describe sufficiently the requisite underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant\u2019s information was reliable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, supra </em>at 374-375, citing <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Review of search warrant applications which rely on information provided by unnamed informants involves, for Massachusetts magistrates and trial judges, the difficult task of applying the precisely articulated tests of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard, in a \u201ccommonsense and realistic fashion\u201d and without \u201chypertechnical\u201d analysis. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ven-tresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747, 750 (1971). Our analysis, assisted by recent appellate decisions, leads us to conclude that the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483 (1988), decided after the defendant\u2019s first motion to suppress had been denied, held that \u201c[a] naked assertion that in the past the informant had provided information which led to a prior arrest is insufficient by itself to establish an informant\u2019s veracity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. While the veracity test does not require a representation by an affiant that the informant\u2019s past tip led to a conviction, see 1 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3(b) (2d ed. 1987), some meaningful information beyond the mere fact of an arrest is necessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, supra </em>at 486. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Malone, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 72 (1987). The question before us is whether detailed information of <em>three </em>arrests attributable to an informant\u2019s prior tips takes the present case beyond the reach of <em>Rojas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Among the types of additional affidavit recitations which have been held to be meaningful to the reliability assessment are: (1) self-verifying detail, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 348 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 323 (1989); (2) corroboration by police, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pettier, </em>362 Mass. 621, 625 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 876, 877 (1978); (3) recent conviction of a crime similar to the one which is the subject of the tip, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 418 n.7 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labelle, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 180 (1983); (4) a corroborative postarrest procedure such as a prosecution or indictment, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406, 410 (1985); 1 LaFave, \u00a7 3.3(b), <em>supra </em>at 634; and (5) an informant\u2019s declaration against penal interest, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, supra </em>at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The affidavit in the case before us attributes to the informant reliable information that led to the arrests of three named individuals, at different times, and in the same city as the search site. The affidavit contains no additional information which supports the informant\u2019s veracity. Since an arrest may not lead to further proceedings and, therefore, may be a \u201cdud,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 28, 31 (1989), information limited to the details of the arrest does not constitute self-verifying specificity in that it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>strengthen any inference relating to the trustworthiness of the informant. That more than one arrest is attributed to an informant also does not necessarily enhance his reliability. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 407 (1989) (affidavit that referred to the arrest and convictions of \u201cpersons\u201d would fail to establish probable cause if reference to convictions were struck).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We recognize the theoretical possibility that arrests resulting from an informant\u2019s tips may be reported in such number in an affidavit as to be construed as self-verifying without any additional indications of reliability. See 1 LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 634. Our conclusion that that number has not been here attained is supported by the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>407 Mass. 53 (1990), reported after the trial of the case at bar. In <em>Melendez, </em>the affidavit in support of a search warrant application reasonably could be read to indicate that an unnamed informant had given information that led to the arrest of more than two individuals. It stated that \u201c[t]wo such arrests\u201d were of named persons, on a specific date, in the same city in which the search site was located. <em>Id. </em>at 54. The arrests were for possession of heroin with intent to distribute. The affidavit was held to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, supra, </em>underscores the need for affiants to include significant indicia of an informant\u2019s reliability, in addition to specific information about past arrest tips, in order for their affidavits to pass constitutional muster. The affidavit in the case contained information to the effect that the cases of the arrested persons were \u201ccurrently pending\u201d in a District Court and that the informant had purchased cocaine at the place to be searched from a Jorge Melendez and injected it into his or her arm. It also stated that Jorge Melendez had previously pleaded guilty in the Superior Court to a cocaine possession charge. Notwithstanding the specificity relating to the prior tips and the accompanying detail which arguably could support a contrary result,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>majority of the Supreme Judicial Court held that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The affidavit before us is similarly specific with regard to past tips, but it is devoid of any additional detail which reasonably might support an inference of reliability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Absent such detail, the assertion that the informant had provided information leading to three arrests is insufficient to establish the informant\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the orders denying the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress are vacated. An order is to enter allowing the motions to suppress. We are unable, on the record, to determine the extent of the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the illegally seized evidence. We, therefore, do not preclude retrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>383 Mass. 272, 285 &amp; n.17 (1981). The prosecution, of course, is under an obligation promptly to notify the Superior Court of its intentions as to retrial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 508 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-16\"> After the denial of his first motion to suppress, the defendant, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483 (1988), sought and obtained a hearing on a \u201csupplemental motion to suppress.\u201d That second motion was also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Among the materials listed in the return of the search warrant were eighty-one plastic baggies containing white powder. Evidence was introduced at the trial to the effect that the powder weighed forty-six grams and that sixty-seven percent of it was cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The defendant also argues that there was an unlawful delay in the execution of the search warrant. Our decision obviates the necessity of our addressing that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\">No question is raised regarding the \u201cbasis of knowledge prong\u201d of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard. The requirements of the \u201cveracity prong\u201d and the \u201cbasis of knowledge prong\u201d must each be met in order for probable cause to be established. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. at 375-376. For a discussion of the various prongs and spurs of that standard, see Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 123-130 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In his dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>407 Mass. at 59-69, Justice Greaney contended that the corroborative information in the affidavit provided an adequate basis to find the informant reliable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The judge who denied the second motion to suppress in this case based his decision on the conclusion that the tips resulting in the three arrests for possession of cocaine or heroin supported the inference that the named narcotics were found in the possession or control of the arrested persons. He apparently reasoned that the inferred possession or control of narcotics constituted additional evidence supporting the further inference of reliability of the informant. Whatever the merits of this line of reasoning, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, supra, </em>renders it unavailable to us since the affidavit in that case also described arrests for possession of specified illegal drugs. It is noteworthy that neither the affidavit in the case before us nor that in <em>Melendez </em>indicates that the informants\u2019 tips had led to both arrests <em>and </em>seizure of illegal drugs. See 1 LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 634 n.86.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
