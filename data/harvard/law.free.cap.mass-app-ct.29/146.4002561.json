The question before us is whether the trial judge erred in holding that the paroi evidence rule did not preclude the defendant borrowers (Wayne and Dimitria Williams) from introducing evidence of an additional agreement that, in the event the lender (Howard Maxim) died, the borrowers would have no obligation to continue payments on the notes to Maxim\u2019s estate. We hold the paroi evidence rule inapplicable and the evidence admissible because the judge was warranted in determining, as a preliminary matter, that the notes did not reflect an integrated agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Prior to the jury\u2019s hearing of testimony, the plaintiffs, executors of Howard Maxim\u2019s estate, who had brought this action on the notes, filed a motion in limine seeking exclusion of Maxim\u2019s statements at the time of the execution of the notes. Those statements were to the effect that, if he could pick the day to die, he \u201cwould take care of it,\u201d meaning (so the defendants claim) he would tear the notes up.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The judge held a voir dire at which Wayne Williams was the only witness. He testified that in September, 1978, he entered into an agreement with Howard Maxim which was part written and part oral, that the notes were the written part, that, between the signing of the first and last note, Maxim stated that \u201che would do away [with] or tear up the papers if it was possible before his death,\u201d that \u201cthese papers don\u2019t really mean anything, anyway, if I knew something was going to happen to me we would do away with them.\u201d Based on this testimony, the judge denied the motion in limine, saying, \u201cThe parties, so far as I could tell from the evidence, did not intend to integrate the oral statement into the written documents; therefore, . . . the paroi evidence rule does not operate to make the statements inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The matter was then tried to a jury who were warranted in finding the following facts. In the early 1960\u2019s, Howard Maxim befriended Dimitria Williams and her husband Wayne Williams. The trio developed a close relationship and often socialized together. Maxim, who was childless and thirty-five years Wayne\u2019s senior, ran a well-drilling company. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>He encouraged Wayne to enter the business, and, although Wayne declined to buy Maxim\u2019s company in 1970, Maxim ultimately helped Wayne start his own. In 1977, Maxim wrote a $50,000 check for the purchase of Wayne\u2019s first rotary rig, and in 1978 Maxim lent Wayne an additional sum of $80,000 to upgrade his well-drilling equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Maxim drafted three promissory notes of $50,000, $80,000, and $46,864.80 (see appendix), the last of these representing interest on the $80,000 note. On September 12, 1978, Maxim and the Williamses signed the notes at Maxim\u2019s home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">At trial, Wayne repeated his testimony at the voir dire concerning the statements made by Maxim, adding \u201cthat it was not intended for me to pay it \u2014 to continue it on to the estate.\u201d Dimitria Williams testified that, at Maxim\u2019s death, \u201che wanted us not to pay any more, that debt would be free and clear from there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Wayne also testified that Maxim had deliberately written the notes in an unconventional way and had told Wayne, \u201cTwo of them says I owe you the money, one of them says you owe me the money.\u201d Williams stated that it was his understanding that the notes were so written because Maxim wanted to forgive the balance of the notes at his death, and that Maxim had explained that the notes were written in that manner \u201cin case things don\u2019t work out.\u201d At Maxim\u2019s death, the Williamses stopped making payments on the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Both Wayne and Dimitria Williams testified that, on numerous occasions subsequent to the signing of the notes, Maxim reiterated his comments to the effect that, if he knew when he was going to die, he would tear up the notes. Maxim also told his secretary and long-time friend Virginia Riemels (Riemels) that if he knew when he was going to die, he would tear up the notes. The night before Maxim died in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>1982, he summoned Riemels and instructed her, in the event of his death, to go to his house, to enter using a hidden spare key (Riemels knew its location), and to tear up all the notes in his box. When Riemels went to Maxim\u2019s house the morning after his death, the doors were locked and the spare key was not in its hiding place. She could not retrieve the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Both the plaintiffs and the defendants moved unsuccessfully for directed verdicts at the conclusion of the evidence. The primary question before the jury was whether the agreement between the parties included a provision excusing the outstanding balance on the notes on the occasion of Maxim\u2019s death based on an oral understanding with Maxim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury found for the defendants. The plaintiffs moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, a new trial. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In their appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the jury finding was based on evidence which does violence to the paroi evidence rule since the notes contain no provision relating to Maxim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But, as indicated in <em>New England Factors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Genstil, </em>322 Mass. 36, 40 (1947), quoting from <em>Kesslen Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>295 Mass. 123, 129 (1936), \u201cbefore that rule comes into operation \u2018the court must be sure that it has before it a written contract intended by the parties as a statement of their complete agreement.\u2019 \u201d If not, the rule is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">1. <em>Preliminary finding by the judge. </em>For purposes of this preliminary determination by the judge \u2014 a factual one, <em>Wang Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Docktor Pet Centers, Inc., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 213, 219 (1981) \u2014 the parties may present proof beyond the writing itself, including evidence of prior negotiations. <em>Antonellis </em>v. <em>Northgate Constr. Corp., </em>362 Mass. 847, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>849 (1973). <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 324 (1981). <em>Fred S. James &amp; Co. of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hoffmann, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 163 (1987). Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 209(2), \u00a7 210(3), and \u00a7 214(a) &amp; (b) (1981). 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 588 (1960). In <em>Antonellis </em>v. <em>Northgate Constr. Corp., </em>362 Mass. at 850, involving a contract for the purchase and sale of 150,000 yards of fill at a certain price, evidence of an oral agreement that the buyer\u2019s obligation would end if the city of Brockton found the fill unacceptable was admissible to show whether the parties intended an integrated contract. Justice Kaplan, writing for the court, found that the evidence (in view of the brevity of the writing and the evident design to mesh the agreement with a certain Brockton job) could justify a preliminary finding that the agreement was not integrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Similarly, as a preliminary matter, the evidence in the case at bar, especially in view of the brevity and unusual form of the notes, could justify the judge\u2019s finding that the parties\u2019 contract was not integrated \u2014 that the notes did not reflect the parties\u2019 entire agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe conclusion of nonintegration is quite plausible\u201d even if the termination of the Williamses\u2019 obligation on Maxim\u2019s death is viewed as \u201ca condition added to\u201d the contract. See <em>Antonellis </em>v. <em>Northgate Constr. Corp., </em>362 Mass. at 850 &amp; n.3. The judge could well find that the parties did not intend to exclude an oral agreement on the subject of what was to happen on Maxim\u2019s death, and, considered in that light, the additional term sought to be proved by the defendants was consistent with the notes as written.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>2. <em>Jury finding. </em>Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, the jury could infer from Maxim\u2019s statements, made both at the time of the execution of the notes and thereafter, from his statements explaining the unusual form of the notes, and from his conversation and instructions to Riemels that Maxim intended and agreed at the time of the execution of the notes, as did the Williamses, that payments were to be made on the notes only during his lifetime, or until such earlier time as they were fully paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for judgment n.o.v. or for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The note for $50,000 was dated May 17, 1977. It appears, however, from Wayne\u2019s testimony and the similarity of the notes and the ink color of signatures, that the three notes were signed at the same time in September, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">At the time of Maxim\u2019s death, the Williamses had paid $29,500 on the $50,000 note; $29,333.48 on the $80,000 note; and $17,183.78 on the $46,864.80 note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The cases cited by the plaintiffs, <em>Trahant </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>253 Mass. 486 (1925), <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>264 Mass. 208 (1928), and <em>Quincy Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>299 Mass. 565 (1938), unlike the present case, involve negotiable notes. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-104(1)(if). Different policy considerations may apply to such notes. See 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 587, at 518 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In addition to the reversal of the obligor in two of the notes and the signing of the note by Maxim as well as the Williamses, the execution of a separate note for interest is not conventional.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The trial judge also allowed testimony as to Maxim\u2019s statements on the additional ground that the notes were ambiguous. We do not consider this additional reason for the admission of Maxim\u2019s statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 388-389 (5th ed. 1981), indicating that borderline cases present difficulties.
