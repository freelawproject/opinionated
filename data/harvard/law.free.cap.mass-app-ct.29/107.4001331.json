Rule 3:07, DR 5-101 &amp; 5-102, 382 Mass. 779-780 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Superior Court Rule 12 (1974). The plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against the defendants. Count I alleged that the plaintiff was wrongfully discharged as an employee of the defendants. Count II alleged that, following the discharge, the parties orally agreed to a severance agreement which the defendants then violated. The defendants\u2019 answer to the complaint included an affirmative defense and a counterclaim, essentially alleging that the parties had reached a settlement agreement which the plaintiff now refuses to honor. More specifically, the defendants claimed that Mr. Earle C. Cooley, then counsel for the plaintiff, communicated to the defendants through their counsel, Mr. R. Robert Popeo, a specific offer to settle the dispute, and that Mr. Popeo then notified Mr. Cooley of the defendants\u2019 acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s settlement offer. The defendants further asserted, however, that five days later Mr. Cooley informed Mr. Popeo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>that the plaintiff would not honor the settlement agreement and instead demanded that the defendants accept new and less favorable terms. The plaintiff denied the defendants\u2019 allegations and soon thereafter filed a motion to disqualify Mr. Popeo and his law firm from representing the defendants. Appended to the motion was the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in which he stated that Mr. Cooley was never authorized to offer or accept any settlement agreement. Concluding that Mr. Popeo \u201cought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client,\u201d and that none of the exceptions of DR 5-101 (B) applied, a Superior Court judge allowed the motion. We vacate that order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Disciplinary Rule 5-102(A) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, a lawyer (and any member of his law firm) who learns that he \u201cought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client . . . shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial.\u201d Note 2, <em>supra. </em>Ever since the case of <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775 (1979), the appellate courts of this Commonwealth have attempted to explicate the bare language of this rule. This has been particularly necessary because of the repeated use of a disqualification motion as a litigation tactic. The plaintiff in the present case argues, and the judge agreed, that Mr. Popeo \u201cis a key player in this conflict and it is obvious that he, or a lawyer in his firm, ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client.\u201d <em>Borman, </em>however, requires more searching inquiry. Disqualification is not required in every case in which counsel could give testimony on behalf of his client on other than formal or uncontested matters. We must look to whether the attorney is likely to \u201cwithhold crucial testimony from his client because he prefers to continue as counsel,\u201d <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. at 790, to determine if the \u201ccontinued participation as counsel taints the legal system or the trial of the cause before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>at 788. In sum, <em>Borman </em>\u201csounds a cautionary note about judicial disqualification of counsel.\u201d <em>Serody </em>v. <em>Serody, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 413 (1985). See also <em>Gorovitz </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>394 Mass. at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Upon review of the sparse record as it stands now (there has been no discovery), we conclude that the disqualification order was either unnecessary or premature. See <em>Borman, </em>378 at 791. The plaintiffs affidavit only brings into issue whether Mr. Cooley had authority to bind his client to a settlement agreement. It is not clear, at this point, whether the existence of the settlement agreement, or its terms, are actually in dispute. If they are not, there is no basis for disqualifying Mr. Popeo. He could give no relevant testimony as to Mr. Cooley\u2019s authority. Cf. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Black, </em>376 Mass. 929 (1978). If through discovery it should become clear that the agreement or its terms are in dispute, and the defendants cannot support their claim without their attorney\u2019s testimony, that will be the time to take appropriate action. We \u201cdefer to the best judgment of counsel and his client [s]\u201d until such time as an \u201cintention to forgo the testimony of counsel appears obviously contrary to the client [s\u2019] interests.\u201d <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. at 790-791. <em>Mendel Kern, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workshop Inc., </em>400 Mass. 277, 281 (1987).
