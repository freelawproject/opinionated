At Gwendolyn\u2019s birth on July 28, 1986, Sally\u2019s first two children had, for a considerable period, been under the care and custody of the Department of Social Services (the department) \u2014 since 1981 in the case of her first child, and since 1984 in the case of her second child. Gwendolyn\u2019s father was in Bridgewater State Hospital for chronic mental illness and Sally had been hospitalized for chronic mental illness on fourteen prior occasions, the first of which was in 1975 and the last of which, prior to Gwendolyn\u2019s birth, was in December, 1984. The judge found that the diagnosis of Sally\u2019s condition \u201cincluded paranoid schizophrenia and manic depression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">On September 18, 1986, seven weeks after Gwendolyn was born, Sally was again committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital and Gwendolyn was placed in emergency foster care. On September 19, 1986, the department filed a petition for care and protection in the Concord District Court (the custody case) and received Gwendolyn into its physical custody on that day. The District Court granted temporary custody of Gwendolyn to the department on October 24, 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 3, 1987, the department filed a petition in the Middlesex Probate Court to dispense with the consent of Gwendolyn\u2019s parents to the adoption of Gwendolyn (the \u00a7 3 case). See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 <em>3(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The two cases were consolidated for trial, as expressly authorized by G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, beginning March 7, 1989. After a three-day trial, the judge found that Sally and the father were currently unfit to care for Gwendolyn, and judgment in the custody case was entered awarding permanent custody of Gwendolyn to the department. Judgment in the \u00a7 3 case, after reciting the unfitness of the parents, provided that (i) \u201cit is in the best interest of the child to termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>nate the parental rights of [Sally and the father],\u201d and (ii) \u201c[t]here shall be no further visitations between the biological parents and the minor child.\u201d Sally has appealed from the judgment entered in each of the two cases. The father, for whom a guardian ad litem had been appointed, did not appear at the trial and did not claim an appeal from the judgments. (At the trial the judge noted he was on escape status from Metropolitan State Hospital.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Our review of the judge\u2019s decision proceeds on established principles. The required detailed findings by the judge, which will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous, <em>Care and Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 151 (1987); <em>Care and Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. 319, 327 (1990), must nevertheless be supported by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 747-748 (1982), of parental unfitness, <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 882 (1979); <em>Petition of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>391 Mass. at 119; <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 4 (1989); <em>Care and Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. at 327, viewed in the context of the child\u2019s welfare, <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 641 (1975); <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. at 4. These principles apply to custody cases as well as petitions to dispense with parental consent to adoption. <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. 755, 765 (1983). <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>392 Mass. 719, 725 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">1. <em>The Custody Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The judge noted that he heard the cases seriatim, with the custody case being considered and adjudged first. Thus we start with the custody case, bearing in mind that the award of permanent custody to the department does not necessarily determine the outcome of the \u00a7 3 petition. Compare G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, with G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The judge\u2019s twenty-four page opinion provides adequate documentation of his findings, supported by clear and convincing evidence, summarized below, that Sally is not currently fit to care for the needs of her daughter, and that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>in Gwendolyn\u2019s best interests to award permanent custody to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Sally\u2019s illness is both persistent and episodic; that is to say, Sally has periods of lucidity, but they are interrupted, inevitably, with periods of seriously aberrational behavior. The judge found that Sally\u2019s thoughts are impaired with paranoid ideas and an inability to think coherently. Her illness leaves her unable to differentiate her own needs from those of Gwendolyn; frightened for herself of the consequences of sleep, she believes that sleep is threatening to Gwendolyn. She is convinced periodically that her children are being sexually abused by the very people attending to the children\u2019s interests, and she is equally convinced from time to time that her husband is the object of sexual advances by those who are concerned with her well-being, including the case workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In periods of mental disarray Sally\u2019s language can become extremely foul and her perception of reality exceedingly dim. Moments of stress can precipitate hallucinations and destructive fantasies, and during these periods of deep trouble, caring for Gwendolyn is utterly beyond Sally. When in better condition, caring for Gwendolyn can be sustained by Sally, but not for long periods of time. While her disease may be amenable to some extent to therapy and medication, in recent years she has rejected both. Thus the prognosis is poor and her condition may be worsening. Sally is \u201cprofoundly disturbed,\u201d the judge found, a conclusion confirmed and supported by psychological evaluations adopted by the judge as part of his findings. See <em>Care and Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The outcome is a disabling disease which prevents Sally from being a reliable parent able to care for the almost constant needs of a very young child. Sally was, therefore, incapable of being, and thus \u201cunfit\u201d to be, the parent of Gwendolyn, responsible for her care and nurturing. See <em>id. </em>at 151-152 (past and current mental illness amply supported determination of unfitness). In sum, there was clear and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>vincing evidence supporting the judge\u2019s conclusion that permanent custody should be given to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">2. <em>The \u00a7 3 Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The allowance of the petition in the \u00a7 3 case means \u201cthat the parent no longer has the power to prevent the termination of . . . [all] rights, duties, and other legal consequences of . . . [her] relation to . . . [her] child.\u201d <em>Petition of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>391 Mass. 113, 119 (1984). \u201cFor this extreme step to be taken, we believe that it must be shown by clear and convincing evidence that the parent\u2019s unfitness to assume parental responsibility is such that it would be in the best interests of the child for all legal relations to be ended.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The custody case adjudicated Sally\u2019s current unfitness to care for Gwendolyn. What is required in the \u00a7 3 case is an assessment of Sally\u2019s capabilities when what is at stake is the irreversible termination of Sally\u2019s parental and legal relationship to Gwendolyn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">As in <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bureau to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>395 Mass. 180, 184-185 (1985), the mother here is overwhelmed with her own problems, and her refusal to accept medication or therapy contributes substantially to the unfavorable prognosis. Being a parent is not a sometimes thing; the occasional but potentially decisive intervention by Sally under G. L. c. 119 could be enormously disruptive, and especially so if Sally\u2019s emotional and mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>condition falls far short of what is then needed for a parental decision that must focus on Gwendolyn\u2019s needs and potential development. The wise exercise of parental responsibility \u2014 difficult under the best of circumstances, but most particularly so when the child\u2019s father has abandoned all responsibility \u2014 has no prospects for success when it is hobbled by a disabling and probably deteriorating mental disease. Sally\u2019s long history of mental illness and parental unfitness has prognostic value which plainly fills any alleged gap in the evidence of Sally\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 883 (1979); <em>Care and Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. at 152; <em>Custody of Michel, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 269-270 (1990). To be sure, there is no fault or blame, no abuse, no neglect; Sally has been overtaken by a disease she did not cause and would not have chosen. But moral innocence is not necessarily a decisive factor in a \u00a7 3 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In addition to Sally\u2019s unfitness, we are obliged to consider, as Justice Kaplan wrote in <em>Petition of New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 641 (1975), the \u201ccognate\u201d test, Is Sally\u2019s illness such that it is in the best interests of Gwendolyn to terminate their legal relations? The judge concluded that it is in Gwendolyn\u2019s best interests, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Consideration of Gwendolyn\u2019s welfare must start with the fact that she has been in foster care from the time she was two months old, and she has been with her current foster parents almost all of that time. There was expert opinion testimony, which the judge adopted, that Gwendolyn\u2019s relationship with the foster parents is \u201cwell established in terms of her attachment and bonding with her foster mother [who is] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>... a source of psychological safety.\u201d Gwendolyn calls her foster parents \u201cMommy\u201d and \u201cDaddy,\u201d and although Gwendolyn is relaxed with Sally, she sees Sally as a familiar adult rather than as her psychological mother. In spite of her ominous start in life, Gwendolyn\u2019s prospects for a healthy and consistent family environment with her foster parents now appear to be favorable. Gwendolyn\u2019s legal adoption by her psychological parents would only enhance those prospects while the rejection of the foster parents as adoptive parents could only dim the outlook.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">If adoption is not to be approved, Gwendolyn, in all likelihood, will spend her childhood in temporary arrangements that inevitably lack the security and stability that an advantageous adoption can provide. In this context, Sally\u2019s inability to be a fit parent because of her chronic mental illness is a decisive factor. It is in the best interests of Gwendolyn to have \u201cparents\u201d who can and who will, on a consistent, long-term basis, assume all parental responsibilities and who can provide Gwendolyn with the stable and continuous care and nurturing she needs and will continue to need as a child. See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. at 882. The continued reservation of Sally\u2019s rights to intervene in the decisions that affect Gwendolyn\u2019s life, in the circumstances presented here, can only be contrary to Gwendolyn\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">While our courts have emphasized that prospective adoptive parents are not to prevail \u201cautomatically,\u201d even when the child sees them as her psychological parents, <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>392 Mass. 719, 724 (1984), and cases cited at 724-725, those cases do not state a rule of disqualification for the prospective parents. The controlling issue is whether a now four year old girl with a single parent seriously disabled with a chronic mental illness would be benefited more by adoption than she would by the continued intervention in her life of her chronically ill and unfit mother. The judge\u2019s finding that the adoption should go forward is supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>3. <em>Postadoption Visitation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In both brief and argument Sally presses with considerable force the right to continue to visit her daughter following an adoption without her consent, should that occur.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The \u00a7 3 judgment provided that \u201cthere shall be no further visitations between the biological parents and the minor child.\u201d It is possible to interpret this as a final order forbidding visitation at any time and under any circumstances. For several reasons, we conclude that the judge\u2019s intention was not to forbid visitation but was merely to deny Sally\u2019s request for settled and enforceable visitation rights. In other words, we take the judge\u2019s meaning to be that visitation was to be in the complete discretion of Gwendolyn\u2019s adoptive parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The principal witness with regard to visitation was the guardian ad litem (GAL) whom the judge appointed for Gwendolyn. The GAL filed a written report dated May 27, 1988, and, at the judge\u2019s request, visited Sally and Gwendolyn while the trial was in progress in order to make certain that his opinions and recommendations were not based on stale information. Note 4, <em>supra. </em>See <em>Adoption of George, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 268 (1989). He testified that his written report and recommendations were unchanged by the March, 1989, visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The May, 1988, report, ten pages long, concludes with a discussion of the department\u2019s plan for Gwendolyn followed by his summary and recommendations. Based on his inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>view of Sally, Gwendolyn, and the adopting parents, he reported that Gwendolyn knew that Sally was her biological mother, and he described the support of the adopting parents for the \u201cidea of continued contact after . . . adoption.\u201d In his summary the GAL wrote, \u201cBoth [biological] parents love their child, and neither has intentionally caused her harm. Especially for Sally, continued contact with Gwendolyn is extremely important. Such contact, as long as it is carefully monitored and supervised should not be detrimental to Gwendolyn, and in fact, may be helpful. Gwendolyn knows that . . . [Sally] is her mother, and as she [grows] older, should have the benefit of knowing that this woman continues to care for her. It is appropriate that Gwendolyn\u2019s caregivers have control over any visitation as does occur.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The report and testimony of a psychologist, while confined largely to the issue of unfitness, observed that Sally \u2014 though her prognosis is poor \u2014 \u201cexhibits a genuine fondness for her children.\u201d The psychologist\u2019s final report, based on a visit on March 2, 1989, with Sally and Gwendolyn, was to the effect that \u201cSally\u2019s conduct was generally appropriate,\u201d and that during the visit, \u201cGwendolyn appeared comfortable in the situation.\u201d The judge found that the psychologist \u201cindicated that Sally . . . could be a caring parent but not a consistent one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The judge also summarized the testimony of the case worker most familiar with Sally and her children. Her testimony, he found, portrayed Sally \u201cas a caring individual,\u201d but not one capable of providing consistent care for Gwendolyn. The plan presented by the department was silent on the visitation issue. There was, in sum, no testimony advocating that visitation be forbidden, regardless of the wishes of the adopting parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In these circumstances it seems clear to us that the judge intended merely to deny Sally\u2019s application for settled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>enforceable visitation rights, properly leaving the matter of visitation in the hands and discretion of the adoptive parents. Without doubt they are the persons who will be in the best position, as Gwendolyn grows from childhood to a young woman, to determine how often, and under what circumstances, Sally\u2019s visits with Gwendolyn would be in Gwendolyn\u2019s best interests. That arrangement, which in substance follows the recommendation of Gwendolyn\u2019s GAL, is entirely appropriate here. The judgment need not contain explicit language to effectuate that arrangement; it is implicit, unless expressly negated, in the eventual adoption which carries with it the incidents of custody. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">For these reasons we delete from the \u00a7 3 judgment, as ambiguous and possibly misleading, the clause, \u201cThere shall be no further visitations between the biological parents and the minor child.\u201d As so modified, the \u00a7 3 judgment is affirmed, as is the judgment in the custody case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> After the trial and prior to argument, Sally remarried and gave birth to her fourth child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">No question is raised with respect to the \u201cseventy-two hour hearing\u201d requirement contained in G.

After an adjudication awarding custody to the department, the parent is left with the residual rights, see <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. at 884-885, to seek to modify or terminate the custody, see G. L. c. 119, including \u00a7 21 (definition of \u201ccustody\u201d includes parental right to seek judicial review of the exercise of the enumerated powers), \u00a7 26 (review of needs of the child not more than once every six months) and \u00a7 35, and any additional rights, not inconsistent with c. 119, that may be embraced by the settled doctrine that biological parents are the \u201cnatural guardians\u201d of their child. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932). All of these residual rights are terminated upon the allowance of a \u00a7 3 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Sally claims that her then boyfriend, and now husband, created an entirely new environment which must be evaluated by the judge in further hearings. However, the information in the record about her second husband was deeply troubling (in 1984 he pleaded guilty to incest and rape of his sixteen year old daughter), and further hearings would be futile. Sally also claimed that the information concerning her was <em>not </em>sufficiently current. The judge responded by ordering a mid-trial observation of the mother-child relationship by the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, and the judge was satisfied with the subsequent oral report concluding that parental unfitness continued. We see no reason to disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Until recently the Supreme Judicial Court had left unanswered the question whether open adoption was permissible without legislative action. <em>Petition of the Dept. of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 376, 379-380 (1981). See <em>id. </em>at 379, n.3, for a definition of \u201copen adoption,\u201d and n.5 for possible criticism of the concept. Three years later, in <em>Petition of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 696, 702 (1984), the court saw no obstacle to a judge, when evaluating the department\u2019s plan, considering whether the child\u2019s best interests call for visitation rights after adoption. Just a few months earlier, this court had observed that a judge acting on a \u00a7 3 case \u201cmust give equal consideration to any plan proposed by the parents.\u201d <em>Petitions of the Dept, of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>18 Mass.
