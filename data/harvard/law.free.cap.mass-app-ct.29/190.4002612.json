The specific defect claimed here is that the prisoner was not afforded a reclassification hearing as matter of State law before his transfer to the higher custody status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Mass. 537, 537-538 (1983); 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.13 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Notwithstanding the fact that the prisoner was given a hearing before the classification board sixteen days after his transfer to the higher custody status,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was error, as, on review of the record before the Superior Court judge, we cannot say that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact or that either party is entitled to judgment as matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">At the time of the prisoner\u2019s transfer, the applicable regulation of the Department of Correction was 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.13 (1978). In his decision, the Superior Court judge, however, relied on 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.09 (1987), which came into effect after the transfer. The judge apparently also based his decision on what he perceived to be the \u201cemergency\u201d nature of the situation. From language in 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.13(2)(b) (1978) (prisoner may be placed in \u201cawaiting action status\u201d pending hearing or final decision on transfer where there is \u201can immediate threat to the health or safety of the resident or to others\u201d), the defendants and the judge apparently extrapolate the concept of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>emergency transfers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compare 103 Code Mass. Regs. 420.09(3)(a) (1987) (inmate may be transferred prior to classification hearing if \u201csecurity needs so dictate\u201d; such a prehearing transfer must be approved by Commissioner or designee prior to its occurrence). Nowhere, however, has it been made to appear, by affidavit<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or otherwise, that an \u201cemergency\u201d existed. Further, whether the plaintiff was an \u201cescape\u201d risk, as the defendants suggest (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>appears on this record to be a question requiring resolution in an evidentiary or fact-finding proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">With respect to the Department\u2019s claim of qualified immunity, under the applicable standard in these circumstances the governmental officials would be \u201cshielded from liability for civil damages\u201d if, at the time of the challenged actions, \u201ctheir conduct [did] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 &amp; n.30 (1982). <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>405 Mass. 43, 47 (1989). The test is the \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d of the officials\u2019 conduct. <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra. </em>See also <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>405 Mass, at 48, quoting from <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 190 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court to stand for further proceedings that are not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-17\">The volume and frequency of prisoner cases in which, as here, the primary complaint involves a perceived deviation from the Department of Correction\u2019s own regulations points out most dramatically the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>careful and thoughtful initial drafting and continuous scrutiny and review of these regulations. Unless this is done, the limited resources of the trial and appellate courts will, unfortunately, too often be diverted from the genuine and substantial concerns of prisoners to what sometimes appear to be self-inflicted wounds on the part of the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The Superior Court judge determined that, pursuant to the recommendation of the classification board, the plaintiff was subsequently (apparently about two months after the classification hearing) returned to minimum custody status, \u201cthe status he apparently sought to regain,\u201d although at a different institution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\">In his complaint the plaintiff claims that the procedure required by the applicable regulations was not followed and that because of the transfer (1) his likelihood of receiving parole when eligible was reduced, (2) his opportunity to be considered for a placement in a work release program was delayed, (3) he lost earnings from prison employment, (4) his conditions of confinement are more adverse than those at M.C.I., Lancaster, and (5) he lost personal property during the transfer. Although these claims may prove to lack persuasive substance, we are unable to conclude that these issues are moot and that entry of summary judgment on behalf of the defendants was warranted, because it has not been shown that there is no factual basis to any of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The defendants also cite in support of this concept a decision issued pursuant to Rule 1:28 of this court. Without assessing any similarities and differences between that case and the present one, we note that unpublished decisions of this court are not to be relied upon or cited as authority in unrelated cases. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 566 &amp; n.7 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>397 Mass. 498 (1986). <em>Wolbach </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 306 n.5 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">An affidavit filed in support of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment states that the plaintiff had reported late for a work assignment and that because of his behavior and attitude he was determined to be an \u201cescape risk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
