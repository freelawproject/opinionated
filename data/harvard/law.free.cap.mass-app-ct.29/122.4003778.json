Regs. \u00a7 430.24(2) (1987), and with conduct disrupting the orderly running of a correctional institution, 103 Code Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Regs. \u00a7 430.24(8) (1987). The report described the offense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">\u201cOn 7-17-88 at aprox 6:20 p.m., while I was standing at the end of the upper right tier, I did notice inmate Mc-Lellan passing the phone to Jack Shea. This inmate is well aware that he is not to pass the phone on his allotted phone time. Inmate Jack Shea is on isolation status and is not to have the phone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Belisle\u2019s report was signed by the disciplinary officer and by the shift commander, as well as by Belisle. The disciplinary officer is appointed by the superintendent of M.C.I., Cedar Junction, to review disciplinary reports, to determine whether to proceed on disciplinary charges, and to designate the offense as a major or minor matter. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.07 &amp; 430.09 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Designated as \u201cmajor,\u201d the matter went to a hearing. The disciplinary board found the plaintiff guilty on the basis of the report, \u201cgiven inmate refused to attend hearing,\u201d and imposed a sanction consisting of a two-week loss of telephone privileges. After an unsuccessful appeal to the superintendent, the plaintiff brought this action in the nature of certio-rari.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment; only the defendants\u2019 was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In this appeal from the ensuing judgment, the plaintiff makes the following contentions: (1) because the board gave inadequate reasons for its findings and because the evidence relied upon was only the officer\u2019s disciplinary report and the plaintiff\u2019s silence, the board\u2019s decision was in violation of both the department\u2019s regulations and the requirements of due process set forth in <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539 (1974); (2) because of the notation by Officer Belisle on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the superintendent that he tried to stop the \u201cticket,\u201d the decision should have been dismissed; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>(3) regulations of the department as to telephone use were not followed. We affirm the judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">1. <em>Adequacy of reasons and evidence. </em>We'first consider whether there was a violation of local law in the form of the regulations. See <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 444 (1985). The one-page departmental form for recording decisions of the prison disciplinary board provided, inter alla, space for \u201cStatement of Evidence relied upon to Support Finding\u201d and for \u201cReasons for Sanction.\u201d In the appropriate place, the board inserted, \u201cReport relied upon to determine guilt \u2014 given inmate refused to attend hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As reasons, the board inserted: \u201cSanction to serve as a message to the inmate that passing the phone to other inmates is against the rules and will not go overlooked. He has been here long enough to know this. His scheduled phone time is for himself, not anyone else.\u201d The plaintiff urges that the disciplinary report must have some kind of corroborating evidence other than the adverse inference that may be drawn from the plaintiffs silence. The reasons for the sanction, in his view, also are inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The departmental regulations, the relevant portions of which are summarized in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and other authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>do not bear out these claims. To the contrary, they support our conclusion that the statement of evidence relied upon was sufficient and reflects \u201cthe thinking processes that led the prison board to believe the inmate committed the charged offense and to determine that a particular sanction was appropriate.\u201d <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 591 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The plaintiff in this case did not request the presence of the staffperson or any other witnesses, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>and refused to attend the hearing. We, therefore, turn to the disciplinary report itself and compare it with the document found inadequate in <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 443 and 446. There, an officer, \u201cprofessing no particular experience with, or technical understanding of the drug,\u201d and \u201cwho [did] no more than express a \u2018belief that the substance found was \u201cangel dust,\u201d made a report charging the inmate with possession of an \u201cunauthorized controlled substance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The face of the report conceded that the substance was \u201cunknown.\u201d In contrast, the disciplinary report of Officer Belisle recounted his direct observation of the plaintiff passing a telephone to an inmate on disciplinary isolation, an action which, without any additional validation, may be deemed a violation of the rules. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The \u201cadequacy of the accusatory document,\u201d see <em>Wightman </em>at 445; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 589, together with the adverse inference which could be drawn from the plaintiff\u2019s silence (103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.14[3] [1987]), constituted substantial evidence under the departmental regulations. See <em>Stokes </em>at 588-589. This is particularly true where (as here) the evidence was uncontradicted, see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Cedar Junction, </em>396 Mass. 830, 834 (1986), and where the plaintiff\u2019s challenge was that the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>described by the officer did not state an offense. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The plaintiff also raises due process considerations relying on <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 536 (1974). He claims the requirements of Wolff<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> apply here because the offense was designated a \u201cmajor\u201d one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wolff, </em>he argues, governs proceedings where there is a <em>possibility </em>of a loss of good time credits as well as when there is an actual loss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He ignores footnote 19 at 571-572 of <em>Wolff, </em>which specifically states: \u201cWe do not suggest, however, that the procedures required by today\u2019s decision for the deprivation of good time would also be required for the imposition of lesser penalties such as the loss of privileges.\u201d See also <em>Cassesso </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 419, 423-424 (1983). But see <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, 472 </em>U.S. 445, 454 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>392 Mass. 198 (1984), in which the Supreme Court stated, in dictum, \u201cWhere a prison disciplinary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ing <em>may </em>result in the loss of good time credits,\u201d <em>Wolffs </em>requirements must be met (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">While we consider it unlikely that the onetime use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the <em>Hill </em>opinion, in view of other language in <em>Hill, </em>see 453-454, indicates that the potential loss of such credits impairs a liberty interest and hence triggers the due process rights of <em>Wolff, </em>see also <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 323-324 (1976),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we need not decide that issue as, in any event, we think the <em>Stokes </em>decision, 26 Mass. App. Ct. at 588-590, implicitly, if not explicitly, disposes of the plaintiffs contentions that the requirements of <em>Wolff </em>were not met. The Federal Constitution requires, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>only that <em>some </em>evidence support the disciplinary findings, a standard less stringent than the substantial evidence test required by our State law. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Cedar Junction, </em>396 Mass. at 833. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.16(1) (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In <em>Stokes, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 588-589, the plaintiff argued there was \u201cinsufficient specificity in the written decision as to the evidence the board relied on.\u201d In upholding certain of the board\u2019s decisions as not violative of either the department\u2019s regulations or of due process, where the board apparently relied entirely on the disciplinary reports, this court said, \u201c[A]lthough more explanation might have been preferable, in each such decision the board\u2019s rationale is revealed, and there is at least a basis for a reviewing court or agency administrator to understand how the prison board reached the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589. An adequate accusatory document may thus provide the specificity as to the evidence on which the board relied. We hold, as was implicit in <em>Stokes, </em>that it may also, especially when coupled, as here, with the silence of the plaintiff,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> constitute substantial evidence of the offense, and, a fortiori, constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>by <em>Hill </em>See also <em>Vega </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>66 N.Y.2d 130, 139-141 (1985), where the New York Court of Appeals held that written misbehavior reports describing with specificity an incident which the author claimed to have witnessed could, by themselves, constitute substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">As in <em>Stokes, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 589, there is no merit to the claim that the stated reason for the sanction, a two-week loss of telephone privileges, was constitutionally inadequate. The \u201cpenalty [not here onerous] was based on the board\u2019s view of the seriousness of the particular offense.\u201d <em>Stokes </em>at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">2. <em>Officer\u2019s notation. </em>Officer Belisle, apparently, had second thoughts about the incident. According to an affidavit filed by the plaintiff in support of his cross-motion for summary judgment, the writing on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal form to the superintendent was Belisle\u2019s and stated: \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion this ticket should be void. I did try to stop this ticket before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that Belisle\u2019s notation should have resulted in a dismissal of the board\u2019s decision does not recognize that, once a disciplinary report has been filed, the decision to proceed rests not with the reporting officer, but with the disciplinary officer. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.09(1) (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">There are many reasons, moreover, why an officer may have a change of heart or mind other than the truth of the allegations. While Belisle may -have had discretion whether to issue a disciplinary report, he had no discretion under the regulations to prevent prosecution of the charges once they had been initiated. His unexplained notation on the appeal form, entered after a finding of guilty by the disciplinary board, is not a sufficient ground for requiring prison officials to follow Belisle\u2019s revised opinion or to reverse the board\u2019s finding or the denial of the appeal by the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The remaining contention of the plaintiff that the department did not allow him to use the telephone to call attorneys or the courts during the period of the sanction is not sup- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>. ported by the record and, moreover, has no relevance to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The plaintiff also sought to bring this action under G. L. c. 231 A. This was inappropriate. See <em>McLellan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, post </em>933, 934 (1990), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The plaintiffs complaint stated that he refused to attend the hearing because there is no rule or regulation prohibiting \u201cpassing the phone.\u201d He wisely refrains from making this argument on appeal in view of 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 482.09(1) (1986), which prohibits inmates in disciplinary isolation from having access to a telephone, except to call courts and attorneys, without authorization of the superintendent. McLellan\u2019s providing telephone access to an inmate in isolation can readily be considered to interfere with the orderly running of the institution (\u00a7 430.24[8]), an offense listed in Belisle\u2019s disciplinary report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The departmental regulations require that: \u201cThe evidence relied upon for the guilty finding and the reasons for the sanction .... be set out in specific terms.\u201d 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.17(2) (1987). The proponent of the disciplinary report has the burden of proving the offense by a preponderance of evidence. \u00a7 430.16(1)(1987). The board is not bound by the rules of evidence (\u00a7430.13[3] [1987]) but is to make its findings based on \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d \u00a7 430.16(1). If the inmate wishes to have the reporting staffperson present, he is to file a form (\u00a7430.11 [4] [1987]) and such staffperson, when requested by the inmate or the disciplinary board, shall attend the hearing unless a determination of unavailability has been made. \u00a7430.14(5)(1987). The inmate may call witnesses and present other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>evidence in his defense when permitting him to do so will not be unduly hazardous to personal safety or institutional security. \u00a7430.14(4) (1987). He may, but is not required to, make oral or written statements in his defense; however, an inmate\u2019s silence may be used to draw an adverse inference against him. \u00a7430.14(3)(1987). Such silence cannot be the sole basis for a guilty finding. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The requirements of <em>Wolff </em>as set forth in <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985), are, insofar as here relevant: \u201c(3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d See also <em>Wolff, </em>418 U.S. at 563, 566. <em>Hill </em>also added a requirement that \u201cthe findings of the prison disciplinary board [be] supported by some evidence in the record.\u201d 472 U.S. at 454.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The department\u2019s regulations distinguish between major and minor matters, see 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.09(3), 430.11(1) (1987), and also between major and minor sanctions. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.25 (1987). Although major \u201csanctions\u201d are not expressly linked to major \u201cmatters,\u201d the connection is implicit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The plaintiff also argues that, because he was housed in the departmental segregation unit, the report had the potential of prolonging his confinement in segregation and therefore entitled him to the due process rights set forth in <em>Wolff. </em>Subsequent to the filing of his complaint, the plaintiff was released on parole. The claim is therefore moot. We treat, without so deciding, his other claims as still viable. He may have a personal stake in their outcome if findings of guilty on disciplinary reports have serious collateral consequences. See <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>369 Mass. 701, 703-704 (1976); 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.17(4) (providing for retention of disciplinary reports where an inmate has been found guilty). See also 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.16(2) (1987). But see <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, </em>425 U.S. 308, 311 n.1 (1976), where counsel for the respondents conceded that the action was moot as to a respondent who had been paroled two years after the suit was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>McKinnon </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>568 F.2d 930, 939 &amp; n.9 (2d Cir. 1977), takes the view that the inmate\u2019s rights depend upon the maximum penalty which may be imposed.
