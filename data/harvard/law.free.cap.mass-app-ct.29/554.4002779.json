The plaintiffs, Local 1445, United Food and Commercial Workers Union and the Massachusetts Council of Churches, apparently, apprehend erosion. They brought an action to enjoin Filene\u2019s from opening its store in the Natick Mall before noon on the first four Sundays of December, 1989, although Filene\u2019s had obtained a permit so to do issued in accordance with G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 7, by the police chief of Natick. December, 1989, has come and gone, and the controversy, as pleaded, is moot. But the question raised is one susceptible to repetition, yet likely to evade review, and it has a measure of public interest. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943); <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 783 (1984); <em>Andrade </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>406 Mass. 337, 339 (1989). We, therefore, consider the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">During the Colonial era, the Sunday proscriptions were fundamental and comprehensive. \u201c[P] laying, uncivil walking, drinking, travelling from town to town, going on shipboard, sporting, or in any way misspending that precious time,\u201d was forbidden conduct. So was \u201cservile work . . . such as are not works of Piety, of Charity or of Necessity.\u201d Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Committee to Consider the Laws Relative to Lord\u2019s Day Observance, 1962 Senate Doc. No. 404, 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1791, the General Court passed a new Lord\u2019s Day Act, whose preamble left no doubt that the Commonwealth meant business about there being no business. The preamble pronounced: \u201cWhereas the observance of the Lord\u2019s day, is highly promotive of the welfare of a Community, by affording necessary seasons for relaxation from labour &amp; the cares of business; for moral reflections &amp; conversation on the duties of life, &amp; frequent errors of human conduct; for public and private worship of the Maker, Governor &amp; Judge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>World and for those acts of charity which support and adorn the Christian Society. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">After the Civil War, exceptions to the sweeping prohibition of work and play on Sunday began to appear. Travel was permitted in 1887, so long as it was not work. The accelerating exceptions in this century are a study in changing mores. Operating ice cream parlors became lawful in 1902; engaging in amateur photography in 1908; operating a motor vehicle in 1914; unpaid gardening around a dwelling in 1930; Sunday golf in 1931; and dancing at a Sunday wedding in 1955. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Conducting business on Sundays is still generally prohibited by G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 5. There follows in G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 6, a long list of activities not prohibited on Sundays. We are concerned with clause 50 of \u00a7 6, which permits retail businesses to open on Sunday at noon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 616, \u00a7 2, the chief of police of a city or town<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cmay issue a permit for the performance on Sunday of necessary work or labor which could not be performed on any other day without serious suffering, loss, damage or public inconvenience, or which could not be performed on any other day without delay to military defense work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">By St. 1988, c. 311, \u00a7 2, a provision was added that permits for Sunday work and stores \u201cshall not be granted without the approval of the department of labor and industries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>which shall approve such permits only on a uniform basis throughout the commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Under the power conferred by G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 7, Dennis R. Mannix, the police chief of Natick, granted, to any retail store which requested it, permission to open before noon on the first four Sundays of December in 1989. He gave as his reasons, first, a desire to spread throughout an entire day the overcrowding and traffic congestion generated by heavy Christmas holiday shopping and, second, the convenience of people who \u201cwork or have religious or family commitments or are unable to shop during the Christmas season except on Sunday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">On December 7, 1988, the Department of Labor and Industries announced that, \u201c[i]n order to meet the pressing needs of retailers during this holiday season, [it would] consider approved all Sunday opening permits granted by local authorities under G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 7, . . . until further notice.\u201d Such, the Department states in its brief, continues to be its policy, i.e., there has been no \u201cfurther notice.\u201d As the case was presented to us, the chief of police has this year again granted permission for retail openings before noon during the post-Thanksgiving stretch of the Christmas holiday shopping season.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In their first amended complaint, the plaintiffs asked for injunctive relief prohibiting Filene\u2019s from opening prior to noon and sought a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 2, determining, in substance, that the permits for the early opening were not based on a proper showing of necessity within the meaning of G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Whatever its religious antecedents, the Sunday law is now, by its terms, called the Common Day of Rest Law. G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 1. It is a statute for the secular benefit \u2014 respite \u2014 of the general public. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Crown Kosher Super Mkt. of Mass., Inc., </em>366 U.S. 617, 627-630 (1961). <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Has, </em>122 Mass. 40, 42 (1877). <em>Zayre Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>372 Mass. 423, 434, 444 (1977) (Braucher, J., dissenting). There are criminal penalties, in the form of fines, for its violation. G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 5. Beyond fines, the statute confers upon the Attorney General (and also upon district attorneys and, in cities and towns, upon the mayor, city manager, city council, or board of selectmen) the authority to bring actions in the Superior Court to enjoin any violation of c. 136. The injunctive relief provision appears to have had its origins in a recommendation made by a minority of the committee which prepared the 1962 report. Injunctive relief, the minority thought, would constitute an effective means to discipline retailers who might otherwise regard the relatively modest statutory fines as a reasonable cost of doing business. See 1962 Senate Doc. No. 404 at 53, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Concerning the criminal sanction in the Common Day of Rest Law, its invocation lies in the discretion of prosecutorial authority, not on complaint of members (whether individually or in association) of the general public. <em>Linda R. S. </em>v. <em>Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973). <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 961, 962 (1975). As to the injunction sanction in G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 10, the category of persons who may employ it is similarly limited. When, as in \u00a7 10, the power to seek injunctions is expressly conferred upon specified public officers, we may assume that the Legislature did not intend to create the private attorney general rights which the plaintiffs purport to exercise. Such rights, when intended, have been expressly granted. <em>Massachusetts Soc. of Optometrists </em>v. <em>Waddick, </em>340 Mass. 581, 584 (1960). Compare G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 12, c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 &amp; 11, and c. 93B, \u00a7 12A, which expressly grant private rights of action in addition to the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement powers. Compare also G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and c. 41, \u00a7 8IBB, limiting appeal of administrative decisions in zoning and planning cases to aggrieved persons. When a statute confers standing in relation to particular subject matter, that statute, rather than more general ideas about standing, governs who may initiate legal action in relation to the subject matter. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number><em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 46 (1977). <em>Bello </em>v. <em>South Shore Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 770, 780 (1981). See <em>Knowles </em>v. <em>Codex Corp., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 493, 498-499 (1981). We have no difficulty concluding that only the public officers named in \u00a7 10 may bring proceedings to enjoin violations of G. L. c. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The plaintiffs gain no ground in asking for a declaration under G. L. c. 231 A<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the permission to open early was not validly granted, although in that context the basis for their lack of standing may rest on a slightly different and more general basis. The plaintiffs\u2019 interest in a more strict application of the Common Day of Rest Law is that they regard Sunday morning work as subversive of the respite which the statute is designed to produce. Views on public policy, although held with strong conviction and moral fervor, are not bases for standing to sue. <em>Valley Forge Christian College </em>v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 486 (1982). <em>Pratt </em>v. Boston, 396 Mass. 37, 42 (1985).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Persons who ask a court to \u201cassume the difficult and delicate duty of passing upon the acts of a coordinate branch of the government\u201d must demonstrate that they suffer or are in danger of suffering some particularized legal harm. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Bowker, </em>333 Mass. 455, 459 (1956). <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>407 Mass. 377, 387-389 (1990) (Liacos, C.J., concurring). Other phrases which attempt to catch what furnishes standing to maintain an action against the government are \u201cthat a personal interest is <em>directly </em>affected; that their <em>rights </em>have been impaired; that they have demonstrated <em>legally cognizable injury, </em>or shown a breach of any <em>duty\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 388. What emerges is that someone who may maintain an action against the government must be able to describe impairment of an economic or civic interest. So, for example: a store which is denied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Sunday opening permit may challenge the lawfulness of the denial (see <em>Zayre Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., 372 </em>Mass. 423); a factory owner may challenge denial of a Sunday permit (see <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>344 Mass. 314 [1962]); citizens, individually or through associations, may challenge laws bearing on the taxes they pay (see <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Tobacco Distribs. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>354 Mass. 85, 88 [1968]; <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., 373 </em>Mass. 290 [1977]).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Clause 50 of G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 6, provides that employees who work on Sunday shall be paid time and a half and shall not be required to work, and that an employee\u2019s refusal to work shall not be a basis for discharge or any other penalty. In the face of these protections the union is remitted to arguing that subtle pressures on its members to show up on Sunday mornings are inherent in the situation. This is too intangible a consequence to amount to impairment of economic or civic interest; it is not a legally cognizable injury. We need not consider whether an unincorporated association such as a labor union can bring a legal action on behalf of individual members in the absence of a showing of particularized harm to those members. Cf. <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>366 Mass. 667, 675 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Concerning the plaintiffs\u2019 postjudgment effort to amend their complaint to add a count in the nature of mandamus, the same standing problem confronts them. Moreover, the police chiefs issuance of a permit fell in the category of a discretionary act, see <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>344 Mass. at 318, a category of action which a court may not review in a mandamus proceeding. <em>Lutheran Serv. Assn. of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., 191 </em>Mass. 341, 344 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Having decided the case on the basis of the lack of legal standing of the plaintiffs, we do not reach the merits. We do not intimate an opinion whether the police chief, in granting permission to Filene\u2019s to open before noon on Sundays in December, exceeded his discretionary authority under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>c. 136, \u00a7 7. Cf. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall </em>River, 344 Mass. at 318 (construing predecessor statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The quoted material is from a statute enacted in 1672 and also appeared in a document entitled \u201cReport of the Committee on the Judiciary on Sunday Laws\u201d produced by the Common Council of the City of Boston in 1887. Because it is more accessible, we cite to the 1962 document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Clause 50 was added by St. 1977, c. 722. In its 1977 form, clause 50 allowed retail stores to open on Sundays between Thanksgiving and Christmas. St. 1982, c. 556, extended the retail exemption to the rest of the year but introduced the prohibition on opening in the forenoon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., </em>404 Mass. 476, 479-480 (1989). Currently there are fifty-one clauses listing categories of exemptions. That is eight more categories than were listed in the most recent general recodification of the Common Day of Rest Law, St. 1962, c. 616, \u00a7 2. Many of the exception clauses have subcategories, some of which are curious joinings. Clause forty, for example, exempts work incident to religious exercises and preparation for trials by lawyers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">In Boston it is the police commissioner, and in a town where there is no police department it is the chairman of the board of selectmen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\">After a judge of the Superior Court had dismissed the complaint on standing grounds, the plaintiffs moved to vacate judgment and to amend their complaint to ask for relief in the nature of mandamus.
