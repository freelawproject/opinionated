We agree that the plaintiff did not become a member in service prior to 1957 and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The importance of the initial date of membership is that, if the plaintiff became a member prior to 1957,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he is entitled to higher retirement benefits, because those benefits would be computed on the basis of a two-year formula pursuant to St. 1951, c. 784, \u00a7 1 (former G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10[2][a]), rather than a five-year average of his annual salary pursuant to St. 1957, c. 661, \u00a7 3 (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10[2][a], as in effect prior to St. 1984, c. 473, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The question then is when the plaintiff became a \u201cmember in service.\u201d The dates of his employment are not in dispute. He was first employed by the Commonwealth as a laborer, bathhouse attendant, and lifeguard with the MDC during the summer months from 1952 through 1959. After service in the United States Army, he became a teacher in the Quincy school system, and later an assistant attorney general for the Commonwealth. No one contests that he became a \u201cmember in service\u201d when he joined the Quincy school system in 1962.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1982, he applied for a retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">1. <em>The claim of \u201cautomatic\u201d membership. </em>Citing to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(a)(iv) (set forth in part in the appendix to this opinion), substantially unchanged since its enactment by St. 1945, c. 658, the plaintiff argues that he became a \u201cmember in service\u201d \u201cupon the completion of six calendar months of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>service.\u201d Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(\u00bfz)(iv), did not give him automatic membership or an absolute right to membership after six calendar months. Section 3(2)(a)(iv) refers to c. 32, \u00a7 <em>3(2)(d), </em>set forth in part in the appendix, and also substantially unchanged insofar as here relevant since its enactment by St. 1945, c. 658, which gives the appropriate retirement board<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cfull jurisdiction\u201d to determine whether seasonal or certain other non-permanent employees are \u201cregularly employed\u201d so as to be eligible for membership. No such determination was made. Moreover, the judge made a finding based on facts in the record that the plaintiff was not a member of the State retirement system during the period he was employed by the MDC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">2. <em>Effect of \"buy-back.\u201d </em>In 1973, the Massachusetts State Retirement Board permitted the plaintiff to \u201cbuy back\u201d his prior MDC service. Each of the various \u201cbuy-back\u201d provisions cited by the plaintiff in support of his theory that he was a \u201cmember in service\u201d prior to 1957<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> speaks of \u201ccredit\u201d or \u201ccreditable service.\u201d Thus, if G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(3), is applicable, the governing provision is the next-to-last sentence, which provides: \u201cUpon the completion of such make-up payments such member shall be entitled to <em>all creditable service </em>to which he would have been entitled had he joined the system when first eligible to become a member.\u201d (emphasis supplied). An entitlement to \u201ccreditable service,\u201d G. L. c. 32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u00a7 3(3), or to \u201ccredit\u201d as referred to in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 3(5) and 4(2)(c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not create retroactive membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">This conclusion follows from the definitions of \u201ccreditable service\u201d and \u201cmembership service\u201d contained in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. \u201cMembership service\u201d is defined as \u201cservice as an employee in any governmental unit rendered <em>since becoming a member </em>of any system pertaining to such governmental unit for which credit is allowable ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). \u201cCreditable service\u201d is broader and is defined as \u201call membership service, prior service and other service for which credit is allowable to any member . . . .\u201d That \u201ccredit\u201d or \u201ccreditable service\u201d does not determine when a person becomes a \u201cmember in service\u201d is apparent also from c. 32, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">3. <em>Remaining contentions, </em>a) The plaintiff makes the curious argument that St. 1957, c. 661, \u00a7 4, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>is of no effect as it is not part of the General Laws. An act passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor has the force of law. Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 2, of the Massachusetts Constitution. Art. 48, The Referendum, II, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. Moreover, as indicated in 1A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 20.21, at 74 (4th ed. 1972), it is preferable not to include transitional period provisions in the main body of an act. \u201cBetter drafting practice dictates that they be placed in separate sections at the end of the statute. In this way when the act is included in the permanent code of laws of the state, the temporary provisions may be eliminated without destroying the context or the continuity of the permanent law.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>b) As we have held that the plaintiff was not a \u201cmember in service\u201d until 1962, the plaintiff has no standing to claim (1) that there may be a gap between May, 31, 1957, and August 13, 1957, when the Governor signed the bill,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or (2) that accrued pension rights at the time of the 1957 statute were unconstitutionally impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">c) That CRAB was late in promulgating its decision did not deprive it of jurisdiction. <em>Methuen Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>384 Mass. 797, 798 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">d) The decision by CRAB which incorporated findings one through nine of the administrative magistrate was adequate to comply with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">e) The plaintiff also claims that the decision was improperly issued as there were three members of the appeal board (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16[4]), and two abstained from voting. Since there was only one signatory to the decision, he urges that it lacks the necessary majority approval. The plaintiff had requested that the representative from the Division of Public Employee Retirement Administration not hear the appeal to CRAB as that division had previously issued an opinion contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s position. But see \u00a7 32, 16(4). Through a misunderstanding of the plaintiff\u2019s position, or because the plaintiff had been an assistant attorney general, or otherwise, the Attorney General\u2019s designee to the appeal board abstained from voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The question is whether the irregularity requires a remand to CRAB. Since there is no factual dispute, and since we have set forth our interpretation of the statutes involved, \u201cthere is no real doubt\u201d as to the decision which CRAB would make on remand. <em>United Food Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>375 Mass. 238, 245 (1978). In such circumstances a remand is unnecessary. <em>Ibid.

Although the plaintiff contends that he does not know whether deductions were made for retirement purposes, the fact that he later \u2018bought back\u2019 his service during these years for retirement purposes, indicates [that no deductions were made and that] the plaintiff was not a member of the retirement system [during his MDC service].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">It is not clear under which section of G. L. c. 32 the \u201cbuy-back\u201d was made. At various times, the plaintiff points to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(3), \u00a7 3(5), and \u00a7 4(2) (c). For purposes of this opinion, we need not consider which was the applicable provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">If c. 32, \u00a7 3(5), is applicable, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>the plaintiffs rights are governed by the following language: \u201cUpon the completion of such payments such member shall receive the same credit for such period of his previous intrastate service ... as would have been allowed if such service had been rendered by him in the governmental unit by which he is presently employed.\u201d Chapter 32, \u00a7 4(2) (c), also speaks of \u201ccredit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The definition of \u201cmember in service\u201d in c. 32, \u00a7 3(l)(o)(i), and the qualifications for eligibility for membership in \u00a7 3(2) have, insofar as here relevant, remained substantially the same since the enactment of St. 1945, c. 658.
