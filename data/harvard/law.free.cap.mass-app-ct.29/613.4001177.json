L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(6)(1), as in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>prior to St. 1988, c. 124. Their appeals raise common and discrete issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">On January 11, 1988, State Trooper Anthony Thomas, a member of the narcotics unit of the office of the district attorney for Plymouth County, went to an apartment building at 227 North Main Street in Brockton.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There, he was met by a black male named Angelo who escorted Thomas to apartment twelve on the third floor. Angelo knocked on the door, spoke in \u201cbroken English\u201d with a person inside the apartment through a crack in the door, slid $20 which he had obtained from Thomas through the crack and received a plastic bag containing .77 grams of twenty-seven percent cocaine in return. Thomas was unable to observe any occupant of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The trooper returned to the apartment on January 12, 1988, and consummated another transaction. When he knocked on the apartment door, Thomas heard a noise like \u201cwood being removed from a metal object\u201d and a \u201cthump.\u201d A person with a \u201cdark-skinned hand\u201d opened the door the width that a chain lock allowed. Thomas exchanged $20 for a plastic bag containing .9 grams of twenty-five percent cocaine. Again, Thomas could not identify any person in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">At 5:45 a.m. on January 13, 1988, six police officers executed a no-knock search warrant at the apartment. The front door was opened with a battering ram. As this was occurring, an officer stationed outside on a porch observed a flickering candle and two or three people run from a bedroom. Another officer, positioned in the driveway, saw a light go on, a kitchen window opened, and three tin foil packages thrown by an arm coming out the window. One package fell at the officer\u2019s feet and was empty; the other two landed on an adjacent roof top; one contained twenty-nine plastic bags (42.08 grams) of thirty-one percent cocaine and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>contained twenty-seven plastic bags (24.35 grams) of thirty-one percent cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The police officers found the five defendants in the living room. Two of them were \u201cbare chested.\u201d A search of the kitchen turned up six plastic bags (7.54 grams) of thirty-one percent cocaine and two containers of lactose,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> all on open shelves. Each defendant carried cash.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each defendant denied that he lived in the apartment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and each stated that he was an unemployed construction worker and came from the Dominican Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The apartment was sparsely furnished.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was only a mattress in the bedroom, a couch and a chair in the living room, and some men\u2019s clothing, not linked to any defendant, strewn about. When the police entered, the front door had been barricaded inside with two bracketed lengths of two-by-four boards across the door, a dead bolt, a slide bolt and a chain lock.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A second door led to an outer porch and was secured from the inside by nailed two-by-four boards and plywood covering the glass portion. On top of the plywood was a calculator and behind it $400 in cash. In the bathroom, the police discovered an overflowing bucket of water under the spout in the bathtub; water was dripping or running slowly from the spout. A State trooper testified that he had seen such an arrangement almost every time there were similar barricades and that it is typically used to dispose of bulk cocaine by dissolving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>1. <em>The motions to dismiss the indictments. </em>The defendants Arias, Diaz and Mehejia challenge the denials of their motions to dismiss the indictments. Each relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160 (1982), and claims that the evidence presented to the grand jury showed no more than mere presence in the apartment. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The general and long-standing rule is that a \u201ccourt will not review the competency or sufficiency of the evidence before a grand jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 450 (1984). An exception to that rule was laid down in <em>McCarthy, supra </em>at 163\u2014 \u201c[A]t the very least the grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused . . . and probable cause to arrest him.\u201d 385 Mass. at 163. \u201c[A] requirement of sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused and probable cause to arrest him is considerably less exacting than a requirement of sufficient evidence to warrant a guilty finding.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra </em>at 451. \u201cProbable cause does not require the same type of specific evidence of each element of the offense as would be needed to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 104 (2d ed. 1983). The question in this case is whether the grand jury was presented with sufficient evidence which would justify a finding that when the police officers made the arrests, they had \u201creasonably trustworthy information sufficient ... to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass. 169, 174 (1982), quoting from <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-176 (1949). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, supra </em>at 450; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 402 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Here, unlike <em>McCarthy, </em>there was evidence before the grand jury of more than mere presence of the defendants. The purchase of cocaine on the two days preceding the execution of the warrant, the heavily barricaded apartment, the time of day, the attempt to dispose of cocaine, the cocaine and other materials found in the search of the apartment, the sparse furnishings, the cash found on each of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and in the apartment, and their unemployed status provided ample probable cause to arrest. \u201cIn dealing with probable cause ... we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">2. <em>The motions for required findings of not guilty. </em>Each of the defendants presented a motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> arguing that the evidence established no more than mere presence at a scene where cocaine was found. Our review of the denials of the motions is under familiar standards. We look to see whether any rational trier of fact, taking the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. 529, 533 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendants were charged with trafficking in cocaine with a net weight of twenty-eight or more but less than 100 grams. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32(6)(1), as in effect prior to St. 1988, c. 124. Possession of the quantity of cocaine found in the apartment and on the adjacent roof, as well as the packaging of the drug, permitted an inference of trafficking. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 653 (1990), and cases cited. The crucial question is whether the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence that each defendant possessed the cocaine found. \u201cPossession implies \u2018control and power,\u2019 exclusive or joint . . ., or, in the case of \u2018constructive possession,\u2019 knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. at 409, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1984). \u201cProof of possession of a controlled substance may be established by circumstantial evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>therefrom.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426 (1985). \u201cWhile presence in an area where contraband is found \u2018alone cannot show the requisite knowledge, power, or intention to exercise control over the [contraband] . . . presence, supplemented by other incriminating evidence, will serve to tip the scale in favor of sufficiency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brzezinski, supra </em>at 409, 410, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977). \u201cAn inference drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. at 533, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977). \u201cThe Government . . . need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, supra, </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Systems Architects, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 373, 377 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 847 (1985). \u201cWhether an inference is warranted or is impermissibly remote must be determined, not by hard and fast rules of law, but by experience and, common sense\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 30, 32 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 508 (1983). \u201cNeither juries nor judges are required to divorce themselves of common sense, but rather should apply to facts which they find proven such reasonable inferences as are justified in the light of their experience as to the natural inclinations of human beings.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>680 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case depended on proof of constructive possession of the cocaine in the apartment by each defendant. This required a showing that each knew of the presence of cocaine and had the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. at 409. It is beyond serious question that the judge could reasonably infer from the evidence we have recited that each defendant had knowledge of the presence of cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>(1977). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>358 Mass. 817 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">There could hardly be more potent evidence of an intention by the defendants to exercise dominion and control of the premises and its contents than their presence at an early morning hour in a heavily barricaded apartment, sparsely furnished and in the absence of either the owner or the tenant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 370, 371-372 (1975). The defendants\u2019 reliance on cases which involve defendants who are shown to have, or not to have,, some property interest in the premises where drugs are found is misplaced. Those cases represent only examples of the kind of circumstantial evidence thought persuasive on the question of knowledge or constructive possession in particular and distinguishable circumstances. See and compare, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, supra </em>at 818; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, supra </em>at 410; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. at 652-653; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. at 371; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 429 (1985). As this case demonstrates, \u201c[e]ach instance of a prosecution for possession with the necessary intent has its own singularities, which makes precedent a somewhat imperfect guide . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sendele, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 758 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>We conclude that the judge, taking the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, could have found as to each defendant the essential elements of trafficking in cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt. As we have said, the Commonwealth\u2019s proof \u201cneed not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\u201d as, for example, the possibility that the defendants were casual visitors to the apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merola, </em>405 Mass. at 533. Indeed, here the physical characteristics of the apartment, the time of day and the absence of either the owner or tenant cut heavily against such an inference. An inference need not be necessary and inescapable but only reasonable and possible.
