Judgment was entered for the defendant and the plaintiff has appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">The dispositive facts, as must be the case when summary judgment is granted, are undisputed. Costa was hurt while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>working on a \u201cmangle\u201d machine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Liberty was the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for Costa\u2019s employer, Arkwright Finishing Company. The \u201cmangle\u201d machine was manufactured by Morrison. Textile Machinery Company (Morrison). Liberty made medical payments and disability payments to Costa, provided rehabilitation services, and paid a lump sum settlement of $50,000. Neither Costa, who did not consult a lawyer, nor Liberty brought an action under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, against the manufacturer of the \u201cmangle\u201d machine, Morrison, on the ground that its defective design caused Costa\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Liberty\u2019s tepid enthusiasm for pursuing Morrison was understandable; it was also Morrison\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Costa\u2019s complaint may be read as alleging that Liberty was negligent, at best, or deceitfully in breach of its fiduciary duty to Costa, at worst, in failing to advise him before the statute of limitations ran out (the accident occurred on April 16, 1979) that he might wish to explore the third-party liability of Morrison. There is also a claim under G. L. c. 93A. The action must assume the existence of a duty by a workers\u2019 compensation insurer to advise an employee of potential third-party liability claims. See <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 804-805 (1982); <em>Flattery </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>397 Mass. 143, 145 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, an employee injured in an industrial accident or the workers\u2019 compensation insurer may bring an action against a person other than the employer (the \u201cthird party\u201d) if that person has legal liability for the injury. From any recovery, the funds shall first be applied for the benefit of the insurer to the extent of benefits paid by the insurer to the employee; the excess shall be retained by or paid to (depending upon who has brought the action) the employee. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 661, 669 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(2d ed. 1981), supplemented by Nason &amp; Wall, Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act \u00a7 13.2 (1990). As applicable on April 16, 1979, the date of Costa\u2019s injury, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 888, \u00a7 1, and amended by St. 1971, c. 941, \u00a7 1, did not permit an insurer to initiate an action against a third party unless compensation had first been paid to or <em>claimed </em>by the employee. In earlier versions of \u00a7 15, the insurer controlled third-party litigation unless the employee took the daring step of seeking recovery from the third party, but that would have constituted an election not to seek workers\u2019 compensation. See St. 1943, c. 432.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As amended by St. 1980, c. 488, \u00a7 15, provides that the insurer may not proceed against a third party unless compensation has been paid \u201cnor until seven months following the date of . . . injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The legislative development of \u00a7 15 is one of transformation from an insurer\u2019s right (see, e.g., <em>Calligaris\u2019s Case, </em>292 Mass. 397, 398 [1935], decided under still earlier forms of the statute) to a joint right at which the employee has the first go.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A statutory scheme which, since 1971, makes the employee and insurer competitors for control of the action against third parties,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> does not seem to contemplate that the insurer will give tutorial on the subject of \u00a7 15 to the employee. Significantly, all texts of \u00a7 15 over the last fifty years have provided that settlements under \u00a7 15 must be approved by the Industrial Accident Board, the reviewing board, or the court in which an action has been commenced after an opportunity has been afforded to both insurer and employee to be heard on the merits of the settlement. The drafters of \u00a715 apparently assumed an adversary relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the insurer and the employee-claimant, rather than a fiduciary relationship; hence the requirement of a referee. Section 15 does not impose the sort of duty for which the plaintiff contends.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Statutory text and history apart, there is nothing in the workers\u2019 compensation contract, the other possible source of such a duty, see <em>Swift </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. 373, 377 (1987), which imposes any obligation on the insurer to instruct the employee about third-party claim possibilities. The insurer is bound under the contract to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits, not to dispense legal advice, which, indeed, is nowise its business. See G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 46A.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We, therefore, conclude that Liberty had no duty to apprise Costa of the possibilities of a \u00a7 15 claim against the manufacturer of the machine. That conclusion disposes, as well, of Costa\u2019s c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">A \u201cmangle\u201d machine dyes continuous lengths of cloth by routing the cloth through a bath of dye by means of a series of rollers.
