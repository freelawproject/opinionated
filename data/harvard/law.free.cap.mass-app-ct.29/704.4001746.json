Specifically, we must decide whether a designation of beneficiary form executed pursuant to an individual retirement account (IRA) takes precedence over a later testamentary disposition directing the distribution of the same IRA proceeds. We hold that a designation of beneficiary form, executed in accordance with the provisions of the IRA plan under which it is to operate, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>trols.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the judgment of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Leo Fitzpatrick (the decedent) established, over the years, six IRAs at Old Colony Bank of Barnstable County (now Bank of Boston) and at Bank of Boston. In the designation of beneficiary forms of both banks, the decedent named his brother, Francis J. Fitzpatrick, as beneficiary of one hundred percent of the benefits at the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the IRAs were created and the beneficiary was designated, the decedent executed a will which contained a provision disposing of his \u201cIRA account [s] which stand in [his] name and Francis J. Fitzpatrick as successor administrator, [to be given] to [his] said brother, Francis J. Fitzpatrick and [his] sister, Claire D. Small, in equal shares . . . .\u201d The decedent died three weeks later. The decedent\u2019s will was presented for probate and allowed, with the decedent\u2019s brother as appointed executor. A first and final account was presented to the Probate Court that did not include the six IRAs, and a statement of objections was filed, objecting to the failure to include the IRAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>After hearing, a Probate Court judge ordered that the amounts on deposit in the decedent\u2019s IRAs be included in the assets of the estate and that full effect be given to the decedent\u2019s testamentary intent, i.e., that the brother and the sister\u2019s successors in interest<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> share equally the amounts on deposit in the IRAs. The brother, named sole beneficiary in the form designating the beneficiaries of the IRAs, appeals on the ground that G. L. c. 167D, \u00a7 30, precludes the court from giving effect to the decedent\u2019s testamentary intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Section 30, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 590, \u00a7 2, and in effect at the time the designation of beneficiary forms were executed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">\u201cAny designation of any beneficiary in connection with and as provided by an instrument intended to establish a pension, profit-sharing, or other deferred compensation or retirement plan, trust or custodial account described in . . . sections [401(a), 401(f), 403(b)(7), 405(a), 408(a), 408(h)] of the Internal Revenue Code . . . shall be effective according to its terms, <em>notwithstanding any purported testamentary disposition allowed by statute, by operation of law or otherwise to the </em>contrary\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument made before the Probate Court that \u00a7 30 should be read only to govern the rights between the bank and its depositors and that rights between the parties should not be affected because statutes like \u00a7 30 are intended only for the protection of banks. In <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>361 Mass. 156, 157-158 (1972), a statute arguably similar to \u00a7 30 was held not to apply to disputes between parties, but the statute in the <em>Doucette </em>case<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> speaks of \u201cdis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>charging] the liability of the bank,\u201d language which is absent in \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">IRAs are \u201cretirement plans,\u201d see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a) (1988), and are, thus, governed by \u00a7 30. The statute provides that a person who establishes an IRA is free to change the designation of beneficiary under that IRA and that, so long as he or she does so in the manner specified by the IRA plan, the change will have controlling effect. Section 30, in effect, adopts the policy of transactional finality that underlies the rule in insurance matters. In enacting \u00a7 30, the Legislature appears to have determined that the policy giving effect to testamentary intent should yield to the policy of giving prompt and final effect to the beneficiary designations in retirement plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In this case, the decedent, although free to change or revoke his designation of beneficiary under his IRAs (and free to designate his estate as his beneficiary), failed to comply with the provisions of the IRA plans under which he established his IRAs and, instead, apparently sought to change his designation by his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to enter disallowing the objections to the executor\u2019s first and final account, thus giving effect to the decedent\u2019s IRA designations of beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that the plan provides any means for designating or changing a beneficiary other than the form provided by the plan custodian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The Bank of Boston, Individual Retirement Account, Designation of Primary Beneficiaries form executed by the decedent on December 12, 1979, contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">\u201cI hereby designate the person(s) listed below as primary beneficiary(ies) to receive all benefits that become due and payable in the event of my death under The First National Bank of Boston Master Individual Retirement Account (the \u2018Plan\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">\u201cIf I have not designated any beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary survives me, any benefits that become due and payable under the Plan in the event of my death shall be paid to the executor of my will or the administrator of my estate to be disposed of as a general asset of my estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">\u201cI hereby revoke any prior designation of primary beneficiary made by me under the Plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">The Old Colony Bank of Barnstable County, N.A., Individual Retirement Custodial Account, Designation of Beneficiary Form signed by the decedent on December 29, 1982, contained substantially similar language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The sister survived the decedent but has since died.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">General Laws c. 167D, \u00a7 30, is identical to and was derived from a statute enacted in 1976.
