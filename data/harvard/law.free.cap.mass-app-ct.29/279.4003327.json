L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The jury were warranted in finding the following facts. Two victims, Richard Archuleta and Tom McDonald, were attacked on Longwood Avenue in Brookline by three men in the early hours of September 13, 1986. Archuleta was robbed, and an attempt was made by one of the assailants to reach into McDonald\u2019s pocket where he kept his cash. After the attack, which lasted two or three minutes, the three men fled on foot toward Beacon Street. Officer Mulligan of the Boston police department, who happened to be nearby, saw the scuffle and then observed three men running toward him. One of them was the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Boston and Brookline police came upon the scene and were given a description of the men by McDonald. At trial, although the officers gave different accounts of how the defendant was stopped while driving,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they agreed that he was stopped by the Brookline police, that McDonald was brought to the place where the defendant was detained, and that McDonald identified the defendant as one of the assailants. McDonald was \u201cvery certain\u201d of his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">At trial, McDonald testified that one of the assailants, a black man, the tallest of the three, was well built, had a short \u201cafro\u201d and a light beard, and was wearing a dark blue sweater with the letters F-I-L-A on the front. The defendant, when stopped by the Brookline police, fit that description and wore a black sweatshirt with the letters F-I-L-A across the front.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The car in which the defendant was stopped was registered to Nathaniel Williams. Williams was apprehended later that morning and was subsequently identified by McDonald both in October, 1986, and at a preliminary hearing in December in the Brookline District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McDonald also identified the defendant on those occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Williams and the defendant were tried together. Each was charged with unarmed robbery of Archuleta and assault with intent to rob McDonald. There was evidence that the defendant had held Archuleta from behind while the third assailant punched him and that Williams had assaulted McDonald. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the three assailants had been acting in concert in furtherance of a common purpose to rob both victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In closing argument, the defendant claimed mistaken identification and, based on certain testimony of Brookline police officers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argued that the defendant was in a car at the time of the attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cIf Mr. McDonald was mistaken in his identification of [Willie Williams], isn\u2019t it possible, given the circumstances of this fight and his state of mind, that he could have been mistaken in his identification of Melvin Levy, Melvin Levy whom you know was in a car talking to the Brookline police when the Brookline police were told there is a fight in progress, Melvin Levy who, if he was in the car and in the presence of Officers Ward and O\u2019Leary, could not possibly have been down at the scene of this crime and could not possibly have laid a finger on anyone, especially not Mr. Archuleta.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>1. <em>Jury instruction on joint venture.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In his charge, the judge accurately instructed the jury on the theory of joint criminal enterprise. To illustrate the legal principles involved, the judge used an example of a bank robbery. The illustration and some relevant portions of the charge are set out in the appendix to this opinion. The defendant objected, claiming that it gave the jurors an alternative theory of guilt that had not been before them during the trial, namely, that the defendant could be guilty as a \u201cgetaway\u201d driver even if he had not been at the scene of the incident. The judge gave a supplemental instruction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to which the defendant raised no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The defendant now contends that the judge\u2019s supplemental instruction did not cure the harm, and that the hypothetical permitted the jury to convict him as a joint venturer even if they believed he was in a car during the attack. He claims that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an instruction based on the defendant\u2019s role as a \u201cgetaway\u201d driver, that the judge exacerbated the problem by not foreclosing the possibility that the joint criminal enterprise was still in progress while the defendant was sitting in a car,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the hypothetical was particularly prejudicial, in light of the defendant\u2019s \u201calibi\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In the context of the charge as a whole, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 270 (1990), and the strong identification evidence of McDonald and Officer Mulligan, the example, while perhaps in retrospect unwise, did not, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>elude, create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A trial judge may choose the form of expression best adapted to make the law intelligible to jurors, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass. 495, 507 (1983), and may illustrate the law using a hypothetical situation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurber, </em>383 Mass. 328, 332-333 (1981). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benders, </em>361 Mass. 704, 708 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Both before and after the hypothetical, the judge reminded the jury that he was not talking about the facts of this case, and, in response to the defendant\u2019s objection, pointed out that the purpose of the hypothetical was not to emphasize the use of a car. Moreover, after a query from the jury,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the judge gave the following additional instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cSo if you found that one defendant actually punched one of the victims and you found the defendants to be part of a joint criminal enterprise, then that punching would be the act of the other defendant. ... If this was a joint criminal enterprise and if one defendant held a victim, that would be the act of the other also, in other words, acting jointly toward a common criminal purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We do not think the jury were misled by the hypothetical. At no time did the prosecutor argue that the defendant\u2019s role was to assist an escape. Both the prosecutor\u2019s opening and closing arguments described a venture in which three assailants set upon two victims at the same time. McDonald\u2019s powerful identification of the defendant, including the telltale lettering on his sweater, put the defendant at the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of the incident as a direct participant in the attack on Archuleta. That attack appeared to be coordinated with a concomitant assault on Archuleta\u2019s companion, McDonald. In convicting both men of both crimes, we think it highly unlikely that the jury were led by the judge\u2019s hypothetical to convict the defendant on the basis that he was waiting in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">2. <em>References to the assailants as \u201cdefendants\u201d during jury empanelment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">At the defendant\u2019s request, the judge individually screened the prospective jurors for racial bias. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28, second par. In most instances, the judge worded his inquiry as follows: \u201cThis case involves an alleged robbery by two black defendants on two white victims. Would this alleged incident cause you any problem in reaching a fair and impartial verdict based only on the evidence?\u201d The judge in several instances used the words \u201cby two black defendants that I introduced to you earlier.\u201d The judge had previously introduced the defendants to the jurors to find out if any of them knew the defendants. When the empanelment was completed, counsel for both defendants said they were content.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">For the first time, on appeal, the defendant claims that the judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cdefendants\u201d rather than \u201cassailants\u201d or \u201cperpetrators\u201d enhanced the prosecution\u2019s case \u201cby informing all fourteen eventual jurors during voir dire that the defendants were actually the assailants.\u201d We see nothing in the judge\u2019s questions suggesting a belief on his part that the defendants were actually the assailants. In any event, in the absence of an objection, we review the empanelment procedure only to determine whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrows, </em>391 Mass. 781, 783 (1984). The word \u201cdefendant\u201d is the customary and appropriate term for a person charged with a crime, and does not convey any belief that the person is guilty. In the absence of a showing that the use of the term caused a particular prejudice or weakened the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>case in some significant way, the claim that the term was improper borders on the frivolous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">3. <em>Failure of judge to ask prospective jurors statutory questions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">General Laws c. 234, \u00a7 28, set forth in the margin<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> requires the judge upon request to include questions about presumption of innocence, the defendant\u2019s right not to present evidence in his own behalf, and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 1708 (1990 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Prior to empanelment, the defendant filed a motion requesting the judge to ask the statutory questions of each juror individually. The judge did not do so, but the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>neither objected nor brought the omission to the judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the error is cause for reversal. Even when an objection is taken, a statute, G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 32, \u201cproviding that no irregularity in the jury em-panelling process shall be sufficient to set aside a verdict unless the objecting party has been injured or has objected before the verdict, requires some proof of prejudice . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Campbell, 394 Mass. 77, 84 (1985). In <em>Campbell, </em>the court held that the selection of a foreperson in an irregular manner required a showing of prejudice although the defendant had duly objected. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fudge, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 382, 388-389 (1985), we characterized the failure of the judge to make specific inquiry of the venire as to relationship, interest, opinion, bias, or prejudice, as required by Mass.R.Crim.P. 20(b)(1), 378 Mass. 889 (1979), as a \u201cmere irregularity\u201d which was waived by the defendant when he failed to file a motion entitling him to the statutory questions (G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28) or to object to the deficiencies under rule 20(b)(1). We also pointed out in <em>Fudge </em>at 389, citing G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 32, \u201cEven if the defendant had objected to the empanelling process, he has not shown that he \u2018has been injured thereby.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fudge </em>thus disposes of the defendant\u2019s claim, even though in the present case, unlike <em>Fudge, </em>the defendant filed a motion under G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We are buttressed in this conclusion by the requirement that there be a showing of prejudice even when the safeguards at stake are more important than the defendant\u2019s right to the statutory questions of \u00a7 28. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), </em>396 Mass. 215, 223-225 (1985), where the judge erred in failing to conduct a colloquy with the defendant before granting a motion of defendant\u2019s counsel for race-related questioning of prospective jurors, the Supreme Judicial Court noted, \u201c[Ojrdinarily, ... the deprivation of a statutory right is not grounds for reversal unless the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ant can demonstrate resulting prejudice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> [Citation omitted.] The defendant, therefore, must show that the error \u2018possibly weakened his case in some significant way so as to require a new trial\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 224. Both in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), supra </em>at 224-225, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>397 Mass. 244, 251-252 (1986), where the same omission occurred, the court\u2019s focus was whether the guilty verdict was attributable to the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, rather than to any animosity toward the defendant which might have been created by the race-related voir dire questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The right at stake here \u2014 to examine a juror\u2019s understanding of constitutional principles \u2014 like the right in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), </em>is not constitutionally based. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 821 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>406 Mass. 843, 851 n.6 (1990). Applying an analysis similar to that applied in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), supra </em>at 224-225, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>at 251-252, cases in which the potential injury to the defendant was more palpable, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 2), supra </em>at 223, we conclude it highly unlikely that the judge\u2019s failure to ask the statutory questions was a factor in the verdict. Before the introduction of evidence, the judge instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He reiterated these principles during his final charge and explicitly instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendant in a criminal case has no burden of proving his innocence and the defendant is under no obligation to testify or present any evidence whatsoever.\u201d In addition, the questions the judge asked during empanelment elicited the prospective jurors\u2019 understanding that a defendant\u2019s conviction must be based only on the evidence at trial. As discussed earlier, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>powerful, if not overwhelming. Although there were some inconsistencies in the testimony of some of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, these related primarily to insignificant details. In light of the evidence, it is difficult to imagine how the asking of the requested questions would have made a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Portion of Judge\u2019s Charge on Joint Enterprise.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201cNow, to be engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, a person must actually participate in it; that is, he must take some part in it. If you are talking about a robbery and an assault, a person must take some part in it involving one victim or the other or both. Merely being present at the time a crime is committed is not enough even though a defendant may-have knowledge that the crime was to be committed and did nothing to prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u201cTo sustain a conviction on the theory of joint enterprise, the defendant must be shown to have shared the mental state required for the crime and to have assisted the principal intentionally in its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u201cThere must be proof that the defendant somehow participated in committing the offense by counseling, hiring or otherwise procuring the principal, by agreeing to stand by, at or near the scene to render aid, assistance or encouragement if it became necessary or to assist the perpetrator in making an escape from the scene of the crime. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\u201cNow, the defendants are charged with the crimes of assault with intent to rob and unarmed robbery <em>but to get away from the scene of what is alleged to have occurred on September 13, 1986 </em>[emphasis added], and to give you an example of joint criminal enterprise, let me say this:</p>\n<p id=\"apj-dedup-0\">\u201cSuppose you have three people who plan to rob a bank. They drive up to the bank. One person is behind the wheel of the car and stays in the car. The other two persons go into the bank and hold up the teller at gunpoint and, at some time during the course of what takes place in the bank, one of those persons that is robbing the bank shoots the teller or perhaps the security guard. The person in the car knows that his companions are going into the bank to rob the bank and that they are armed. That being the case, that person in the car, even though he never fired a shot and never carried a gun and never went into that bank and injured anybody, can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>charged with armed robbery and can be charged with the shooting of that particular person and, if that particular person in the bank dies, can be charged with a homicide because he is involved in a joint criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u201cAnd that is an example of what a joint criminal enterprise is, <em>taking it away from the circumstances of this case </em>[emphasis added],</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201cAnd what the government is alleging in this case is that these two defendants, Mr. Levy and Mr. Williams, joined in or participated in a criminal venture with a third party, that each joined the enterprise with the knowledge that it was criminal in nature or had a criminal objective, that each had a specific criminal intent or a shared criminal intent to join in and participate in a joint criminal venture and that after they joined this criminal enterprise, each defendant, Mr. Levy and Mr. Williams, were involved in the crimes charged, one or both, that were committed and that each of them committed some act in furtherance of that enterprise. And you may make a judgment, of course, individually on each charge, whether on the robbery itself or the assault .with intent to rob, whether that was a part of the joint enterprise and whether Mr. Levy or Mr. Williams committed some act in furtherance of that enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u201cAnd if you find that that exists, that there was a joint criminal enterprise, that each had a specific criminal intent to join in the enterprise, which must be established by the evidence, of course, and that one or the other committed some act in furtherance of that enterprise, then the acts of one become the acts of the other once that joint criminal enterprise exists, and one can be charged even though one has not actually committed, let us say, the actual assault. But, if it is a joint criminal enterprise, the other can be charged with the same crime, assuming you find to a point beyond reasonable doubt all of the essential elements I have given you of the crime or crimes charged.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Officer Mulligan testified that, after seeing the scuffle and the men run to a black car, he flagged down a Brookline police cruiser and told the officers to stop the car and hold the driver. Officers of the Brookline police, however, testified that they stopped the car when they saw it make an illegal U-turn; they said it was only <em>after </em>they had stopped the defendant that Officer Mulligan walked over to them and told them that the driver was involved in a fight down the street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> At the preliminary hearing, McDonald misidentified Williams\u2019s brother as one of the assailants (the brother was overseas at the time of the incident), but McDonald had indicated he was less sure of that identification than he was of the other two assailants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\">While the defendant was detained in the car by Brookline police officers, but before McDonald had been brought to identify him, four women in a vehicle came up to the officers saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a fight down around the corner. Better get down there fast.\u201d The women were never identified or questioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u201cWhen I gave the jury an example of joint criminal enterprise and I used the example of a robbing of a bank, I did not mean to emphasize in any way the fact that a car was used. What I was emphasizing was that a person does not have to be involved in every act with another defendant in a joint criminal enterprise. If the jury finds there is a joint criminal enterprise, each person is responsible for the acts of the other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In his original instructions, the judge told the jury that \u201ca joint criminal enterprise has a beginning and an ending and, of course, you the jury must determine when the joint criminal enterprise, if any, began and when it ended. I think it is fairly obvious, whoever you find to be involved, as to what the beginning and ending was.\u201d Later, in response to a question from the jurors on another point, he told the jury that \u201cwhen the joint criminal enterprise ends, ... the acts of one are no longer the acts of the other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Because the defendant did not renew his objection after the judge gave the supplemental instruction our review is confined to whether the instructions as a whole created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.
