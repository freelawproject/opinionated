Of these candidates, three were from Fall River, including the plaintiff Pereira. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The fourth, the defendant Gonsalves, was of Dartmouth. Because of the resignation of a commissioner who had served only two of the four years of a term, there was another contest for county commissioner on the ballot for the remainder of the term created by that vacancy. There were two candidates for that office, the defendant Machado of Fall River and his opponent from Taunton. Machado bested his opponent in the two-year term race, and Pereira prevailed over her three rivals for the full term position. The total number of votes received by Pereira, however, did not exceed those collected by Machado. Because both Pereira and Machado were from Fall River, they could not serve together as commissioners if elected in November. See G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 158. Consequently, the defendant Secretary advised Pereira that, as Machado had received more votes than she, albeit in a different contest and with only one, as opposed to three opponents, her name would not appear on the ballots for the general election. Rather, Gonsalves and Machado would be the Democratic nominees for the four-year and two-year term offices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On Pereira\u2019s complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, a Superior Court judge issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Secretary from \u201cissuing ballots for the election to the office of Bristol County Commissioner four year term for the general election\u201d unless the ballots included the name of Pereira \u201cas the Democratic nominee for said office.\u201d The Secretary sought relief from, or reversal of, that injunctive order under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118. Because of the time period involved, we proceeded under the second paragraph of \u00a7 118 on an expedited schedule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After oral argument on the Secretary\u2019s appeal on October 2, 1990, we affirmed the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>granting injunctive relief and stated that an opinion setting forth the reasons for our decision would follow in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">As here pertinent, G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 158, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cNot more than one of the county commissioners shall be chosen from the same city or town. If two persons residing in the same city or town shall appear to have been chosen to said offices, only the person receiving the larger number of votes shall be declared elected; but if they shall receive an equal number of votes, no person shall be declared elected. If a person residing in a city or town where a county commissioner who is to remain in office also resides, shall appear to have been chosen, he shall not be declared elected. If the person is not declared elected by reason of the above provisions, the person receiving the next highest number of votes for the office, and who resides in another city or town, shall be declared elected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">In proposing to apply \u00a7 158 to the results of this primary election, the Secretary relied upon <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Secretary of the </em>Commonwealth, 250 Mass. 188 (1924). That case involved the results of the primary election as they pertained to the Republican ballot for two positions for the office of Barn-stable county commissioner. Of the four candidates seeking to be nominated for these two offices, two, Bodfish and Thacher, were from the town of Barnstable. Bodfish beat Thacher by fifty-eight votes. When the Secretary sought to place Bodfish\u2019s name on the ballots for the general election with that of the third place candidate, Benjamin F. Bourne of Bourne, Thacher petitioned for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In concluding that Thacher was not entitled to the writ, the court relied upon that part of G. L. c. 50, \u00a7 2, which provides: \u201cIn elections, the person receiving the highest number of votes for an office shall be deemed and declared to be elected to such office; and if two or more are to be elected to the same office, the several persons, to the number to be chosen to such office, receiving the highest number of votes, shall be deemed and declared to be elected. . . .\u201d Because both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Thacher and Bodfish were of Barnstable, they could not both \u201cbe deemed and declared to be elected.\u201d See <em>Thacher, supra, </em>at 190-191.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">There is nothing in our decision, that Pereira\u2019s name be placed on the ballots for the general election, that is contrary to the reasoning in <em>Thacher. </em>It is central to both decisions that election laws be read with an eye to the legislative purpose of their enactment: \u201cto make a reasonably consistent and harmonious body of law which should afford to qualified citizens an opportunity to cast votes efficient to express their preferences and which should have the final result of filling the offices required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. It is perhaps to fulfil that purpose that <em>Thacher </em>expressly limited itself \u201cto the facts of the case at bar\u201d and dismissed the petition \u201cwithout considering the form of the remedy . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">On the facts of the instant case, we concluded that bumping Pereira from the ballots for the general election did not further the purposes of giving voters the opportunity to express their preferences <em>and </em>effectively nominate only as many candidates as could be elected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The voters had not been allowed to choose between Pereira and Machado. Moreover, replacing Pereira\u2019s name with that of Gonsalves to avoid the prohibition set out in c. 54, \u00a7 158, did not resolve with certainty the problem sought to be remedied. The Republican candidate on the general election ballot for the four-year term is, like Pereira and Machado, from Fall River.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We also thought it worthy to note that the injunction did not preclude the Secretary from including the name of Gonsalves on the ballots.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, it enjoined him from excluding Pereira\u2019s name. It may well be that if the problem is not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>solved by the voters, the Secretary might then be required to take the action we thought now premature. See also G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 144. In view of the circumstances presented, however, and their difference from those which controlled <em>Thacher, supra, </em>we concluded that the voters should be given the first opportunity, by expressing their preference, to resolve the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">For these reasons we affirmed the order of the Superior Court judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Machado received 34,433 votes, Pereira 21,125, and Gonsalves 18,216.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">As represented in an affidavit presented by the Secretary in opposing injunctive relief, the Commonwealth would be liable for delay costs under its contract for the printing of the ballots in the amount of $9,289 a day, commencing 5:00 P.M., October 2, 1990, until the printing of the ballots was authorized. Further, if the printing was not authorized by October 5, the timely delivery of absentee ballots could not be assured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Although not readily discernible from the facts set out in <em>Thacher, </em>it appears from the record and briefs on file in that case that the Democratic party may well have not nominated a candidate for the general election for the office of Barnstable county commissioner. In those circumstances, c. 54, \u00a7 158, would have more immediacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b526-13\">In this respect, <em>Thacher </em>may be somewhat similar to the present circumstances. As there noted, at 191, \u201c[n]o contention has been made that the name of Bodfish ought not to be upon the official ballot,\u201d and all that was decided was that the law did not mandate that the Secretary also place Thacher\u2019s name on the ballot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
